Multiple endometrial stromal nodules with sparse cysts and glands in the lung--a nodular variation of endometriosis that may mimic metastases of sarcoma. We report an unusual case of a nodular variation of pulmonary endometriosis. To our knowledge, there is no previous report on a morphological investigation of this entity. The etiology of this rare condition is still a matter of discussion. The well-circumscribed nodular mass is composed of cells identical to, or closely resembling, those of endometrial stroma containing sparse cysts and glands. Immunohistochemically, the cells showed an extensive co-expression of cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and vimentin and were highly positive for progesterone receptor (PRICA) and estrogen receptor (ERICA). Cells lining the cysts and glands as a monolayer were reactive for Ber-Ep4, cytokeratin Pan and cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and negative to all other markers used including PRICA and ERICA. The differential diagnosis of this entity included fibrous tumor of the pleura and metastatic low-grade-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma. The morphological findings are correlated with immunohistochemical studies and results of cell image analysis. This study details the clinicopathological features of the nodular variation of pulmonary endometriosis.
