Ultrasound guidance during endoscopic procedures. The use of laparoscopic ultrasound probes has been shown to improve outcomes and facilitate surgery for hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers. It is a useful, inexpensive, and safe imaging technique that should also supplement operative laparoscopy for gynecologic indications. These techniques are new, and their use in gynecologic surgery has not been adequately evaluated to recommend widespread use. The principal benefit of ultrasound monitoring during operative laparoscopy is its potential impact on operative management and decision making. Theoretically, the intentions would be to reduce the amount of tissue dissection, for example, by more precisely locating an ovarian endometrioma to reduce operating time
