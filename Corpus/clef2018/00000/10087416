Effect of treatment with GnRH agonists on new markers of bone metabolism. To assess the utility of new markers in monitoring bone turnover during treatment with GnRH agonists, alkaline phosphatase (total and bone specific) and urinary N-telopeptides were measured. 16 women undergoing treatment with GnRH agonists for endometriosis or leiomyomas were studied before and 3 months after the onset of treatment. N-telopeptide levels increased significantly (44% of baseline, p < 0.05). Bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), measured with a new ELISA assay, was more elevated (40% of baseline, p = 0.001) than total ALP (15% of baseline, p < 0.001). In conclusion, in estrogen deficiency states, urinary N-telopeptide measurements provide a quantitative measure of bone resoption. In the assessment of bone formation, BALP determination is move sensitive than total ALP and this may be clinically useful.
