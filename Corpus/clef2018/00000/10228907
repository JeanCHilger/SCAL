CA 125 in benign gynecological conditions. The tumor marker CA 125 was initially thought to be specific for ovarian malignancies. Subsequently it was found to be raised in a variety of benign conditions, including pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, tuberculosis and cirrhosis of the liver. With respect to gynecological tumors, CA 125 may be elevated in benign ovarian cysts, tubo-ovarian abscess, endometriosis, hyperstimulation syndrome, ectopic pregnancy and fibroids. These results demonstrate that CA 125 is a marker of non-specific peritoneal conditions.
