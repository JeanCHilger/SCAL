The diagnosis and surgical treatment in rectal endometriosis. From Jun 1975 to Mar 1995, 26 cases of endometriosis in the rectum (RE) were admitted. Local resection was performed in 16 and Dixon's operation in 10. The result showed 21 cases were symptomatically cured and 5 with remission. 2 cases were reoperated because of recurrence in 5 years after the first operation and cured. RE is difficult in distiguishing from rectal cancer. It is characterized by tenesmus, bursting pain, hematochezia in young and middle aged women during periods. The diagnosis can be made by tipycal history and vaginal examination, rectal examination, barium enema, proctoscopy and so on. The indications of operation include severe clinic symptoms and failed conservative therapy. Wedge resection was suitable in cases with small lession in rectum, while large, deep seated lessions in lower rectum were treated with Dixon's operation in order to prevent recurrence.
