A case of postmenopausal endometriosis unrelated to neoplasm. A 55-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for evaluation of a lower abdominal mass. Menopause had occurred at age 52 years. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a partially solid right ovarian tumor, an appearance suggestive of malignancy. A transabdominal simple hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. Pathologic examination revealed an endometrial cyst of the right ovary, a uterine leiomyoma, and adenomyosis.
