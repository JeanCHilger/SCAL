Interleukin-8 stimulates the adhesion of endometrial stromal cells to fibronectin. To study the effect of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and mouse anti-human IL-8 monoclonal antibody on endometrial stromal cell adhesion to fibronectin.Prospective, controlled in vitro study.Academic research laboratory.Women undergoing benign gynecologic surgery for indications other than endometrial disease.Endometrial stromal cells were treated with IL-8 and mouse anti-human IL-8 monoclonal antibody at different concentrations and adhesion assays were performed by labeling the cells with calcein.Fluorescence in calcein-labeled endometrial stromal cells.IL-8 induced a concentration-dependent increase of cell adhesion to fibronectin matrix (twofold at 10 ng/mL P = .006). Treatment of endometrial stromal cells with anti-IL-8 neutralizing antibody inhibited partially the cell adhesion.IL-8 stimulates the adhesion of endometrial stromal cells to fibronectin in a concentration-dependent manner. IL-8 may thus be relevant for the attachment of endometrial implants in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
