High resolution imaging of endometriosis and ovarian carcinoma with optical coherence tomography: feasibility for laparoscopic-based imaging. High resolution imaging of gynaecological tissue offers the potential for identifying pathological changes at early stages when interventions are more effective. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high resolution high speed optical imaging technology which is analogous to ultrasound B-mode imaging except reflections of light are detected rather than sound. The OCT technology is capable of being integrated with laparoscopy for real-time subsurface imaging. In this report, the feasibility of OCT for differentiating normal and pathologic laparoscopically-accessible gynaecologic tissue is demonstrated. Differentiation is based on architectural changes of in vitro tissue morphology. OCT has the potential to improve conventional laparoscopy by enabling subsurface imaging near the level of histopathology.
