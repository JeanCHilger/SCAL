Drug therapy of endometriosis. Surgical treatment of endometriosis should be done during laparoscopy, which is obligatory for the diagnosis of the disease. In case of continuing postoperative symptoms, a medical treatment should be administered. As endometriosis is a hormone-dependent disease, hormones are the matter of choice (progestogens, danazol, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists). Because all agents do not differ significantly in efficacy, the therapy has to be adapted individually. The side-effects and metabolic changes have to be taken into account. In case of infertility, a beneficial effect of medical treatment is not proven.
