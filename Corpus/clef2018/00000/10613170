Endometriosis of the pelvis presenting as hip pain. A case report. Endometriosis is a disorder resulting from the presence of actively growing and functioning endometrial tissue in aberrant sites outside the uterus. Ectopic implantation of the endometrium can be located throughout the pelvic cavity. Depending on the location of the endometriosis, it can mimic common musculoskeletal problems, especially in young women who are menstruating. A young woman presented to an orthopaedic specialist with bilateral hip pain for the last several years. Magnetic resonance imaging subsequently was performed on both hips and showed evidence of bilateral intrapelvic endometriosis adjacent to both acetabula. The patient was seen by her gynecologist, who prescribed cyclic hormonal suppressive therapy. On followup visit to the orthopaedist, the patient's symptoms had resolved completely.
