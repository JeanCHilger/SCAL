Atypical presentation of microscopically advanced ovarian carcinoma. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) continues to be an academically challenging and clinically problematic disease. Even with recent advances, the overall 5-year survival is still 31% to 42% in various studies. Deaths from EOC outnumber those due to cervical, vulvar, and endometrial carcinomas combined. Screening for EOC has shown limited success in early detection. The Pap smear is not a dependable tool in EOC screening, though at times it can be the first evidence of ovarian disease. We report a case of EOC that was diagnosed during evaluation of an abnormal Pap smear. On completion of evaluation, stage IIIA endometrioid-type adenocarcinoma of the ovary was diagnosed. Occult EOC should be considered in patients with abnormal findings on cervical cytology after cervical and uterine carcinomas are ruled out.
