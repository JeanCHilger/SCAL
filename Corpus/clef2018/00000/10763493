Morphologic characteristics of the endometrium in women with endometriosis. It was established that in accordance with certain phases of sexual cycle (menstrual cycle in women and estral cycle in rats) on the background of hormone action at follicular and luteal phase the surface of epitheliocytes acquires specific relief (formation and degradation of microvilli appropriately in first and second halves of the cycle, accordingly). Disturbance of cyclic change of the relief of apical surface of epitheliocytes of the endometrium, persistence of high binding activity of the cationic dye and formation of intercellular clefts were demonstrated in developing endometriosis, which significantly interferes with the reproductive function. This was suggested to be an unfavourable result of cytotoxic effect of autoimmune processes that develop due to implantation of cells of endometrium in abdominal cavity and initiation of cooperative cellular response, which seems to be morphologically demonstrated by significant increase in number of macrophages in tissues of the uterus and in menstrual discharge.
