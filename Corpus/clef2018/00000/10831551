Tumour necrosis factor alpha concentrations in the peritoneal fluid of infertile women with minimal or mild endometriosis are lower in patients with red lesions only than in patients without red lesions. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) of peritoneal fluid is believed to have important pro-inflammatory and angiogenic activities in the complex mechanisms of development of peritoneal endometriotic lesions. We have evaluated the concentrations of TNFalpha and macrophages in peritoneal fluid of infertile women with minimal or mild endometriosis and related them to the presence of peritoneal red lesions alone (red lesions only group n = 11) or their absence (non-red lesions group
