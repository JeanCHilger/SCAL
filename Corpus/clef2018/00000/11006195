Differential expression and localization of de-novo synthesized endometriotic haptoglobin in endometrium and endometriotic lesions. Endometriosis protein-I (ENDO-I) mRNA expression and protein localization were evaluated using in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in endometriotic lesions and eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis, and in eutopic endometrium from women without endometriosis (controls). When present, ENDO-I mRNA and protein were observed in the functionalis zone of endometrial stroma and the stroma of endometriotic lesions. Expression and localization differences were scored and statistically analysed. During the secretory stage, ENDO-I mRNA expression by endometriotic lesions and eutopic endometrium from women with disease was significantly greater than ENDO-I mRNA expression by proliferative stage eutopic endometrium from women with disease or eutopic endometrium from controls, regardless of cycle stage (P < 0.001). More ENDO-I protein was localized in endometriotic lesions and eutopic endometrium from women with disease than in eutopic endometrium from controls, regardless of cycle stage (P < 0.001). Differential expression and localization of ENDO-I may help develop minimally invasive diagnostic strategies for endometriosis. Further, as ENDO-I shares nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence with hepatic haptoglobin-which in certain disease states is immunosuppressive and angiogenic-differences in ENDO-I expression and localization in the peritoneal cavity may contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis and/or facilitate development of unprecedented diagnostic or therapeutic approaches for management of this enigmatic disease.
