Immunohistochemical analysis of gynecologic tumors. Ancillary techniques such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) enable the surgical pathologist to extract additional information from fixed, deparaffinized tissue specimens and to provide data critical to optimal clinical management of the patient. In this review of applications of IHC to the analysis of gynecologic malignancies, the usefulness of immunohistochemical analysis of neoplasms of the cervix, endometrium, and ovary is summarized. In the uterine cervix, dysplasia is associated with qualitative and quantitative alterations in the expression of the Ki-67 antigen expression, as well as an ability to detect human papillomavirus. Endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas display a highly characteristic immunophenotype, with coexpression of cytokeratin and vimentin and demonstration of foci of high molecular weight cytokeratin expression in addition, IHC analysis of estrogen and progesterone receptor and p53 expression can provide important prognostic information about this tumor. Stromal tumors of the endometrium may display a partial smooth muscle immunophenotype, but novel markers such as CD10 provide new tools for the identification of these tumors. The immunophenotypes of the normal ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) and corresponding tumors display significant overlap with, but important distinctions from, mesothelium, and important new markers such as the Wilms tumor gene product can prove useful in the identification of carcinomas of the OSE. Important prognostic markers for carcinomas of the OSE include the HER-2/neu gene product and p53, alterations of which can both be assessed by IHC techniques. Finally, the recent availability of markers of ovarian stroma, including Melan-A and inhibin-alpha, has provided a means for the positive identification of ovarian stromal tumors, which can manifest protean histological appearances.
