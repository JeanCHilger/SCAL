The effects of danazol on gonadotropins and steroid blood levels in normal and anovulatory women. The effect of Danazol, a new gonadotropin inhibitor, was examined in four categories of patients. (1) Ten normal women medicated orally with Danazol, 800 mg. daily for 91 days, showed no depression of serum LH, estrone, estradiol, or progesterone below control, second-day levels. The serum FSH was slightly depressed (2) Two anovulatory patients having elevated serum LH values were treated with Danazol, 400 to 800 mg. daily, for 1 to 3 days at midcycle. One patient repeatedly showed a temperature rise and LH flood within 24 hours of initial medication. Both had menstrual periods 7 to 9 days later. (3) Two normal midcycle ovulators were treated with 400 and 800 mg
