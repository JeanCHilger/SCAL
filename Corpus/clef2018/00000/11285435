Leptin in obstetrics and gynecology: a review. Leptin, a recently described type-1 cytokine, is involved in cellular maturation and growth and appears to have a relationship to some obstetrical and gynecologic diseases. The MEDLINE database was accessed, and leptin-related articles published during the past 6 years were reviewed for their relevance to gynecologic and obstetrical diseases. The relationships between this cytokine and obesity, puberty, polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, assisted fertility, and menopause are discussed. The role of leptin in fetal physiology and in normal and abnormal fetal growth as well as its role in diabetes, pregnancy, and pregnancy-induced hypertension are reviewed.
