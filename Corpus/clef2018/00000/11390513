Eotaxin (CCL11) induces in vivo angiogenic responses by human CCR3+ endothelial cells. Chemokines are attractants and regulators of cell activation. Several CXC family chemokine members induce angiogenesis and promote tumor growth. In contrast, the only CC chemokine, reported to play a direct role in angiogenesis is monocyte-chemotactic protein-1. Here we report that another CC chemokine, eotaxin (also known as CCL11), also induced chemotaxis of human microvascular endothelial cells. CCL11-induced chemotactic responses were comparable with those induced by monocyte-chemotactic protein-1 (CCL2), but lower than those induced by stroma-derived factor-1alpha (CXCL12) and IL-8 (CXCL8). The chemotactic activity was consistent with the expression of CCR3, the receptor for CCL11, on human microvascular endothelial cells and was inhibited by mAbs to either human CCL11 or human CCR3. CCL11 also induced the formation of blood vessels in vivo as assessed by the chick chorioallantoic membrane and Matrigel plug assays. The angiogenic response induced by CCL11 was about one-half of that induced by basic fibroblast factor, and it was accompanied by an inflammatory infiltrate, which consisted predominantly of eosinophils. Because the rat aortic sprouting assay, which is not infiltrated by eosinophils, yielded a positive response to CCL11, this angiogenic response appears to be direct and is not mediated by eosinophil products. This suggests that CCL11 may contribute to angiogenesis in conditions characterized by increased CCL11 production and eosinophil infiltration such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, nasal polyposis, endometriosis, and allergic diathesis.
