Genetic alterations in microsatellite marker sites among tumor suppressor genes in endometriosis. Four endometriotic lesions were examined for the presence of genetic alterations in microsatellite marker sites among eight tumor suppressor genes. For this, a microdissection method was used on paraffin sections. Only one instance of loss of heterozygosity was detected at the PTCH locus. Heterozygosity was retained (indicating the absence of both loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability) at the other seven tumor suppressor gene loci in all the cases. Among the tumor suppressor genes examined, genetic defects in these microsatellite regions are certainly not ubiquitous in endometriosis and may be uncommon.
