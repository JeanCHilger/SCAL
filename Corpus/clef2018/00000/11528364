Adenomyosis demonstrates increased expression of the basic fibroblast growth factor receptor/ligand system compared with autologous endometrium. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is an angiogenic growth factor present in human endometrium and myometrium. Women with leiomyoma-related abnormal uterine bleeding have local dysregulation of bFGF and its type 1 receptor (FGF-R). This study was designed to evaluate if adenomyosis expresses bFGF and FGF-R, and if present, to compare bFGF and FGF-R expression in adenomyosis and autologous endometrium.Menopausal uteri containing endometrium and adenomyosis were analyzed using immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies specific for bFGF, FGF-R, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a marker of cellular proliferation. The expression and intensity of staining for bFGF, FGF-R, and PCNA were evaluated in the glandular epithelium and stroma of adenomyosis and endometrium.Glandular epithelial staining was significantly greater in adenomyosis compared with autologous endometrium for bFGF and FGF-R. Stromal staining for bFGF and PCNA was significantly increased in adenomyosis compared with autologous endometrium.Upregulation of the bFGF receptor/ligand system and increased cellular proliferation in adenomyosis may contribute to the pathogenesis of abnormal uterine bleeding associated with adenomyosis.
