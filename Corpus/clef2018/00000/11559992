Treatment of endometriosis in female infertility. A total of 16 women with endometriosis 25 to 36 years old were examined. Of these, 6 presented with primary infertility, 10--with secondary intertility, 7 female patients had endometriosis concurrent with other localizations. The treatment was with duphaston (dydrogesteron), 10 mg (5 mg twice a day) beginning from day 5 till 25 of the menstrual cycle for 6 months. The control echography and hysteroscopy permitted ascertaining regression of endometrioid foci in 13 female patients. According to the histological findings in 15 women the endometrium corresponded to the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, with its focal hyperplasia having been noted in 1 woman. Efficacy of treatment aimed to return the reproductive function back to normal was assessed in 14 female patients. The pregnancy incidence after the treatment came up to 56.7% (9 women). Thus, duphaston is an effective drug that can be recommended for treating endometriosis in those women at reproductive age presenting with infertility.
