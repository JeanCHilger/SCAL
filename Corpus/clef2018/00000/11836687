Comparative study of HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DRB1 allele in patients with endometriosis and adenomyosis. To make a comparative study of HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies in the cases of endometriosis and adeonmyosis.The allelic types of HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DRB1 were detected by polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) technique in 51 cases of endometriosis, 45 cases of adenomyosis, and 44 normal individuals as the control.The frequencies of HLA-DQA1*0401(7.8%, 10.0%) were significantly increased in the endometriosis group and the adenomyosis group (Pc=0.03, Pc=0.01), and the frequencies of HLA-DQA1*0301(8.8%, 5.6%) were significantly decreased in these two groups (Pc=0.00, Pc=0.00).There was no significant difference between the frequencies of HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DRB1 of endometriosis and adenomyosis.The results indicate that HLA-DQA1*0301 and *0401 alleles are associated with both endometriosis and adenomyosis, and there is perhaps common mechanism involved in both endometriosis and adenomyosis based on HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies.
