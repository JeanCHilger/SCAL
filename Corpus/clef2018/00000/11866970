The malignant potential of ovarian atypical endometriosis. To investigate the malignant potential of ovarian atypical endometriosis and ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma.12 cases of ovarian endometroid adenocarcinoma with associated endometriosis were reviewed retrospectively. Microsatellite markers were used to detect the loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 10q23 in ovarian carcinoma and their coexisting endometriosis.Among the 12 cases, benign eosinophilic metaplasia was observed in 8 cases, 5 of which (41.7%) with atypia. In these 5 cases, a spectrum of benign-atypical endometriosis with a transition to endometrioid adenocarcinoma was identified, and common genetic lesions were also detected in 2 of the 5 atypical endometriosis and their coexisting carcinomas.Histological observations as well as the molecular genetic evidence indicate that ovarian atypical endometriosis may possess a precancerous potential or play a role in the pathogenesis of certain malignant ovarian cancers.
