Ceroid granuloma of the uterine cervix. A case of ceroid granuloma of the uterine cervix in a 58-year-old woman is presented, the fourth such case in the literature. It was an incidental finding during a routine pelvic examination and appeared as an exophytic brownish lesion on the anterior wall of the uterine cervix. On histological examination it consisted of sheets of ceroid-rich histiocytes within the superficial cervical stroma. There was no obvious cause for the lesion. Ceroid granulomas of the female genital tract may be related to endometriosis, but the rarity of the cases precludes definite conclusions about the etiology and pathogenesis of this lesion.
