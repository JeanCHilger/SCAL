Clinical picture and therapy of endometriosis. This paper defines endometriosis disease and summarizes its clinical and pathological features. Definitive diagnosis of endometriosis requires direct visualization of the disease. Laparoscopy is the most commonly employed method to inspect the peritoneal cavity directly. We list the drugs employed for the medical therapy of endometriosis and put evidence on limits and side effects of medical treatment. The surgical treatment is mainly laparoscopic for excision or coagulation of pelvic endometriosis implants but frequently the rate of recurrences or new implants is high. In this paper we stressed the urological aspect of endometriosis in particular bladder and ureteral locations and the secondary ureteral injuries resulting from surgical treatment.
