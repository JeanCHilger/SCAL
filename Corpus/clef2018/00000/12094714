Partial ureterectomy in a case of intrinsic-type ureteral endometriosis. We report a case of intrinsic-type ureteral endometriosis in a 28-year-old woman. She visited our hospital, complaining of lower abdominal pain. Drip infusion pyelography (DIP) showed left hydronephrosis, and left retrograde pyelography revealed a filling defect of the left pelvic ureter. Biopsy under ureteroscopy showed chronic ureteritis. It was difficult to exclude a malignant tumor, and we performed left partial ureterectomy and uretero-ureterostomy. The pathological examination showed endometrial tissue in the submucosal and muscle layer, and we diagnosed it as intrinsic-type ureteral endometriosis judging from the findings of the ureteroscopy and the operation. After the operation, drip infusion pyelography showed the improvement of the left hydronephrosis and ureteral passage, and the right ovarian endometriosis was found by gynecologists. She received hormonal therapy with the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist for about half a year, but the right ovarian endometriosis remained unchanged. This is the ninth case in the Japanese literature reported as intrinsic-type ureteral endometriosis.
