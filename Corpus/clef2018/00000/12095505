Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and thrombospondin-1 mRNA in patients with endometriosis. To investigate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) mRNA in endometriosis.Molecular studies in human tissue.Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, P. R. China.Patients undergoing laparoscopy for infertility or other benign gynecologic conditions.Biopsies were taken from endometriotic lesions (red peritoneal lesion, ovarian endometrioma, and unterosacral ligament nudule) and eutopic endometrium during laparoscopy.mRNA expression from endometriotic lesion and eutopic endometrium was analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Northern blotting.Among the endometriotic lesions, red peritoneal lesions expressed higher levels of VEGF mRNA and lower levels of TSP-1 mRNA, whereas ovarian endometrioma expressed lower levels of VEGF mRNA and higher levels of TSP-1 mRNA. Eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis had higher expression levels of VEGF mRNA and lower expression levels of TSP-1 mRNA than that of women without endometriosis.The expression of VEGF and TSP-1 in endometriotic lesions appears to be associated with the extent of their neovascularization. The imbalance in expression of VEGF and TSP-1 in the endometrium may play a role in the development of endometriosis.
