Emerging role of genomics in endometriosis research. Rapidly evolving methods in genomics and proteomics research already are changing the nature of biomedical investigation. In this report we briefly review some of the seminal technological advances that inspired the genomics revolution and describe their application in the field of endometriosis research.Review of different techniques successfully applied to endometriosis research.Collaborative investigation in academic and pharmaceutical industry laboratories.Biopsies were obtained from consenting ovulatory women on no medications, with or without laparoscopically proven endometriosis.Genomics techniques have confirmed gene products shown to be abnormally expressed in endometriotic tissues by prior studies. In addition, identification of novel transcripts not previously appreciated in this condition were discovered. Examples of dysregulated genes in endometriosis include glycodelin, complement, early growth response-1 and transducer of erbB-1.Global gene profiling studies are poised to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis and other human diseases.
