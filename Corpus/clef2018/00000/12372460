Involvement of catalase in the endometrium of patients with endometriosis and adenomyosis. To determine the distribution of catalase in eutopic and ectopic endometria in patients with endometriosis or adenomyosis.Retrospective randomized study.Department of obstetrics and gynecology in a university hospital.Thirty-three patients with endometriosis, 36 with adenomyosis, and 47 fertile controls (total, 116 women).Semiquantitative immunostaining of endometrial cells obtained by biopsy sampling, followed by calculation of an evaluation nomogram score.The score of catalase in the glandular epithelium of controls group fluctuated during the menstrual cycle it was lowest in the early proliferative phase and peaked in the late secretory phase. In patients with endometriosis, catalase scores did not fluctuate during the cycle, and scores were high compared with controls throughout the menstrual cycle. Catalase scores did not vary in patients with adenomyosis, and scores in this group were consistently higher than those in patients with endometriosis throughout the cycle.Abnormal expression of catalase in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium strongly suggests pathologic involvement of free radicals in endometriosis and adenomyosis.
