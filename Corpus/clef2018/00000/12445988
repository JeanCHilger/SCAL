Angiogenic activity and IL-8 concentrations in peritoneal fluid and sera in endometriosis. During menstruation endometrial fragments are transported into the peritoneal cavity where they form endometriotic lesions. Angiogenesis is proposed as one of the mechanisms in endometriosis pathogenesis. The aim of the study was to determine the angiogenic activity and interleukin 8 concentrations in peritoneal fluid and sera in endometriosis.Angiogenesis was determined in cutaneous assay in Balb/c mice IL-8 concentrations were measured by ELISA test in sera and peritoneal fluid of 32 control and 56 endometriosis patients. Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests and Spearman rank correlations were used in statistical analysis.Peritoneal fluid and sera from the examined group had higher angiogenic activity and interleukin 8 concentrations. There was correlation found between AFS and neovascularization induced by sera and PF of patients with peritoneal lesions.Angiogenesis plays an important role in pathogenesis of endometriosis. Although IL-8 takes part in neovascularization, there are other factors modulating angiogenesis in endometriosis.
