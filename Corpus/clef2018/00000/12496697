Ovarian mucinous and mixed epithelial carcinomas of mullerian (endocervical-like) type: a clinicopathologic analysis of four cases of an uncommon variant associated with endometriosis. The epithelial cells of ovarian mucinous carcinomas may sometimes appear similar to those of gastrointestinal or endocervical mucinous carcinomas, but most are composed of cells that do not suggest any particular derivation. We report four cases of mucinous ovarian carcinoma in which the cells were entirely or almost entirely endocervical-like. The patients' ages were 34, 43, 44, and 50 years. Two patients had bilateral tumors confined to the ovaries at initial staging both also had synchronous endometrial carcinomas of the mucinous type. The two other patients had unilateral tumors, both with invasive metastases in the pelvis and abdomen at initial staging. In one of the latter cases a mullerian (endocervical-like) mucinous borderline tumor (MMBT) of the opposite ovary had been removed 5 years earlier, and in this case and two other cases the ovarian carcinomas had foci resembling MMBT, suggesting that they may be an invasive counterpart to these tumors. The six tumors ranged from 4 to 19 cm
