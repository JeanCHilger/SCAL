Analysis of an interleukin-6 gene promoter polymorphism in women with endometriosis by pyrosequencing. Interleukin (IL)-6 has been implicated in the etiology of endometriosis. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position -174 in the IL-6 gene promoter appears to influence IL-6 transcription rates in vitro and basal IL-6 levels in vivo. We determined the genotype and the allele frequencies of the -174 IL-6 promoter polymorphism and the corresponding IL-6 serum levels in women with endometriosis. The pyrosequencing technique was used to assess the IL-6 genotypes in 94 women with histologically confirmed endometriosis (study group). A series of 70 healthy women without history of uterine disease served as clinical controls (control group).Allele frequencies for the G allele among women with and without endometriosis were 59.6% and 55.0%, respectively (P =.430 odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53, 1.29). Homozygotes for the protective allele C were present in 17.0% of women with endometriosis and in 18.6% of controls were homozygous for the protective allele C (P =.797
