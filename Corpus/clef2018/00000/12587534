Gene expression of adhesion molecules and matrix metalloproteinases in endometriosis. Various types of cell adhesion molecules and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) seem to play an important role in the invasion process of endometriosis however, limited investigation has focused on their gene expression in human peritoneal endometriotic lesions. A total of 63 endometriotic tissues were surgically obtained from 35 women with endometriosis, which included 43 pigmented and 20 non-pigmented lesions. Gene expression levels of E-cadherin, alpha- and beta-catenin, MMP-2, MMP-9 and membrane-type 1 (MT1)-MMP in these endometriotic lesions were compared with those in normal eutopic endometrium obtained from 12 women without endometriosis. MMP-2, MMP-9 and MT1-MMP mRNA expression in pigmented lesions was significantly higher than that in normal endometrium (p < 0.05), whereas E-cadherin, alpha- and beta-catenin mRNA expression was not suppressed in endometriotic lesions. There was a close correlation between MMP-2 or MT1-MMP and E-cadherin, alpha- or beta-catenin gene expression in 63 endometriotic tissues examined (p < 0.01). Immunohistochemical expression of E-cadherin, alpha- and beta-catenin in glandular epithelial cells was positive not only for all of seven cases with normal eutopic endometrium but also for 9 of 11 with ovarian endometriosis. MMP expression in ectopic endometrium was much greater than that in eutopic endometrium. These results suggest that endometriotic tissues expressing MMPs might be invasive and simultaneously possess cell-to-cell adhesion property in pelvic peritoneal foci.
