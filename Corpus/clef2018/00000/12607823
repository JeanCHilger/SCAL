Atherosclerosis, oxidation and endometriosis. Endometriosis affects younger women of childbearing age. Atherosclerosis is considered as a disease of the old and increases with the ageing process. Both diseases are characterized by the increased presence of activated macrophages and associated increases in growth promoting activity and the production of inflammatory cytokines. In this review, we propose that oxidative stress and the presence of forms of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) might contribute to both Atherosclerosis and Endometriosis.
