Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists: impact of IVF practice and potential non-assisted reproductive technology applications. To provide the clinician with updated knowledge of the most recent findings on the clinical use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists.Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists, which have recently been introduced in clinical practice, cause an immediate suppression of gonadotropin secretion by competitive blocking of pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors. Thus, they are effective in preventing the premature luteinizing hormone surges during ovarian stimulation for in-vitro fertilization and may improve the patient's response to lower doses of gonadotropins. Better patient acceptance, shorter treatment cycles and fewer follicles and oocytes are also reported. Data existing so far concerning the necessity of luteal phase support after the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists show that it might not be mandatory when used in clomiphene citrate costimulated cycles or in intrauterine insemination cycles. The use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists seems to be safe for pregnant women and their offspring. All sex-hormone-dependent disorders, currently treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, may in future be indications for a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, including endometriosis, leiomyoma, and breast cancer in women, benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma in men, and central precocious puberty in children. The vast majority of the available clinical data up till now, however, are in assisted reproduction and prostate cancer.It is expected that the availability of gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist will lead to the use of 'softer' ovarian stimulation protocols, which will be shorter, cheaper and safer compared with the conventional protocols.
