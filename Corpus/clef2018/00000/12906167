Serum soluble E-cadherin level in patients with endometriosis. To investigate the serum sE-cadherin level in patients with endometriosis and the alterations of that level in healthy control during the menstrual cycle.Thirty-two patients with endometriosis and 30 healthy women were tested for serum sE-cadherin levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The serum sE-cadherin levels in healthy control did not vary throughout the menstrual cycle, which were lower than those in patients with endometriosis.E-cadherin might be involved in endometrial shedding during menstruation in endometriosis patients. The serum sE-cadherin assay might be helpful as a serum marker for the diagnosis and management of endometriosis.
