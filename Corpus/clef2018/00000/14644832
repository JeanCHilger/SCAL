Endometriosis and reproductive disorders. The classic concept of endometriosis as a cause of infertility is challenged. Traditionally, both surgical and medical therapy have focused on alleviation of symptoms, prevention of disease progression, and promotion of fertility. In spite of significant developments in medical and surgical approaches, the optimal therapy for treating endometriosis-associated infertility has yet to be established. The relationship between prevalence of fecundity and stage of the disease was studied according to the type of management. Of 151 women who were consecutively proved by laparoscopy to have endometriosis stage I and II, operative laparoscopy was performed in 49, medical treatment in 59, and expectant management in 43 cases. During a 24-month period, the cumulative pregnancy rates were 36.7%, 30.5%, and 20.9%, respectively. Survival analysis over the 20 weeks of pregnancy showed that the probability of carrying the pregnancy beyond this week was 30.6%, 25.4%, and 16.2%, respectively. Of 64 patients with advanced disease, 34 (53%) became pregnant during the 2-year follow-up period. A significantly increased pregnancy rate was found for the first year as compared to the second (76% vs. 24%). The existence of adhesions affected adversely the outcome of the treatment when early achievement of pregnancy is considered. Diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis was beneficial for the infertile women. Laparoscopic surgery seems to be the best treatment in these cases, as it increases the fecundity and involves minimal risk.
