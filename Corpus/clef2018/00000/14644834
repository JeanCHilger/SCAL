Laparoscopic management of patients with endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain. Endometriosis has been traditionally included among the most important causes of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in women of reproductive age. The main clinical manifestations of endometriosis are dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic nonmenstrual pain. Despite the high prevalence of endometriosis in women suffering from CPP, controversy still exists regarding the true association between the stage and extent of this peculiar disease and the severity of pain. Over the last decade, advances in endoscopic technology have enabled gynecologic surgeons to recognize many atypical appearances of the endometriotic implants not known to exist before, thus allowing their complete excision or destruction. Laparoscopic surgery may offer considerable relief in patients with endometriosis and CPP. Although cases with advanced endometriosis seem to benefit the most, we also support surgical treatment in patients with early endometriosis diagnosed using laparoscopy, as many will experience improvement in their symptoms.
