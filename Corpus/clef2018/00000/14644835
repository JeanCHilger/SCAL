Laparoscopic management of peritoneal endometriosis, endometriotic cysts, and rectovaginal adenomyosis. Peritoneal endometriosis is probably caused by the implantation of regurgitated menstrual cells. The ovarian endometrioma is the consequence of non-hormone-regulated bleeding from intraovarian epithelial inclusions after they have undergone metaplasia into endometrial-like tissue. Rectovaginal adenomyosis is, in fact, an adenomyotic lesion and can develop from MÃ¼llerian rests. In conclusion, peritoneal endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis, and rectovaginal adenomyotic nodules must be considered as three separate entities with different pathogeneses that require a different therapeutic approach.
