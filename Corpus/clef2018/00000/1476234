Prognostic possibilities in genital endometriosis. A total of 64 patients with genital endometriosis were examined. The reference group included 120 phenotypically healthy women. The dermatoglyphic pattern of patients with genital endometriosis was defined, pointing to a genetic predisposition to genital endometriosis and reflecting the risk of its development. Together with other clinical and laboratory criteria, the dermatoglyphic studies permit an early diagnosis of endometriosis.
