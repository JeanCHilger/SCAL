Effects of danazol at the immunologic level in patients with adenomyosis, with special reference to autoantibodies: a multi-center cooperative study. We attempted to evaluate the effects of danazol on autoantibodies, in particular, to phospholipids, and on the immune system in patients with adenomyosis.Forty-two patients with adenomyosis who had high titers of autoantibodies were randomly chosen, and they received 400 mg/day of danazol for 4 months (n = 22) or underwent hysterectomy (n = 20).Among the six autoantibodies we investigated, the incidence of antiphosphatidylinositol immunoglobulin G was the highest (42.9%), followed by antiphosphatidylglycerol immunoglobulin G (38.1%). The autoantibody titers decreased with time and were comparable to the control values 16 weeks after treatment in both groups. Total serum levels of immunoglobulin G and M were high before treatment, but immunoglobulin M levels decreased significantly in week 8 during treatment with danazol, whereas C4 levels increased and C3 levels decreased with danazol.Danazol has an inhibitory effect on the autoimmunologic response associated with adenomyosis.
