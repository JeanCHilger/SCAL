Correlation between expression of oncogene products and resistance to anticancer drugs in cultured ovarian cancer cell lines. Despite recent advances in the application of chemotherapy to ovarian cancer, the development of alternative therapies that retain activity against drug-resistant-tumors remains a high priority. We analyzed a number of cultured ovarian cancer cell lines of different tissue types for the presence or absence of sensitivity to various anticancer drugs as well as expression patterns of oncogene products (erbB-2, EGFR, bcl-2). As a result, we identified oncogene products that were related to resistance. Using 9 cultured cell lines of ovarian cancers (serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear, undifferentiated), sensitivities to anticancer drugs were investigated using the MTT assay. The phenotypes of oncogene products expressed by the above cultured cell lines were analyzed by Western blotting. The oncogene products involved in resistance to anticancer drugs were identified by multivariate analysis. Positive correlation between the resistance to anticancer drugs and the oncogene products was obtained by multivariate analysis for (a) CDDP and erbB-2 (b) x p-16 and erbB-2, and (c) MMC and EGFR. Correlation between resistance to anticancer drugs and expression of certain oncogene products was obtained in ovarian cancers, suggesting that sensitivity to anticancer drugs could be predicated prior to chemotherapy.
