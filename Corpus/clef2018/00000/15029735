Immunohistochemical localisation of metallothionein in ovarian endometriosis in women. Endometriosis is an illness accompanied by invasion features, but malignant changes appear extremely seldom. Metallothionein (MT) is a protein and takes part in the detoxicating processes of the organism. MT is located, among others, in benign and malignant neoplasms in animals as well as humans, mainly in the S phase of cellular cycle, and that is why MT is considered to be both an index of cell proliferation and tumor progress.34 specimens from 21 women with ovary endometriosis (III degree according to AFS) have been examined. The specimens were obtained during surgery and they were histopathologically verified. The material was coloured by H + E and by van Gieson method, and MT was determined immunohistochemically. The measurement of the cells number containing MT was performed with measurement system Multi-Scan Base V8.08, with the microscope Axiophot, Zeiss Jena in so-called measurements areas, with the surface 18802 microns 2.High MT capacity was found in the epithelial cells in the endometriosis focus. This high MT capacity may imply that there exists the proliferation process in the focuses of external endometriosis. Simultaneously, the lowest MT capacity was discovered in glandular ducts.Proliferating epithelial cells contain the highest capacity of MT, which indicates increase of number of dividing cells particularly in the S phase of cellular cycle and that is why MT can be considered one of the markers of ovary endometriosis.
