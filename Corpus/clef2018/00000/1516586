Comparison between serum CA 125 and CA 19-9 assays and tissular OC 125 and 1116NS 19-9 reactivity in malignant and benign ovarian tumors. This preliminary study included 25 patients with primary epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) (18 serous, 3 serous-mucinous, 1 endometrioid, 2 undifferentiated carcinomas and 1 malignant Brenner carcinoma) 2 patients with borderline ovarian tumors and 20 patients with benign ovarian tumors (9 benign cystic teratomas, 6 serous cystoadenomas and 5 mucinous cystoadenomas). Blood samples for the measurement of CA 125 and CA 19-9 were drawn from all patients before surgery. Serum CA 125 (Reference Value-RV = 65 U/ml) and CA 19-9 (RV = 40 U/ml) were measured with IRMAs using the monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) OC 125 and 1116NS 19-9. The same antigens were detected on paraffin-embedded tissue sections by immunocytochemistry with the avidin-biotin complex method employing the same MoAbs used for serum IRMAs. Among the 25 patients with EOC serum CA 125 levels were elevated in 20: tissular OC 125 reactivity was observed in 15 (75%) of them. Of the 5 EOC patients with normal CA 125 levels, 4 showed OC 125 reactivity. Only 2 of the 25 EOC patients had elevated serum CA 19-9 levels: one of them had tissular 1116 NS 19-9 reactivity. Among the 23 patients with normal serum CA 19-9 levels only 5 had immunocytochemical reactivity for this antigen. The 2 patients with borderline ovarian tumors had negative serum CA 125 and CA 19-9 assay: tissular OC 125 reactivity was observed in both patients, while 1116 NS 19-9 reactivity was detected in only one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
