Increase in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)- and CD56+ cell-mediated killing of endometrial stromal cells by mycobacteria a possible role in endometriosis immunotherapy? Immunological therapies have shown promising results in the treatment of endometriosis. Mycobacteria are one of the most common immune therapies used in other diseases. We have assessed the effects of mycobacteria in altering the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and natural killer (NK) cells to kill endometrial stromal cells using an in vitro model. This may have implications in the immunotherapy of endometriosis.Primary cultures of endometrial stromal cells were grown from female patients and PBMCs were extracted from healthy female volunteers. Effector cells (PBMCs or NK cells) were exposed to varying concentrations of mycobacteria before their ability to kill cultured endometrial cells was tested using a 51Cr-release assay.Treatment of effector cells with the Connaught Substrain Bacillus of Calmette and Gu√©rin (BCG) led to increased killing of target cells by PBMCs and NK cells. The optimal concentration for treatment of effector cells with Connaught BCG was approximately 0.1 multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.). There was a trend towards increased killing after treatment with Pasteur BCG. CD56+ (NK) cells treated with BCG at 0.1 m.o.i. showed increased killing of target cells compared with untreated effector cells.Endometrial stromal cells are susceptible to killer cells activated by mycobacteria. This in vitro work suggests a possible role for mycobacteria in the immunotherapy of endometriosis.
