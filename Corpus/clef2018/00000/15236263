Fine-needle aspiration cytology of endometrioid adenofibroma of the ovary. We report the fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology findings of endometrioid adenofibroma arising in the ovary of a 60-year-old woman who presented with vaginal bleeding. Imaging studies revealed a large pelvic mass, which was sampled by computed tomography-guided FNA and core biopsy. The FNA yielded cellular smears composed of bland endometrioid cells and fragments of ovarian-type stroma. The core biopsy showed a biphasic process comprising bland endometrioid glands in a spindle-cell stroma. Immunohistochemical studies performed on the core showed the stroma to be CD10-negative and smooth muscle actin-positive. Subsequent resection of the tumor confirmed the diagnosis and revealed an adenocarcinoma arising in the tumor that was not sampled by FNA. To our knowledge, the cytologic features of ovarian endometrioid adenofibroma have not been previously described.
