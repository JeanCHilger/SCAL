CD10 immunohistochemical staining enhances the histological detection of endometriosis. To determine whether the use of CD10 immunohistochemistry in addition to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining would increase the sensitivity of surgically suspected endometriosis lesions.Retrospective cohort study.Tertiary care government research hospital.Thirty-one women with chronic pelvic pain.Immunohistochemical analysis for CD10 was performed on 108 possible endometriotic lesions and in the corresponding endometrial biopsy samples obtained during laparoscopy. When CD10 immunohistochemistry results were positive, the corresponding H&E section was reviewed to determine if the initial diagnosis should be revised.Histologic diagnosis of endometriosis by adjunctive use of CD10 immunohistochemistry in conjunction with H&E-stained specimens.In endometrial stroma, CD10 was consistently present. Of the 70 specimens judged negative initially by H&E staining, CD10 staining led to the diagnosis of endometriosis in 11. The addition of CD10 immunohistochemistry detected more positive endometriosis lesions than H&E staining alone (45% vs. 35%). In three women with minimal endometriosis at surgery but initially negative histopathology, CD10 immunohistochemistry changed the histologic diagnosis to endometriosis.The adjunctive use of CD10 immunohistochemistry improves diagnostic sensitivity for endometriosis, especially for women with minimal disease.
