Expression of cancer-testis antigens in endometrial carcinomas using a tissue microarray. Cancer-testis (CT) antigens are expressed in a variety of malignant tumors, but in normal adult tissue, they are only expressed in testicular germ cells. Owing to this tumor-associated expression pattern, these antigens are of major interest as potential targets for immunotherapy and possibly for diagnostic purposes. This study was performed to analyze the expression of four CT antigens, NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A3, MAGE-A4, and CT7/MAGE-C1, in endometrial carcinoma using immunohistochemistry, and to correlate expression with histologic subtypes, grade, and expression of WT1 and p53. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of 130 endometrial carcinomas of the following types and grades were analyzed using a tissue microarray: 85 endometrioid carcinomas (FIGO grade 1, 39 grade 2, 11
