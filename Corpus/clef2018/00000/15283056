T allele for VEGF gene-460 polymorphism at the 5'-untranslated region: association with a higher susceptibility to endometriosis. To investigate whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene 5'-UTR-460 polymorphism could be used as a marker of susceptibility to endometriosis.Women were divided into 2 groups, endometriosis (n = 122) and nonendometriosis (n = 131). Polymorphisms for VEGF were detected by polymerase chain reaction and BstUI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Massachusetts) restriction enzyme analysis. Genotypes and allelic frequencies between the groups were compared.Proportions of different VEGF polymorphisms in the groups were significantly different. Proportions of cuttable (C) homozygote/heterozygote/ uncuttable (T) homozygotefor VEGF in the groups were 0/44.3/55.7% and 0/63.4/36.6%, respectively. A higher percentage of T/F homozygote and T allele was present in the endometriosis population. The proportions of C/T alleles in the groups were 22.1/77.9% and 31.7/68.3%, respectively.T/T homozygotes and the T allele of the VEGF-460 gene are associated with a higher risk of endometriosis. Heterozygotes and C allele are related to the lower risk of endometriosis formation. VEGF polymorphism likely contributes to the pathogenesis of endometriosis and may become a useful markerfor predicting endometriosis susceptibility.
