Prostatic duct carcinoma with combined prostatic duct adenocarcinoma and urothelial carcinoma features: report of a case. We report a unique case of prostatic duct carcinoma (PDC) featuring both prostatic duct adenocarcinoma (PDA) and high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HG-UC). An 84-year-old man presenting with hematuria showed at ultrasonography and cystoscopy a papillary neoplasia located near to the verumontanum. Histopathologic examination of specimens from transurethral resection revealed a tumor originating from large prostatic ducts showing 2 different components: PDA with endometrioid features (main pattern) and HG-UC (minor part). Immunohistochemically, the areas of PDA were positive for prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), prostatic specific antigen (PSA), and androgen receptors (AR), while negative for estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PGR). Prognostic factors evaluation pointed out a low proliferation index (10%) and focal expression of p53 (6%) c-erb-B2 was not overexpressed. The HG-UC areas were negative for all previous markers, while positive for thromobomodulin. The proliferation index was high (60%), and p53 was diffusely expressed (55%). The incidence and significance of PDC with combined features is discussed with reference to literature data.
