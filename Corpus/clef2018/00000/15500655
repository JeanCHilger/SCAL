Cellular retinol-binding protein-1 expression in endometrial stromal cells: physiopathological and diagnostic implications. Cellular retinol-binding protein-1 (CRBP-1) contributes to the maintenance of the differentiated state of the endometrium through retinol bioavailability regulation. The aim was to analyse CRBP-1 expression in endometrial stromal cells at eutopic and ectopic sites in different physiopathological conditions.Antibodies to CRBP-1, CD10 and alpha-smooth muscle actin were applied to proliferative (n = 10), secretory (n = 9) and atrophic (n = 7) endometrium, decidua (n = 4), adenomyosis (n = 5), endometriosis (n = 10), endometrial polyps (n = 9), simple endometrial hyperplasia (n = 6), well-differentiated endometrioid carcinoma (n = 6) and submucosal leiomyomas (n = 5). In some cases, Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were also applied. CRBP-1 was expressed by eutopic and ectopic endometrial stromal cells more markedly during the late secretory phase and in decidua of pregnancy. CRBP-1 expression was low in the stroma of atrophic endometrium and absent in myometrium, leiomyomas and cervical stroma. CD10 immunoreactivity was weak in atrophic endometrium and in decidua.CRBP-1 expression characterizes endometrial stromal cells at eutopic and ectopic sites and appears to be more specific than CD10. The level of CRBP-1 varies in intensity according to hormonal variations, reaching its maximum in predecidua and decidua. Thus, immunodetection of CRBP-1 may help to elucidate the physiopathological changes which occur in endometrial stroma and can also be applied as an adjuvant stromal marker.
