Endometrial adenocarcinoma associated with subtle lymph-vascular space invasion and lymph node metastasis: a histologic pattern mimicking intravascular and sinusoidal histiocytes. Lymph-vascular space invasion has been established as an independent prognostic factor in endometrial adenocarcinoma. Despite the importance of its recognition, the histologic patterns of lymph-vascular space involvement have not been well addressed in the surgical pathology literature. We report three cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus associated with a subtle pattern of lymph-vascular space invasion closely mimicking intravascular histiocytes. Two cases had regional lymph node metastases composed of morphologically similar cells.
