Molecular genetic alterations in endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary: similar frequency of beta-catenin abnormalities but lower rate of microsatellite instability and PTEN alterations than in uterine endometrioid carcinomas. Endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary closely resemble their uterine counterparts. It has been suggested that the former tumors have the same molecular alterations (microsatellite instability [MSI], PTEN, and beta-catenin) described in endometrioid carcinomas of the uterus. We analyzed 55 ovarian carcinomas, including 22 endometrioid, 18 clear cell, and 15 mixed types. MSI was detected in 5 of 39 cases (13%). MLH1 promoter hypermethylation was identified in 2 of the 5 MSI-positive tumors. PTEN was mutated in 5 of 54 cases (9%) of these, 3 had MSI and exhibited frameshift mutations in short-coding mononucleotide repeats. Beta-catenin nuclear expression was detected in 11 of 54 cases (20%) by immunostaining
