T homozygote and allele of epidermal growth factor receptor 2073 gene polymorphism are associated with higher susceptibility to endometriosis and leiomyomas. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a regulator of angiogenesis and mediator of sex steroid-induced cell growth and differentiation. We observed that EGFR gene 2073*T-related genotypes and allele are associated with higher susceptibilities to endometriosis and leiomyoma.
