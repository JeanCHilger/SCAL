Ber-EP4 and anti-calretinin antibodies: a useful combination for differential diagnosis of various histological types of ovarian cancer cells and mesothelial cells. The differential diagnosis between reactive mesothelial cells and ovarian carcinoma cells is often difficult in cytologic specimens. Immunocytochemical procedures have been utilized in assisting this differential diagnosis, with limitations. Furthermore, previous studies examined only serous type but not other histological types of ovarian carcinoma cases. Therefore, we evaluated the practical value of various epithelial and mesothelial markers in differential diagnosis of these two types of cells. Various types of ovarian carcinoma (serous, n = 22 mucinous, n = 10
