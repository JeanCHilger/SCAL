Endometrial and endocervical micro echogenic foci: sonographic appearance with clinical and histologic correlation. The purpose of this research was to determine the clinical and histologic importance of small echogenic foci seen in the endometrium/endocervix on pelvic sonography.A retrospective study was performed on 62 women, aged 28 to 81 years, who had echogenic foci of the endometrium and endocervix. Patients' medical records were accessed to review pertinent obstetric and gynecologic information. Additionally, histopathologic slides from patients who underwent diagnostic procedures (endometrial biopsy or dilation and curettage) or hysterectomy were reviewed.The clinical information for the 62 women included the following: mean age, 49 years history of exogenous hormonal use, 84%Histopathologic studies showed microcalcifications, which are the most common cause of echogenic foci. The foci were stable with time and seemed to be an incidental finding associated mostly with benign conditions. The etiologic factors for echogenic foci may be numerous.
