Trends in causes and treatment of infertility at Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, 1976-1989. To describe the causes of infertility among couples presenting to a fertility clinic over a period of 14 years. Changes in treatment methods over the same period are described.A retrospective analysis of records of patient age, date of first visit, duration and cause of infertility, treatment and outcome.A fertility clinic set in a large public hospital. Patients are referred by both general gynaecologists and general practitioners.From 1976 to 1989 (inclusive) 2895 couples who had engaged in unprotected intercourse for at least 12 months without conceiving attended the clinic.Three major diagnostic categories were considered these embraced aetiological factors relating to semen, ovulation, and pelvic anatomy. Investigation of the causes of infertility after a couple's first visit showed these to be a semen defect in 22%, irregular cycles or anovulation in 29%, and a pelvic disorder in 57%. The incidence of semen defects as the cause remained constant between 1976 and 1989 while that of ovulation "problems" declined from 42% in 1976 to 13% in 1989. In contrast, the incidence of pelvic dysfunction increased from 40% in 1976 to 68% in 1989, predominantly due to an increased diagnosis of endometriosis. The principal treatments were ovulation induction/cycle regulation (51%), in-vitro fertilisation/gamete intrafallopian transfer (42%), and donor insemination (18%).Provided patient information is accurately and consistently recorded a Fertility Audit is a useful window on the activates of a Fertility Clinic and serves to highlight areas which warrant further investigation.
