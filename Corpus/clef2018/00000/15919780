Adenomyosis in endometriosis--prevalence and impact on fertility. Evidence from magnetic resonance imaging. The hypothesis is tested that there is a strong association between endometriosis and adenomyosis and that adenomyosis plays a role in causing infertility in women with endometriosis. METHODS. Magnetic resonance imaging of the uteri was performed in 160 women with and 67 women without endometriosis. The findings were correlated with the stage of the disease, the age of the women and the sperm count parameters of the respective partners.The posterior junctional zone (PJZ) was significantly thicker in women with endometriosis than in those without the disease (P<0.001). There was a positive correlation of the diameter of the PJZ with the stage of the disease and the age of the patients. The PJZ was thicker in patients with endometriosis with fertile than in patients with subfertile partners. The prevalence of adenomyotic lesions in all 160 women with endometriosis was 79%. In women with endometriosis below an age of 36 years and fertile partners, the prevalence of adenomyosis was 90% (P<0.01)With a prevalence of up to 90%, uterine adenomyosis is significantly associated with pelvic endometriosis and constitutes an important factor of sterility in endometriosis presumably by impairing uterine sperm transport.
