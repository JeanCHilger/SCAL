Application of two dimensional electrophoresis,western blot and mass spectrum to screen markers of endometriosis. To find out markers of endometriosis.The two dimensional gel images of proteins extracted from eutopic endometrium from endometriosis patients and controls were analyzed by software Phoretix 2D,and the proteins expressed differently were identified primarily by query of data base. The proteins extracted from ectopic endometrium of ovarian endometriosis were transferred from two dimensional gel onto nitrocellulose membranes, followed by incubation with sera from women with and without endometriosis. Analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS, the proteins hybridized differently were identified through their Peptide Mass Footprints.Having compared the reproducible two dimensional gel images of proteins from eutopic endometrium of women with and without endometriosis,we obtained 11 proteins expressed differently. Through Western Blot technique,we found three proteins hybridized differently which were identified as vimentin, beta-actin and ATP synthase beta subunit respectively.The protein expression spectra of eutopic endometrium from patients with endometriosis are significantly different from those of the controls, and the anti-endometrial autoantibodies against vimentin, beta-actin and ATP synthase beta subunit may be induced.
