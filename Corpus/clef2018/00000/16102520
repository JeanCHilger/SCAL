IL-10-dependent down-regulation of MHC class II expression level on monocytes by peritoneal fluid from endometriosis patients. Endometriosis is a gynecologic disorder characterized by the ectopic growth of misplaced endometrial cells. Moreover, immunological abnormalities of cell-mediated and humoral immunity may be associated with the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The effects of peritoneal fluid (PF) from endometriosis patients on the expression levels of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules on the cell surfaces of monocytes were investigated. Compared to the PF of controls, the addition of 10% PF (n=10) from patients with endometriosis to culture medium significantly reduced the percentage of MHC class II-positive cells in cultures of a THP-1, monocytic cell line at 48 h. The effect of endometriosis patient PF (EPF) was dose-dependent, and similar effect was observed in peripheral blood monocytes. An inverse correlation was found between MHC class II expression level and IL-10 concentration in EPF (r=-0.518 p=0.019) and in the supernatant of peripheral blood monocyte cultured in EPF (r=-0.459
