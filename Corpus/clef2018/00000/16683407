Tumor marker CA-125 in adnexal inflammatory tumors. The glycoprotein of a high molecular weight CA-125, which is not a specific tumor marker of ovarian cancer, is secreted by the endothelial cells of most pelvic organs. Endometriosis, inflammatory processes in the pelvic cavity, as well as some nongynecoligical malignant diseases, could be followed by the increased values of CA-125. Serial assessment of the values of CA-125 makes it possible to avoid surgical treatment, and, by means of the used conservative treatment, to avoid malignant diseases not to be noticed.The study included 57 female patients hospitalized due to inflammable adnexal tumors. Besides following the values of serum CA-125 during and after the therapy, also performed were the transvaginal Doppler ultrasonography and the determination of the values of resistance index (RI).In 27 patients (55.1%) the CA-125 values ranged from 38.8 U/ml to 794 U/ml, while in 30 of the patients they were within the range of normal. In this group of the patients, besides the increased values of CA-125, also increased were the values of leucocytes (11(9)/1-20(9)/1), as well as the sedimentation rates (65-120) within the first hour. In all the 57 patients, transvaginal Doppler ultrasonography revealed the presence of adnexal tumor of inflammatory kind. The measured values of RI were within the range of 0.539-0.681. Eight of the patients were treated by the conservative--triple antibiotic therapy, while in 49 patients explorative laparotomy was performed. Hystorectomy was done in 12 of the patients, and one-side adnexectomy in 37 of them.The method for the assessment of CA-125 is simple and available which facilitates the monitoring of surgical, conservative or the combined therapy that is particularly significant in younger patients with inflammable adnexal tumor developed on the basis of endometrosis.
