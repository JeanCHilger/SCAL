Use of proteomic analysis of endometriosis to identify different protein expression in patients with endometriosis versus normal controls. To use proteomic techniques, including two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), Western blot, and mass spectrometry, to screen and identify proteins that were expressed differently in patients with endometriosis versus normal controls.First, we aimed to find a difference in the way serum and eutopic endometrial proteins were expressed in women with and without endometriosis. Second, we were interested in searching for endometriotic proteins, which were specifically recognized by sera from patients with endometriosis.Collaborative investigation in an academic research environment.Consenting women of reproductive age taking no medications and with laparoscopically proven endometriosis.Surgical excision of eutopic and ectopic endometrial biopsy and phlebotomization of patients with endometriosis and controls.Protein expression.Thirteen protein spots from serum correlated with 11 known proteins and 11 protein spots from endometrium correlated with 11 known proteins were found differently expressed between women with and without endometriosis. Some proteins may be cytoskeletons, and some may be involved in the regulation of cell cycle, signal transduction, or immunological function. Three proteins, which were identified as vimentin, beta-actin, and ATP synthase beta subunit, hybridized significantly differently between endometriosis sera and normal sera.The data help to establish a human endometriosis proteome database and broaden our understanding of the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Further study of the proteins identified herein will assist in the eventual development of new diagnoses and treatments for endometriosis.
