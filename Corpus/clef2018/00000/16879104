Mean of CA 125 in making therapy decision in adnexal inflammatory tumors. LABORATORY FINDINGS such are white blood count and sedimentation rate are of relative value in inflammations of the upper genital tract and adnexal inflammatory tumors. Antibiotics are administrated in all cases according to the protocol but some of them need operative treatment also. Inflammatory tumors can develop in endometriotic and even in cancer adnexal masses. CA 125 is elevated in great number of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. It can also be elevated in endometriosis, inflammations and in non-gynecological malignancies. Adnexal inflammatory tumor was confirmed in 57 patients.white blood count and sedimentation rate were in normal levels in 17 patients. CA 125 was elevated in 27 patients. 49 patients were operated and CA 125 decreased in the first 5 days after the operation. Only 8 patients without CA 125 elevation were successfully treated by mean of antibiotics. Even there is no need for routine examining of serum CA 125 in adnexal inflammatory tumors it can be examined in cases with suspected Doppler ultrasonographic findings or unclear clinical findings. Endometriosis brings some risk of malignancy. Inflammatory tumor can develop in endometriotic tumor as well as in necrotic malignant ovary tissue. These could be reasons for making decision to do the operation in cases with inflammatory tumor followed with increased CA 125, hystological assessment and serious interpretation of final results.
