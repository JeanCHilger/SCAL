Body mass index as a prognostic factor in endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. To determine if body mass index (BMI) influences tumor expression of HER-2/neu, estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/PR), and survival in women with endometrial adenocarcinoma.Patients diagnosed between January 1992 and December 2001 with endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus were identified. Clinical and pathologic data were retrospectively collected. HER-2/neu, estrogen and progesterone receptor expression were determined by immunohistochemistry. Differences in these variables and other prognostic factors were analyzed and correlated with effect on survival.One-hundred-sixty-five patients were included in this analysis. Lower BMI was associated with high stage (p=0.04) and HER-2/neu expression (p=0.04). Black race, high grade, high stage and lack of ER/PR expression were all associated with decreased survival. Despite having better prognostic factors, women with a BMI >25 had a lower survival than women with a BMI <25 (p=0.36). When five-year survival rates were calculated for BMI category and stratified by prognostic factors, for almost every high risk factor, survival was lower in overweight patients.In patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, low BMI is associated with high stage and tumor expression of HER-2/neu. Despite better prognostic factors, overweight women experience poorer survival.
