Spontaneous cutaneous umbilical endometriosis. Endometriosis consists of extrauterine endometrial growths. Although it is usually located in the pelvis it can also be found in other sites. Endometriosis of the skin is rare and the most frequent form develops over gynecologic or obstetric scars, although it may also appear spontaneously in the umbilical area. We present a 39-years-old woman with an umbilical nodule as a clinically characteristic form of spontaneous cutaneous endometriosis. The histopathological examination confirmed the clinical diagnosis.
