Effect of triptorelin and an extended-interval dosing regimen in the treatment of patients with endometriosis and adenomyoma. To study the role of triptorelin in the treatment of patients with endometriosis, adenomyoma and fibromyoma and the effect of an extended-interval dosing regimen.Seventy patients suffering from endometriosis, adenomyoma and fibromyoma were divided into two groups: extended-interval dosing (group E) and conventional dosing (group C). There were treated with injection of triptorelin 3.75 mg intramuscularly either every 6 weeks of totally four dose regimen (group E) or every 4 weeks of six dose regimen (group C). Comparison was made in improvement of symptoms, size of uterus and volume of tumor, as well as in serum levels of 17beta-estradiol, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone.In each group, symptoms and tumor growth significantly improved after treatment (P < 0.05). For the patients of both groups E and C, the levels of gonadotropins and gonadal steroids were obviously reduced throughout the treatment period and up to 8 - 10 weeks after the injection of the last dose (P < 0.05). The hormonal profile of group E was similar to group C (P > 0.05).Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist is efficacious in the treatment of endometriosis and adenomyoma through reducing the serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and 17beta-estradiol. The curative effect is satisfactory in most patients receiving an extended interval dosing regimen. To reduce the cost of treatment, the extended-interval dosing regimen of triptorelin should be adopted in well-equipped hospitals.
