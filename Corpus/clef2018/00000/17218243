Endometrioid adenocarcinoma treated by hysteroscopic endomyometrial resection. A 53-year-old multiparous woman, with no identifiable risk factor for endometrial cancer, presented with menorrhagia. She had been treated with oral contraceptives for 3 years. Office endometrial biopsy indicated well-differentiated villoglandular adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. The patient refused hysterectomy and would consent only to hysteroscopic resection. She remains alive and well, with no clinical evidence of recurrence 5 years after resection. We propose that skillful resectoscopic surgery, under specific circumstance, may be an appropriate alternative treatment to hysterectomy for some early uterine malignancies.
