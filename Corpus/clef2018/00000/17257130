The role of matrix metalloproteinases-2, -7 and -9 and beta-catenin in high grade endometrial carcinoma. To determine the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-2, -7 and -9 and beta-catenin in uterine serous carcinoma (USC) and endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC) and to investigate any difference in expression between EEC and USC which might explain the mechanism of invasion and aggressive behaviour of USC.Tissue microarrays were created from the viable central part and from the invasive edge of 20 cases of grade 3 EEC and 73 cases of USC. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies to MMPs-2, -7 and -9 and beta-catenin. MMPs-2, -7 and -9 and beta-catenin were present in both tumour types there was significantly higher expression of MMPs-2 and -9 in EEC compared with USC and significantly increased expression of MMPs-2 and -9 by carcinoma cells at the invasive edge of USC.MMPs-2, -7 and -9 and beta-catenin are present in EEC and USC. The increased expression of MMPs-2 and -9 by carcinoma cells at the invasive edge of USC is possibly due to increased binding of MMPs secreted by the stromal cells to carcinoma cells, thus equipping the USC carcinoma cells with proteases for invasion.
