Overexpression and prognostic value of p53 and HER2/neu proteins in benign ovarian tissue and in ovarian cancer. To investigate the prognostic value of p53 and HER2/neu overexpression in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).p53 and HER2/neu immunostaining were performed in 198 tissue samples, 124 EOC, 44 benign ovarian tumors and 30 normal ovaries. Nuclear p53 and membranous HER2/neu immunostaining were evaluated.Neither p53 nor HER2/neu overexpression was seen in the benign ovarian tumors. HER2/neu immunostaining was observed in one normal ovary. P53 overexpression was found in 25% EOC and was related with advanced stage, endometrioid, clear cell and undifferentiated types, grade G3, and sub-optimal surgery. HER2/neu immunostaining was observed in 24.2% and it was associated with advanced stage, clear cell and undifferentiated types, and suboptimal surgery. Both, p53 and HER2/neu overexpression decreased overall and progression-free survival, but in the multivariant analysis, only HER2/neu overexpression was an independent prognostic factor of overall survival (RR = 2.8 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-5.6) and recurrence (RR = 2.8HER2/neu overexpression (but not p53 overexpression) is a major prognostic factor in EOC.
