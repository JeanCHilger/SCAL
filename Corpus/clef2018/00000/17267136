Endometriosis imaging. Pelvic endometriosis primarily affects the ovaries, pelvic peritoneum, utero-sacral ligaments, Douglas pouch, vagina, rectum and bladder. Clinical assessment is difficult, and imaging proves necessary to determine location and extent of the disease. We review pelvic endometriosis with regards to imaging modalities: technical considerations, imaging patterns, diagnostic performance and respective place of ultrasound and MRI.
