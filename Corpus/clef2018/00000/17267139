Adenomyosis. Diagnostic adenomyosis is done by pathologist (grade A). Adenomyosis is usually asymptomatic (grade C). Symptomatic adenomyosis gives pains and/or bleedings (grade C). Hysterosalpingography is not included in diagnostic strategy (grade B). Sonography has a good sensitivity and can be exclusively used for therapeutic strategy (grade B). MRI is pertinent but only useful in case of associated lesions (grade B). Hysterectomy is the gold standard for symptomatic patients without desire of pregnancy (grade B). Medical treatments are: IUD with levonorgestrel, Gn-RH analog, antigonadotrope progestin (grade C). Uterine artery embolisation is not recommended (professional agreement). Endometrial resection/destruction are indicated in case of menorraghia (grade C).
