Putative predictors of antibodies against follicle-stimulating hormone in female infertility: a study based on in vitro fertilization patients. We have previously demonstrated the presence of naturally occurring antibodies against follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in patients with endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Here, we investigated the parameters associated with anti-FSH antibodies in in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients.The following parameters were studied in 135 patients: peripheral FSH levels, FSH beta-subunit gene (FSHB) haplotypes, history of previous IVF, and susceptibility to autoimmune reactions in general [seven common autoantibodies (against nuclear antigens on human and rodent substrates, smooth muscle, gastric parietal cells, beta2-glycoprotein I, cardiolipin, and thyroid peroxidase) and HLA-DQB1 alleles].Although the anti-FSH levels were higher in patients when compared with controls, those higher levels were not associated with FSHB haplotypes. The anti-FSH IgM associated with (i) the levels of FSH in women with male and tubal factor infertility (ii) the history of IVF in patients with PCOS, endometriosis, and unexplained infertilityAnti-FSH may be naturally occurring antibodies associated with peripheral FSH concentrations, but increased in infertile women with dysregulation of immune reactions and repeatedly performed IVF.
