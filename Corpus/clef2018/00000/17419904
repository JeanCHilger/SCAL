Is extrauterine endometriosis confined to the gynecological sphere? A critical review of the experience in a general surgery unit. Extrauterine or external endometriosis (e.e.) describes ectopic localization of functional endometrial tissue, a finding whose incidence is increasing due to the diffusion of laparoscopic procedures. The clinical presentation of such disease is often non-specific, even in those cases with a definite surgical indication, depending on the site and pathology of the lesions. Surgical planning is therefore difficult at times, specifically regarding the extent of resection in patients--as young women--willing to maintain fertility. The Authors report on 7 cases observed in their own experience (inguinal endometriosis--1 case, umbilical endometriosis--1 case, abdominal wall endometriosis--3 cases, intestinal endometriosis--1 case, diaphragmatic endometriosis associated with pneumothorax--1 case), representing the wide range of clinical settings related to e.e. Based on literature data, an analysis of clinical and diagnostic issues is carried out. Specifically, the problems related to extent of surgical resection in multifocal cases, possible malignant degeneration and localization on abdominal wall scars are discussed.
