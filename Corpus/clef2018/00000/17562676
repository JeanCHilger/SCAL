A system-wide analysis of differentially expressed genes in ectopic and eutopic endometrium. Decades of research suggest that endometriosis is a complex disorder, with varying severity, onset and progression. Many genes have been associated with endometriosis through a number of studies and now microarray analyses have added to the list of perturbed or differentially regulated genes. Thus, it is difficult to see 'the big picture' without first integrating these multiple, heterogeneous sources of high-quality information for analysis.The goal of this study was to infer correlative and/or causal trends by combining empirical microarray analysis with a historical knowledge base of genetic relationships in endometriosis via a program called IRIDESCENT.Importantly, we found a number of genes, which may have a central role in endometriosis, despite the fact that few or no past studies have reported these associations.Several genes listed as non-responders on the microarray were found to be regulated post-transcriptionally, illustrating the importance of integrating multiple data sources.
