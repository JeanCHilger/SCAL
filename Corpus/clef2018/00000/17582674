Serum cytokines as biomarkers for nonsurgical prediction of endometriosis. To test the ability of a group of serum cytokines, either individually or in combination, to serve as biomarkers for the nonsurgical diagnosis of endometriosis.Subjects were allocated to two groups according to their laparoscopic diagnosis. The first group consisted of patients with endometriosis and the second group was made up of infertile women with no pelvic pathology (controls). Blood samples were collected preoperatively and stored. Cytokines were measured in the serum of all participants using the Bio-Plex Protein Array System. Nonparametric statistics and the Mann-Whitney test were used to compare groups. Subjects were seen at the Gynecologic endoscopy unit.Three cytokines were significantly higher in the serum of subjects with endometriosis than in the control group: interleukin-6 (IL-6) [4.41 pg/ml (range: 1.47-15.01) versus 0.97 pg/ml (range: 0.29-2.98), respectively p<0.001], monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) [37.91 pg/ml (range: 24.54-94.74) versus 22.13 pg/ml (range: 13.85-39.45), respectivelySerum of subjects with endometriosis contains significantly higher levels of interleukin-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and interferon-gamma than control women. Serum interleukin-6 measurements discriminate between women with endometriosis and controls. Interleukin-6 provides a promising serum marker for the nonsurgical prediction of endometriosis.
