Maintenance therapy involving a tapering dose of danazol or mid/low doses of oral contraceptive after gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment for endometriosis-associated pelvic pain. Pelvic pain associated with endometriosis was treated by the long-term administration of a tapering dose of danazol or mid/low doses of oral contraceptives after the end of therapy involving a GnRH agonist (GnRH-a). Results demonstrated that each of these three therapies is a practical and efficient treatment regimen to maintain the relief of pelvic pain achieved by GnRH-a therapy, at least for a period of 12 months.
