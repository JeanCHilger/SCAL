Efficacy of recombinant human interferon alpha-2b on experimental endometriosis. To investigate the efficacy of recombinant human interferon alpha-2b on endometriosis.The randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, experimental study was performed on 30 Wistar female rats in the Experimental Surgery Laboratory at Ondokuz Mayis University in Turkey. After the peritoneal implantation of endometrial tissue, rats were randomized to two equal intervention groups: (1) the control group and (2) the interferon group. Six weeks later, after implant volume was measured (volume-1) by performing a second laparotomy, interferon alpha-2b (100,000 IU subcutaneously per rat, three times at 48 h intervals) was administered to the interferon group, and saline solution (0.1 ml SC, once per week), to the control group, for 8 weeks. At the end of the treatment, a third laparotomy was performed to remeasure implant volumes (volume-2), and implants were totally excised for histopathologic examination. Volume-1 and volume-2 within the groups, as well as stromal and glandular tissues between the groups were compared.In the interferon group, volume-2 was statistically significantly reduced compared with volume-1, whereas there was no significant volume change in the control group. In the interferon group, when compared with the control group, both stromal and glandular tissues had statistically significantly lessened.Interferon alpha-2b was seen to regress significantly both the size and the histological structure of endometriotic implants.
