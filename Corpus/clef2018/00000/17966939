Laparoscopic surgery of profund endometriosis with rectal affect. To present the principles of laparoscopic treatment for rectal endometriosis and to discuss possible postoperative outcomes.Our series included women managed for rectal endometriosis during consecutive 20 months in the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Rouen University Hospital, Rouen--France. Patient's characteristics, symptoms, imaging examination results, surgical treatment and postoperative outcomes were all evaluated retrospectively.Sixteen patients presenting with rectal endometriosis were managed surgically, (mean age was 35.9 +/- 6.5 years). All women presented at least one severe painful symptom which was typical of a digestive involvement in 12 cases. MRI results suggested a rectal involvement in 14 cases, and endorectal ultrasound examination clearly showed rectal wall infiltration in all patients. The gynaecological stage of surgical treatment was carried out laparoscopically in 13 cases, and the digestive surgical stage in 7 cases. Two limited and 14 segmental rectal resections were performed. Transitory stoma was carried out in 9 women. The length of the surgical procedure depended on the number of endometriosis localizations with a median value of 6 h 30 min. Postoperative complications occurred in 6 women: 2 anastomosis stenosis, 1 anastomosis fistula, 1 abscess of the parietal wall and 1 bladder atonia. Complains of pain were completely or significantly improved in all cases.Surgical treatment for rectal endometriosis may be carried out laparoscopically. It should be reserved for women presenting with severe painful condition and may contribute to significant improvement. However, the balance of benefit and risks must also be assessed on a case to case basis prior to any decision for or against surgical treatment.
