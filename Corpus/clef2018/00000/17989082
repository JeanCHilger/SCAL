Identification of novel antigens in blood vessels in rectovaginal endometriosis. To identify specific markers of rectovaginal endometriotic nodule vasculature, highly enriched preparations of vascular endothelial cells and pericytes were obtained from endometriotic nodules and control endometrial and myometrial tissue by laser capture microdissection (LCM), and gene expression profiles were screened by microarray analysis. Of the 18 400 transcripts on the arrays, 734 were significantly overexpressed in vessels from fibromuscular tissue and 923 in vessels from stromal tissue of endometriotic nodules, compared with vessels dissected from control tissues. The most frequently expressed transcripts included known endothelial cell-associated genes, as well as transcripts with little or no previous association with vascular cells. The higher expression in blood vessels was further corroborated by immunohistochemical staining of six potential markers, five of which showed strong expression in pericytes. The most promising marker was matrix Gla protein, which was found to be present in both glandular epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells of endometriotic lesions, although it was barely expressed at all in normal endometrium. LCM, combined with microarray analysis, constitutes a powerful tool for mapping the transcriptome of vascular cells. After immunohistochemical validation, markers of vascular endothelial and perivascular cells from endometriotic nodules could be identified, which may provide targets to improve early diagnosis or to selectively deliver therapeutic agents.
