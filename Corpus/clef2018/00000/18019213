A levonorgestrel-containing IUD for the treatment of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a chronic condition that can cause severe pain and have a significant effect on the quality of life. The currently available hormonal treatments with analogues of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) and oral progestational agents are effective in the short term, but the systemic side effects affect treatment compliance. Recurrence of the symptoms is therefore not uncommon. Recently, a few studies have assessed the effect of a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD on the pain associated with endometriosis. This treatment may have a positive effect on endometriosis, both on the symptoms, the measured extent of the lesions, and the serum levels of CA-125. However, the level of evidence of these studies is lower than that of the standard hormonal treatment options, since large randomised controlled trials are still lacking.
