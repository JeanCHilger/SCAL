Low serum and peritoneal fluid concentration of interferon-gamma-induced protein-10 (CXCL10) in women with endometriosis. To evaluate serum and peritoneal fluid concentrations of interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (CXCL10), a chemokine involved in local immune function, in women with endometriosis.Prospective study.Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Siena.A total of 147 women were divided in two groups: women with (n = 77) and without (n = 70) endometriosis.Serum and peritoneal fluid were collected from all patients undergoing laparoscopy.CXCL10 concentrations were measured by a specific ELISA.Serum CXCL10 concentrations in women with endometriosis were significantly lower than in those without endometriosis. No statistically significant difference between women with early endometriosis and those with advanced endometriosis was found. CXCL10 concentrations in peritoneal fluid of women with advanced endometriosis were significantly lower than in that of women with an early stage of, or without, endometriosis.The decreased concentrations of CXCL10 in serum and peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis indicate an impaired immune activity in women with endometriosis.
