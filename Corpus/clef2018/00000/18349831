An immunohistochemical perspective of PPAR beta and one of its putative targets PDK1 in normal ovaries, benign and malignant ovarian tumours. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta (PPAR beta) is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family and is a ligand-activated transcription factor with few known molecular targets including 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1(PDK1). In view of the association of PPAR beta and PDK1 with cancer, we have examined the expression of PPAR beta and PDK1 in normal ovaries and different histological grades of ovarian tumours. Normal ovaries, benign, borderline, grades 1, 2 and 3 ovarian tumours of serous, muciuous, endometrioid, clear cell and mixed subtypes were analysed by immunohistochemistry for PPAR beta and PDK1 expression. All normal ovarian tissues, benign, borderline and grade 1 tumours showed PPAR beta staining localised in the epithelium and stroma. Staining was predominantly nuclear, but some degree of cytoplasmic staining was also evident. Approximately 20% of grades 2 and 3 tumours lacked PPAR beta staining, whereas the rest displayed some degree of nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of the scattered epithelium and stroma. The extent of epithelial and stromal PPAR beta staining was significantly different among the normal and the histological grades of tumours (chi(2)=59.25, d.f.=25, P<0.001 chi(2)=64.48, d.f.=25, P<0.001). Significantly different staining of PPAR beta was observed in the epithelium and stroma of benign and borderline tumours compared with grades 1, 2 and 3 tumours (chi(2)=11.28, d.f.=4, P<0.05
