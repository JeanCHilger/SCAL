Glycodelin expression in the endometrium of healthy women and in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. To analyze the expression of the glycodelin gene to better understand the molecular environment of endometriotic lesions and to elucidate the potential mechanisms that underlie the complex physiopathology of endometriosis.Prospective laboratory study.University hospital.Eleven healthy fertile women and 17 patients with endometriosis in the early proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle.Endometrial biopsy specimens were obtained from the endometrium of healthy women without endometriosis (controls) and from eutopic and ectopic endometrium tissues (pelvic and ovarian endometriotic implants) of endometriosis patients.The glycodelin relative expression level by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.The glycodelin down-regulation found in the endometriotic lesions was 332.26 and 123.17-fold lower, respectively, when compared with the eutopic tissue and the control endometrium.Glycodelin may be one of the molecules that contributes to the loss of cellular homeostasis in endometriotic lesions.
