Comparison of STAT3 with HIF-1alpha, Ob and ObR expressions in human endometrioid adenocarcinomas. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) maintained invasiveness of endometrial cancer cell line. STAT3 mediated signaling for oncogenic growth stimulated by leptin (Ob) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Therefore, we studied STAT3 in relation with HIF-1alpha, Ob, leptin receptor (ObR) and clinical and pathological variables with immunohistochemistry in 48 human endometrioid adenocarcinomas. Nuclear location was a proof of activity of STAT3 and HIF-1 and it was mainly characteristic for granular anti-STAT3 staining and rarely for diffuse HIF-1alpha expression. HIF-1alpha, Ob and ObR presented cytoplasmic granular immunoreactivities. Positive staining for STAT3, HIF-1, Ob and ObR occurred in 75%, 79%, 60% and 31% of cancers, respectively. Anti-STAT3 staining did not significantly vary with grading, staging and patients' age. STAT3 correlated with Ob (p=0.048, r=0.290) and with HIF-1alpha (p=0.004, r=0.407) in all cancers but it failed to associate with ObR at all. In opposition to the absence of significant relationship between STAT3 and Ob, STAT3 correlated with HIF-1alpha in well differentiated cancers (G1), poorly differentiated tumors (G3), pT1b neoplasms, compound group of pT1c, pT2a, pT2b tumors, and older patients over their sixties. STAT3 mediated signaling pathways that engage leptin and HIF-1alpha could only be partially reflected in correlations between STAT3 and Ob or STAT3 and HIF-1alpha in the examined neoplasms. Nevertheless, STAT3 failed to mark cancer advancement, so progressive significance of STAT3 is questionable in endometrioid adenocarcinomas.
