Cytokine and chemokine expression in a rat endometriosis is similar to that in human endometriosis. The pathogenesis of endometriosis, a gynecologic disorder associated with infertility, appears to involve immune responses. However, the details involved have not been clarified. In this study, we analyzed expression levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, eosinophil chemotactic protein, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) and CC chemokine receptor 1 in endometriotic lesions in a rat model in which endometrium is autotransplanted onto peritoneal tissue and found that they were remarkably increased, while those of IL-2, IL-4, and interferon-gamma were not. These results were obtained in a rat model induced by autologous, not allogeneic, transplantation of endometrial epithelium to the peritoneum. Expression of these factors is consistent with that of endometriosis in humans. Therefore, this model may be useful in the investigation of the pathogenesis and treatment of endometriosis.
