Effect of ultrafiltered peritoneal fluid from patients with pelvic endometriosis on the in vitro motility of their spouse's sperm. Recently, there has been information about the ultrafiltrated peritoneal fluid in patients with endometriosis, containing macromollecules that diminish tubal fimbria action, and the in vitro ovular captation in experimental animals. In order to investigate the presence of these substances in the peritoneal fluid, and to know the possible effect that could have on spermatic motivility in vitro, of their mates 11 sterile women with diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis, and 11 normal fertile women, were studied. On the other side, the same day of study, the mate of each of these women, produced semen obtained by masturbation, where amount and motility of sperm, in basal conditions, and after, it was capacitated with Ham-F10, were determined. The final results was evaluated as to percentage of spermatozoon with excellent and progressive motility, and percentage of motionless spermatozoo as well as based on average values (mean +/- EE), of each one of them. The statistic analysis of differences was done by t Student that in coupled samples. The results confirm that peritoneal fluid of patient with endometriosis contains macromollecules, and it shows that these substances affect the motility in vitro of mate's spermatozoon, which could explain, partially at least, the origin of sterility in this disease.
