Semiquantitative analysis of mRNA aromatase expression in eutopic endometrium as a diagnostic marker of endometriosis and estrogen dependent diseases. To determine clinical benefits of mRNA aromatase expression in entopic endometrium as a diagnostic marker of endometriosis.Prospective clinical trial.Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Jessenius Medical Faculty and Faculty Hospital, Martin.The expression of mRNA aromatase of eutopic endometrium was determined among women who underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy due to pelvic pain, infertility or benign pelvic tumor. Endometriosis was confirmed histologicaly and classified by rAFS.On the basis of entering criteria 23 women were enrolled in this study and divided into two subgroups: 12 endometriotic and 11 without endometriosis. Sensitivity of aromatase expression was 75% and specificity 54.5% at the cut-off value of at least minimal aromatase activity. By the presence of estrogen-dependent diseases- endometriosis, myomas or endometrial hyperplasia 18 women were compared to 5 disease free women. In this case, sensitivity of aromatase expression was 72.2 and specificity 80%.Aromatase expression in eutopic endometrium is a good diagnostic marker for endometriosis.
