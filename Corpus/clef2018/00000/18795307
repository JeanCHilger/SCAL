Xanthogranulomatous inflammation: a rare cause of premature ovarian failure. Xanthogranulomatous inflammation is rare, mainly involving the kidneys, histologically characterized by partial or complete replacement of the mucosa by granulation tissue with an abundance of foamy histiocytes, siderophages and multinucleated giant cells. We report an unusual presentation of xanthogranulomatous inflammation of the genital tract in a young female presenting with premature ovarian failure. A 25-year-old unmarried female presented to the gynecology OPD with amenorrhea and lump abdomen for one and half years with weight loss and mucoid discharge per rectum for 2 months. On investigating, CECT showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass lesion with solid cystic components in pelvis. Cystic components showed enhancing walls and air fluid levels. Uterus and ovaries were not seen separately. There were multiple lymph nodes in retroperitoneum. Both LH and FSH were raised to post menopausal levels (FSH-69.35, LH-64.53). A provisional diagnosis of ovarian malignancy was made and a differential diagnosis of genital tuberculosis was kept and a decision for laparotomy was taken. Intraoperatively, there was a mass arising from the right side of fundus stuck to rectum. There was a pus pocket in the tumor. The final histopathological report was suggestive of endometrioma with xanthogranulomatous inflammation involving adjacent ovary and fallopian tube.
