Susceptibility-weighted MRI of endometrioma: preliminary results. Susceptibility-weighted MRI combines magnitude and phase information from fully velocity-compensated gradient-echo sequences and depicts as signal voids the susceptibility effects caused by local inhomogeneity of the magnetic field. Our objective, based on MRI of 60 pathologically proven ovarian cystic lesions, including 42 endometriomas and 18 nonendometrial cysts, was to evaluate hemosiderin deposition within the walls of endometriomas on susceptibility-weighted MR images. Two radiologists blinded to the final diagnosis retrospectively reviewed the images in consensus.On susceptibility-weighted MR images, punctate or curved linear signal voids along the cyst wall were observed in 39 endometriomas (92.9%) and in no nonendometrial cysts. The signal voids were more prominent on 3-T than on 1.5-T images, reflecting the higher sensitivity of 3-T MRI to magnetic susceptibility effects. Thirty-two endometriomas (76.2%) met definitive MRI criteria, that is, hyperintensity on T1-weighted images and hypointensity on T2-weighted images, and 41 endometriomas (97.6%) were correctly diagnosed with susceptibility-weighted MRI.
