Effect of oral contraceptives on vascular endothelial growth factor, Cox-2 and aromatase expression in the endometrium of uteri affected by myomas and associated pathologies. The study was conducted to evaluate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Cox-2 and aromatase expression in the endometrium of uteri with myomas and other associated pathologies.Hysteroscopy was performed in 118 women of reproductive age with myomas and menorrhagia, 40 of whom were using a pill containing 75 mcg gestodene+30 mcg ethinylestradiol. Aromatase p450, VEGF and Cox-2 expression was detected using immunohistochemistry. Fisher's Exact Test and the Mann-Whitney test were used in the statistical analysis, with significance established at p<.05.In patients with myomas and menorrhagia, associated pathologies such as adenomyosis, endometrial polyps and endometriosis were found in 32%, 12% and 17% of cases, respectively. Aromatase, Cox-2 and VEGF expression was greater during the proliferative phase compared to the luteal phase of the cycle or following oral contraceptive use.Endogenous progesterone or combined oral contraceptives are potent inhibitors of VEGF, aromatase and Cox-2 expression in the endometrium of patients with myomas and menorrhagia.
