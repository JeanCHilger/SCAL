Aberrant nuclear beta-catenin expression in the spindle or corded cells in so-called corded and hyalinized endometrioid carcinomas. Another critical role of the unique morphological feature. Corded and hyalinized endometrioid carcinoma (CHEC), showing spindle and/or corded (SPICO) cells often in the background of hyalinized stroma, is a rare variant of uterine endometrioid carcinomas. The aim of our study was to explore the status of cell-adhesion molecules (beta-catenin, E-cadherin) in CHECs and to survey whether immunostains for beta-catenin and p53 can help to distinguish CHECs from their morphological mimics: malignant mixed mullerian tumors (MMMTs) and uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex-cord tumors (UTROSCTs). Immunohistochemistry was performed and scored for each element as follows: 0: negative, 1+: <10% positive cells, 2+: 10-30%, 3+: >30%. The SPICO patterns were classified as spindle/fusiform 3, corded
