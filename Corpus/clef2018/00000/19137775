Clinical and morphological parallels and molecular aspects of the morphogenesis of adenomyosis. The purpose of the study was to reveal clinical and morphological parallels and to define molecular mechanisms, the regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, neoangiogenesis, and the extent of abnormal tissue in adenomyosis (AM). The surgical material obtained from 492 patients of late reproductive age was examined. The data of clinico-anamnestic and instrumental diagnostic studies and a morphological study with hematoxylin and eosin staining were analyzed. An immunohistochemical study was carried out on serial paraffin sections (n = 115), by applying antibodies to Apo-CAS, Ki67, PCNA, CD-34, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-3, TIMP-4, and E-cadherin. The specific features of their morphological structure and the clinical course of the disease allowed identification of its active and inactive forms. Immunohistochemically active AM is characterized by high proliferation, diminished apoptosis, and increased expression of MMPs along with lower expression of TIMPs by glandular and stromal cells as compared with inactive AM. At the same time, there was a high activity of stromal cells in the foci of active AM. The results of the study may be used to predict the course of the disease and to elaborate target therapy for AM.
