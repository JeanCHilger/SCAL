Differentially expressed genes in eutopic and ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. To elucidate the potential mechanisms involved in the physiopathology of endometriosis. We analyzed the differential gene expression profiles of eutopic and ectopic tissues from women with endometriosis.Prospective laboratory study.University hospital.Seventeen patients in whom endometriosis was diagnosed and 11 healthy fertile women.Endometrial biopsy specimens from the endometrium of healthy women without endometriosis and from the eutopic and ectopic endometrium tissues of patients with endometriosis were obtained in the early proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle.Six paired samples of eutopic and ectopic tissue were analyzed by subtractive hybridization. To evaluate the expression of genes found by rapid subtraction hybridization methods, we measured CTGF, SPARC, MYC, MMP, and IGFBP1 genes by real-time polymerase chain reaction in all samples.This study identified 291 deregulated genes in the endometriotic lesions. Significant expression differences were obtained for SPARC, MYC, and IGFBP1 in the peritoneal lesions and for MMP3 in the ovarian endometriomas. Additionally, significant differences were obtained for SPARC and IGFBP1 between the peritoneal and ovarian lesions. No significant differences were found for the studied genes between the control and the eutopic endometrium.This study identified 291 genes with differential expression in endometriotic lesions. The deregulation of the SPARC, MYC, MMP3, and IGFBPI genes may be responsible for the loss of cellular homeostasis in endometriotic lesions.
