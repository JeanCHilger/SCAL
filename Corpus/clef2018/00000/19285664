Prokineticin 1 mRNA expression in the endometrium of healthy women and in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. To examine prokineticin 1 (PROK1) mRNA expression in eutopic endometrial glands obtained from patients with or without endometriosis, to investigate the presence of additional endometrial abnormalities in women with endometriosis.Prospective laboratory study.University hospital.Twelve control women and 12 patients affected by endometriosis in the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle.Endometrial specimens were obtained from women affected (cases) or not (control group) by endometriosis. Endometrial glands were freshly isolated from endometrial biopsies.PROK1 mRNA expression levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis.PROK1 mRNA was detectable in 4 of 12 (33%) samples obtained from women affected by endometriosis, whereas 10 of 12 (83%) samples obtained from normal women were positive for PROK1 detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, detectable PROK1 mRNA levels were 10 times lower in samples obtained from women with endometriosis than in samples obtained from control women.PROK1 is a newly discovered angiogenic factor implicated in the vascular function of peri-implantation endometrium and early pregnancy. An altered expression of PROK1 could be one of the several biochemical abnormalities characterizing eutopic endometrium in endometriosis.
