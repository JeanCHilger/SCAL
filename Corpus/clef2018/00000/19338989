Interleukin-4 induces expression of eotaxin in endometriotic stromal cells. To study the relationship between eotaxin and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the pathophysiology of endometriosis.Comparative and laboratory study.University teaching hospital reproductive endocrinology and infertility practice.Ectopic endometrial tissues were collected from women with endometriosis.Ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) were isolated and cultured with IL-4. Ectopic endometriotic tissues were immunostained for eotaxin and IL-4.Gene expression of eotaxin was determined by standard and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Secretion of eotaxin from ESC was measured using specific ELISA. The immunostained sections were examined.Interleukin-4 (IL-4) increased mRNA expression and protein secretion of eotaxin from ESC in a dose-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that eotaxin-positive cells colocalized with IL-4-positive cells and accumulated around the blood vessels in the stroma of endometriotic tissue.IL-4 induces eotaxin in ESCs, which might promote angiogenesis and the subsequent development of endometriosis.
