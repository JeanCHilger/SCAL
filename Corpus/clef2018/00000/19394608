Tumor necrosis factor alpha -C850T polymorphism is significantly associated with endometriosis in Asian Indian women. To establish the association of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA) promoter C850T polymorphism in Asian Indian women with endometriosis.Case control study, from multiple gynecological centers from Hyderabad, a cosmopolitan city in southern India. The study included 245 women who comprised 110 surgically confirmed cases of endometriosis, 50 ultrasonographically confirmed cases of fibroid tumors, and 85 healthy female volunteers.Academic hospital.The cases were 245 women, 160 patients and 85 controls.None.Tumor necrosis factor alpha -C850T polymorphism may be used as a molecular marker for endometriosis in our population.In this study we have demonstrated an association between TNFA -C850T polymorphism and endometriosis. The T allele is significantly associated with endometriosis when compared to women with fibroids as well as healthy controls. Our data imply that the T allele is associated with endometriosis (OR = 1.9594: 95% CI, 1.3833-2.7753 in our population. The TT genotype increases the risk of endometriosis by fourfold (4.5542: 95% CI, 2.0388-10.1701.This study suggests that -C850T TNFA gene polymorphism could be used as a relevant molecular marker to identify women with risk of developing endometriosis in our population.
