Umbilical primary endometrioma. Case report. Umbilical primary endometrioma is a rare extra-uterine localization of endometriosis with a documented neoplastic risk. It is often difficult to distinguish primary umbilical endometriosis from other benign and malignant tumors of the abdominal wall. The Authors report a case of umbilical endometriosis in a 36-year old female. Endometriosis was suspected because of the presence of the typical cyclic bleeding and swelling. Abdominal CT excluded the presence of other endometriotic localizations. The umbilical mass was widely excised together with umbilicus, fascia and peritoneum. The tissue defect was primary closed without prosthetic mesh. Histological examination of the specimen showed the presence of endometrial glands with stromal component, compatible with the diagnosis of endometriosis. The Authors suggest that surgery should be performed in the first 3-4 days of the follicular phase, to minimize the risk of diffusion of endometriotic cells. Moreover, the excision should be wide in order to prevent local recurrence.
