Adenomyotic cyst in an adolescent girl. Cystic adenomyosis is an extremely rare form of adenomyosis, particularly in the pediatric population. We report a unique case of an adenomyotic cyst in an adolescent girl.A 16-year-old G0P0 presented with cyclic pelvic pain. Ultrasonography demonstrated a large cystic lesion, which was localized to the myometrium on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The lesion was surgically excised and confirmed to be cystic adenomyosis by pathology.Cystic adenomyosis is a rare cause of abdominopelvic pain and dysmenorrhea in adolescents. Imaging is key in distinguishing this disease from other congenital and acquired gynecological disorders. Awareness of this condition is important for timely, accurate diagnosis and intervention.
