Interstitial cystitis is an etiology of chronic pelvic pain in young women. The prevalence of interstitial cystitis (IC) in young women, especially in those 18 years old or younger, is not well defined. This case series was performed to investigate IC as a cause of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in young women.Case series.University medical center.Twenty-eight women with CPP, ages 13 to 25, who underwent concomitant laparoscopy and cystoscopy.All subjects underwent concomitant diagnostic laparoscopy and cystoscopy with hydrodistension for evaluation of CPP. Charts were reviewed to discern preoperative symptoms, operative findings, and postoperative diagnoses.Diagnosis of IC based on symptoms and cystoscopic findings.All 28 women had CPP, 23 (82%) had dysmenorrhea, and 12 of 25 (48%) sexually active subjects had dyspareunia. Twenty-six subjects (93%) had urinary symptoms including frequency (75%), nocturia (32%), urgency (25%), and dysuria (18%). Eleven (39%) subjects were diagnosed with IC and 18 (64%) with endometriosis, including 7 (25%) subjects with both IC and endometriosis. Laparoscopic findings were normal in 6 (21%) subjects. Of the 26 subjects with urinary symptoms, 21 (81%) had findings on laparoscopy or cystoscopy. In this cohort of young women with chronic pelvic pain, urinary frequency and dyspareunia were significantly associated with the diagnosis of IC.The results of this study suggest that interstitial cystitis is an etiology of CPP in young women. Evaluation of the bladder as an origin of pelvic pain is warranted in young women with CPP and urinary frequency or dyspareunia.
