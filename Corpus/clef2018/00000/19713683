Benefit of diagnostic laparoscopy for patients with unexplained infertility and normal hysterosalpingography findings. Patients with unexplained infertility following standard infertility screening tests usually undergo timing therapy that coordinates the time of ovulation and coitus, controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, or intrauterine insemination. If the treatment is unsuccessful, diagnostic laparoscopy is performed. However, with recent improvements in the assisted reproductive technology (ART), there has been a growing tendency that bypasses diagnostic laparoscopy and proceeds directly to ART. Therefore, the value of diagnostic laparoscopy in current fertility practice is under debate. In the present study, we evaluated the usefulness of diagnostic laparoscopy for patients with unexplained infertility and normal hysterosalpingography (HSG) findings. Between January 1997 and December 2006, 57 infertile patients with normal HSG findings underwent diagnostic laparoscopy at Kinki University Hospital. In 46 (80.7%) of these patients, diagnostic laparoscopy revealed pathologic abnormalities. Specifically, endometriosis and peritubal and/or perifimbrial adhesions were found in 36 (63.2%) and 5 (8.8%) of the patients, respectively. In 8 patients (14.0%), the management plan was switched to ART because of severe tubal diseases. Among the 57 patients, 29 pregnancies (50.9%) were achieved, including 6 ART-mediated pregnancies. We conclude that diagnostic laparoscopy is beneficial for patients with unexplained infertility and normal HSG findings. Indeed, by diagnostic laparoscopy, we are able to detect the cause(s) of infertility in the pelvic cavity and to design a suitable management plan, which could lead to postoperative pregnancy. Therefore, because of the potential diagnostic and therapeutic benefits, patients with unexplained infertility and normal HSG findings should undergo diagnostic laparoscopy prior to ART.
