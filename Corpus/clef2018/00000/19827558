Catamenial pneumothorax with breast cancer treated successfully by goserelin acetate. A 47-year-old woman with 4 episodes of right pneumothorax related to onset of menstruation was reported. A month ago, she was undergone breast conserving resection for breast cancer. She had recurrent right pneumothorax a month later and operation was performed. Thoracoscopy revealed the presence of multiple fenestrations in the right diaphragm. Thoracoscopic partial resection of the diaphragm was performed. Histopathological findings of the lesion showed spindle cells with hemosiderosis. Immunohistochemistry showed that spindle cells were estrogen receptor (ER) positive and progesterone receptor (PgR) positive, compatible with endometriosis. She was treated by tamoxifen and goserelin acetate for breast cancer and endometriosis. Two years later, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue was converted from goserelin acetate to leuprorelin acetate. She was diagnosed as having recurrence of right pneumothorax 17 months later and was treated with a chest tube. Additionally, GnRH analogue was re-converted to goserelin acetate. Since then, she has been asymptomatic free for 18 months. A catamenial pneumothorax is rare disease with difficulty of diagnosis and treatment We herein report a case of the disease that was treated successfully by goserelin acetate.
