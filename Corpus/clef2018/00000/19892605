Peritoneal vascular density assessment using narrow-band imaging and vascular analysis software, and cytokine analysis in women with and without endometriosis. The development and onset of endometriosis is associated with angiogenesis and angiogenic factors including cytokines. We analyzed intrapelvic conditions in women with endometriosis via vascular density assessment of grossly normal peritoneum and determination of cytokine levels in peritoneal fluid. Seventy-three patients underwent laparoscopic surgery because of gynecologic disease including endometriosis in our department using a narrow-band imaging system. Each patient was analyzed for peritoneal vascular density using commercially available vascular analysis software (SolemioENDO ProStudy Olympus Corp, Tokyo, Japan). Each patient was also subjected to analysis of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations in peritoneal fluid. We defined 4 groups as follows: group 1, endometriosis: gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist administration group (n=27)
