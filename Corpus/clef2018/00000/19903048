Correlation between symptoms of pain and peritoneal fluid inflammatory cytokine concentrations in endometriosis. Endometriosis affects 10-20% of women during reproductive age and is a common cause of infertility and pain leading to work absenteeism and reduced quality of life.The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the presence and concentration of interleukin-8 (IL-8), RANTES, osteoprotegerin (OPG), pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), midkine and glycodelin in the peritoneal fluid (PF) and the intensity of pain reported by patients undergoing laparoscopy in our clinic. They rated their pain during menstruation, intercourse and lower abdominal using a visual analogue scale. During laparoscopy, PF was aspirated. Pain scores were correlated to the concentration of the above substances in the PF and to the stage of endometriosis. Endometriosis was histologically confirmed in 41 of 68 participating women 27 without such evidence were considered as controls. TNF-alpha and glycodelin correlated positively with the level of menstrual pain. For IL-8, RANTES, OPG and PAPP-A no correlation between their PF concentration and the menstrual pain scores was observed. Patients with severe dysmenorrhoea had increased PF cytokine and marker levels
