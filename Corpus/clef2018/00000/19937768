Papanicolaou tests associated with cervical mucosal endometriosis: an analysis of cellular features and comparison to endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ. Endometrium directly sampled from endocervical mucosal endometriosis can mimic endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) in Papanicolaou (Pap) tests. We analyzed a series of Pap tests to investigate the cellular features of mucosal endometriosis and to assess the utility of stroma and apoptotic bodies in the differential diagnosis with AIS. Pap test samples from patients known to have endocervical mucosal endometriosis were compared with samples containing AIS. Pap tests from patients with mucosal endometriosis had lesional cells in 13 (62%) cases which includes glandular and stromal cells (10 cases), stroma only (two cases), and glandular cells only (one case). Three (23%) cases had gland-stromal aggregates. Three (23%) cases had mitotic figures and two (15%) had apoptotic bodies. By comparison, only one (8%) AIS case had endometrial-type stroma. Seven (58%) AIS cases had apoptotic bodies and three (25%) had mitotic figures. We conclude that Pap tests from patients with mucosal endometriosis usually (62%) have lesional cells. These lesional cells almost always include stroma, which is useful in the differential diagnosis with AIS. We identified stroma significantly more often in endometriosis cases (92%) than in AIS cases (8%). Pathologists should look for endometrial stroma when considering an interpretation of directly sampled endometrium. In the absence of stroma, AIS should be considered.
