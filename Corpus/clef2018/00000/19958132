Electrodermal measures of Jing-Well points and their clinical relevance in endometriosis-related chronic pelvic pain. To determine whether electrodermal measures at Jing-Well acupuncture points, "indicator" points located at the tips of fingers and toes are associated with clinical measures in adolescent women with chronic pelvic pain.The design of this study was a randomized sham-controlled trial. Analyses of electrodermal measures were based on longitudinal, multivariable analyses using generalized estimating equations.The subjects were 14 young women (ages 14-22) with laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain. Subjects were randomized to sham acupuncture or Japanese-style active acupuncture. Sixteen (16) treatments were administered over 8 weeks.Using a Hibiki-7 device, electrodermal impedance measures were obtained at all 24 Jing-Well points for each treatment visit. From these readings, measures of "imbalance" were determined by calculating statistical dispersion (statistical deviation and Gini coefficient) and level of asymmetry (left-right, top-bottom, and yin-yang). Clinical outcome measures were obtained at baseline, week 4, and week 8 and included level of pelvic pain, Endometriosis Health Profile, Pediatric Quality of Life, perceived stress, and inflammatory cytokine levels (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha).Participants designated to the acupuncture group had, on average, a substantial decrease in statistical dispersion and asymmetry of Hibiki-7 values over the course of treatment compared to the sham group. Electrodermal asymmetry variables, specifically either yin-yang or left-right measure, were significantly associated with pelvic pain, Endometriosis Health Profile, Pediatric Quality of Life, and Perceived Stress even after adjusting for treatment designation. No associations between electrodermal balance measures and inflammatory cytokines were found.Electrodermal measures may be significantly associated with clinical outcome and acupuncture treatments in adolescent women with chronic pelvic pain.
