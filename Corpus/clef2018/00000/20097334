Endometrial stromal progesterone receptor-A/progesterone receptor-B ratio: no difference between women with and without endometriosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether alterations of the P receptor-A/P receptor-B ratio could be considered an etiopathogenetic factor for endometriosis. We failed to observe statistically significant differences in both P receptor-A/P receptor-B messenger RNA and protein ratio between endometrial stromal cells derived from women with and without endometriosis.
