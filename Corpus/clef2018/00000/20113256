Matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) polymorphism is a risk factor for endometrial cancer susceptibility. The goal of our study was to evaluate the influence of genetic polymorphisms of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2, MMP-3 and MMP-7 on susceptibility to endometrial cancer.In the present study, we enrolled a total of 118 patients with endometrial cancer confirmed by histopathology, and 229 unrelated healthy individuals. Polymorphism for the MMP-2 (rs2285053), MMP-3 (rs3025058) and MMP-7 (rs11568818) genes was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction enzyme length polymorphism.The frequencies of MMP-7 -181 G/G and A/G genotypes were found to be significantly higher in cancer patients compared with healthy controls (p = 0.017). Stratification showed that individuals with MMP-7 -181 G allele were at increased risk for endometrial cancer when >50 years of age [odds ratios (OR) = 2.03 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-3.39], endometrioid (OR = 1.80This is the first report on the association of MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-7 gene polymorphisms in endometrial cancer. Our results suggest that individuals with the MMP-7 -181 G/G and A/G genotype may have an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer.
