Effect of vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-1beta on apoptosis in endometrial cell cultures from patients with endometriosis and controls. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) on apoptosis induced by leuprolide acetate (LA) in endometrial epithelial cell cultures from patients with endometriosis. Primary endometrial epithelial cell cultures were obtained from uterine endometrial biopsies of patients with endometriosis and control women. Endometrial epithelial cells were incubated with LA a combination of LA and VEGF
