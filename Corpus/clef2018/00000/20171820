Learning curve in the detection of ovarian and deep endometriosis by using Magnetic Resonance: comparison with surgical results. Determining if Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) accuracy in diagnosing endometriosis is related to radiologist's expertise.Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. This study is compliant to STARD method. Thirty patients (mean age 34 range 21-45 years) who had undergone MRI study for suspected endometriosis underwent surgery were retrospectively evaluated. MRI at 1.5T was performed with SE and TSE sequences, T1 and T2-weighted with and without fat suppression. Four localizations were analyzed: ovary, uterosacral ligaments (USL), vaginal fornix and Rectum\Sigma\Douglas (R.S.D.). One radiologist evaluated each datasetSensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the ovary at the first analysis were 88.9%, 87% and 88%, at the second 92.6%, 87% and 90% whereas at the third 92.6%, 91.3% and 92%. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the USLs at the first analysis were 62.5%, 76.9% and 70%, at the second 72%, 80.8% and 76% whereas at the third 80%, 84.6% and 82%. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the vaginal fornix at the first analysis were 63.2%, 64.5% and 64%, at the second 73.7%, 77.4% and 76% whereas at the third 73.7%, 83.9% and 80%. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the R.S.D. at the first analysis were 39.1%, 81.5% and 62%, at the second 62.5%, 85.2% and 76% whereas at the third 73.9%, 88.9% and 82%. McNemar test indicated a significant statistical difference in sensitivity in detecting nodules of endometriosis in R.S.D. between first and third analysis (p=0.0215). The mean review time decreased (p=0.0001).Accuracy of MRI in diagnosing endometriosis increased with radiologist's expertise and the improvement was statistically significant in determining RSD involvement.
