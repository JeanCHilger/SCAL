Update on the role of leukemia inhibitory factor in assisted reproduction. To review the recent literature on the involvement and importance of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in the human implantation process, and the attempts using LIF-based interventions to improve assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) outcome in women with recurrent implantation failure.High LIF expression is an indicator of receptive endometrium in fertile women. However, in infertile individuals, the data on endometrial LIF expression and secretion are controversial. Even after ruling out other causes of infertility, such as tubal, endocrine, male factor, and endometriosis, LIF-only detection is not sufficient for assessment of implantation potential in women with unexplained infertility. This is obviously in contrast to evidence of the crucial role of LIF in mouse endometrial physiology. In a large multicenter study, recombinant human LIF failed to improve the outcome of IVF treatment in women with recurrent implantation failure.A better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying endometrial receptivity and implantation should guide clinicians through proper management and treatment of infertility and implantation failure, and may eventually enable widespread adherence to single embryo transfer practices.
