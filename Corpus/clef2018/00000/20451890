Understanding cellular leiomyomas: a case-control study. Reports exist in which cellular leiomyomas (CLs) appear to have clinical characteristics or genetic profiles similar to leiomyosarcomas. This study aimed to determine whether most CLs differ clinically from typical uterine leiomyomas (ULs).A case-control study was conducted with women who underwent surgical procedures between January 1989 and December 2008 and who were diagnosed with a CL (n = 99). Control subjects, who were matched in a 2:1 ratio, were women with a diagnosis of UL (n = 198). Hospital and ambulatory records were reviewed.In multivariable logistic regression analyses, women with CLs were more likely to have surgery for the indication of enlarging leiomyoma and less likely to have concomitant endometriosis or adenomyosis. Uteri that contained CLs were also more likely to have larger and fewer leiomyomas when compared with control subjects.CLs have a distinct clinical phenotype compared with ULs and have some characteristics in common with leiomyosarcomas.
