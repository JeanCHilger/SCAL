HMGA1 and HMGA2 rearrangements in mass-forming endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disorder characterized by ectopic endometrium associated with pelvic pain and infertility. The pathogenesis of endometriosis is unclear, and several genetic, endocrine, immune, and environmental agents have been studied as putative causative factors. However, consistent somatic genetic alterations have not been identified. Rarely, endometriosis presents as a mass lesion with an infiltrative pattern reminiscent of malignancy. We describe cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic findings of mass-forming endometriosis. The index case of pulmonary endometriosis underwent conventional and molecular cytogenetics analysis. In addition, 16 cases of mass-forming endometriosis, 11 cases of usual endometriosis, and six endometriomas were investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for HMGA1 and HMGA2 loci, performed on paraffin-embedded thin tissue sections with custom-designed probes. The index patient had an endometriotic lung nodule, with a 46,XX, t(56)(q13
