Expression of PSCA, PIWIL1, and TBX2 in endometrial adenocarcinoma. Endometrial cancer is the 4th most common gynecological cancer. The expression of prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), piwi-like 1 (PIWIL1), and T-box 2 (TBX2) in endometrial cancer remains to be elucidated.The expression of PSCA, PIWIL1, and TBX2 was examined using the streptavidin-peroxidase method in 64 endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC) and paired normal endometrium (NE) samples from the Shaanxi Province in China.Positive expression rates of PSCA, PIWIL1, and TBX2 were 75% (48/64), 25% (16/64), and 56% (36/64), respectively in EACs, but 5% (3/64), 6% (4/64), and 2% (1/64), respectively in NEs. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). PSCA was positively correlated with TBX2 (p = 0.003) but not PIWIL1 (p = 0.188). PIWIL1 was positively correlated with TBX2 (p = 0.003). PSCA was positively correlated with age, tumor grade, and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.05). TBX2 had an association with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.014). PIWIL1 was not associated with clinicopathological features (p > 0.05).We report the first analysis of PSCA, PIWIL1, and TBX2 expression in EAC. Our findings suggest that PSCA and TBX2 might be candidate targets for cancer therapy, and have helped us further understand the carcinogenesis of endometrial cancer.
