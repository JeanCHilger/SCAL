Pseudo-Meigs'syndrome as a cause of exertional dyspnea: a case report. A 61-year-old otherwise healthy woman presented with gradually worsening exertional dyspnea. Routine examinations revealed bilateral pleural effusion with no other notable cardiopulmonary diseases. Systemic examinations showed ascites and a pelvic tumor, which turned out to be right ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Surgical removal and chemotherapy against the ovarian cancer resulted in disappearance of the ascites and pleural effusion, establishing a diagnosis of pseudo-Meigs'syndrome. It is common for reported cases of pseudo-Meigs' syndrome to initially present with dyspnea, therefore it is important to consider this disorder when attempting a differential diagnosis in female patients presenting with dyspnea without other noticeable conditions.
