A GOG 210 aCGH study of gain at 1q23 in endometrioid endometrial cancer in the context of racial disparity and outcome. The goal of this study was to identify recurrent regions of genomic gain or loss in endometrial cancer of the endometrioid type in the context of racial disparities in mortality for this disease. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis was performed on 80 frozen primary tumors from the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)-210 bank using the RPCI 19K BAC arrays. The 80 patients included 20 African American (AA) Stage I, 20 White (W) Stage I, 20 African American (AA) Stage IIIC/IV, and 20 White (W) Stage IIIC/IV. A separate subset of 220 endometrial cancers with outcome data was used for validation. A 1.6-Mbp region of gain at 1q23 was identified by aCGH in all AA patients and high grade W patients, but not W low grade patients. In the validation arm of 220 patients copy number gain at this region was validated using FISH and locus specific BACs. The number of AA patients in the validation arm was too small to confirm the aCGH association with racial disparity. Kaplan-Meier curves for survival showed a significant difference for gain at 1q23 versus no gain (log rank P = 0.0014). When subdivided into various groups of risk by stage and grade the survival curves showed a decreased survival for high grade and/or stage tumors, but not for low grade and/or stage endometrioid tumors. Univariate analyses for gain at 1q23 showed a significant association (P = 0.009) with survival. Multivariate analysis for gain at 1q23 did not show a significant association with survival (P = 0.14).
