Insulinlike growth factor-1Ec (MGF) expression in eutopic and ectopic endometrium: characterization of the MGF E-peptide actions in vitro. The transcription of the insulinlike growth factor 1 (igf-1) gene generates three mRNA isoforms, namely IGF-1Ea, IGF-1Eb and IGF-1Ec (or MGF [mechano growth factor]). Herein, we analyzed the expression of IGF-1 isoforms in eutopic and ectopic endometrium (red lesions and endometriotic cysts) of women with endometriosis, and we characterized the actions of a synthetic MGF E-peptide on KLE cells. Our data documented that all three igf-1 gene transcripts are expressed in the stromal cells of the eutopic and ectopic endometrium however, endometriotic cysts contained significantly lower IGF-1 isoform expression, both at the mRNA and protein level, as was shown using semiquantitative PCR and immunohistochemical methods. In addition, the glandular cells of the eutopic endometrium did not express any of the IGF-1 isoforms
