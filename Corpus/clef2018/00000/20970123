Inhibition of CD44 N- and O-linked glycosylation decreases endometrial cell lines attachment to peritoneal mesothelial cells. The attachment of endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) and endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) to peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs) with and without inhibition of N- and O-linked glycosylation, the viability of EECs and ESCs, and the expression of CD44 surface density were evaluated. Inhibition of CD44 N- and O-linked glycosylation by using tunicamycin and/or B-GalNAc statistically significantly inhibited endometrial cell attachment to peritoneal mesothelial cells, suggesting a role in establishment of early endometriotic lesions.
