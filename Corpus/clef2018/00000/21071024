Questioning patients about their adolescent history can identify markers associated with deep infiltrating endometriosis. To investigate whether the clinical history, particularly of the adolescence period, contains markers of deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE).Cross-sectional study.Universitary tertiary referral center.Two hundred twenty-nine patients operated on for endometriosis. Endometriotic lesions were histologically confirmed as non-DIE (superficial peritoneal endometriosis and/or ovarian endometriomas) (n = 131) or DIE (n = 98).Surgical excision of endometriotic lesions with pathological analysis of each specimens.Epidemiological data, pelvic pain scores, family history of endometriosis, absenteeism from school during menstruation, oral contraceptive (OC) pill use.Patients with DIE had significantly more positive family history of endometriosis (odds ratio [OR] = 3.2 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-8.8) and more absenteeism from school during menstruation (OR = 1.7The knowledge of adolescent period history can identify markers that are associated with DIE in patients undergoing surgery for endometriosis.
