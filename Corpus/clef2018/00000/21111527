The usefulness of transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy in infertile women with abnormal hysterosalpingogram results but with no obvious pelvic pathology. To evaluate the value of transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (THL) in infertile women with abnormal hysterosalpingogram results but with no history of previous pelvic surgery and with normal gynecological examination and vaginal sonography.This is a retrospective study. From January 2008 to October 2009, 51 infertile women were planned to undergo standard laparoscopy because of abnormal HSG. None of the patients had any history of previous pelvic surgery and all had normal findings on gynecological examination and vaginal sonography. These women underwent THL.Among the 51 cases, successful access to the pouch of Douglas was achieved in 49. There were two failures due to obesity, and the operation was converted to standard laparoscopy. No complication was observed in this study period. In 26 patients (53.1%) the THL procedure showed normal pelvic organs. Four patients were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 22 cases, four became pregnant (4/22, 18.2%) through intercourse or intrauterine insemination (IUI). There were some morphologic abnormalities seen in the remaining 23 patients such as adhesions, endometriosis and hydrosalpinx. Six cases with mild adhesions and endometriosis were treated with THL alone, and four (4/6, 66.7%) became pregnant with or without IUI. Among the 19 who underwent standard laparoscopy, three were lost to follow-up. In the other 16 cases, natural pregnancy occurred in six (6/16, 37.5%) patients with or without IUI.For women with abnormal HSG results but with no obvious pelvic pathology, THL should be recommended and about 50% could avoid an unnecessary laparoscopy. Adhesiolysis and coagulation of endometriotic lesions under THL in mild adhesion and endometriosis cases could lead to encouraging results.
