Matrix metalloproteinase-3 mRNA: a promising peripheral blood marker for diagnosis of endometriosis. Endometriosis is an invasive disease. Its diagnosis depends on laparoscopy, which is traumatic and associated with potential complications. The aim of this study was to develop a rapid, reliable, and less invasive diagnostic test for endometriosis. We hypothesized that genes related to cell invasion would be transcriptionally upregulated in endometriosis, and tested whether blood levels of their transcripts might be used as biomarkers of endometriosis.We used quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to quantify the mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), and MMP-9 in peripheral blood from 20 patients with mild/intermediate endometriosis, 20 patients with severe endometriosis and 20 endometriosis-free subjects.Our results indicate that circulating mRNA for MMP-3 is significantly higher in patients with endometriosis than in control patients, regardless of the degree of severity. Conversely, the level of circulating mRNA for VEGFA and MMP-9 did not distinguish patients from controls.MMP-3 mRNA is a promising peripheral blood marker that discriminates between patients with endometriosis and healthy subjects. Our results support the possibility of finding genes suitable for diagnostic qRT-PCR for endometriosis in peripheral blood and should be explored further.
