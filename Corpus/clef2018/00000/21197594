A structured questionnaire improves preoperative assessment of endometriosis patients: a retrospective analysis and prospective trial. To determine whether a structured questionnaire can improve preoperative assessment of patients with endometriosis.Hospital records for patients with endometriosis were evaluated retrospectively to determine the completeness of information. A structured electronic questionnaire was developed and used to assess preoperatively patients with suspected or proved endometriosis. Data from both assessments were compared.Data analysed retrospectively showed that there were valid answers for 89.2% of questions on a standard patient history template, but information was available for only 46.3% of parameters considered specific to endometriosis. Data from 69 patients investigated by structured electronic questionnaire gave improved rates of 90.3% for standard patient history items and 88.5% for endometriosis-specific parameters. Significant improvement in valid answers was achieved in 66.7%.A structured questionnaire improved the documentation of endometriosis-specific parameters. Further studies are needed to ensure that it enhances the effectiveness of preoperative counselling and decisions about surgery.
