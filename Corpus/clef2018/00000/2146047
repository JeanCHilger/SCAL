The effect of danazol and the LHRH agonist analogue goserelin (Zoladex) on the biological activity of luteinizing hormone in women with endometriosis. In an attempt to determine whether the suppression in oestradiol levels caused by danazol is due to an effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, we compared the endocrine effects of danazol with those of the LHRH (GnRH) agonist analogue goserelin. Serum levels of immunoreactive LH (I-LH), FSH, 17 beta-oestradiol (E2) and bioactive LH (B-LH) (using a mouse Leydig cell bioassay), were measured in ten and 20 women with endometriosis treated with danazol and goserelin, respectively. I-LH was measured both by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). During 6 months of treatment with 600 mg of danazol daily, mean serum E2 decreased (P less than 0.05) to levels near the upper limit of the post-menopausal range (to a mean (and 95% confidence interval of the mean) of 117 (65-169) pmol/l) whereas FSH, I-LH (both by RIA and IRMA) and B-LH levels were not significantly altered. During 6 months of treatment with monthly depot injections of 3.6 mg goserelin, mean serum E2 decreased (P less than 0.001) to well within the post-menopausal range (to 23 (18-28) pmol/l). The mean FSH, I-LH and B-LH levels also decreased (P less than 0.05) during therapy with goserelin (from 3.9 (3.1-4.7) to 2.0 (1.6-2.4) IU/l for FSH, from 5.3 (4.5-6.1) to 1.9 (1.7-2.1) IU/l for RIA-LH, from 2.9 (2.5-3.3) to less than 0.5 (less than 0.5) IU/l for IRMA-LH and from 9.1 (7.1-11.1) to 2.9 (2.6-3.2) IU/l for B-LH).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
