Interleukin-17F increases the secretion of interleukin-8 and the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 in endometriosis. To examine the effects of interleukin (IL)-17F on the secretion of IL-8 and the gene expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) in endometriotic stromal cells.In vitro experimental study using human samples.University hospital.Endometriotic tissues were obtained from women with ovarian endometriomas undergoing laparoscopic surgery.Endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs) were cultured with IL-17F.Concentrations of IL-8 were measured by a specific ELISA, and messenger RNA levels of IL-8 and COX2 were measured by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR).IL-17F increased the secretion of IL-8 from ESCs, and the effect was inhibited by antibodies for IL-17 receptor A and IL-17 receptor C. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) synergistically enhanced IL-17F-induced increase in IL-8 secretion from ESCs. The IL-17F increased the gene expression of IL-8 and COX2 in ESCs.These findings suggest that IL-17F may stimulate the development of endometriosis by up-regulation of IL-8 and COX2.
