Association of single nucleotide polymorphism in CYP17 and ERα genes with endometriosis risk in southern Chinese women. To investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 17 (CYP17) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα ) genes with the risk of endometriosis among southern Chinese women.Two SNPs rs743572 (CYP17 gene 34T/C) and rs9322331 (ERα gene -397T/C) were genotyped by high resolution melting curve in 432 endometriosis patients and 499 matched controls.There was no significant difference in the genotype frequencies of the two loci between endometriosis patients and the control subjects (P> 0.05). And there was no significant interaction effect of these two genes on the disease either.CYP17 gene and ERα gene may not be genetic risk factors for endometriosis among southern women in China.
