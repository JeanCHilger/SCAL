Follicular loss in endoscopic surgery for ovarian endometriosis: quantitative and qualitative observations. To identify a possible marker of follicular depletion in relation to some histologic parameters of endometriotic cysts.Prospective study.Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Operative Division of Endocrinological Gynecology.Seventy-seven patients (aged 20-40 years) with endometrioma.Patients underwent laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometriosis.After excision of the cyst wall, involuntarily removed follicles were correlated with age at surgery and with intrinsic histologic parameters of the specimen (thickness and composition of capsule size of cyst).There was a statistically significant relationship between patient age and number of follicles in the histologic section, a statistically significant inverse relationship between size of cyst and number of follicles, and no significant correlation between thickness of the capsule and number of follicles. Fibroblastic-type capsule, most frequently found in younger patients, was associated with removal of a significantly higher number of follicles.Our study suggests that patient age and cyst dimension are related to the histologic composition of the capsule, which is a marker of the aggressiveness of the cyst itself.
