Stage IA ovarian cancers: comparison of sonographic findings and histopathologic types between patients with normal and elevated serum cancer antigen 125 levels. The purpose of this study was to compare sonographic findings and histopathologic types of stage IA ovarian cancers between groups with normal and elevated cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) levels.Between 2000 and 2009, 146 stage IA ovarian cancers were treated surgically (85 invasive and 61 borderline, 73 self-referred with tumor-related symptoms, 20 self-referred with nonspecific symptoms, 52 identified through screening, and 1 other). Of these, 87 cases (60%) had normal serum CA-125 levels (<35 U/mL). Their pre-operative sonographic findings and histopathologic types were compared to those of cases with elevated CA-125 levels.Statistically significant differences were found between the proportions of patients with elevated CA-125 levels in groups having tumors with maximal diameters of less than 20 cm and at least 20 cm (P = .03) and groups having tumors with less than 50% and 50% to 80% solid components (P = .02). In the group with normal CA-125 levels, we found predominantly mucinous adenocarcinoma in multilocular cysts with less than 50% solid components (25 cases), and clear cell adenocarcinoma in unilocular cysts with less than 50% solid components (12 cases), whereas in the group with elevated CA-125 levels, mucinous adenocarcinoma in multilocular cysts with less than 50% solid components (19 cases) and endometrioid adenocarcinoma in solid tumors (â‰¥80% solid components) were predominant (5 cases).Stage IA ovarian cancers with normal CA-125 levels tend to be smaller, have less solid components, and have a slightly different distribution of histopathologic types than cancers with elevated CA-125 levels.
