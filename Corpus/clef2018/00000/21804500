Laparoscopic findings of subfertile female patients in a tertiary hospital. Sub-fertility affects approximately 15% of couples. Approximately 40% of cases involve a male factor, 40% involve a female factor and the remainder involves both sexes. The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common causes of sub-fertility due to anovulation in women. Treatment of sub-fertility in female partners mainly depends on the laparoscopic findings of patients with PCOS, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), endometriosis and fibroid uterus. Between February 2007 and April 2009, 73 subfertile women with PCOS were evaluated on their laparoscopic findings in a tertiary hospital in Dhaka city. Mean±SD age was 28.55±3.98 years and primary sub-fertility was 68.5% vs. secondary 31.5% (p<0.01). In most cases, uterine size and position was normal (91.8%, p<0.001 and 89%, p<0.001) and 78.1% mobile. In most of the cases pouch of douglas was normal (78.1%, p<0.001) and adhesion absent (72.6%, p<0.001). In majority of the cases both right and left fallopian tubes were patent (80.8% vs. 75.3%) and ovary healthy (65.8% vs. 64.4%). Positive dye test of right and left fallopian tubes was significantly high (p<0.001). Careful evaluation of laparoscopic findings, are likely to help appropriate treatment modalities for desired outcome.
