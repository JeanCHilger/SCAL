Correlation of angiogenic cytokines-leptin and IL-8 in stage, type and presentation of endometriosis. Pelvic endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease with an immunological background. Yet there is paucity of contemporary research exploring both the angiogenic cytokines, leptin and IL-8 for a possible role in its pathophysiology.To compare levels of both leptin and IL-8 in peritoneal fluid (PF) in women with endometriosis vs. fertile controls and correlate with disease stage, type and symptoms.PF from 58 women with endometriosis and 28 women undergoing tubal ligation was collected at laparoscopy and leptin and IL-8 levels were measured using ELISA. Results showed significantly higher levels of both cytokines in women with endometriosis. Significantly higher leptin and IL-8 levels were demonstrated in patients with early peritoneal (ASRM stage I and II) and advancing disease (ASRM stage III and IV), respectively. Levels of leptin/IL-8 were significantly lower in patients with endometrioma (4.8 ng/mL/32 pg/mL) vs. implants (13.0 ng/mL/68 pg/mL). There was no correlation of infertility or chronic pelvic pain with these levels.Both leptin and IL-8 levels are raised in PF of women with endometriosis reflecting inflammation and dysregulated immunomodulation. Higher levels of leptin were seen in early stages IL-8 seems to stimulate the disease in a dose-dependent manner.
