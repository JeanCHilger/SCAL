Increased asymmetric dimethylarginine and enhanced inflammation are associated with impaired vascular reactivity in women with endometriosis. Enhanced inflammatory responses which may inhibit vascular reactivity, are associated with endometriosis development. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an inhibitor of endogenous nitric oxide synthase, is also implicated in endothelial dysfunction. We aimed to determine whether plasma ADMA and systemic inflammation are associated with endothelial function in women with endometriosis.We evaluated 41 women with and 28 women without endometriosis. Plasma levels of lipids and inflammatory markers such as high sensitive-C reactive protein (hs-CRP), serum amyloid protein A (SAA), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured in the two groups. We also measured levels of ADMA and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA). High-resolution ultrasonography measured flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) to assess vasodilatory responses.FMD was significantly lower in women with endometriosis compared to those without endometriosis (8.39 ± 0.43% vs 10.79 ± 0.54%, P = 0.001). While plasma lipid levels did not differ significantly between groups, levels of AMDA, but not SDMA, were significantly higher in women with endometriosis (409.7 ± 10.1 pmol/L vs 383.0 ± 48.3 pmol/L, P = 0.04). Inflammatory markers were also significantly higher in these women (hs-CRP: 1053.3 ± 252.0 ng/mL vs 272.0 ± 83.3 ng/mL, P = 0.02 SAA: 8.00 ± 1.53 μg/mL vs 3.82 ± 0.42 μg/mL, P = 0.04Increased plasma ADMA levels and enhanced inflammation are associated with inhibited endothelial function in women with endometriosis.
