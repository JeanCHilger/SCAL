An atypical echographic aspect of endometriotic cysts. Description of a case. The paper reports an atypical ecographic pattern of endometriosic cysts. The large biometry and the presence of a septum which was more than 1 cm thick prevented the diagnosis of this ovarian pathology. The Authors agree that in similar cases it is important to limit the report to a mere description since it is impossible to identify the histological character of the ovarian mass.
