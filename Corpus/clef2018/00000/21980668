Diagnosis and treatment of deep infiltrating endometriosis with bowel involvement: a case report. Deep infiltrating endometriosis is a form of endometriosis penetrating deeply under the peritoneal surface causing pain and infertility. Assessment of the pelvis by laparoscopy and histological confirmation of the disease is considered the golden standard of diagnosis.We are presenting a patient diagnosed with deep infiltrating endometriosis by transvaginal ultrasound and treated with minimally invasive radical surgery including segmental resection of the bowel.Transvaginal sonography has an important role in detecting deep endometriosis of the pelvis. Fertility sparing surgery is the treatment of choice in symptomatic women wishing to retain fertility, since drugs used for endometriosis interfere with ovulation.The success of the surgery depends on the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis. A multidisciplinary approach in managing deep endometriosis is mandatory in order to offer patients the best possible treatment using the combined skills of the colorectal and gynaecologic surgical teams. The presented case exhibits the feasibility of laparoscopic approach to severe pelvic endometriosis with bowel involvement.
