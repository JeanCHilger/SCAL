Smear cytology findings of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the uterine cervix is a rare tumor. Moreover, there are only three reports to date that have focused on the cytologic findings of cervical LCNEC. We report the case of a 59-year-old Japanese woman with cervical LCNEC combined with small cell carcinoma (SmCC). Cytologic specimens from the uterine cervix demonstrated large cells with coarse chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Frequent mitotic figures were also observed. Curettage of the uterine endometrium revealed an endometrioid adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation i.e., an adenoacanthoma. Histologic examination of surgically resected uterine cervical tissue revealed LCNEC with minor foci of SmCC. Neuroendocrine differentiation in LCNEC was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for synaptophysin and CD56. Cytotechnologists or pathologists need to consider a differential diagnosis of LCNEC while examining cervical cytologic specimens
