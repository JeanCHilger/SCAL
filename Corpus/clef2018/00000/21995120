Current treatment of endometriosis. Early diagnosis of endometriosis is important for proper planning of the treatment. First-line treatment of moderate endometriosis is hormonal drug therapy, which should be long-standing. Surgery is needed, if pain symptoms cannot be controlled with medication. For patients with severe endometriosis, surgical treatment is often the first-line therapy. Complete elimination of the foci of endometriosis is attempted already at the first time. More than half of endometriosis patients will get pregnant and give birth to a child either naturally or via infertility treatments.
