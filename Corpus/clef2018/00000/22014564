Intestinal endometriosis. Endometriosis affects 6 to 10 % of all women of childbearing age. Intestinal involvement is defined by muscularis infiltration and has been estimated to occur in 8 % to 12 % of women with endometriosis. The most common sites are rectum, sigmoid and ileocaecal junction. In most cases, intestinal endometriosis is associated with deep infiltrating endometriosis, multifocal and aggressive form of endometriosis, responsible for refractory pelvic pain and infertility. The symptoms are nonspecific but are characterized by cyclic exacerbation of pain. The preoperative work-up includes a rectal endoscopic ultrasonography, a transvaginal ultrasonography, a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging and a multidetector CT scan. There is currently no cure other than surgical removal of lesions. Medical treatments are based on a hormone used to block ovarian function.
