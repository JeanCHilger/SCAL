The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) polymorphisms and the risk of endometriosis in northern Iran. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to be a key molecule in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. In this study, we evaluated whether two polymorphisms -460T>C and +405G>C in VEGF are related with the susceptibility to endometriosis in northern Iran. Genomic DNA derived from patients with endometriosis and healthy women were analysed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The total number of 1080 subjects (480 patients with endometriosis and 600 normal controls) was enrolled into the study. We used the Chi-square (Ï‡(2)) test to evaluate each allele and genotype frequency of -460T>C and +405G>C polymorphisms among the cases and controls. The associations between the polymorphisms and the risk of endometriosis were estimated by odds ratio and their 95% confidence intervals. There was no significant differences in the VEGF -460T>C genotypes and allele frequencies between control women and endometriosis patients (P = 0.63). In contrast, an increased frequency of the +405CC genotype was observed in the patients with endometriosis as compared with the controls. The +405C allele was associated with the presence of endometriosis. It is concluded that the +405G>C polymorphism in VEGF may be associated with higher risk of endometriosis in northern Iran.
