Expression and possible role of interleukin-10 receptors in patients with adenomyosis. To investigate the expression and potential roles of interleukin-10 receptor 1 (IL-10R1) and interleukin-10 receptor 2 (IL-10R2) in adenomyosis.This prospective study examined 33 women with histologically proven adenomyosis and 21 women without adenomyosis who had undergone hysterectomy for non-endometrial pathology. Comparative immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression and localization of IL-10R1 and IL-10R2. Tissue sections were immunostained with goat anti-human interleukin-10 receptor alpha and rabbit anti-human interleukin-10 receptor beta antibodies. The presence and localization of IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 were evaluated microscopically throughout the menstrual cycle in eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues of women with adenomyosis, and the results were compared with those for normal endometrium.IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 were mainly expressed by epithelial cells in both women with adenomyosis and controls. Epithelial expression of IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 was higher in adenomyotic samples than in eutopic endometrium of women with adenomyosis or normal endometrium. Moreover, epithelial expression of IL-10R1 was higher in eutopic endometrium of women with adenomyosis than in normal endometrium. Epithelial expression of IL-10R1 showed cyclic variation in eutopic endometrium of women with adenomyosis and normal endometrium, with elevated expression in secretory-phase tissues compared with proliferative-phase tissues.Intrinsic abnormalities concerning IL-10 and IL-10 receptors may be present in eutopic and ectopic endometria of women with adenomyosis. These findings suggest that IL-10 receptors may be involved in the immunotolerant and/or anti-inflammatory process of adenomyosis.
