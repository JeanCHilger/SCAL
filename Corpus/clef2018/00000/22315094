Microparticles from ovarian carcinomas are shed into ascites and promote cell migration. Microparticles are cellular-derived vesicles (0.5-1.0 μm) composed of cell membrane components, which are actively shed from the surface of various cells, including epithelial cells. We compared microparticles in ascites between women with ovarian carcinoma and women with benign ovarian pathology, and isolated tumor-derived (epithelial cell adhesion molecule [EpCAM]-positive) microparticles for functional analysis and proteomics.Cases included 8 patients with benign ovarian neoplasms and 41 with ovarian carcinoma. Ascites from a high-grade stage III serous carcinoma was used for functional and proteomic analysis. Cancer cells were isolated using EpCAM-coated beads, microparticles were isolated by ultracentrifugation/flow cytometry, and sorting was achieved using markers (eg, EpCAM). Binding and migrations assays were performed with 3 ovarian cancer cell lines. Proteomic analysis of EpCAM-positive microparticles and ascites cancer cells was performed by mass spectrometry.Microparticles in benign pelvic fluid were similar to early and advanced-stage ascites (2.4 vs 2.8 vs 2.0 × 10⁶ microparticles/mL). Advanced stage had a greater proportion of EpCAM-positive microparticles than early or benign disease (13.3% vs 2.5% vs 2.1% P = 0.001), and serous histology had more than endometrioid (13.2% vs 1.8%Ascites from advanced-stage and serous ovarian carcinomas contain large numbers of tumor-derived microparticles. In vitro, these microparticles bind to cancer cells and stimulate migration. Tumor-derived microparticles in ascites could mediate the predilection for peritoneal spread in serous ovarian carcinomas.
