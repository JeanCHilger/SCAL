T2* relaxometry mapping of the uterine zones. Previous literature demonstrated that the T2* value of the uterine junctional zone was lower than that of peripheral myometrium by using BOLD MR imaging. We expect T2* mapping image may add more information to T2-weighted images of the uterine myometrium.To evaluate whether T2* mapping software would reproduce the result of previous report, and to apply the software to benign uterine diseases.Five healthy volunteers and 19 patients clinically suspected of having benign pelvic disease were imaged using a 1.5T MR system. All women were of reproductive age, and all provided informed consent. Sagittal T2* images using a multishot EPI sequence were obtained. T2* values were calculated and color T2* maps reconstructed using a T2* fitting tool.The uterine zones could be identified in all 24 examinations on the T2* maps. In addition, a thin "4th zone" was seen between the endometrium and the JZ (junctional zone) in 19 of 24 examinations. The T2* value of JZ was significantly lower than that of peripheral myometrium (PM) (P < 0.001). No significant difference in the T2* value of the JZ or of PM was noted between normal uterus and uterus with leiomyomas and/or adenomyosis.A quantitative T2* map can easily be obtained using the PRIDE software T2* fitting tool, and the software reproduces the result from previous report. T2* value of the junctional zone was lower than that of peripheral myometrium regardless of having benign myometrial diseases.
