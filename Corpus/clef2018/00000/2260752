Immunological studies of peripheral blood in patients with external genital endometriosis and infertility. Immunoregulatory lymphocytes of SD2-, SD4-, SD8- and SD2-phenotypes have been assayed using monoclonal antibodies in peripheral blood of infertile women with external genital endometriosis and tubal-peritoneal infertility. The tested cells did not markedly differ from those in control fertile patients. Serum concentrations of immunoglobulin M were increased in women with endometriosis. Immunoglobulin concentrations widely varied in the peritoneal fluid, with a statistically significant elevation of IgA and IgM in women with tubal-peritoneal infertility.
