Ovarian pregnancy resulting from cryopreserved blastocyst transfer. Ovarian pregnancy very rarely occurs and its exact mechanism is unclear. Here, we report a case of ovarian pregnancy resulting from cryopreserved blastocyst transfer. The patient was a 34-year-old woman who had undergone bilateral ovarian cystectomy for endometriosis. Both fallopian tubes indicated normal findings on laparoscopic surgery, and we removed the gestational product of the right ovary. Pathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of right ovarian pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is one of the major complications of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer. Although ovarian pregnancy is an extremely rare occurrence, the possibility of developing this event after cryopreserved blastocyst transfer should be recognized.
