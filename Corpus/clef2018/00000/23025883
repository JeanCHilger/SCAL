Interleukin-19 and interleukin-22 serum levels are decreased in patients with ovarian endometrioma. To determine the serum levels of interleukin (IL)-10 family ILs in women with ovarian endometriosis and investigate the correlation of these levels with disease activity.A case-control laboratory study.Tertiary-care university hospital.Two hundred nineteen women, with (n = 112) and without (n = 107) endometriosis.Complete surgical excision with pathological analysis.Blood samples were obtained during surgical procedures. IL-10, -19, -20, and -22 were assayed by ELISA in sera, and the concentrations correlated with the extent and the severity of the disease.IL-19 was detectable in 18.3% and IL-22 in 47.9% of sera samples from all 219 women studied. Serum IL-19 was lower in women with endometriosis (median, 292.7 pg/mL range, 32.2-1,339.3) than in endometriosis-free women (median, 1,035.8 pg/mLSerum IL-19 and IL-22 are decreased in women with ovarian endometrioma. IL-10 family ILs may be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
