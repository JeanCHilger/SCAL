Endometriosis: the gynecologist's opinion. Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. Endometriosis affects 7-10% of women of reproductive age, 60% of women with pelvic pain, and up to 50% of women with infertility. Etiology and pathogenesis of the disease are still unclear, with the theory of retrograde menstruation, and possibly associated cofactors, as the most important. The definitive method to diagnose endometriosis is visualization at surgery, preferably at laparoscopy, with histology confirmation of disease. The revised classification of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine is used to stage the disease and determine the patient's prognosis. The treatment of the disease depends on the patient's age, associated symptoms, and disease stage. Medical or surgical therapy may be used in case of pain associated with endometriosis, whereas surgery is the mainstay of treatment in case of endometriosis-associated infertility.
