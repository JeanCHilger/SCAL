ARID1A loss is prevalent in endometrial hyperplasia with atypia and low-grade endometrioid carcinomas. ARID1A (AT-rich interactive domain 1A) has recently been identified as a tumor suppressor gene in various, predominantly gynecological cancers. We wanted to investigate the distribution of ARID1A in endometrial hyperplasia, carcinomas and metastatic lesions to elucidate the timing of expression loss of its protein ARID1A in the course of endometrial cancer carcinogenesis. In addition, we wanted to assess the relationship between the loss of ARID1A and clinicopathological variables in endometrial cancer in general and the endometrioid subtype in particular. We analyzed a prospectively collected series of 535 primary endometrial cancers, 77 metastatic lesions, as well as 38 retrospectively collected endometrial hyperplasias with evaluable immunohistochemical staining for ARID1A. Fresh frozen tissue was available for mRNA microarray analysis in 122 primary tumors in parallel. Loss of ARID1A protein expression was noted in none of the hyperplasias without atypia, 16% of hyperplasias with atypia, 19% of primary endometrioid tumors and 28% of metastatic lesions. Loss of ARID1A in primary tumor was significantly associated with endometrioid grade 1 or 2 and clear-cell histology, diploid tumor cells, younger patient age and deeper myometrial infiltration, but not survival. ARID1A RNA expression was significantly correlated with ARID1A protein loss. Thus, loss of ARID1A appears to be an early event in the carcinogenesis of endometrioid uterine carcinomas and the association with deep myometrial infiltration may suggest an importance for invasiveness.
