Tumor-associated macrophages correlate with progesterone receptor loss in endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma. It has been well established that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a tumor promoting role in endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EEC). But the association with TAMs and sex hormone receptor expression, and progression of precancerous endometrial lesions in EEC has been little reported.We used immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of CD68, CD34, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) in 95 cases of EEC, as well as 35 cases of endometrial hyperplasia (including 15 atypical hyperplasia, 10 complex hyperplasia and 10 simple hyperplasia). We also correlated TAMs count with various clinicopathological factors, sex hormone receptor, and prognostic value in patients with EEC.We identified that TAMs count increased linearly with disease progression (mean count per case at Ã— 200 magnification: simple hyperplasia, 6.30 complex hyperplasia, 11.20TAMs are potentially related to PR loss and progression of precancerous endometrial lesions in EEC.
