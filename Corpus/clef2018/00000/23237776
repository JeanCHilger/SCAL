Association between interleukin-10 promoter polymorphisms and endometriosis: a meta-analysis. To investigate the influence of the interleukin-10 gene promoter polymorphisms on the susceptibility of endometriosis, we examined the association by performing a meta-analysis. The PubMed, Embase, HuGE Navigator and CNKI were searched to identify eligible studies. We then conducted a meta-analysis to examine the association between interleukin-10 gene promoter polymorphisms and endometriosis. Eight case-control studies which examined the association between the IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms and the susceptibility to endometriosis were finally included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of the IL-10 -592 A/C polymorphisms showed a significant increased risk of endometriosis in the overall and Asian population in all genetic models and allele contrast. However, meta-analysis of the IL-10 -1082 A/G and IL-10 -819 T/C polymorphisms showed no association with endometriosis in all genetic models and allele contrast in the overall and Asian population samples. In addition, there was not a significant association between the IL-10 -592 A/C gene promoter polymorphisms with the severity of endometriosis. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that the IL-10 -592 A/C polymorphisms conferred susceptibility to endometriosis. However, no associations were found between the IL-10 -1082 A/G and -819 T/C polymorphisms and susceptibility to endometriosis. Further studies are required to elucidate these associations more clearly.
