Early stage epithelial ovarian cancers: a study of morphologic prognostic factors. We intended to reevaluate the morphologic prognostic factors for early-stage ovarian carcinomas. We reviewed 111 patients diagnosed with early-stage ovarian cancer who had undergone primary surgery at Hacettepe Hospital between 1984 and 2001, using diagnostic criteria from the WHO-2003 classification. We applied the Universal grading system suggested by Shimizu/Silverberg and noted FIGO-stage, histotype, tumor size, bilaterality, and endometriosis. These features were compared with each other and survival. The survival analysis was carried out by Kaplan-Meier curves. Of the cases, 52 were reclassified as 'borderline tumor' or 'cystadenoma with borderline foci' and 59 as 'invasive carcinoma'. FIGO-stage and mitotic count were significant for survivals of 59 patients with cancer. Mitotic index was also significant for the probability of metastasis. The patients with stage-II cancer had 5.65 times more risk of recurrence than stage-I cancer. The 5-year overall and disease-free survivals rates were 90.6% and 87.5% for stage-I, 54.7% and 39.3% for stage-II, respectively. Universal grade did not reach statistical significance for survivals but it was related to FIGO-stage significantly. In conclusion, FIGO-stage is the most reliable prognosticator. Although prognostic value of universal grade is not significant, mitotic count may provide important prognostic information for early-stage ovarian carcinomas.
