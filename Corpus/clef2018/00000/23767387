It affects 5-15% of females during their reproductive years. Thoracic endometriosis syndrome is characterized by the presence of functional endometrial tissue within the pleura, the lung parenchyma or the airway. The overall prevalence of this condition is unknown due to a lack of epidemiological studies, variety of symptoms, signs and locations.
