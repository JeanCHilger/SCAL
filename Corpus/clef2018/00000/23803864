Deep endometriosis of the colon. The article presents a case of deep intestinal endometriosis in a 27-year-old woman who complained of dysmenorrhea and infertility. The diagnostic process included ultrasonography as well as colonoscopy, barium enema and CT imaging. Because of the presence of two distant changes which involved nearly the full thickness of the rectal wall and the major part of its circumference, the decision to perform an anterior rectal resection with a simultaneous retroperitoneal colorectostomy was made. The Knight technique was implemented. The surgery involved the anterior rectal resection, the transverse rectal stump closure by use of a stapling device (TA50), and the creation of colorectal circular anastomosis with the CEEA 31 stapler.
