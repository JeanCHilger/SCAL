Expression of hPEBP4 negatively correlates with estrogen and progesterone receptors in endometrial carcinoma. To investigate the expression of human phosphatidylethanolamine- binding protein 4 (hPEBP4) in endometrial carcinoma and its relation with progesterone receptor (PR) and estrogen receptor (ER).Forty-five samples of endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC), 12 samples of atypical endometrial hyperplasia, and 30 samples of normal endometrium were examined. Samples were studied by immunohistochemistry for PR, ER and hPEBP4 expression. Expressions were statistically quantified and analyzed.Expressions of PR and ER were significantly higher in normal endometrium than in cancer. Expression of hPEBP4 was significantly lower in normal endometrium. The expression of hPEBP4 was significantly higher in advanced-stage endometrial cancer, whilst higher but insignificant trend was noticed in higher grade carcinoma. Statistically insignificant trend of negative ER and PR expression with higher grade or stage was noticed. The expression of hPEBP4 was negatively correlated to ER and PR in EEC.The expression pattern of hPEBP4 indicated that hPEBP4 interacted with ER and PR in EEC and could thus become a possible target for the development of novel treatment against this malignancy.
