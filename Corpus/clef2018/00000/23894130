Understanding the pathogenesis of endometriosis through proteomics: recent advances and future prospects. Endometriosis is a complex gynecological disease, characterized by the presence and growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, resulting in pelvic pain and infertility. It occurs in 10% of women in their reproductive age. The viable endometrial cells enter the peritoneal cavity by retrograde menstruation, implant, and cause lesions ectopically depending on their ability to survive, attach, grow, and invade. These "normal" endometrial cells turn "endometriotic" apparently because of inherent abnormalities present in them. Information on these molecular abnormalities is now being sought through proteomic approaches. Recent proteome-based comparisons between the eutopic endometrium from normal women and patients with endometriosis have revealed several proteins (many of which are shown to have a role in several cancers), of which a few have been validated as potential players in the etiology of endometriosis. After an initial in-flow of information from these proteome studies of eutopic endometrium, focus now needs to be expanded to the changes in the various protein PTMs and their upstream effectors present in these tissues. Early diagnosis of endometriosis through noninvasive means is the need of the hour as well-which would require the use of the presently existing immunoassays, along with the advancing MS-based proteomics. In this review, we aim to discuss these future thrust areas of human endometriosis proteomics and also present the proteomic advances made so far in understanding the molecular basis of endometriosis.
