The analysis of the human plasma N-glycome in endometriosis patients. Analysis of the plasma N-glycome in endometriosis patients compared with controls.In a case-control study, blood samples were collected from patients who underwent either diagnostic or operative laparoscopy between 2008 and 2011 in the Semmelweis University, Budapest, I. Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. From these patients, 92 with endometriosis (30 stage I-II and 62 stage III-IV, including altogether 18 deep infiltrating cases) and 62 controls were selected for glycan analysis. After release, plasma N-glycans were subjected to hydrophilic interaction high performance liquid chromatography, which resulted in 19 chromatographic glycan peaks (GP). The abundances of the GPs were compared between the study groups. For statistical analysis a non-parametric test, the Mann-Whitney-U test, was used.We found a statistically significant decrease of GP1 and increase of GP14, GP17 and GP18 in endometriosis patients. The latter peaks consist of glycans which play a role in inflammatory processes and malignancy. We also found significant differences in GP2, GP4, GP6, and GP9 between controls and the different endometriosis stage groups. The observed alterations in GP2, GP4 and GP6 may be related to altered glycosylation and remodelling of the glycan branches of the IgG molecule. The alterations of GP9 are presumably associated with changes of transferrin glycosylation. Furthermore we detected a highly significant decrease of GP1 in patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis compared with controls.This is the first analysis of the plasma N-glycome in endometriosis. The observed changes in GP14, GP17 and GP18 and in GP2, GP4, GP6 and GP9 provide new aspects to the pathophysiology of the disease and the alterations of the GP1 may serve as a new potential marker in the future.
