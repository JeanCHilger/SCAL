Tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 gene polymorphisms and endometriosis risk in Asians: a systematic review and meta-analysis. A relationship between endometriosis and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene polymorphisms has been raised for Asians. However, this topic is controversial. This study was a meta-analysis to explore whether TNF-α/IL-6 gene polymorphisms were associated with a risk of endometriosis in Asians. By searching PubMed, HuGENet, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases, 17 studies were identified and included (3372 cases and 4008 controls). The odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the association between TNF-α/IL-6 gene polymorphisms and endometriosis risk. An association of TNF-α gene -1031T/C polymorphism with endometriosis was found (TT + TC vs. CC: OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30-0.82, I(2) = 37.1%, P = 0.20 TT vs. CC: OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30-0.82, I(2) = 43.0%, P = 0.173
