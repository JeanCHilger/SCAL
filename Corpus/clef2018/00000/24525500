Primary endometrioid stromal sarcoma of the ovary: a clinicopathologic study of 27 cases with morphologic and behavioral features similar to those of uterine low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. Twenty-seven endometrioid stromal sarcomas of the ovary from patients 38 to 76 (mean 56) years of age are reported. The tumors were unilateral in 20 cases and bilateral in 7. They were solid (9), solid and cystic (9), or predominantly cystic (6) when this information was known and ranged from 1 to 20 (mean 9.5) cm. The solid areas typically had a tan-yellow cut surface, with areas of hemorrhage and/or necrosis noted in 6 however, in addition, blood was often present in the cyst lumens. On microscopic examination, the predominant and frequently exclusive pattern was a diffuse growth of small cells with interspersed arterioles, the latter appearing round to elongated. A fibromatous pattern was present in 14 of the tumors but was extensive in only 3. A vague nodular growth was observed in 10 tumors but was never striking
