Serum and peritoneal lavage fluid CA-125 levels in endometriosis. Serum and peritoneal lavage fluid CA-125 levels were assayed in 20 women with endometriosis and 20 control women at the time of laparoscopy. Serum levels of CA-125 were significantly higher in women with endometriosis. Peritoneal lavage fluid CA-125 levels were significantly higher than serum levels but showed no significant difference between control and endometriosis patients. Peritoneal lavage fluid CA-125 did not follow expected dilution curves when attempts were made to validate the assay. Serum CA-125 levels were a more sensitive indicator of endometriosis, than peritoneal lavage fluid CA-125 levels.
