Membrane expression of trail receptors DcR1 and DcR2 in the normal endometrium, endometrial atypical hyperplasia and endometrioid endometrial cancer. We aimed to evaluate the membrane expression of DcR1 and DcR2 in the normal endometrium (NE), endometrial atypical hyperplasia (EAH) and endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC). The study comprised 101 patients: 20 NE, 14 EAH and 67 EEC. Membrane expression of DcR1 and DcR2 was examined and presented as total score (TS). The membrane expression of both DcR1 and DcR2 was more common in EEC than in NE (p < 0.001 p < 0.001). A strong correlation was found between type of endometrial tissue (NE/EAH/EEC) and the TS of DcR1 (p = 0.001) and DcR2 (p < 0.001). In EEC, the TS of DcR1 and DcR2 was not related to grading and survival. The TS of DcR1 negatively correlated with staging (p = 0.018), but DcR2 did not. The membrane expression of decoy receptors for TRAIL DcR1 and DcR2 is greater in NE than EEC. In EEC patients, membrane expression of DcR1 and DcR2 are not independent predictors of survival.
