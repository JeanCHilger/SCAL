Effects of laparoscopic ovarian endometriosis cystectomy combined with postoperative GnRH-a therapy on ovarian reserve, pregnancy, and outcome recurrence. The aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of laparoscopic ovarian endometriosis cystectomy combined with postoperative GnRH-a therapy on ovarian reserve, pregnancy outcome and recurrence.This was a prospective control study. The experimental group: 63 patients with combinations of laparoscopic bilateral ovarian endometrial cystectomies and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) treatment for three months.62 patients with laparoscopic bilateral ovarian endometrial cystectomies. Benchmarks: the changes of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and FSH/luteinizing hormone (LH), etradiol (E2) in preoperative and postoperative three months or menstrual two to three days, menstrual two to three days after surgery, natural pregnancy, and cyst recurrence in 18th month during postoperative follow-up.In experimental group after six months, the percentage of returned FSH accounted for 95.3% of normal range, in the control group it was 82.2%, and the difference was significant (p < 0.05). The natural pregnancy rate of preoperative infertility patients (57.1%) was higher than the control (36.8%) (p < 0.05). The recurrence rate of preoperative infertility patients (12.7%) was lower than the control (27.4%) (p < 0.05).After bilateral laparoscopic ovarian endometrial cystectomy, an implement of GnRH-a therapy can improve the postoperative pregnancy rate, which changes with clinical stage and patient age, reduces ovarian recurrence, and its influence on ovarian reserve is lesser.
