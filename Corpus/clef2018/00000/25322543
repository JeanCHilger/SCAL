Endometriosis causing intussusception of the ileum into the colon. Intussusception of the caecum occurs about twenty times less frequently in adults as compared to children and in 90% of these cases is caused by intestinal tumors. Intussusception of the ileum usually causes intestinal obstruction which requires urgent surgical intervention. So far only a few cases of intussusception due to the presence of endometrial tumor have been described. The clinical course, imaging and laboratory tests are not specific for endometriosis. The macroscopic appearance of the tumor during laparotomy is also not diagnostic. In case of endometriosis, the diagnosis can only be made on the basis of the histopathological examination of the excised tumor In this report, we present the diagnostic process and treatment of a patient with intussusception of the ileum to the ascending and transverse colon due to cecal tumor During the operation, the surgeon suspected a cancerous tumor and performed a right hemicolectomy The final diagnosis of endometriosis was made on the basis of the histopathological analysis.
