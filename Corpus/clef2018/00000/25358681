Expression of PTEN in endometrial liquid-based cytology. Endometrial cytology offers a reliable alternative to biopsy in endometrial cancer detection and it may be useful in obtaining material to study prognostic and predictive markers. Over the years, new sampling devices have been developed. Molecular alterations in endometrial cancers were previously described using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues with particular attention, in endometrioid carcinomas, to the PTEN-PI3K pathway. PTEN evaluation could be useful in endometrial carcinomas for selecting patients for target therapies.We studied 51 endometrial samples collected using the Endogyn device and 71 obtained with the Endoflower dispositive device, and processed using liquid-based cytology. Most of the cases were matched with a corresponding histological biopsy. The overall accuracy of Endoflower was 100%. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) for PTEN were performed using monoclonal antibody 6H2.1 from DAKO.The IHC showed PTEN-null glands in 4 cases. The same cancers were negative in ICC. Among the 10 carcinomas on cytology, PTEN-null glands were found in 1 case. All the normal endometrium control cases were positive in cytology and histology.Our results suggest that endometrial devices provide useful material for the diagnosis and evaluation of PTEN expression.
