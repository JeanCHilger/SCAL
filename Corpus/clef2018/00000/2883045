Laparoscopic evaluation of the tuboperitoneal factor in infertile Nigerian women. Laparoscopy has become the most important investigative tool for the evaluation of tubal disease in developed countries of the world. In this report of 218 diagnostic laparoscopies performed on infertile Nigerian women, bilateral tubal occlusion was found in 35.3% and unilateral occlusion in 9.6%. Pelvic adhesions were present in 55.0% out of which 25.2% and 21.1% were moderate or severe, respectively. Endometriosis and uterine fibroids were present in 1.4% and 26.6% of patients, respectively. The implications of these findings for management of tubal disease in Nigerian women is discussed.Laparoscopy has become the most important investigative tool for the evaluation of tubal disease in developed countries of the world.

Some of the worst results of tubal surgery come from Africa where, ironically, the prevalence of tubal disease is highest.  Patients with gross tubal disease and/or widespread pelvic adhesions should be listed for in-vitro fertilization programs which are currently providing reasonable satisfactory results in the developed countries of the world.  Health programs in the African continent must incorporate preventive measures for pelvic inflammatory disease complicating a variety of sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy termination in order to reduce the presently high prevalence of tubal infertility.
