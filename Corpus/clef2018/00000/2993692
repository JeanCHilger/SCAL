Studies on CA 125, CA 19-9, TPA and IAP as tumor markers in patients with ovarian cancer. CA 125, CA 19-9, TPA and IAP were useful for diagnosis of ovarian cancer. CA 125 was localized immunohistochemically in the surface and cytoplasma of cancer cells of serous cystadenocarcinomas, clear cell carcinomas, endometrioid carcinomas and undifferentiated carcinomas and CA 19-9 localized in mucinous cystadenocarcinomas and endometrioid carcinomas. When the cut off value of CA 125 was set by 35 U/ml in the control group, the patients with serous cystadenocarcinoma showed positive in 81%, resulting by 1,766.5 U/ml as an average value. As for CA 19-9 having set by 37 U/ml as the cut off value, patients suffering from mucinous cystadenocarcinoma who revealed positive by 60%, were 194 U/ml in an average value. It is considered that measuring values of CA 125 and CA 19-9 are valuable not only to diagnose as ovarian cancers but also to evaluate their prognosis.
