Hormonal activity of epithelial ovarian tumours in post-menopausal women. Concentrations of progesterone and oestradiol in peripheral serum and tumour cyst fluid were measured in 42 post-menopausal women with epithelial ovarian tumours (17 cancer, 6 borderline malignant, 19 benign tumours) and in 19 post-menopausal women without ovarian neoplasms. The hormonal response of the endometrium was assessed, progestogen and oestrogen receptor content in the tumour tissue case recorded, and tumour deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy was measured by flow cytometry. No significant differences were found between the mean serum steroid levels in patients with malignant, borderline or benign tumours, but the mean serum levels of oestradiol in patients with malignant or benign ovarian tumours were higher than those in the controls. Endometrial hormonal activity was seen in 19% of the samples studied. Malignant and benign mucinous epithelial tumours were the types most frequently associated with hormonal activity. Increased levels of sex steroids were seen in the cyst fluid of serous malignant and borderline malignant tumours, while benign tumours were inactive. The steroid receptor content of the various tumour types did not vary significantly. Ten (59%) out of 17 ovarian carcinomas were found to be aneuploid and 41% diploid as measured by flow cytometry. No significant differences in serum levels of progesterone and oestradiol were found between aneuploid and diploid ovarian carcinomas. These results contribute to our knowledge of the hormonal activity of epithelial ovarian tumours in post-menopausal women.
