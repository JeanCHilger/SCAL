CA 125 antigen is an effective diagnostic for external endometriosis. We measured serum levels of CA 125 in 26 patients with external endometriosis, using CA 125 RIA Kits. The normal range was instituted below 39 U/ml. The mean CA 125 level (+/- SD) was 55.1 +/- 24.9 U/ml in patients with external endometriosis, the positive rate being 71.4%. Considering the clinical stage of external endometriosis, the mean CA 125 level and positive rate increased to 64.5 +/- 23.2 U/ml and 93.3%, respectively. The CA 125 levels in these patients gradually decreased after surgery and/or Danazol treatment and the levels were below 39 U/ml within four weeks. Thus, progressive external endometriosis can be accurately diagnosed by determining the serum levels of CA 125, and appropriate clinical treatment designed.
