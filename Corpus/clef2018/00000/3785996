Abnormal vaginal bleeding in adolescents. The evaluation and management of abnormal vaginal bleeding should be tailored to the individual case. Pediatricians caring for adolescents need to be skilled in the evaluation and management of this common adolescent problem. Physicians who do not feel comfortable with their skills in the performance of a pelvic exam should obtain consultation from an adolescent specialist or a gynecologist who has experience with adolescents.
