Sperm survival studies in peritoneal fluid from infertile women with endometriosis and unexplained infertility. Peritoneal fluid (PF) volume and sperm survival (motility and velocity) were studied in PF from women with unexplained infertility, infertile women with endometriosis and fertile women without endometriosis using a laser light scattering technique. PF volume was significantly larger in the group of women with unexplained infertility (P less than 0.025) and in infertile women with endometriosis (P less than 0.003) when compared with fertile women. There was a significant reduction in the percentage motile sperm in women with unexplained infertility (P less than 0.001) and in infertile women with endometriosis when compared with fertile women (P less than 0.001). In infertile women with endometriosis a positive correlation was observed between peritoneal fluid volume and reduction in the percentage of motile sperms (P less than 0.01).
