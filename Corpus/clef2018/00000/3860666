The clinical significance of CA125 in patients with gynecological tumors--a comparative study on CA125 and other tumor markers. Serum CA125 levels were measured by radioimmunoassay patients with various gynecological tumors. Elevated levels of CA125 were detected in the serum of patients with malignant ovarian tumors. Among patients with uterine tumors, CA125 levels were elevated in those with malignant uterine tumors, but not with uterine myomas. The correlations between tumor markers (CA125, IAP, ferritin, PTA) and malignant ovarian tumors were measured, and only CA125 levels were found to correlate with progression or regression of the disease in patients with malignant ovarian tumors. These results suggest that CA125 may be a useful marker for monitoring the response to treatment in patients with malignant ovarian tumors.
