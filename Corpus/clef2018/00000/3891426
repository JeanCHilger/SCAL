Behavior of cultured glandular cells obtained by flushing of the uterine cavity. In 77 of 115 cultures from uterine/tubal flushes performed in women undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy for reasons of infertility, epithelioid colonies of "tadpole-like" cells appeared. In cultured jet washings from the uterine cavities in women with ligated tubes, the same tadpole-like cells are present. These cells are also observed in vitro in laparoscopic biopsy specimens of active endometriosis nodules. Judged by the presence of cytokeratin in these cells, demonstrated by polyvalent or monoclonal antikeratin antibodies (the latter as a marker for glandular epithelia), there can be no doubt about their origin from the lining and glandular epithelium of part of the genital tract. Peritoneal washings not preceded by uterine/tubal flushing never contained the tadpole-like cells in culture. True epithelial cells were observed in the peritoneal cavity after flushing, and the proliferative capacity of these cells in vitro during the preovulatory phase was proven.
