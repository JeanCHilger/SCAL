Laparoscopy in children and adolescents. One hundred twelve females below the age of twenty years underwent laparoscopy at the Medical University of South Carolina over a ten-year period. Pelvic pain followed by primary amenorrhea was the major indication for the procedure. Eighty-nine percent of those with acute pain had identifiable pelvic pathology, whereas 27% of girls presenting with chronic pain had a normal laparoscopic examination. Pelvic inflammatory disease was the most common diagnosis. Ovarian cysts, pregnancy complications, and endometriosis were also found. Endometriosis was not found among black teenage clinic patients. The procedure appears to be a safe and useful diagnostic tool in this age group.
