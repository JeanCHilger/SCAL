External pelvic endometriosis: diagnostic study. Our experience in the maternity department of Saint-Antoine Hospital. A propos of 130 cases. The circumstances leading to the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis (adenomyosis excluded) were studied in 130 patients. From the epidemiological data yielded by these cases, the profile of women susceptible to this disease is delineated. Hysterosalpingography is the key to the diagnosis of endometriosis in most instances however, coelioscopy and/or laparotomy are required to establish the diagnosis, as well as for staging the disease which is important for the choice of therapy.
