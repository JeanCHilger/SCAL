Monitoring techniques for improved pregnancy rates during clomiphene ovulation induction. Despite the introduction of new ovulation-inducing agents, CC remains the drug of choice for most anovulatory patients. Before initiating therapy, patients should be evaluated to determine the cause of anovulation. Patients with ovarian failure, hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism, or forms of CAH should be treated with the appropriate replacement therapy. Evaluation of male factor and tubal patency should be obtained. Once CC therapy is initiated, careful monitoring should be continued. Confirmation of ovulation by endometrial biopsy or serum P levels is essential. CC doses should be increased monthly until normal luteal function is demonstrated. If the patient does not conceive in three ovulatory cycles, her treatment should be further evaluated by postcoital testing, repeat serum P measurement, and review of her endocrine findings. Patients with poor cervical mucus may benefit from midcycle estrogen. Patients with elevated T may benefit from prednisone suppressive therapy. Patients with abnormal HSGs should have laparoscopy and surgical correction if feasible. After six ovulatory cycles without conception, all patients should undergo laparoscopy. If laparoscopy is normal, therapy can be continued for a total of 10 to 12 cycles. Patients with reduced fecundability (male factor, minimal endometriosis, or minimal tubal adhesions) may require a longer time to conceive.
