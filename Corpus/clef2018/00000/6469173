Hyperplasiogenic gastric polyps and stomach cancer. Endoscopic findings of early stomach cancer in 3 out of 42 biopsies of hyperplasiogenic polyps. The hyperplasiogenic gastric polyp is an organo-specific polyp and compared to the real adenoma of the stomach and colon is not a neoplasia. The formation of a carcinoma in or on a hyperplasiogenic polyp is extremely rare. Hyperplasiogenic polyps have more of an indicator function, indicating an ill mucous tissue and the possibility of the formation of a carcinoma and a precancerous condition. Three observations of the formation of early carcinoma of the stomach in or on hyperplasiogenic polyps in 42 patients with hyperplasiogenic polyps, which were found in the upper alimentary tract in the course of 4 years and 10.473 endoscopic investigations, are reported here. Due to these observations the endoscopic loop extraction of all polypous protuberances still seems to be necessary.
