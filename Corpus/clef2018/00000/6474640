Vesical endometriosis. A case is presented of vesical endometriosis treated surgically in a thirty-one-year-old woman who presented with hypogastric pain and a pelvic mass. Echography showed an intravesical tumor, and cystoscopy led to a presumptive diagnosis of bladder endometriosis. The clinical features, diagnosis, and management are discussed, based on a review of the literature.
