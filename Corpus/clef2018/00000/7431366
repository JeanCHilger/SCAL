Diagnosing endometriosis with ultrasound: accuracy and specificity. Gray-scale ultrasonograms in 26 patients with pathologically and/or surgically proven endometriosis were evaluated. We found a complex pattern (18) more often than previously reported among the 38 lesions studied. In four patients, fluid/fluid levels were recognized. In no instances were we unequivocally able to identify focal endometrial adenomyosis. Judging on a careful correlation between the surgical and pathologic specimens, we found the ultrasound to be extremely accurate in determining the size, shape and location of the endometriosis. Our study failed to demonstrate that the ultrasonic pattern is specific, as suggested by some, in differentiating the ultrasonic pattern from those of other pelvic diseases.
