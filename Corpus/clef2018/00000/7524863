Current concepts in observation and treatment of patients with internal endometriosis of the uterus. The paper outlines the issues of improving and systematizing clinical instrumental diagnostic and therapeutical techniques for internal endometriosis. The results of examining 220 patients with internal endometriosis, out of whom 116 were further operated on, have been prospectively and retrospectively studies. Based on the histological findings of the gross specimens intraoperatively removed, the authors analyzed the predictive value of clinical and instrumental diagnostic criteria, including those of transvaginal echography, Doppler echometry of the arteries supplying the uterus, those of hysteroscopy and the computer hysterosalping graphic technique developed by them. The ovarian morphological and receptor apparatuses were studied in internal endometriosis. The examination and treatment system for patients with internal endometriosis is presented in the paper.
