Elevated tubal perfusion pressures during selective salpingography are highly suggestive of tubal endometriosis. To investigate the possible etiologies of elevated tubal perfusion pressures.Analysis of 48 consecutive female patients with infertility who underwent laparoscopy and a gynecoradiological investigation as part of their infertility work-up.Academically affiliated infertility center.A gynecoradiological investigation was performed using a previously reported standardized contrast injection system. Laparoscopy was performed routinely.Patients who demonstrated by laparoscopy to have endometriosis showed a significantly increased incidence of tubal blockage during initial hysterosalpingography (HSG) (12/26, 46.1%) compared with controls (2/14, 14.3%). Patients with endometriosis also demonstrated significantly more frequently elevated tubal perfusion pressures (22/26 84.6%) than women without disease (2/14, 14.3%) and significantly higher mean tubal perfusion pressures than women with normal pelvises (576 +/- 264 versus 450 +/- 268 mm Hg).Tubal blockage during initial HSG and elevated tubal perfusion pressures during selective salpingography are highly suggestive of tubal endometriosis. These data are the first evidence that tubal involvement with endometriosis may be more frequent than previously suspected. They also suggest that the performance of a gynecoradiological investigation, inclusive of selective salpingography, can greatly contribute to a presumptive diagnosis of endometriosis.
