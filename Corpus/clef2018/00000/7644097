Endometriosis of the sigmoid: 2 new cases and a review of the literature. Endometriosis of the sigmoid colon is a pathology which is not frequently reported but may be manifested with symptoms in the form of intestinal occlusions and/or subocclusions and rectorrhagia. Diagnosis is difficult because there are no typical radiological and endoscopic findings. The authors report two cases of sigmoid endometriosis which were manifested by recurrent subocclusive attacks and rectorrhagia. Moreover, they stress the rarity of the site and review the literature in order to summarise the etiopathogenetic hypotheses and anatomopathological aspects. They also focus on clinical symptoms and on endoscopic and radiological findings. Lastly, they examine the problems of differential diagnosis and the therapeutic options.
