Endometriosis: current management. To review the clinical features, theories of pathogenesis, and current treatment of endometriosis-associated pain and infertility.We review the manifestation of endometriosis and the possible mechanisms that lead to its symptoms, examine the efficacy of current therapeutic options for pelvic pain and infertility, and provide specific recommendations for treatment based on the current literature.Endometriosis is the presence of hormonally responsive endometrial tissue occurring outside the uterine cavity. This condition may be asymptomatic but is often found in association with pelvic pain or infertility (or both). The precise pathogenesis has not been clearly established but likely involves retrograde menstruation with subsequent seeding of endometrial glands at extrauterine sites. The definitive diagnosis and staging of endometriosis are performed by laparoscopy. Various strategies have been used to treat endometriosis including expectant, medical, surgical, and combination management.The efficacy of treatment varies for pelvic pain and infertility. Endometriosis-associated pain may respond to both medical and surgical management. The use of medical therapy for endometriosis-associated infertility is not supported by current studies. Surgical management of infertility may be efficacious when pelvic anatomy is distorted because of endometriosis. The use of superovulation strategies and in vitro fertilization has been shown to be effective in overcoming endometriosis-associated infertility.Pelvic pain and infertility in the presence of endometriosis necessitate individualization of therapy to achieve treatment goals. Neither medical nor surgical management is efficacious in all circumstances. As a better understanding of the pathogenesis of endometriosis evolves, treatment of this perplexing condition will probably continue to improve.
