Intestinal obstruction due to endometriosis of the ileocecal valve. Intestinal endometriosis can rarely show itself bowel obstruction. An accurate anamnesis, radiological tests and endoscopy are of some use for correct diagnosis. Frequently however, differential diagnosis with others of pathology is not possible either in preoperative or in postoperative management, but by means of histological finding. We present here a case of acute bowel obstruction secondary to ileo-cecal endometriosis.
