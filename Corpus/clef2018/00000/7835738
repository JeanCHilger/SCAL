Laparoscopic findings in endometriosis in women with dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain and sterility. Preliminary note. Laparoscopy was performed on patients with dysmenorrhea, sterility and pelvic pain in order to evaluate the prevalence of endometriosis in our environment therefore considering the population of female beneficiary patients of reproductive age of the ISSSTE hospital in the city of Veracruz, Ver. in MÃ©xico. The percentages of endometriosis were similar to the reports published in the international journals with the exception of the dysmenorrhea where our results were higher. In all the cases the same variables were analyzed age, active sexual life (V.S.A.), birth control method, menarche (men), menstrual cycle, childbirths and abortions, as well as other laparoscopic detections. Each of the endometriosis cases were classified according to the revised American Fertility Society classification of 1985 (R.A.F.S.) for endometriosis.
