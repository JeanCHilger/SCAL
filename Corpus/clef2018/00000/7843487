Cesarean scar endometriosis. A mass located in a scar area during examination is an infrequent phenomenon. Such a mass can be associated with keloid, hematoma, granuloma, hernia or neoplasm. Two cases of scar endometriosis are reported. The late onset of symptoms after surgery (average 4.5 years) is the usual reason for misdiagnosis. Awareness of this infrequent and late postoperative complication would increase the detection rate. Surgical excision remains the treatment of choice and should be accomplished without complications.
