Treatment of endometriosis with the GnRH agonist leuprorelin acetate depot (Enatone-Gyn monthly depot): a multicenter study. In an open, non-randomized prospective phase-III-study the clinical and endocrine efficacy as well as the safety of leuprorelin acetate depot (Enantone-Gyn Monats-Depot) were investigated. The therapeutic results of 198 patients, gathered from 5 university institutions and two city hospitals, are reported. Endometriosis was classified by the revised American Fertility Society score (r-AFS) before and at the end of treatment. Serum levels of LH, FSH, prolactin, estradiol, progesterone, androstenedione, testosterone and leuprorelin acetate were determined by radioimmunoassay. The mean total r-AFS score changed as follows: before surgical intervention during first-look laparoscopy 21 +/- 24 at the end of first-look laparoscopy 15 +/- 19 at the end of the GnRH-treatment 8 +/- 14 During leuprorelin acetate treatment the r-AFS stages changed as follows: [table see text] Using the scoring system 85.2% of the patients improved. Relief of dysmenorrhoea could be achieved in 95.4%, relief of dyspareunia in 64% and of pelvic pain in 69.4% of patients. Baseline hormone levels dropped sharply during treatment. [table
