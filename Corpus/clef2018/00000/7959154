An analysis of bone mass and remodeling in women with pharmacological inhibition of ovarian function. The response to nasal calcitonin. Pharmacological inhibition of ovarian function (PIOF) in young women is associated with hypoestrogenism and very low estrogen levels. These alterations can trigger osteopenia, either by delayed peak bone mass or by active bone destruction, and therefore, an increased risk of osteoporosis at later years. Twenty-one women (mean age: 32 years) with diagnosis of endometriosis, who were submitted to PIOF with leuprolide acetate, were prospectively studied. As a result of treatment for bone resorption with nasal spray salmon calcitonin, 200 UI/day, a decreased femoral and lumbar bone mass density was identified in these women through densitometry. Regarding bone remodelling biochemistry, changes were seen in urinary markers suggesting bone destruction inhibition, while bone formation markers showed stimulation. Biochemical markers of bone turnover and bone mass measurements are useful during follow-up of young women with osteopenia.
