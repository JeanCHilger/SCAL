A clinico-morphological comparison of the ultrasonic criteria of adenomyosis. The authors analyze the data of ultrasonic examinations in 110 patients operated on for adenomyosis and in 50 patients with this condition not exposed to surgery, in whom the diagnosis was made after comprehensive examinations. The accuracy of ultrasonic diagnosis correlated with the disease severity. Diagnostic difficulties are explained by the absence of pathognomonic echographic criteria, frequent associations with myoma, and with false echo signals emerging in the myometrium. Transabdominal and transvaginal methods may be recommended for a more precise diagnosis it is desirable to single out several echographic criteria and by all means correlate them to clinical data. An attempt at morphologic explanation of the principal echographic criteria of adenomyosis has been made. Echo-negative structures in the myometrium emerge mainly as a result of the signal reflection from the zone of perifocal membranogenic edema of myometrial stroma developing round endometriosis focus.
