CA-125 and uterine leiomyomas. CA-125, in the past considered as marker of ovarian neoplasms, has been proven to be useful successively in several obstetric-gynecologic physiopathologic conditions (Endometriosis, beginning pregnancy, PID), united by the common characteristic of peritoneal involvement. Such evidence has suggested us to search possible correlations with uterine leiomyomatosis disease, which for its frequency has the character of a social disease. Our findings would justify the clinical use of this marker in the first screening of fibromiomas, but above all, its diagnostic utility in evolutive aspects of such pathology.
