Genitourinary endometriosis: report of 2 cases and clinical aspects of patients in Japan. One hundred and fifty two cases of genito-urinary tract endometriosis reported in Japan including our 2 cases were reviewed. The incidence and mean patients' age were respectively 0.7% and 22 years old for kidneys, 37.5% and 38.8 years old for ureter and 61.8% and 36.2 years old for bladder. Clinical symptoms in ureteral endometriosis were similar to those in upper urinary tract obstruction and in vesical endometriosis, lower urinary tract symptoms such as pain on urination, irritative bladder symptoms and macrohematuria were frequently observed. Vesical lesions tend to be located on the posterior wall in the retrotrigone or trigone, and ureteral lesions tend to be located in the bilateral lower segments. The incidence of extrinsic type of ureteral endometriosis was 6 times higher than that reported as intrinsic type, and mixed type was reported in only 3.5%. Recent first choice for mild endometriosis is hormonal therapy with Danazole or LH-RH analogue. Surgical treatment is recommended in severe cases or patients in whom hormonal therapy is not effective.
