Expression of major histocompatibility complex class II antigen in endometriotic tissue in patients with endometriosis and adenomyosis. To evaluate the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II antigen (human leukocyte antigen, HLA-DR) in glandular cells in eutopic and ectopic endometria in patients with endometriosis and adenomyosis.Subjects consisted of 50 patients with adenomyosis and 18 patients with endometriosis. Controls consisted of 17 patients with adenomyoma and 42 infertile women without habitual abortion and autoimmune diseases.Glandular cells in eutopic and ectopic endometria were analyzed immunohistochemically to localize the expression of HLA-DR antigen. The sections were scored from 0 to 5 according to the evaluation nomogram.Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly increased expression of HLA-DR antigen in the glandular cells in eutopic and ectopic endometria, compared with materials from patients with adenomyoma and infertile patients.It is likely that aberrant expression of HLA-DR antigen in glandular cells of eutopic and ectopic endometria in endometriosis and adenomyosis is deeply involved in various immunological abnormalities.
