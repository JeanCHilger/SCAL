A randomized and longitudinal study of human menopausal gonadotropin with intrauterine insemination in the treatment of infertility. To study in a randomized and longitudinal manner the efficacy of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) superovulation combined with intrauterine insemination (IUI) versus IUI alone in the treatment of various causes of infertility in the presence of normal ovulation.An initially randomized and subsequently longitudinal study of infertile couples was performed at a university-based clinical research center. One hundred nineteen couples with longstanding infertility (average duration 3.7 years) associated with male factor infertility, unexplained infertility, and/or endometriosis were enrolled. All patients were randomized in the initial cycle to treatment with either hMG/IUI or urine LH-timed IUI alone. They were then followed longitudinally as they alternated subsequent cycles between the two modalities. Outcome indices measured were cycle fecundity, pregnancy outcome, and cumulative pregnancy rates evaluated by life-table analysis.Human menopausal gonadotropin/IUI therapy was consistently more effective than IUI alone in the treatment of endometriosis, male factor infertility, and unexplained infertility, with cycle fecundities ranging from 7.1-19.0% versus 0-6.7%, respectively, during the first seven cycles.Human menopausal gonadotropin/IUI is a more effective therapy for enhancing fertility than is IUI alone for the treatment of endometriosis, male factor infertility, and unexplained infertility.
