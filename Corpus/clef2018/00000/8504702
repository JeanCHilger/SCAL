Prolactin secretion in patients with endometriosis and its relationship to luteal phase defect and infertility. Serum prolactin (PRL) levels and PRL response to TRH stimulation were studied in 49 patients with endometriosis (EM) during mid-luteal phase. Eight cases with other gyn-diseases and 14 normal fertile women served as controls. Their luteal function were also estimated by three serum progesterone(P) measurements during the luteal phase and endometrial dating in the late luteal phase.The incidence of hyperprolactinemia in EM group (32.7%), and in EM with primary infertility group (61.5%) was significantly higher than that in normal controls (7.1%) (P < 0.05). However, the PRL secretory capacity was not positively correlated to the severity of EM. There was no difference in serum P levels between EM and two control groups. But delayed endometrial maturation was shown in 6 EM infertile cases suggesting luteal phase defect, an incidence of 27.3% (6/22) in EM group or 42.9% (6/14) in EM infertile group. Five out of the six were hyperprolactinemic and had no other identified causes of infertility. These data implied that hyperprolactinemia may impair the luteal function causing infertility in EM patients.
