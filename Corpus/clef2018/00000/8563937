Intussusception of the appendix: a report of three cases with different clinical and pathologic features. Three cases of intussusception of the appendix (IA) with distinctive pathologic changes were reported. All patients were women with different clinical presentations. Grossly, a complete intussusception was found in one case (case 1), while the others (cases 2 and 3) showed a partial intussusception. In case 1, almost the total segment of the appendix bearing the villous adenoma with focal malignant transformation became completely telescoped into the cecum. In case 2, no underlying appendiceal lesion was disclosed. In case 3, appendiceal endometriosis was found as the point of traction. Awareness of such a rare complication associated with various appendiceal lesions provides a clue for making an accurate diagnosis and selecting appropriate surgical management.
