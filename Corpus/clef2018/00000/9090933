Ovarian angioma. Report of 3 asymptomatic cases. In 3 female patients, aged 46, 50 and 74 years respectively, ovarian angiomas measuring 3, 5 and 30 mm in diameter were discovered. All the angiomas were asymptomatic. They were either associated with endometrioid carcinoma or uterine leiomyomas, or detected casually by ultrasound scan in a patient with ascites, intrahepatic nodule and increased serologic CA 125. The immunohistochemical studies failed to reveal any affinity between the vascular endothelium of our ovarian angiomas and oestrogen and progesterone receptors.
