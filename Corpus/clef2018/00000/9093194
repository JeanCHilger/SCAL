Flow cytometry study on the effect of serum and peritoneal fluid of women on sperm-binding activity of immunoglobulin G antisperm antibodies. To investigate the influence of sera and peritoneal fluids (PFs) from fertile and infertile women on the binding of antisperm antibodies to the surface of spermatozoa.The immunoglobulin (Ig) G antisperm antibodies binding to the surface of liver spermatozoa was evaluated after their incubation in antisperm antibodies-positive serum from an infertile male in the presence and absence of female sera or PFs.Russian Scientific Center for Obstetrics, Gynaecology, and Perinatology.Serum and PF samples from fertile and infertile women antisperm antibodies-positive serum from infertile menSerum samples were obtained from fertile and infertile women and from infertile men. Peritoneal fluids were collected during routine laparoscopy.The proportion of spermatozoa positive for IgG antibodies and the quantity of antisperm antibodies on the sperm surface measured by flow cytometry (FCM).The addition of sera from fertile or infertile women with endometriosis or pelvic adhesion disease to an IgG antisperm antibodies-positive male serum resulted in significant inhibition of the antisperm antibodies binding to the sperm surface.Sera of fertile as well as infertile woman contain factors that block IgG antisperm antibodies binding to the surface of live spermatozoa.
