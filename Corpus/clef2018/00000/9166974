Cathepsin B-like activity as a serum tumour marker in ovarian carcinoma. Serum cathepsin B-like activity was determined in 75 patients with ovarian carcinomas and in control groups. Ovarian cancers were of FIGO stages I-IV. Control groups consisted of 15 healthy women, 20 patients with myomas of the uterus, and 17 with benign ovarian cysts. Preoperative results showed elevated cathepsin B-like activity in 100% of the patients with ovarian cancers in relation to healthy subjects and patients with myomas, and in 78% in relation to benign ovarian cysts. Cathepsin B activity increased progressively with the FIGO stage of the disease, but the differences among particular stages were not statistically significant. In serous tumours cathepsin activity was significantly higher only in comparison to endometrioid ones (p < 0.001). Antipapain capacity of cystatins in the sera was also determined. No significant correlation between cathepsin B-like, and antipapain activity of cystatins was found. Serum cathepsin B-like activity may be helpful in the preoperative differential diagnosis between ovarian carcinomas and benign ovarian or uterine tumours.
