Expression of aromatase cytochrome P450 protein and messenger ribonucleic acid in human endometriotic and adenomyotic tissues but not in normal endometrium. To determine whether local estrogen production takes place in endometriotic or adenomyotic tissues, in eutopic endometrium from patients with endometriosis or adenomyosis, and in normal endometrium, tissue specimens were examined by immunohistochemistry, catalytic activity, and mRNA expression for aromatase cytochrome P450 (P450arom). P450arom was immunohistochemically localized in the cytoplasm of glandular cells of endometriotic and adenomyotic tissues, and of eutopic endometrium from patients with the respective diseases, whereas estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors were localized in the nuclei of the glandular cells and stroma. Aromatase activity in the microsomal fraction of adenomyotic tissues was inhibited by the addition of danazol, aromatase inhibitors, and anti-human placental P450arom monoclonal antibody (mAb3-2C2) in a manner similar to such inhibition in other human tissues. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis also revealed P450arom mRNA in these tissues. However, neither P450arom protein activity nor mRNA was detected in endometrial specimens obtained from normal menstruating women with cervical carcinoma in situ but without any other gynecological disease. These results suggest that at a local level, endometriotic and adenomyotic tissues produce estrogens, which may be involved in the tissue growth through interacting with the estrogen receptor.
