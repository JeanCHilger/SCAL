Increased expression of complement component 3 in human ectopic endometrium compared with the matched eutopic endometrium. To compare the gene expression of complement component 3 (C3) in human eutopic and ectopic endometrium.A prospective, controlled study.Academic hospital.Women with documented endometriosis.Eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues were collected simultaneously at laparoscopy.Detection of C3 messenger RNA (mRNA) by in situ hybridization and C3 protein by immunohistochemistry and Western blot.Expression of C3 mRNA increased in ectopic endometrium compared with that in the matched eutopic endometrium. The quantitative analysis of C3 mRNA by grain count (mean +/- SE) showed 175.60 +/- 40.02 and 39.97 +/- 8.17 grains per micron2 in ectopic and eutopic glands, respectively, and 67.65 +/- 29.82 and 15.02 +/- 5.80 grains per micron2 in ectopic and eutopic stroma, respectively. Expression of C3 mRNA in ectopic glands was significantly higher than that in eutopic glands. The pattern of immunoreactive staining of C3 protein was consistent with that of C3 mRNA. A higher level of C3 protein in ectopic endometrium than eutopic endometrium was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot.Expression of C3 mRNA and protein significantly increased in human ectopic endometrium compared with that in the matched eutopic endometrium.
