Surgical management of cornual-isthmic tubal obstruction. To examine the efficacy of microsurgical tubal anastomosis among patients having failed attempts to correct cornual-isthmic tubal obstruction by hysteroscopic tubal catheterization.An open observational trial.A tertiary referral reproductive medicine practice.Forty-three patients with laparoscopically confirmed bilateral cornual-isthmic obstruction and otherwise normal fallopian tubes. Thirty-three control patients with a history of elective sterilization presenting for tubal anastomosis.All patients with bilateral cornual-isthmic obstruction underwent attempted hysteroscopic tubal cannulation. Those unsuccessfully catheterized proceeded with microsurgical resection and anastomosis. Candidates for reversal of sterilization underwent microsurgical repair in standard layered technique.Mean time to achieve pregnancy, as well as cumulative pregnancy rates for all three groups using life-table analysis, were calculated.Cumulative pregnancy rates for patients with successful tubal catheterization, for those requiring microsurgical repair, and for reversal of elective sterilization were 0.68%, 0.56%, and 0.29%, respectively, at 12 months. Mean duration to achieve pregnancy was similar for both cornual-isthmic blockage-treated groups and was shorter than that for the sterilization-reversal group.Patients with cornual-isthmic obstruction and otherwise normal fallopian tubes who are treated successfully by either tubal catheterization or resection and microsurgical anastomosis demonstrate high pregnancy rates, short interval to achieve pregnancy, and similar obstetric outcome. If no pregnancy is achieved within 1 year of surgery, reevaluation and consideration for possible IVF and ET is indicated.
