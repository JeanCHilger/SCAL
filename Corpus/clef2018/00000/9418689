Exogenous gonadotropin stimulation is associated with increases in serum androgen levels in in-vitro fertilization-embryo transfer cycles. To examine serum androgen profiles in women undergoing ovarian stimulation with exogenous gonadotropins in the setting of IVF-ET.Prospective study.University hospital IVF-ET program.Seventeen ovulatory women undergoing IVF-ET for endometriosis, male factor infertility, or tubal disease.A standard long protocol of GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) pretreatment (1 mg of leuprolide acetate SC for 10 days) was administered before ovulation induction with a urinary gonadotropin preparation.After 10 days of GnRH-a treatment and on the day of hCG administration, serum concentrations of LH, T, androstenedione (A), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and DHEAS the free androgen index (T/SHBG)Serum samples after 10 days of GnRH-a treatment showed incomplete LH suppression. While continuing the agonist during ovarian stimulation, LH values were suppressed further. However, serum T and A concentrations and the free androgen index showed a significant increase (samples drawn just before hCG administration). Serum T levels after 10 days of GnRH-a (before the administration of exogenous gonadotropins) were correlated negatively with the subsequent number of embryos.Serum LH suppression with a conventional regimen of GnRH-a is incomplete in this heterogeneous group of ovulatory women. Exogenous gonadotropin stimulation results in a marked increase in ovarian androgen secretion.
