Endometriosis: the cause of hematuria in the dysfunctional ureter. To review the diagnosis and treatment of ureteral stenosis arising from endometriosis and describe a case of mixed (intrinsic and extrinsic) ureteral endometriosis.The diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of ureteral stenosis due to endometriosis are reviewed. The case of a patient with a nonfunctioning right kidney and hematuria is described. The patient had previously undergone hysterectomy and double adnexectomy for uterine leiomyofibromas and a right ureteral lesion that warranted cuff ureterocystoneostomy leaving the extreme distal third of the pelvic ureter. CT evaluation disclosed a right retrovesical mass. The therapeutic strategy consisted in performing percutaneous nephrostomy, ureteroscopy of nonfunctioning ureter and determining the nature of the retrovesical mass by fine needle punction aspiration biopsy.Percutaneous nephrostomy achieved functional recovery of the renal unit. Endoscopic incision of the stricture with intravesical invagination of the compromised segment was performed with the combined antegrade and retrograde approach. The anatomopathological findings of ureteroscopic biopsy of an intraureteral lesion in the nonfunctioning ureter disclosed ureteral endometriosis. This finding obviated fine needle punction aspiration biopsy and the patient was treated with danazol for 6 months.Diagnosis by ureteroscopy should be considered in intrinsic and mixed forms of ureteral endometriosis. Endoscopic incision of the ureteral stricture combined with hormone therapy is a valid therapeutic option.
