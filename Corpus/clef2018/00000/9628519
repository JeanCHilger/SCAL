How should we approach the management of pelvic pain? Pelvic pain is a common debilitating condition. Most investigations are invasive, expensive and usually negative. Although a positive diagnosis of endometriosis justifies a recognized treatment programme, the majority of women with negative investigations are left without a diagnosis and often accused of psychological abnormalities. The reasons for the negative investigations are just as likely to be due to the inadequate techniques of the operator as the lack of pathological signs. The early use of menstrual suppression with GnRH analogue allows pain relief sooner in the majority of sufferers and separates those with pain related to the menstrual cycle, from whatever cause, from those whose pain is not related to pelvic physiology and who would not benefit from further medication or operative therapy. The majority, who have obtained relief from the analogue therapy, then have time to discuss alternative long-term treatments without the feeling of desperation that chronic monthly pelvic pain can produce.
