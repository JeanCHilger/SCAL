Follow-up of atypical glandular cells in cervical-endocervical smears. Atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS) is a diagnostic category of the Bethesda system encompassing glandular-type cells that show either endometrial or endocervical differentiation and display greater atypia than expected for a reactive process but do not meet the criteria for invasive adenocarcinoma. We investigated AGUS in a follow-up study of cervical-endocervical smears with either histology or repeat cytology follow-up. From the cytology files at Northwestern Memorial Hospital over a 4-year period, 136 cervical-endocervical smears were diagnosed with AGUS, which were further subdivided into atypical glandular cells, unqualified (AGC-U) atypical glandular cells, favor reactive (AGC-FR)
