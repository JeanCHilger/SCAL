Peritoneal endometriotic lesions differentially express a haptoglobin-like gene. A unique glycoprotein, called endometriosis protein-I (ENDO-I), has previously been shown to be synthesized and secreted by rat and human endometriotic explants. Furthermore, the N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis showed that ENDO-I shares homology with haptoglobin. The present study was designed to determine this sequence of ENDO-I cDNA from human peritoneal endometriotic lesions and to determine the relative expression of the ENDO-I gene in several human tissues. Poly A-enriched RNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed. To determine the sequence of ENDO-I cDNA, a polymerase chain reaction was performed on cDNA from human endometriotic lesions and a gene-specific primer based on the human haptoglobin sequence. A similar procedure was followed to assess the relative expression of the ENDO-I gene in various tissues. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase was used as an internal control. ENDO-I gene expression was quantified by densitometry. Sequence analysis of ENDO-I cDNA identified 873 nucleotides that displayed 99.4% homology with the human haptoglobin beta-chain. Relative expression of ENDO-I mRNA by peritoneal endometriotic lesions was 19-fold greater than peritoneum, 28-fold greater than endometrioma and 37-fold greater than eutopic endometrium (P<0.01). Haptoglobin-like ENDO-I may be associated with localized angiogenesis and altered immune response involved with the aetiology/pathophysiology of endometriosis.
