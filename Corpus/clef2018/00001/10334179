A case of endobronchial endometriosis treated by subsegmentectomy. We present a case of endobronchial endometriosis with catamenial hemoptysis. The lesion was diagnosed as endobronchial endometriosis using helical CT, and the patient underwent a subsegmentectomy of the upper part of the lateral basal segment. A histopathologic examination of the resected specimen revealed findings typical of endobronchial endometriosis with intimal hyperplasia within the bronchus. Since the operation, the patient has been asymptomatic for 11 months with no recurrence of hemoptysis.
