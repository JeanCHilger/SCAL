Angiogenesis in gynecology and obstetrics. In current scientific discussion, increasing importance is being given to the clinical significance of the new formation of vessels (angiogenesis) in the course of physiological, inflammatory and neoplastic processes. Angiogenesis is best studied in the growth of malignant tumors, since cancer may be regarded as the most important angiogenesis-dependent disease in terms of social and economic aspects. The significance of angiogenesis in gynecological oncology is as follows: 1) Intratumoral vessel density is an indicator for the emergence and growth of malignant tumours and their precursor lesions, 2) intratumoral vessel density is an independent prognostic factor for solid malignancies and 3) the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by means of anti-angiogenetic substances causes tumor growth to be suppressed. Angiogenesis also plays an important role in the regulation of the female menstrual cycle. Proliferation of the endometrium and the formation of the corpus luteum in the second half of the menstrual cycle are examples of angiogenesis in the physiological field. The function of angiogenetic factors in the emergence of endometriosis and in female and male infertility are currently under study. In obstetrics, the new formation of blood vessels is significant for the implantation of impregnated blastocysts and for the development and growth of the placenta. Preeclempsia (gestational toxicosis), for instance, is a typical pregnancy-related disease whose pathophysiological mechanism is attributed to a disturbed development and function of small placental vessels. The present paper is an overview of current knowledge and current approaches of research concerning angiogenesis in the field of gynecology and obstetrics. The paper is focused on the clinical significance of angiogenesis.
