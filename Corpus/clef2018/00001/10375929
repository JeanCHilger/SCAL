The use of carbon-dioxide laser surgery in the treatment of intraepithelial neoplasia of the uterine cervix. From October 1989 to June 1997, 1841 patients (pts) suffering from different diseases of the lower genital tract have been treated with CO2 laser surgery in our Institution: among them, 782 were affected by cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). All pts underwent CO2 laser procedure for CIN after adequate colposcopic evaluation of the entire lower genital tract, colposcopic guided biopsy of the lesion, adequate pre-surgical work-up for possible infectious and coagulation associated disease. In 736 (94.1%) pts, the procedure was performed on an ambulatory basis while 46 pts (5.9%) were admitted for 1 or 2 days. A CO2 laser Sharplan 55 associated to a Zeiss operative colposcope was employed. The preoperative diagnosis of the 782 pts treated for CIN was 297 CIN1, 255 CIN2, 171 CIN3 and 59 CIS. Mean age was 33.6 years without statistical difference among the grade of disease: 605 pts underwent laser vaporization according to specific selection criteria. The depth of cervical destruction was less than 6 mm in 26 cases, between 6 and 10 mm in 549, between 11 and 15 mm in 157, more than 15 mm in 50 pts. 742 procedures were performed under local anesthesia and pain was absent in 667 pts. (89.9%), mild in 51 (6.8%), moderate in 19 (2.5%) and severe in 5 (0.7%). Intraoperative bleeding was severe in 30 pts. (3.8%), moderate in 77 (9.8%), mild in 204 (26.1%) and absent in 471 (60.2%). The conization procedure was shown to have a higher risk of bleeding but no direct relation was observed with the depth of cervical destruction. Late complications were scarce: 1.3% of late hemorrhages, 1.4% of stenosis of cervical external orifice and cervical endometriosis in 0.3%. In 76 pts (42%) of the 177 conizations the final pathology report was in accordance with the previous biopsy, in 56 (30.9%) a lower grade of CIN was observed, in 53 (29.3%) a worse grade of the lesion was retrieved. Among these latter pts. 10 showed a microinvasive and 2 an invasive cancer: both the invasive but only 3 of the 10 microinvasive cancer pts underwent a surgical procedure (2 radical and 3 extrafascial hysterectomies, respectively). After a mean follow up of 37 months our incidence of recurrence is 2.3% (18 pts): 5 CIN1, 7 CIN2, 3 CIN3, 2 CIS and 1 microinvasive disease. In 78% of the instances the recurrence has occurred within the first year of follow up. All 18 recurrences were successfully treated with further vaporization in 8 cases, conization in 9 and hysterectomy in 1. 93 term pregnancies occurred in 83 pts after CO2 laser treatment of CIN. No cervical incompetence occurred (no cervical cerclage employed) while the incidence of spontaneous abortion was not statistically significant. 82 pregnancies were delivered vaginally without significant variation of labor phase duration. The incidence of caesarian section (11.8%) was lower than the mean incidence in our Institution. These data confirm the successful complete restitutio ad integrum of the cervix after an adequate CO2 laser surgical procedure without any further risk of cervical incompetence, premature delivery or premature rupture of membranes. The use of CO2 laser surgery is recommended as modality treatment of choice in the management of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
