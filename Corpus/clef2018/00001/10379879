Regulation of angiogenic growth factors in the female reproductive tract by estrogens and progestins. Proper regulation of angiogenesis and vascular permeability is essential for the physiological functioning of the female reproductive tract, and major health problems in women, such as dysfunctional uterine bleeding, endometriosis, and uterine cancer, involve a vascular component. There is a large body of literature that describes the effects of sex steroids on the vasculature of the reproductive tract, but far less is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate these important actions. We hope that this minireview will help emphasize the need for mechanistic studies in this area to improve treatment and prevention of these major health problems in women. Specifically, we believe it will be important to 1) define the exact roles of FGF, VEGF, and other factors in physiological and pathological events in the reproductive tract and the cell types and receptors involved 2) identify estrogen and progesterone receptor subtypes, the DNA elements, nuclear protein factors, and signaling pathways that mediate regulation of these genes by sex steroids
