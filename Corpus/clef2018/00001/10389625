Strongly reduced expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 in endometrial neoplasia. In the present study we investigated the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 in endometrial neoplasia using immunohistochemistry with a p27-specific antibody. Expression of p27 in endometrial carcinomas was compared with expression in the normal endometrium throughout the cycle. Normal endometrial cells showed strong nuclear expression of p27. Expression was present throughout the cycle and was stronger during the secretory phase. We found strongly reduced or abolished expression of p27 in endometrial carcinoma (85.3% of cases). The 41 tumours analysed were classified according to p27 staining intensity and percentage of positive cells into the following categories of p27 expression: negative/very low (56.0%) low (29.3%)
