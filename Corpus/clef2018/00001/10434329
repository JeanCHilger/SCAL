Ureteral and vesicular endometriosis: case report. The authors report a case of both vesical and ureteral endometriosis diagnosed after recurrent acute pyelonephitis. A Gonadotrophin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy and a conservative endoscopic management is started allowing an almost complete regression of the lesions. A review of the literature is presented about this unexceptional localisation of endometriosis (1 to 2% of all endometriosis).
