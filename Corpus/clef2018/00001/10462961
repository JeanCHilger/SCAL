Endometriosis in adolescents and young women. Can we afford to delay the diagnosis?. Retrospective analysis performed on medical records of 129 adolescents and young women treated surgically at I Dept. of Surgical Gynaecology during the nine years period (1989-1998) revealed 22 cases (17%) of endometriosis. Main indication for surgical intervention, apart from dysmenorrhoea and cyclic abdominal pain, had been the presence of endometriod cyst, as disclosed by ultrasound investigation (66%). Despite of negative result of imaging or clinical examination subjective complaints necessitated laparotomy in 27% of cases. According to American Fertility Society endometriosis classification, 17% subjects presented endometriosis in I stage, 17%--in stage II and remaining 66%--endometrioid cysts with stage III. Authors conclude, that in cases with persistent abdominal pain, not responding to conventional therapy, diagnostic laparoscopy/laparotomy in young women should not be delayed, unless endometriosis is suspected.
