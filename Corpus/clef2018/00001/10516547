Expression of CA125 in thoracic endometriosis in a patient with catamenial pneumothorax. A 40-year-old woman had experienced monthly right thoracic pain and productive cough occurring at the beginning of her menstrual period. X-ray findings indicated a diagnosis of catamenial pneumothorax. The serum CA125 level was very high at 159.6 U/ml. Thoracoscopy showed multiple dark cherry-colored nodules with neovascularization on the diaphragm. Following partial resection of the diaphragm thoracic endometriosis was diagnosed. Immunohistochemical staining of these endometrial cells showed antibodies to CA125. She has been well without recurrence for 15 months, and her serum CA125 level was within the normal range after operation.
