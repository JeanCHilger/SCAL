High concentrations of the vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-8 in ovarian endometriomata. Patients with endometriosis are characterized by the ability of the endometrium to implant and by the peritoneal response to the tissue angiogenic factors may play a significant role in the aetiology of endometriosis supporting the implantation of ectopic endometrial cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a mitogen, morphogen and chemoactractant for endothelial cells and, in vivo, it is a powerful mediator for vessel permeability. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemoatractant for neutrophils and is a potent angiogenic factor. Women (n = 20) with ovarian endometriomata and 10 women with follicular cysts were enrolled in this study to investigate the role of VEGF and IL-8 in the development and maintenance of ovarian endometriomata. Cystic fluids were collected by laparoscopy, immediately centrifuged and stored until the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed. The VEGF and IL-8 concentrations were found to be significantly higher in the fluids of the ovarian endometriomata than in those of the follicular cysts of controls (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001 respectively)
