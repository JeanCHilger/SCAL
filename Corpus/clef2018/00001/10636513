Endometrial release of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and endometriosis: relationship to the extent of the disease. To relate endometrial release of the soluble form of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 with extent of endometriosis.Samples of endometrium were collected from 23 women with endometriosis. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was quantified in conditioned medium from 48-hour endometrial stromal cell cultures with use of a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels were correlated with revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine classification score for adhesions, implants, and cysts and total score number of endometriotic implantsEndometrial release of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 directly correlated with number of implants (r = .64, P < .005) and score for implants (r = .61, P < .005). There was no significant correlation between levels of the soluble molecule and score for adhesions or total score. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 shed by endometrium did not correlate with the score for ovarian cysts, although an inverse relationship was found with ovarian cyst diameter (r = -0.52, P < .05). No differences were detected between women who had pelvic pain and those who did not and between those who had previous surgery for endometriosis and those who had not.The association between endometrial release of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and the number and score of endometriotic implants suggests that the molecule might be of value in evaluating spread potential of refluxed endometrium.
