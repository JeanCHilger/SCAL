Cytohistologic correlation between AGUS and biopsy-detected lesions in postmenopausal women. To evaluate histologic findings in patients aged 50 and older whose cervical smears revealed atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS).Computerized records spanning a four-year period were retrospectively analyzed. Thirty patients over age 50 had cervical smears interpreted as AGUS and had follow-up biopsies within 12 months following the abnormal smear. The most important histologic diagnosis from the biopsy specimens was correlated with the subcategory of the cervical smear.Five smears interpreted as AGUS, favor reactive, revealed abnormal histology in four cases: three endometrial polyps and one squamous carcinoma. Two smears interpreted as AGUS, favor dysplasia, revealed squamous intraepithelial lesions on biopsy in both cases. Seventeen smears interpreted as AGUS, favor endometrial cells, revealed abnormal histology in 13 cases: 1 endocervical polyp, 6 endometrial polyps, 3 endometrial hyperplasias and 3 adenomyosis. Six patients with smears interpreted as AGUS, unclassifiable, revealed abnormal histology in five cases: two endocervical polyps, one endometrial polyp, one endometrial carcinoma and one ovarian carcinoma.The presence of AGUS in cervical smears from women over 50 was highly predictive of abnormal lesions detected by histologic examination. Although three cancers were detected on histologic follow-up, the most common lesions detected were endometrial polyps.
