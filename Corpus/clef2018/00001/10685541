Moderate and severe endometriosis is associated with alterations in the cell cycle of granulosa cells in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. To determine whether folliculogenesis is impaired in patients with endometriosis.Prospective study.Yamagata University School of Medicine, Yamagata, Japan.Thirty women participating in an IVF program.The patients were divided into four groups according to the cause of their infertility: tubal factor (T), n = 7 male factor (M), n = 7The percentage of granulosa cells in each cell-cycle stage.The mean (+/- SD) rate of apoptosis in the granulosa cells obtained from the patients with endometriosis was the highest among the four groups (T = 11.7% +/- 3.3% M = 5.6% +/- 3.8%Endometriosis impairs the cell cycle in granulosa cells. This phenomenon may have a detrimental effect on folliculogenesis.
