Differential expression of MUC2 and MUC5AC mucin genes in primary ovarian and metastatic colonic carcinoma. Colonic adenocarcinoma, the most common tumor metastatic to the ovary, may closely mimic primary ovarian adenocarcinoma, especially that of mucinous or endometrioid histology. The differential diagnosis is important for therapeutic considerations. Mucin gene expression is relatively organ-specific and may therefore have use in distinguishing between colonic carcinomas metastatic to the ovary and primary ovarian tumors. In this study, we compared the expression of MUC2 and MUC5AC apomucins in 10 colonic adenocarcinomas metastatic with the ovary, 10 ovarian endometrioid carcinomas (4 primary, 6 metastatic), and 32 primary mucinous ovarian tumors (12 cystadenomas, 10 borderline tumors, and 10 cystadenocarcinomas). Monoclonal antibodies CCP58 and 45M1 were used for immunostains of MUC2 and MUC5AC apomucin, respectively. All but 1 of the 10 metastatic colon adenocarcinomas expressed MUC2, whereas none expressed MUC5AC. None of the 10 endometrioid carcinomas expressed MUC2, and only 2 showed weak immunoreactivity with MUC5AC. All 32 primary mucinous ovarian tumors expressed MUC5AC. The percentages of MUC2-positive immunostaining for cystadenomas, borderline tumors, and cystadenocarcinomas were 0% (0/12), 50% (5/10), and 70% (7/10) respectively. These studies show that MUC2 and MUC5AC are useful markers in the distinction between colonic carcinoma metastatic to the ovary and primary ovarian carcinoma.
