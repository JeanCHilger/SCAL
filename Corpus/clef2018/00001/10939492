Adenosarcoma arising in hepatic endometriosis. We report a case of adenosarcoma arising in hepatic endometriosis. Both CT and MR scans demonstrated a huge heterogeneous mass containing septated, thick-walled cystic lesions. After enlarged right hepatectomy, the patient was asymptomatic with no abnormalities at liver and abdominal CT scan at 2-year follow-up.
