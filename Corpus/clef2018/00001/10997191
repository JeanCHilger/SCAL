Adenomyosis: diagnosis and treatment. The cells of the uterine lining (endometrium) may grow, in a aggressive fashion and invade the muscular portion of the uterus. This disorder is nonmalignant but is a serious and disabling disease called adenomyosis. The author presents an actual evaluation of the diagnosis and treatment of adenomyosis with a revision of the world literature, a retrospective evaluation of personal cases that includes a very unusual case of adenomyosis.
