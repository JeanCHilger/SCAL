Stem cell factor (SCF) concentrations in peritoneal fluid of women with or without endometriosis. In the quest for possible involvement of stem cell factor (SCF), a cytokine known to have multiple effects, in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, we evaluated concentrations of SCF in peritoneal fluid (PF) of women with or without endometriosis.SCF concentrations in PF collected from women undergoing laparoscopy were measured, using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to detect gene expression of c-kit, the receptor for SCF, was performed using the endometriotic tissue and the eutopic endometrium collected during the operation.SCF concentrations in PF of women with endometriosis were significantly higher compared to women without endometriosis. Looking at SCF concentrations in PF of women with endometriosis stratified by disease stage, women with stage I and II exhibited relatively higher SCF levels in PF, whereas SCF levels in PF with stage III and IV were comparable with those without endometriosis. The expression of mRNA for c-kit was detected in both the endometriotic tissue and the eutopic endometrium.We demonstrated an elevation in SCF levels in PF associated with endometriosis and the presence of its receptor in endometriotic tissues. Given the known pleiotropic properties of SCF, the present results suggest that SCF might play a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
