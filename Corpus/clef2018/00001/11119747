Peritoneal fluid concentrations of interleukin-11 in women with endometriosis. To determine the peritoneal fluid concentrations of interleukin-11 (IL-11) in women with endometriosis as compared with the control group.A prospective, controlled study.The obstetrics and gynecology department of a teaching hospital and a university immunology department.Sixty consecutive women undergoing laparoscopic surgery for benign gynecological indications.Peritoneal fluid was obtained during laparoscopy, and the concentration of IL-11 was measured.Concentration of IL-11 in correlation with the presence of endometriosis, its stage, and the phase of the menstrual cycle.IL-11 was detectable in the peritoneal fluid of 64% of women tested. Concentrations of IL-11 showed no correlation with the presence of endometriosis, the American Fertility Society stage of the disease, or the phase of the menstrual cycle.We found no evidence to suggest that IL-11 is involved in the pathogenesis of pelvic endometriosis.
