Postlaparoscopic small bowel obstruction secondary to unrecognized nodular endometriosis of the terminal ileum. Small bowel involvement by endometriosis occurs in about 0.5% of patients, but nodular endometriosis involving the entire wall of the terminal ileum is extremely rare. Endometriotic nodules protruding into the intestinal lumen may lead to chronic, partial, or acute complete small bowel obstruction and associated clinical changes. If obstruction is partial, preoperative diagnosis is difficult and seldom suspected, and no reliable diagnostic tests are available. At laparoscopic surgery, performed typically for associated pelvic endometriosis, bowel lesions may easily be overlooked, especially in women with abdominal adhesions from earlier surgery. Surgical injury, tension tears, or postoperative edema may contribute in such cases to the development of acute, complete small bowel obstruction, which may be difficult to differentiate from postoperative ileus. The patient may deteriorate rapidly and develop abdominal sepsis and multiple organ failure with high risk of mortality. Because of increased production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha by autologous monocytes, endometriosis may predispose to development of severe sepsis and septic shock.
