p21 gene codon 31 arginine/serine polymorphism: non-association with endometriosis. p21, an important regulator of the cell cycle, acts as a mediator of the growth-suppressing and -promoting functions of p53. We aimed to investigate the association between codon 31 polymorphisms of p21 gene and endometriosis. Women were divided into two groups: endometriosis (n = 102) and nonendometriosis (n = 119). The gene polymorphism for p21 codon 31 involved a base change from AGC to AGA and amino acid changes from serine (Ser) to arginine (Arg). Polymorphisms (Ser homozygotes, heterozygotes, Arg homozygotes) between both groups were detected and compared. Associations between the endometriosis and polymorphisms were evaluated. The results revealed that the distributions of different p21 polymorphisms in both groups were nonsignificantly different. The proportions of Ser homozygote/heterozygote/Arg homozygote in endometriosis and nonendometriois populations were 26.5/48.0/25.5% and 17.6/50.4/31.9%, respectively. We concluded the noncorrelation between the endometriosis and the p21 codon 31 polymorphism. p21 gene codon 31 arginine/serine polymorphism is not a useful marker for prediction of endometriosis susceptibility.
