Immunohistochemical analysis of the role of angiogenic status in the vasculature of peritoneal endometriosis. To investigate the angiogenic status of the vasculature in peritoneal endometriosis based on macroscopic appearance.Prospective study.University hospital.Patients with peritoneal endometriosis.During laparoscopy, 25 samples of predominantly red peritoneal lesions and 27 samples of predominantly black peritoneal lesions were collected from a total of 31 patients with endometriosis. Eutopic endometrium from 25 patients with endometriosis was collected by curettage during laparoscopy or just after surgery.A proliferating endothelial cell index (PCI) was determined by calculating the percentage of microvessels that contained proliferating endothelial cells. A vessel maturation index (VMI) was determined by calculating the percentage of microvessels showing colocalization of CD34- and alpha-SMA-positive staining.Peritoneal endometriotic tissues had extremely low or null PCI. The VMI of red peritoneal lesions was significantly lower than that of black ones. Vessel maturation index of red lesions was higher that that of proliferative eutopic endometrium and similar to that of secretory eutopic endometrium.Compared with the case of black peritoneal lesions, red lesions had a much higher fraction of immature vessels.
