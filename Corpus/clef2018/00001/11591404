High omega-3:omega-6 fatty acid ratios in culture medium reduce endometrial-cell survival in combined endometrial gland and stromal cell cultures from women with and without endometriosis. To study the effects of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) on in vitro proliferation of endometrial cells and their production of the cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8).In vitro study.Obstetrics and gynecology department, University of Aberdeen.Women attending an infertility clinic.In vitro cell cultures using culture mediums supplemented with normal and high ratios of omega-3 PUFA and omega-6 PUFA.In vitro survival and production of IL-8 by dispersed endometrial cells.In vitro survival of endometrial cells from women with and without endometriosis was significantly reduced in the presence of high omega-3:omega-6 PUFA ratios compared with cells incubated in the absence of fatty acids, in balanced omega-3:omega-6 PUFA ratios, and in high omega-6:omega-3 PUFA ratios. Endometrial cells from women with endometriosis secreted higher concentrations of IL-8, especially in the presence of high omega-3:omega-6 PUFA ratios.omega-3 PUFA may have a suppressive effect on the in vitro survival of endometrial cells and omega-3 PUFA be useful in the management of endometriosis by reducing the inflammatory response and modulating cytokine function.
