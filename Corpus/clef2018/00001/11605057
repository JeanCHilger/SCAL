Expression of angiogenic factors in extrapelvic endometriosis. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were immunohistochemically examined in both pelvic and extrapelvic endometriotic lesions. Different expressions of VEGF and COX-2 were observed in both lesions. VEGF immunoreactivity was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm of the adenocytes in inguinal tumors, but was not seen in ovarian tumors. COX-2 showed the same findings. These results suggest that angiogenesis may be involved in the pathogenesis of extrapelvic endometriosis.
