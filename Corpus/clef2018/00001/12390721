Expression of metalloproteinase-9 in ectopic endometrium in women with endometriosis. To study the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in ectopic and eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis, thereby to determine the role of matrix metalloproteinases in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.Both ectopic and eutopic endometrium tissue specimens were obtained from 30 women with endometriosis, and gelatinase activity in the specimens was detected by zymography and quantitated by Gel Documentation Analysis System.MMP-9 was detected in both eutopic and ectopic endometrium, but the latter contained higher levels of MMP-9 than the former did, and as the endometriosis worsened, MMP-9 expression tended to increase further.Endometriotic tissue possesses higher level of gelatinase activity than eutopic endometrium from patients with endometriosis does, and MMP-9 might be of importance for the implantation and invasive growth of endometriotic tissue that may lead to endometriosis.
