Diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a chronic and progressive disease that affects approximately 10% of women of reproductive age. Its aetiology remains unknown, however, factors such as retrograde menstruation, heredity, impaired immune function and environmental toxins have been implicated. Laparoscopy is still considered the mainstay for diagnosis, however non-invasive diagnostic methods such as transvaginal ultrasound and MRI may also be complementary. Treatment should be individualised and current treatment options include medical treatment and surgery, however, disease recurrence is common following treatment. Hormonal therapy induces atrophy of endometriotic lesions. Conservative surgery may be successful in removing visible lesions, however in cases of severe or incapacitating illness, removal of the uterus and ovaries may be necessary. In such cases, extreme care must be taken to remove all traces of disease. Experimental treatments for endometriosis show promising preliminary results and include GnRH antagonists, aromatase inhibitors, selective oestrogen receptor modulators and mifepristone.
