The laparoscopic appearance of Schistosomiasis may be mistaken for "non-pigmented" endometriosis. The authors report the case history of a patient with symptoms and signs suggestive of endometriosis, who was found to have Schistosomiasis. The laparoscopic appearance was of gelatinous deposits throughout the pelvis which were thought to be "non-pigmented" endometriosis. However, histological examination of the biopsy specimens revealed Schistosomiasis.
