Establishment of a new human cell line (EN) with TP53 mutation derived from endometrial carcinoma. We present a new cell line, EN, established from an invasive endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus in 50-year-old patient. The cells show rapid growth in culture with a doubling time of 24.4 hours and high migration activity. Monolayer-cultured cells were polygonal in shape and showed a tendency to pile up without contact inhibition. Subcutaneous transplantation of the EN cells into nude mice formed solid tumors that were histologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, whereas no metastasis was observed. Cultured EN cells produced tissue polypeptide antigen. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed high telomerase activity and estrogen receptor beta but not alpha expression. Using the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism technique, we have screened EN cells for TP53 mutation in exons 5-8. A mobility shift was observed in this cell line in exon 8. A nucleotide insertion (CGT-->CAGT) was detected at codon 273, which resulted in a creation of a stop codon at codon 308. This cell line thus appears to represent the development of a more malignant clone with divergent receptor function and growth behavior, and provides us with an interesting new tool for the study of tumorigenesis in the human endometrium.
