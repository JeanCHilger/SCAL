Mixed papillary transitional cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix: a clinicopathologic study of three cases. Although tumors consisting of a combination of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and adenocarcinoma have been described in the endometrium, they have not been documented in the uterine cervix to our knowledge. Three such cervical cases are reported in this article. Three patients, whose ages ranged from 40 to 61 years, presented with vaginal bleeding and malignant cells on routine Papanicolaou smears. The initial diagnoses based on a biopsy specimen were poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in two patients and adenocarcinoma with a solid component in the third patient. All patients underwent radical hysterectomy. The hysterectomy specimens each contained a polypoid endocervical mass with minimal invasion of the cervical stroma. On microscopic examination, each tumor consisted of a component of papillary TCC admixed with an adenocarcinoma of endometrioid type. Both carcinomatous components were immunoreactive for cytokeratin (CK) 7 but not CK20. The three patients were alive and disease-free from 10 months to 4 years postoperatively. Recognition of this unusual variant of cervical carcinoma is important to delineate its clinical and pathologic features and establish prognostic differences, if any, from other histologic subtypes of cervical carcinoma. Papillary TCC mixed with adenocarcinoma broadens the morphologic spectrum of transitional cell neoplasms of the uterine cervix.
