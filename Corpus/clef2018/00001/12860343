Investigation of glutathione concentrations in peritoneal fluid from women with and without endometriosis. Changes in the peritoneal fluid (PF) environment have been implicated in the pathogenesis of endometriosis as well as in the decrease of fertility.To evaluate the concentration of glutathione in PF of women with endometriosis.Twenty-one patients with endometriosis (I or II rAFS stage, n=11 III or IV rAFS stage, n=10), and 29 patients with follicular or dermoid ovarian cysts (n=17 and n=12, respectively).Mean (+/-S.D.) PF glutathione concentration was 0.22+/-0.01 micromol/ml in patients with minimal or mild endometriosis, 0.21+/-0.05 micromol/ml in women with III or IV stage of the disease, 0.24 +/- 0.03 micromol/ml in women with follicle ovarian cysts, and 0.23+/-0.05 micromol/ml in patients with dermoid tumors of ovaries. No significant difference in the peritoneal glutathione level was found between the groups.These results suggest that PF glutathione is not involved in the progression of endometriosis.
