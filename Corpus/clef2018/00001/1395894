Relation between macrophages in peritoneal fluid of endometriosis and infertility. Peritoneal fluid was collected from 18 endometriosis-associated infertile patients and 14 unexplained infertile women. The cells were counted in a hemacytometer and subjected to morphologic analysis. The phagocytic activity on Candida Albicans and on Sperms was evaluated and the activity of acid phosphatase in the pelvic fluid and within the macrophages were measured. The results showed that the endometriosis samples have macrophages of large size as compared with the macrophages found in unexplained infertile or fertile women, the concentration of pelvic macrophages in endometriosis is higher, the phagocytic and bactericidal activity is also higher and the macrophages in endometriosis engulf sperms as well. The accentuated activity of pelvic macrophages may be associated with the infertility in patients with endometriosis.
