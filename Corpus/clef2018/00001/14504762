Role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in establishing the indication for, planning, and following up uterine artery embolization (UAE) for treating symptomatic leiomyomas of the uterus. To describe the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in establishing the indication for, planning, and following up uterine artery embolization (UAE) for treating symptomatic leiomyomas of the uterus on the basis of the current literature and our results.Retrospective analysis of the MRI findings obtained in 130 patients before and after UAE. Presentation of characteristic MRI features and their relevance in establishing the indication for, performing, and following up of UAE. Discussion of the results in conjunction with published data.The intermediate results of UAE reported in the literature show a successful improvement of leiomyoma-related symptoms in 82-94% of cases and an average reduction of leiomyoma size by 36-64%. The typical MRI appearance of degenerating leiomyomas is presented together with that of relevant differential diagnoses. MRI findings allow for establishing the indication for UAE by providing reliable information on the location, size, and number of uterine leiomyomas. Analysis of 60 patients of our study population showed solitary leiomyoma in 16% of cases, 2-10 leiomyomas in 47%, and over 10 in 37%. Subserosal, pedunculated leiomyomas cannot be treated by UAE these were present in 5% of the patients. MR angiography is useful in assessing pelvic vascular anatomy before the intervention and identifies collateral vascular supply to the uterus. Contrast-enhanced imaging is suitable for monitoring successful devascularization following embolization and evaluating complications.
