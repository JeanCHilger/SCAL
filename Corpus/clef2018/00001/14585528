Endometriosis arising during estrogen and testosterone treatment 17 years after abdominal hysterectomy: a case report. To report the possible association between the use of oestrogen replacement therapy and endometriosis in a postmenopausal woman.We present a case of a postmenopausal, previously hysterectomised, woman who received hormonal replacement therapy and developed a large broad ligament cyst. Two years prior to her presentation she had been complaining of pelvic pain and deep dyspareunia.Pelvic ultrasound showed an adnexal cyst that was increasing in size. CA-125 was normal. Laparoscopy revealed multiple endometriotic deposits and a broad ligament cyst. Cystectomy and oophorectomy were done. Histology confirmed a diagnosis of endometriosis including the broad ligament cyst.Hormonal replacement therapy can be associated with de novo endometriosis including at sites, which are unusual.
