Serum carbohydrate antigen elevations in endometrial adenocarcinomas: characterization of DU-PAN-2 expression as a tumor marker. To characterize serum elevations of carbohydrate antigens DU-PAN-2, CA19-9, sialyl Lewisx and CA125 in endometrial adenocarcinomas (EMACs), particularly focusing on the clarification of DU-PAN-2 expression profiles.Sixty-four resected EMACs of endometrioid type were used. The preoperative serum values of four markers were measured and comparatively analyzed regarding the relationship between histological grade and clinicopathological stage.The overall ratios of positive cases were 26.2% for DU-PAN-2, 25.0% for CA19-9, 13.6% for sialyl Lewisx, and 35.5% for CA125. DU-PAN-2 decreased as the grading went up (G1: 410.3 +/- 243.8 to G3: 246.7 +/- 90.0 U/mL), however, the reverse was true with CA19-9 (G1: 123.9 +/- 147.4 to G3: 320.0 +/- 180.0 U/mL). Sialyl Lewisx showed a strong tendency towards high elevation in G1 (346.3 +/- 102.6 U/mL), compared to G3 (< 2.5 U/mL). CA125 increased markedly as the grading went up (G1: 43.5 +/- 6.3 to G3: 578.0 +/- 10.0 U/mL). During staging-up from I + II to III + IV, the positive ratios inclined in all four markers as follows: DU-PAN-2, 18.4-53.3% CA19-9, 20.4-40.0%It is suggested that DU-PAN-2 tends to be produced more in well-differentiated components of EMACs than in poorly differentiated ones. Since approximately half the cases with EMAC were serologically positive for DU-PAN-2 in stage III + IV, the marker is believed to be of much use for monitoring the cases with an extrauterine extent.
