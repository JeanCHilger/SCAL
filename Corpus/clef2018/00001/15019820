Immunolocalization of angiopoietin 1 in human peritoneal endometriotic lesions. To analyze the expression of angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1) in pigmented and nonpigmented endometriosis implants and specify its role in the interaction of angiogenic factors.Experimental retrospective study.University hospital.Eighty-two sections from 201 laparoscopic tissue samples of 43 female patients.Biopsies of peritoneal endometriotic lesions of macroscopically different forms.Angiopoietin 1 expression and location pattern in endothelial cells, periendothelial cells, glandular epithelium, and stromal structures.Angiopoietin 1 is immunohistochemically detectable in endothelial cells, periendothelial cells, in the glandular epithelium, and in the stroma. Differences in the expression of pigmented and nonpigmented lesions are not statistically significant.Pigmented and nonpigmented endometriotic lesions differ according to their clinical activity and angiogenic potential. Angiopoietin 1 is an important representative of the angiogenic factors and is involved in the angiogenic processes of these lesions. There were no significant differences in the expression and location within different lesion types for ANGPT1. Thus, it is not a direct activity marker of a lesion.
