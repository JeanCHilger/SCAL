Regulation of endometrial stromal cell matrix metalloproteinase activity and invasiveness by interleukin-8. To evaluate the effect of interleukin-8 (IL-8) on endometrial stromal cell metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and invasiveness.Experimental laboratory study.University medical center.Reproductive age women without endometriosis.Endometrial stromal cells were grown in culture and treated with recombinant IL-8 (0.0001-10 ng/mL) for 24 to 48 hours. Supernatants were collected for soluble assay of collagenase activity and gelatin zymography. Endometrial stromal cells were plated on 8-microm pore membranes coated with Matrigel or human simple matrix and treated with IL-8 for 48 hours.Collagenase activity and MMP2 and 9 activity of control vs. IL-8 treated endometrial cells, and number of endometrial cells that invade through Matrigel or human simple matrix.Collagenase activity in cells treated with IL-8 (1-10 ng/mL) was higher than in control cells. On gelatin zymograms, MMP2 and MMP9 activity of endometrial stromal cells was stimulated by IL-8 treatment (1-10 ng/mL). The number of cells that invaded the Matrigel or human simple matrix was 1.7-fold higher in the group treated with 10 ng/mL of IL-8 compared with the control group.IL-8 increases MMP activity and invasive capability of endometrial stromal cells in culture IL-8 may be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and menstrual physiology.
