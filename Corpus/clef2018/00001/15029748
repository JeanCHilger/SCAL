The use of magnetic resonance imaging for the evaluation of treatment outcome in uterine artery embolisation for fibroids. Of the study was to evaluate utility of magnetic resonance (MR) in the assessment of the women who fulfilled inclusion criteria for uterine artery embolisation as a symptomatic leiomyoma treatment and outcome of procedures.MR examination was performed in 220 patients. Uterine artery embolizations were performed in 170 patients.The reasons for disqualification were: no correlation between symptoms and size an position of leiomyoma--61%, adenomyosis--20%. In MR imaging dominant leiomyoma volumes were diminished by 59.6% (p < 0.05) over a period of 3 months.MR is the method of choice in the assessment of women referred to uterine artery embolisation as a symptomatic leiomyoma treatment. MR imaging is effective and objective method of evaluation outcomes of uterine embolisation.
