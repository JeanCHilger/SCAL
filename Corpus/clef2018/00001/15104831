Rectal endoscopic ultrasound with a radial probe in the assessment of rectovaginal endometriosis. To evaluate the accuracy of rectal endoscopic ultrasound and to evaluate endometriosis in the rectovaginal septum, rectum, and sigmoid walls.Validation of diagnostic test (Canadian Task Force classification II-1).Tertiary care hospital.Thirty-two consecutive women clinically suspected of having rectovaginal septum endometriosis without previous surgical treatment.Colonoscopy, transrectal ultrasound, and rectal endoscopic ultrasound, followed by laparoscopy or laparotomy.The disease was classified according to 1996 standards of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. Images obtained by colonoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, and surgery and histologic findings were compared. In 6 patients endometriosis infiltrated bowel muscularis wall, in 20 it infiltrated rectovaginal septum, and in the remaining 6 there was no evidence of lesions. In all women in whom infiltration of the intestinal wall was suspected, rectal endoscopic ultrasound and colonoscopy confirmed the lesions (sensitivity 100%, specificity 67%).Endoscopic ultrasound was useful in preoperative assessment of women with endometriosis.
