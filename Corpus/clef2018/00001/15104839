Laparoscopic excision of myometrial adenomyomas in patients with adenomyosis uteri and main symptoms of severe dysmenorrhea and hypermenorrhea. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging accurately diagnosed adenomyosis uteri in three women. We performed laparoscopic excision of myometrial adenomyomas and localized portions of adenomyosis uteri in all women in whom the disorder was accompanied by severe dysmenorrhea and hypermenorrhea. We used the same procedure as for laparoscopic myomectomy. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications, and patients were hospitalized only 3 days. The women's dysmenorrhea and hypermenorrhea disappeared by the end of the first postoperative menses.
