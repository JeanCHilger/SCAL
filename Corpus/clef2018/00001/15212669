Localization of mast cells in endometrial cysts. Although the presence of mast cells in endometriosis lesions has been reported, there have been no reports of their pathological localization in ovarian endometrial cysts.The localization of mast cells in ovarian endometrial cysts were investigated using hematoxyline and eosin and toluidine blue staining with light microscopy, immunohistochemical c-kits, and electron microscopy.Mast cells were identified in endometrial cyst tissues. Few mast cells were localized in the endometrial stroma, which is characteristic of endometrial gland-like regions. Many mast cells were noted around blood vessels and the interstitium with fibrosis, that is, the fibrotic interstitium of endometrial cysts.Mast cells may be involved in the development and progression of endometriosis. Localization of mast cells suggests a particularly close relationship with fibrosis and adhesion.
