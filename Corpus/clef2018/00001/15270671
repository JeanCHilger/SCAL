Current treatment options for endometrial cancer. In North America, endometrial cancer is the most prevalent cancer of the female genital tract. On the basis of clinical and histologic variables, two main types of endometrial cancer have been described: Type I tumors, which are usually well differentiated and endometrioid in histology and account for the majority of cases and Type II, which are poorly differentiated tumors, often with serous papillary or clear cell histology. Due to the early declaration of the disease by vaginal bleeding, approximately 80% of endometrial cancers are diagnosed at an early stage. Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without lymph node dissection remains the cornerstone of treatment. Tumor stage, histologic grade and depth of myometrial invasion are the most important prognostic factors. If myometrial invasion to 50% or more of the myometrial width and/or grade 2 or 3 histology is present, pelvic radiotherapy is indicated to reduce the risk of pelvic recurrence. Postoperative radiation therapy may improve local control but does not affect survival for Stage I endometrial cancer patients. Systemic chemotherapy is typically reserved for women with disseminated primary disease or extrapelvic recurrence. Although the combination of cisplatin plus doxorubicin is commonly used, carboplatin plus paclitaxel represents an efficacious, low-toxicity regimen for managing advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Recently, a significant percentage of Type II uterine tumors have been found to overexpress the epidermal growth factor Type II receptor. Anti-HER-2/neu-targeted therapy might be a novel and attractive therapeutic strategy in patients harboring this biologically aggressive variant of endometrial cancer.
