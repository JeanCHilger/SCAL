Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder: a clinical survey of 30 surgically treated patients. Thirty patients with adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder (AMG) were operated on between January 1983 and June 1990. They were made up 3.3% of patients who underwent cholecystectomy during the same interval. Of the 30 patients, ages ranged from 22 to 77 years (mean 52.3 years) and the male-to-female ratio was 8:7. Among the macroscopic types, 10 cases of generalized, 12 of segmental (S) and 8 of fundal (F) were noted, and the size of the affected portion in type S (0.8 +/- 0.2 cm, mean +/- SD) was significantly thinner than in other two types (p less than 0.05). Although the main symptom was abdominal pain, the majority of patients with type F had no complaints. Twenty patients (27%) were accompanied by gallstones including cholesterol stones in 60% of cases, and all six cases showing microbes in the bile had gallstones. Only six patients were diagnosed as AMG by preoperative imaging techniques. Other diagnoses comprised 15 of chronic cholecystitis and 3 of suspected gallbladder carcinoma. To identify the expanded Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and/or ultrasonography of the abdomen were most useful. No preponderant coexistent lesion other than gallstones was noted. Levels of carcinoembryonic antigen in gallbladder bile in cases of AMG (2.5 +/- 1.5 ng/ml, mean +/- SD) were significantly lower than in gallbladder carcinoma (p less than 0.01). All the patients were easily treated with cholecystectomy, and 24 patients who have been followed up after surgery are doing well.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
