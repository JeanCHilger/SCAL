Catamenial pneumothorax is a recurrent condition, predominantly affecting the right lung, of women of childbearing age, which is closely related to the menstruation cycle. Additional endometriosis and a defect of the right diaphragm is found relatively frequently. The case of a patient with a history of endometriosis, and a surgically confirmed defect of the diaphragm with prolapsed liver tissue, in whom pneumothorax first occurred at the age of 46, is presented.
