Inhibins and ovarian cancer. The inhibins are produced and secreted by several ovarian cancers. Monitoring serum levels by immunoassay may be a useful diagnostic aid in the initial assessment of this disease and in monitoring its potential recurrence following surgery. The assays are applicable to women after menopause when the majority of ovarian cancers are detected, and when the normal ovarian production of inhibin is low to negligible. A new inhibin immunoassay (total inhibin ELISA) has been developed with the intention of widespread clinical application. The assay readily detects granulosa cell and mucinous tumours. CA125, a widely used ovarian cancer marker, detects the other main ovarian cancer types (serous, endometrioid, undifferentiated) with high sensitivity. The combination of the two tests detects the majority of ovarian cancers with high specificity (95%) and sensitivity (95%). Studies have been undertaken to assess its application to women in the perimenopausal stage and to younger women during normal reproductive life. These studies are providing a platform for the introduction of the test into clinical practice.
