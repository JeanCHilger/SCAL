Endometrial glandular dysplasia: a putative precursor lesion of uterine papillary serous carcinoma. Part II: molecular features. Endometrial glandular dysplasia (EmGD) may be a newly defined precursor lesion of uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) by morphology. In this report, we studied molecular changes present in EmGD by the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) approach using laser capture microdissected tissue samples. Nineteen uteri showing at least 1 focus of EmGD by morphology were selected. These cases were 12 UPSC, 2 clear cell carcinomas, 1 mixed uterine papillary serous and endometrioid carcinoma, 1 uterine carcinosarcoma, 1 serous endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (EIC), and 2 EmGD involving endometrial polyps. Seven microsatellite polymorphic DNA markers (TP53 at 17p, D1S211, and D1S162 at 1p32, D17S1323 at 17q21, D17S1330 at 17q25, D5S346 at 5q, and D2S123 at 2p) were utilized. A total of 123 laser-captured microdissection samples from 19 cases was studied with LOH method. The frequencies and patterns of LOH were analyzed and compared among benign resting endometrium (RE), EmGD, serous EIC, and UPSC. LOH was observed for at least 1 of the 7 markers in all categories of lesions, EmGD, serous EIC, and UPSC. The frequency of LOH for EmGD ranged from 4.2% to 31.3% the range for serous EIC was 5.9% to 78.6%
