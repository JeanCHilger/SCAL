Expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 in ectopic and eutopic endometrium. To study the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9(MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in ectopic and eutopic endometrium in patients with endometriosis.The expressions of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in ectopic and eutopic endometrium were detected by immunohistochemistry streptavidin-biotin peroxidase (SP) method in 45 patients with endometriosis (study group) and in 32 patients with uterine fibroid (control group).In the ectopic and eutopic endometrium of group and in the control group endometrium, the expression of MMP-9 was respectively 0.381, 0.336 and 0.276 the expression of TIMP-1 was respectively 0.239, 0.253, 0.267. As a result, the ratio of MMP-9/TIMP-1 in ectopic and eutopic endometrium of study group and in the control group endometrium was respectively 1.594, 1.293, 1.034. The difference of MMP-9, MMP-9/TIMP-1 in ectopic and eutopic and the control group endometrium was markedly significant (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). The difference of the expression of TIMP-1 between ectopic and the control group endometrium was also markedly significant (P < 0.01). Higher expression of MMP-9 and lower expression of TIMP-1 in ectopic endometrium and higher expression of MMP-9 in eutopic endometrium occurred in the whole menses period, in which higher expression of MMP-9 in ectopic endometrium than in eutopic endometrium only took place in proliferative phase.The change of expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in ectopic endometrium may be related to the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
