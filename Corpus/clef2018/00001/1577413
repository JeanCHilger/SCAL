Minimal deviation endometrioid adenocarcinoma of cervix: a clinicopathological and immunohistochemical study of two cases. We describe the clinicopathological features of two cases of minimal deviation endometrioid adenocarcinoma of cervix. This is a rare tumour whose predominant pattern is one of bland endometrial-type glands infiltrating the cervical wall without a stromal response. Thus, it may be confused with benign conditions such as cervical endometriosis. The two cases demonstrate that this tumour may behave aggressively despite its bland appearances. An immunohistochemical study was performed and showed only focal reactivity of neoplastic glands for carcinoembryonic antigen, which would limit its diagnostic use in small biopsy specimens.
