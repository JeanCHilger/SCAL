Association between inguinal endometriosis and polycystic ovary. A case of inguinal endometriosis is described in a patient affected by PCOD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of this type of association reported in the literature although cases in which endometriosis was related to high estrogen levels are well documented. We suggest that in the presence of high estrogen levels (absolute or relative hyperestrinism), the foci of endometriosis might not prove a rare condition if clinicians and pathologists lashed for it carefully.
