Haptoglobin beta chain isoforms in the plasma and peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. To estimate the expression of haptoglobin (Hp) beta chain isoforms in the peritoneal fluid (PF) and plasma (PL) of women with and without endometriosis.Cross-sectional study.University hospital.Seventy-two patients with endometriosis and 35 controls.Peritoneal fluid and PL samples were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, silver stained, digitally captured, and compared by semiquantitative computerized analysis.Expression of Hp beta chain isoforms.No significant difference was observed in the frequency of expression of the Hp beta chain isoforms between the two groups. One beta chain isoform (HpbetaE molecular weight, 38.40 +/- 0.94 kDWomen with endometriosis have higher PF and PL levels of HpbetaE. Further investigation should be aimed at producing antibodies against the HpbetaE-specific epitopes to determine whether its measurement may improve the clinical diagnosis of endometriosis.
