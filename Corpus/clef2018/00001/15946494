Possibility of PTEN expression on predicting pathologic risk factors of endometrioid adenocarcinoma before operation. Fully estimating pathologic risk factors is important for selecting operation and predicting prognosis for endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Phosphatase and tension homology deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), taken as the housekeeping gene of endometrium, has the highest mutation rate in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. This study was to investigate the effect of PTEN on predicting pathologic risk factors of endometrioid adenocarcinoma before operation.Clinicopathologic data of 107 patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma were retrospectively analyzed. The expression of PTEN was detected by SP immunohistochemistry. Correlations of PTEN to high risk factors, such as differentiation, myometrium invasion, and lymphatic metastasis, were analyzed.Deletion rate of PTEN was 56.1% in the 107 endometrioid adenocarcinoma patients. PTEN expression had no correlations to histological differentiation (P=0.695), myometrium invasion (P=0.921), lymphatic metastasis (P=0.682), surgical stage (P=0.750), estrogen receptor (P=0.281), and progestin receptor (P=0.260).Detection of PTEN can't predict the high risk factors of endometrioid adenocarcinoma before operation.
