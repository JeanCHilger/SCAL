Ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the molecular profiles of different histologic types of epithelial ovarian cancer before the disease has metastasized beyond the ovary. Stage 1 epithelial ovarian cancers were chosen for analysis of early genetic events associated with different cell types. Allelotyping of 47 cases was performed using 224 polymorphic markers. Analysis with Fisher's exact test found markers specific for grade 3 tumors and clear cell histology. Hierarchal clustering analysis using dChip software revealed that the pattern of allele loss in eight regions on four chromosomes led to grouping of grade 3 tumors, endometrioid (grades 1 and 2) tumors, and clear cell tumors. We conclude that ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease in which histologic phenotypes correlate with distinct genetic patterns.
