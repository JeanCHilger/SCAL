Pregnancy loss and endometriosis: pathogenic role of anti-laminin-1 autoantibodies. Laminin-1 is a major multifunctional glycoprotein that forms an integral part of the scaffolding network of basement membranes, and is the earliest synthesized component during embryogenesis. This protein (alpha1beta1gamma1) plays an important role in basement membrane assembly and epiblast differentiation during embryonic development. Anti-laminin-1 autoantibodies are known to cause infertility and recurrent spontaneous abortion in animals. Recently, we reported that the presence of IgG anti-laminin-1 antibodies (Abs) in the blood is significantly associated with recurrent first-trimester miscarriages and subsequent negative pregnancy outcomes. Interestingly, these antibodies are also strongly associated with infertility, especially infertility caused by endometriosis. Laminin-alpha1, laminin-beta1, and laminin-gamma1 mRNAs were also detected in 90% of endometriotic lesions, and all laminin-alpha1, laminin-beta1, and laminin-gamma1 chains were localized to the basement membranes of glandular epithelium in endometriotic peritoneal lesions. ELISA showed specific reactivity of the autoantibodies to a particular region of the laminin-1 molecule, that is, the alpha1 chain G domain. IgM monoclonal anti-laminin-1 Abs, which we recently established, also recognized the G domain and cross-reacted with human alpha1 chain located in the basement membrane of the glandular epithelium of human endometrium. We also established an animal model that produced high titers of anti-laminin-1 Abs after immunization with mouse laminin-1. Anti-laminin-1 Abs from the immunized mice caused a higher fetal resorption rate with lower embryonic and placental weights. Thus, anti-laminin-1 Abs may be important in the development of autoimmune-mediated reproductive failures, and the assessment of the such antibodies may provide a novel means for noninvasive diagnosis of endometriosis.
