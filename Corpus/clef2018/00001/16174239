Overexpression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc gene products in human primary epithelial ovarian cancer. Cyclin D1 and c-Myc are key participants in the cell-cycle pathway, in which aberrancies have been associated with malignant transformation. To date, data on the relationship of expression of these proteins and histologic subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer are still scarce and discordant. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 12 normal ovaries and 47 cases of serous, mucinous, endometrioid, and clear cell ovarian carcinomas. No abnormal expression of cyclin D1 or c-Myc was demonstrated in any of the 12 normal ovarian specimens. However, compared to normal ovarian tissues, overexpression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc was observed in 42.6% (20/47) and 65.9% (31/47) of tumors examined, respectively. There was no significant difference of overexpression of cyclin D1 or c-Myc gene products between these four histologic subtypes of ovarian adenocarcinomas. This study shows that cyclin D1 and c-Myc are frequently overexpressed in epithelial ovarian carcinomas, but they are not correlated with a particular histologic subtype. Although our preliminary results need to be validated in a larger number of tumors, the abnormal expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc in epithelial ovarian cancer reaffirms the notion that they are crucial components in the pathway of tumorigenesis and deserve further study.
