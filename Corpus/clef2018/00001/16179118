Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors in the ectopic and eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. To study the localization and expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) Fms-like tyrosine kinase (Flt-1) and kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) in human ectopic and eutopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis.Specimens of endometriosis patients, aged (38 +/- 8) years, including 37 specimens of entopic endometrium, 34 specimens of ovarian chocolate cyst, 34 specimens of ovarian chocolate cyst, 15 specimens of red peritoneal endometriosis lesions, and 4 abdominal wall endometriosis lesions were collected. Specimens of endometrium of 33 patients with other gynecological diseases, aged (36 +/- 8) years, were collected during operation and used as controls. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the location and expression of Flt-1 and KDR protein in different tissues. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression of Flt-1 and KDR protein in different tissues. The mRNA expressions of Flt-1 and KDR were detected by RT-PCR.Flt-1 and KDR were expressed in the endometrial glandular epithelium and stromal cells besides the endometrial blood vessels. The positive expression rate of Flt-1 and KDR in the ectopic endometrium of endometriosis patients were 94.3% and 91.4% respectively, both significantly higher than those in the ovarian endometrial cyst (74.3% and 77.1% respectively, both P < 0.05), and similar to those in the eutopic endometrium of the endometriosis patients (93.8% and 90.6% respectively, both P > 0.05). In the eutopic endometrium of the endometriosis patients, the Flt-1 mRNA expression level was 2.4 +/- 1.2 and the Flt-1 protein expression level was 31 +/- 17, and the KDR mRNA expression level was 3.0 +/- 1.4 and the KDR protein expression level was 36 +/- 24, all significantly higher than those in the ovarian endometrial cyst (1.5 +/- 0.9 and 1.8 +/- 1.0 for the Flt-1 and KDR mRNA expressions, and 17 +/- 6 and 20 +/- 11 for the Flt-1 and KDR protein expressions, all P < 0.05), and similar to those in the eutopic endometrium of the non-endometriosis patients (1.9 +/- 0.8 and 2.3 +/- 1.3 for the Flt-1 and KDR mRNA expressions, and 24 +/- 18 and 25 +/- 16 for the Flt-1 and KDR protein expressions, all P > 0.05)VEGF may play certain biological role in the development of endometriosis through VEGFR (Flt-1 and KDR). The expression of Flt-1 and KDR in the endometriotic lesion appears to be associated with neovascualization.
