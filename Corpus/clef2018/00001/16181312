Utility and diagnostic accuracy of fallopian tube touch imprint cytology. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of cytology smears in distinguishing between tube and non-tube structures.One hundred cytology smears of fallopian tube and non-tube structures (vessels, round and ovarian ligaments) were prepared from surgically removed uterus and fallopian tube specimens and stained by the Papanicolaou method. The slides were reviewed blindly by pathologists and interpreted as tube or non-tube structures. The results were compared to the histological examination of the same specimens.Results indicated an overall accuracy of 97% with a specificity of 98% and sensitivity of 96% for cytology smears, taking histology as the gold standard. Positive and negative predictive values were 96.1% and 97.9%, respectively.Cytology smears are a convenient and cost effective tool for laboratory confirmation of tubal sterilization. This method can reduce the costs of laboratory examination, especially in developing countries, where tubal sterilizations are done in large cohorts. However, histological slides remain the gold standard in cases of medicolegal problems.
