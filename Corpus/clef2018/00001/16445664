Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the endometrium is a biologically distinct entity from endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCA) of the endometrium has a poor prognosis, although the biologic features of this rare tumor are not clear. In this study, we analyzed the expression of biologic markers relating to carcinogenesis, tumor growth, and progression. Thirteen cases of CCA were compared with cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EMA) of the endometrium. Immunohistochemical staining for p53 Ki-67
