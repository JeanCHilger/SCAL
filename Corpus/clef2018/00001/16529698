Primary culture and morphologic observation of eutopic and ectopic endometrial cells from patients with endometriosis. To explore the method of primary culture for endometriotic cells and to find out the differences in morphological manifestations among endometriotic cells and eutopic endometrial cells sampled from patients with endometriosis and endometriosis-free women.Endometriotic and eutopic endometrial cells were cultured by modified method of primary culture. The endometriotic cell types were observed and differentiated under optical and electron microscopes.The success rates for culture of eutopic endometrial cells from endometriosis-free women and patients with endometriosis were 91.67% and 93.75% respectively. The success rate for culture of endometriotic cells was 75.00%. The size of endometriotic glandular cells was similar to those of eutopic endometrial glandular cells from endometriosis-free women and patients with endometriosis. The chromatin was manifold and the nucleus was augmented in the endometriotic glandular cells. The endometriotic stromal cells were smaller than the eutopic endometrial stromal cells from endometriosis-free women and patients with endometriosis. Many tiny villi and protuberances on plasma membrane could be seen in the endometriotic stromal cells.The success rate for culture of endometriotic cells can be elevated through improving the method of primary culture. The ultrastructures of endometriotic glandular and stromal cells are obviously different from those of eutopic endometrial glandular and stromal cells from endometriosis-free women and patients with endometriosis.
