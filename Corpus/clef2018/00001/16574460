Endometriosis coaching. Coaching is a well-known terminology and an approach currently used, particularly in the worlds of company management and sport, but its use in the medical field appeared only recently. In the latter field, coaching bears behavioral and psychological aspects. It can not only be intended to a medical team, but also the practionner himself, for a better management of any disease, his patient for a better treatment effect and compliance and an optimal coping with the disease. In the case of endometriosis, a chronic disease, two key aspects are briefly reviewed to illustrate the benefits of coaching and to sensitize health providers to this approach. Thus, an appropriate diagnostic strategy should allow to reduce the delay in the diagnosis, so frequently blamed, and to identify other associated painful diseases. Also, management should be improved as well, not only by applying appropriate therapeutic recommandations, and alternative measures, but also by a better multidisciplinary support towards patient expectations with long-term guidance.
