A randomized study of laparoscopic chromopertubation with lipiodol versus saline in infertile women. Eighty-eight infertile patients undergoing laparoscopy were randomized to undergo chromopertubation with lipiodol or with normal saline. The cumulative probability of conception at 1, 3, and 6 months following laparoscopy was not statistically different between the lipiodol group (21%, 31% , and 43%, respectively) and the saline group (18%, 21%, and 33%, respectively).
