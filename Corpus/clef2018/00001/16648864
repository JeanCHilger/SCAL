Immunophenotypic diversity of endometrial adenocarcinomas: implications for differential diagnosis. Many endometrial adenocarcinomas, particularly those of endometrioid type, express estrogen receptors (ERs), progesterone receptors (PRs), and vimentin. This typical immunophenotype is frequently considered a standard against which others are compared when immunohistochemistry is used for differential diagnosis. We tested large numbers of endometrial cancers, enriched for high-grade tumors, to determine whether this reported immunophenotype was valid and whether expression differences between types of endometrial carcinoma could be exploited for diagnostic purposes. Immunohistochemical stains were performed on the following types of endometrial cancers using established methodology: International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) grades 1 and 2 endometrioid-42 FIGO grade 3 endometrioid-40
