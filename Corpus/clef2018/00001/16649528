Ureteral endometriosis. Case report. Ureteral endometriosis is a rare entity which may produce urinary tract obstruction with subsequent loss of renal function if treatment is not undertaken early due to its asymptomatic but locally aggressive course.We report one case of intrinsic ureteral endometriosis with unilateral renal failure (renal atrophy) and unresectable periureteral fibroinflammatory thickening involving vascular or visceral structures.We emphasize the diagnostic and therapeutic importance of a high degree of clinical suspicion about this entity, mainly in patients with history of genital endometriosis.
