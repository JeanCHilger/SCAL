The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device reduces CA-125 serum levels in patients with endometriosis. This study compared the long-term effects of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device with those of GnRH agonist administration on serum levels of CA-125 in patients with endometriosis. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device was found to be as efficient as GnRH agonist in reducing CA-125 serum levels.
