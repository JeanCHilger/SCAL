Urocortin expression is downregulated in human endometrial carcinoma. Urocortin (UCN) is a 40-amino acid neuropeptide sharing 45% sequence homology with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). The human endometrium expresses both UCN and CRF, and CRF/UCN receptors type-1 (CRF-R1) and -2 (CRF-R2). CRF-R1 activation inhibits cell growth and proliferation of a tumor cell line derived from the human endometrium, and the UCN signaling pathway has been implicated in tumorigenesis of several tissues. Therefore, we investigated whether UCN mRNA and peptide are expressed by human endometrial adenocarcinoma, and whether their expression changes compared to controls. Samples of well (grade 1 n = 6 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, of whom n = 1 with squamous differentiation, and n = 1 clear-cell carcinoma) and poorly differentiated (grade 3
