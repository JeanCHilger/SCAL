Vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-2 expedite formation of endometriosis in the early stage ICR mouse model. To establish a mouse model for endometriosis and to evaluate roles of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in the formation of disease.Experimental laboratory study.A women's hospital in China.Ten women with endometriosis and 10 control women, as well as ICR mice.Endometrial fragments were transplanted in the peritoneal cavities of mice at minilaparotomy. Transplants were observed and then removed for the assessment of morphology and immunohistochemical staining of VEGF and MMP-2.Observation of transplants, expression of VEGF and MMP-2.On days 1 and 2, glandular and stromal cells were viable at the margins of transplants. On day 3, the transplants were surrounded by mesothelial cells, and the endometrial glands and stromal cells were clearly viable at the interface. The scores of VEGF and MMP-2 of viable glandular cells of transplants were increased compared with the ones before transplantation. The scores of VEGF and MMP-2 of transplants from women with endometriosis were higher than those of control women.Endometrial transplants from the patients with endometriosis express more VEGF and MMP-2 than endometrium in control women, suggesting that VEGF and MMP-2 may expedite the formation of endometriosis in its early stage.
