Chromosomal alterations in 98 endometrioid adenocarcinomas analyzed with comparative genomic hybridization. The aim of the present study was to investigate chromosomal alterations in a large set of homogeneous tumors, 98 endometrioid adenocarcinomas. We also wanted to evaluate differences in chromosomal alterations in the different groups of tumors in relation to stage, survival and invasive or metastatic properties of the tumors. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used to detect chromosomal alterations in tissue samples from 98 endometrioid adenocarcinomas. All chromosomes were involved in DNA copy number variations at least once in the tumor material, but certain changes were recurrent and rather specific. Among the specific changes, it was possible to identify 39 chromosomal regions displaying frequent DNA copy number alterations. The most frequent alteration was detected at 1q25-->q42, in which gains were found in 30 cases (30%). Gains at 19pter-->p13.1 were detected in 26 tumors (26%) and at 19q13.1-->q13.3 in 19 tumors (19%). Increased copy numbers were also detected at 8q (8q21-->q22 and 8q22-->qter), at a relatively high rate, in 17 cases (17%). Furthermore, gains at 10q21-->q23 and 10p were found in 14 (14%) and 13 cases (13%), respectively. The most common losses were found in the three regions 4q22-->qter, 16q21-->qter and 18q21-->qter, all of which were detected in eight of the 98 tumors (8%). We also detected differences between the tumors from deceased patients and from survivors. Gain at 1q25-->q42 was more commonly detected in the tumors from patients who died of cancer. We noted that the regions most affected differed in the different surgical stages (I-IV). The results of the CGH analysis identify specific chromosomal regions affected by copy number changes, appropriate objects for further genetic studies.
