Expression of the inhibin/activin subunits (-alpha, -betaA and -betaB) in normal and carcinogenic endometrial tissue: possible immunohistochemical differentiation markers. Inhibins (INH) are dimeric glycoproteins, composed of an alpha-subunit (INH-alpha) and one of two possible beta-subunits (INH-betaA or -betaB), with substantial roles in human reproduction and in endocrine-responsive tumors. The aims of this study were to determine the frequency and tissue distribution of INH-alpha, -betaA and -betaB in normal and malignant endometria. Samples were obtained from normal (n=46), atrophic (n=8) and endometrioid carcinoma tissue (EC G1=93
