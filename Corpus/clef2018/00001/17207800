Detection of endometriosis with the use of plasma protein profiling by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In this prospective case-control study, we determined the role of surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry in the detection of histologically proven endometriosis. In the plasma of the group with endometriosis, there were 20 different protein peaks, and the classifier showed a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 80% in the diagnosis of endometriosis.
