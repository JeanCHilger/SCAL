Surgical treatment of rectal endometriosis. Intestinal endometriosis accounts for 8-12% of all endometriosis and rectal involvement is most often encountered in the context of deep pelvic infiltration. Intestinal symptoms, often nonspecific, are most typically seen as painful defecation or constipation worsening in the premenstrual period associated with pelvic pain, dysmenorrheal, dyspareunia, and infertility. Physical examination should include a pelvic exam under anesthesia. Endorectal ultrasound best evaluates rectal muscle invasion, while pelvic MRI and CT will evaluate the full extent of pelvic involvement and other GI sites of implantation. Only radical extirpative surgery of all intestinal, urologic, deep pelvic, and adnexal sites of endometriosis will permit relief of pain, prevent recurrence, and hopefully preserve fertility. In view of the frequency of extra-intestinal sites of involvement and technical difficulties augmented by previous surgical interventions, open laparotomy remains the preferred approach. A laparascopic approach would be reserved only for well-selected patients presenting with isolated colorectal involvement.
