Association between endometriosis and polymorphisms in endostatin and vascular endothelial growth factor and their serum levels in Korean women. The aim of present study was to evaluate the relationship between endometriosis and polymorphisms in the endostatin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) genes, and their levels in serum in a Korean population. Serum endostatin levels (but not VEGF levels) were negatively correlated with the development of endometriosis, specifically in early-stage endometriosis patients, compared with women without endometriosis, but endometriosis was not associated with the endostatin G(4349)A and VEGF C(936)T polymorphisms.
