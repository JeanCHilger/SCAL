Artificial neural networks combined with surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectra distinguish endometriosis from healthy population. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry protein chip array technology was used to detect the serum proteomic patterns in patients with endometriosis. Four potential biomarkers (8,141 m/z, 6,096 m/z, 5,894 m/z, and 3,269 m/z) were found. This method showed great potential in screening better biomarkers for endometriosis.
