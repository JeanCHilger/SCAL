Endometrial cysts of the vagina and the vulva (case reports and a literature review). Two cases of low-genital-tract-endometriosis are presented. First case is of a big endometriotic cyst of the labia minor, clinically presented as a Bartholin's gland cyst. Second case represents a vaginal cyst which mimics urethral diverticulum. In each case the final diagnosis was determined after the hystopathologial examination. A briefe literature review was done. Endometriotic cysts of the vagina and vulva are rare. Usually they mimic other, more frequently encountered lesions. Not always they have the typical symptoms of endometriosis and there diagnosis is rare determined before the surgical procedure and hystopathological examination. A detailed anamnesis, thorough clinical examination and additional methods (cystoscopic. imaging, sonographic) are needed for the diagnosis. Management consists of a surgical removal of the lesions, hormonal suppression of the ovarian function and, by all means, following up the patients for appearance of a recurrence or of a lesion de novo.
