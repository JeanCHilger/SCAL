Fine needle aspiration cytology in cutaneous and subcutaneous endometriosis. To study the role of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the diagnosis of cutaneous and subcutaneous endometriosis.We present 7 cases of endometriosis in abdominal wall, inguinal region and perineum diagnosed by FNAC. All cases were confirmed with histologic follow-up. Cytologic and histologic material was prepared using standard methods.The smears were highly cellular, showing a hemorrhagic background with hemosiderin-laden macrophages and sheets of epithelial and stromal cells. Occasionally, these cellular components were closely associated.FNAC is useful in the diagnosis of cutaneous and subcutaneous endometriosis, providing a rapid and accurate preoperative diagnosis.
