Adenomyosis: trans-myometrial biopsy. Myometrial biopsies were taken on 45 women less than 40 years old either by laparoscopy or laparotomy, searching for adenomyosis "in vivo". A positive response of 5 cases (11.11%) may prove adenomyosis to affect significantly young women too and not to be closely connected with the usually reported pathogenetic factors.
