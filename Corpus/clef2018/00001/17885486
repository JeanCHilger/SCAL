Estrogen receptor alpha and progesterone receptor expression in ovarian adult granulosa cell tumors and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors. The biologic role that estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) play in ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors is poorly understood. Furthermore, immunohistochemical data on these hormone receptors in this group of neoplasms are limited and conflicting, with many reports suggesting that expression of ERalpha and/or PR is either infrequent or present at low levels in granulosa and Sertoli cell tumors. Immunohistochemical staining for ERalpha and PR was performed in 69 ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors: 41 adult granulosa cell tumors and 28 Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors. Extent of expression was scored based on the percentage of positive cells: 0, 5% or less 1+, 6% to 25%
