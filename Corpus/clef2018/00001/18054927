Local lymphocytic and epithelial activation in a case of autoimmune oophoritis. To further define the immunological tissular modifications in premature ovarian failure (POF).The patient was followed up for premature ovarian failure and mild endometriosis associated with serum antiovarian antibodies. A laparoscopic ovarian biopsy was decided on to analyze the tissue and support the onset of immunosuppressive therapy. Immunohistochemistry was performed using monoclonal antibodies directed against T cell membrane markers, as well as activation molecules, to define the composition of the cellular infiltrate and the consequences on ovarian tissue.A dense infiltration of activated T lymphocytes was observed in close contact with follicular epithelium expressing HLA-DR and CD40.This observation supports the role of cellular immunity in ovarian autoimmunity with features very similar to those reported in murine models and other human autoimmune endocrine pathologies.
