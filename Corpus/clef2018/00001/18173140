Clinical observation on treatment of infertile patients with severe endometriosis by Kangyi Zhongyu Decoction combined with gonadotropin releasing hormone-a. To observe the therapeutic effect of Kangyi Zhongyu Decoction (KZD) combined with gonadotropin releasing hormone-a (GnRH-a) on infertile patients with severe endometriosis.Seventy-five infertile patients with the diagnosis of endometriosis confirmed by laparoscope who were scheduled to receive in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) were randomly assigned to three groups, they were treated respectively with KZD (A), GnRH-a (B) alone and combined of both (C), and IVF-ET were applied in the patients after 3 months of treatment. The clinical efficacy and adverse reactions in the three groups were observed and the changes of serum cancer antigen 125 (CA125) and endometrial antibody (EMAb) levels before and after treatment were tested.Score of dyspareunia in Group A and C was obvioushy lower than that in Group B after treatment (P <0.01). Pregnancy rate in Group C was higher than that in Group A and B (P <0.05), with the adverse reactions less than in Group B (P <0.01). The positive rate of plasma EMAb was reduced obviously after treatment in Group C with the level lower than that in the other two groups (P<0.05).The combined use of KZD and GnRH-a is a new method in treating infertile patients with severe endometriosis with ideal effectiveness and fewer adverse reactions, and it could advance the successful rate of reproductive assistant technique.
