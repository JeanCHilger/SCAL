Comparison of the molecular classification with FIGO stage and histological grade on endometrial cancer. To classify endometrial cancers based on gene expression profiling, and to compare the prognostic value of the classification systems based on gene expression, grade, and stage.cDNA microarray was carried out in 32 endometrioid endometrial cancers. Differentially expressed genes were identified among tumor tissues of different grades and stages. The classification and prognosis comparison analysis was performed between histological grades, FIGO stages and gene expression profiles.Class comparison analysis between different grade and stage endometrial cancer revealed 33 genes that are differentially expressed in tumors of different grades, ten in those of different stages, and 104 in a combined classification of grades and stages (p < 0.001).The cDNA microarray technique is a feasible way to generate gene expression profiles of endometrial cancer. Classification based on gene expression patterns may be more accurate than histological grade and FIGO stage classification in predicting the prognosis of tumors.
