Heparanase expression increases throughout the endometrial hyperplasia-cancer sequence. To assess the expression of heparanase in the different stages leading to endometrial cancer.The 38 examined specimens included adenocarcinoma, hyperplasia, and normal endometrium specimens. Heparanase, estrogen, and progesterone receptor expressions were analyzed immunohistochemically and the intensity was scored.Secretory normal endometrium and simple hyperplasia specimens expressed the lowest mean values of expression (1.00 and 0.63, respectively) the complex hyperplasia specimens and G2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma showed the highest values of expression (2.33 and 2.71, respectively). A linear trend (P=0.005) of heparanase expression was observed when comparing the normal endometrium and simple hyperplasia group with the complex hyperplasia+G1 carcinoma group and the G2+G3 carcinoma group. Evaluation of atrophic and inactive endometrium compared with papillary serous carcinomas yielded no significant differences. We found no significant correlation between heparanase expression and estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor expression.Heparanase expression was tightly regulated in endometrial tumorigenesis.
