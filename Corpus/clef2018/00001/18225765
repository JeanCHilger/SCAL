Comparative efficiency of intraperitoneal interleukine-2 and interferon-A in rats with experimental endometriosis. Intraperitoneal injection of rat IFN-alpha and human IL-2 to rats with experimental endometriosis led to complete regression of endometrioid heterotopies in 50 and 60% cases, respectively. Retention of the endometrioid epithelium resulted in a significant reduction of proliferative activity of its cells, degree of vascularization, and number of macrophages in the leukocytic infiltration of endometrioid heterotopies.
