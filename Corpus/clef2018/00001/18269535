Reproductive abnormalities in aged female Macaca fascicularis. Spontaneous reproductive tract abnormalities occurred in six female wild-caught, Philippine-origin, Macaca fascicularis. These animals were between 19 and 22 years of age and maintained in captivity for approximately 15 years. Clinical presentations ranged from asymptomatic to painful menses manifested as cyclical recumbency and lethargy. All animals had masses in the caudal ventral abdomen.Diagnostics included physical examination, complete blood counts, clinical chemistries, radiography, and ultrasonography. All animals had an ovariosalpingohysterectomy.Histologic diagnoses included ovarian granulosa cell tumor, ovarian pseudocystic cavitation with encapsulating fibrosis, uterine smooth muscle hyperplasia, uterine leiomysarcoma, and uterine leiomyoma with possible adenomyosis.The abnormalities discovered in these animals present novel insight into the reproductive diseases prevalent in geriatric female M. fascicularis, which vary from that previously reported in other non-human primate species.
