Imaging of female infertility. Medical treatment of a couple's infertility depends upon the cause(s) of infertility. The goals of imaging are to determine these causes (male, female, mixed, unexplained), to evaluate their severity and type on the female side central, ovarian, uterine, tubal, peritoneal, endometriosis, in order to propose an adapted treatment. Imaging modalities are essentially non ionising (US and MRI). Hysterosalpingogram retains its indication to study tubal patency, it can be completed by tubal catheterisation in cases of proximal tubal obstruction.
