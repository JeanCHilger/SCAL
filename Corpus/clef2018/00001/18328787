Diagnosis, imaging and anatomical classification of uterine fibroids. Uterine leiomyomata, commonly referred to as fibroids, are often accompanied by symptoms common to many other pelvic conditions. The correct identification of myomata and the exclusion of other diseases, especially malignancies, are imperative when evaluating therapy options. A confident diagnosis of myomata may be aided by several imaging modalities. The selection of an imaging technique should include an evaluation of both the benefits and the costs associated with the procedure. Imaging can provide information regarding precise myomata location, which may, in turn, dictate treatment options. Myomata may be classified based upon position within the uterus, and may be further described by phase of degeneration. With the increasing popularity of uterine-conserving therapy, accurate diagnosis of myomata becomes even more important.
