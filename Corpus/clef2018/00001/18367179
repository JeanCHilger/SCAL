Cyclooxygenase-2 overexpression in ovarian endometriomas is associated with higher risk of recurrence. Cyclooxegenase-2 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in endometrioma tissue samples taken from 109 patients, of whom 53 had recurrence by 30 months after surgery and 56 did not. Cyclooxegenase-2 overexpression, along with previous medical treatment of endometriosis and the presence of adhesion, is predictive of recurrence of ovarian endometrioma within 30 months after surgery, with a resultant sensitivity of 72.5% and a specificity of 72.4%, suggesting that there are intrinsic and identifiable biomarkers that confer recurrence risk.
