Rectosigmoid endometriosis with unusual presentation at magnetic resonance imaging. We report on a patient with a bowel endometriotic nodule that was hypointense on both T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) histologic examination revealed that the MRI appearance of the nodule was due to the presence of extensive fibrosis. Bowel endometriotic nodules with extensive fibrosis and limited endometrial tissue have a signal intensity similar to that of the muscle on both T1- and T2-weighted images. In these patients, additional techniques such as multislice computed tomography enteroclysis may be used for adequate diagnosis before surgery.
