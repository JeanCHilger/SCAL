The use of JJ stent in the management of deep endometriosis lesion, affecting or potentially affecting the ureter: a review of our practice. With the increasing number of operative laparoscopies performed for the treatment of deep pelvic endometriosis, technical difficulties and risk of complications inevitably increase. We report our experience using JJ stents, in women treated for deep pelvic endometriosis, with regard to prevention and management of ureteral lesions.Descriptive retrospective analysis between March 2004 and March 2007.Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France.Cases of women who underwent laparoscopic surgery for severe endometriosis and who needed a JJ stent in their management were recorded. Laparoscopic surgery was performed at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at CMCO-SIHCUS and Hautepierre Hospitals, Strasbourg, which are referral centres in the treatment of deep endometriosis.To evaluate the contribution of JJ stent in the prevention and management of ureteral lesions from endometriotic origin and/or iatrogenic origin in women treated for deep pelvic endometriosis.A total of 145 women had surgery for deep pelvic endometriosis. Seventeen (11.7%) women had a JJ ureteral stent inserted. In 82.4% of women, the stent was inserted pre- or peroperatively. We noted three ureteral complications, of which only one needed management by laparotomy.Except in extreme cases, management of ureteral endometriosis should be performed laparoscopically. Ureteral lesions whether iatrogenic, or secondary to endometriotic disease, can be treated by cystoscopy, JJ stent and laparoscopy. The combination of these three elements is the optimal management and is unlikely to cause subsequent complications. Laparotomy and its associated morbidity should be avoided.
