DNA-binding ability of NF-kappaB is affected differently by ERalpha and ERbeta and its activation results in inhibition of estrogen responsiveness. Estrogenic effects involve interactions between estrogen receptors (ERs), response elements, and nuclear proteins. It is hypothesized that interaction between ER and NF-kappa B may affect the regulation of responsive genes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed to assess if the interaction of ERs and NF- kappaB affect their respective DNA-binding activities, and alkaline phosphatase assay was done to evaluate estrogenic activity. EMSA revealed that ERs inhibit DNA-binding of p50 and p65, whereas p50 did not impair ER alpha binding. Stimulation with estradiol inhibited DNA binding of NF-kappaB in ERalpha-transfected endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). Moreover, activation of NF-kappaB significantly decreased estrogen responsiveness of Ishikawa cells and ERalpha-transfected ESC. Our results suggest that ERs downregulate NF-kappaB-dependent gene activation by directly preventing DNA binding. However, NF-kappaB-mediated inhibition of ER-dependent gene activation may be carried out indirectly rather than through a direct inhibition of ER-DNA binding. These findings offer new insight into the specific role of ERalpha and could eventually help in developing therapeutics for endometriosis.
