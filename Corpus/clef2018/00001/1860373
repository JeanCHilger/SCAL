Autoimmune reaction factors of infertility in patients with endometriosis. The presence of immunoprotein depositions in endometrium and antiendometrial autoantibodies in serum was detected in 59 infertile patients with endometriosis, 45 infertile patients without endometriosis and 11 fertile women by the methods of immunohistochemistry determination and immunodiffusion assay. The immunoprotein depositions in endometrium of endometriosis were significantly increased. The antiendometrial auto-antibodies in serum were positive in 32.2% for infertile patients with endometriosis, 6.7% for infertile patients without endometriosis and 0% for fertile women. This suggested that an autoimmune response might be an etiologic factor of infertility in patients with endometriosis.
