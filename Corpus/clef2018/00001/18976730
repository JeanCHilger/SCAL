The prognostic value of molecular biomarkers in tissue removed by curettage from FIGO stage 1 and 2 endometrioid type endometrial cancer. To analyze the prognostic value of molecular biomarkers in curettages of endometrioid endometrial cancer pathologic FIGO stages 1 and 2.Population-based survival analysis in 258 patients of classical prognostic features and molecular biomarkers of cell cycle regulation, (anti)apoptosis, proliferation, squamous differentiation, and PTEN/Akt pathway.With 74 months median follow-up (range, 1-209), 24 (9.3%) patients had metastases develop. Pathologic FIGO stage 2B (6% of all cases) and age > 68 years had independent multivariate prognostic value. Many molecular biomarkers were prognostic, particularly cell-cycle regulators p16, p21, p27, p53, p63, and the antiapoptosis marker survivin (which mostly stains mitoses). The strong prognostic value of a multivariate model with survivin, p21, and p53 overshadowed all other prognosticators in pathologic FIGO 1 and 2A.In pathologic FIGO stage 1 and 2A endometrioid endometrial cancer curettages, combined biomarkers survivin, p21, and p53 expression patterns are prognostically stronger than classical feature combinations.
