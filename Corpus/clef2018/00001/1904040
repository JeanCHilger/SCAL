Androgens and other hormones in buserelin therapy. 23 women of reproductive age were treated with Buserelin nose-spray for endometriosis, which had been diagnosed by laparoscopic and bioptic methods. The treatment period was 6 months. Various hormones in serum were determined after 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks during treatment. LH, E2, prolactin, progesterone, and testosterone concentrations were significantly decreased under Buserelin therapy, whereas there was only a slight decrease in FSH, free testosterone and androstendion. No changes were observed in the concentrations of DHEAS and SHEBG. Buserelin had no androgenic effect. There was a significant decrease of endometriosis as judged by the implantation score.
