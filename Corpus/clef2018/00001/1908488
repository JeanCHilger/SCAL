Establishing pregnancies after follicular stimulation for IVF with clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotrophin only. Data are presented on establishing pregnancies by IVF during 1987 using only clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotrophin for follicular stimulation. Of the 562 patients undergoing follicular stimulation, 80% reached oocyte recovery and 70% had at least one conceptus replaced. Patients having one or more (up to a maximum of four) conceptuses replaced demonstrated a significant increase in the establishment of pregnancies from one to two (14-29%: P = 0.035) and from two to three conceptuses (29-42%: P = 0.037). There was a significant decline in pregnancies when four conceptuses were replaced compared with three (P = 0.004). The data were also analysed according to the cause of infertility, specifically tubal, endometriosis, unexplained infertility and male factors only. After the replacement of conceptuses, the incidence of implantation and abortion was not significantly different. The incidence of pregnancy declined significantly after 35 years (26%) compared with women under 31 years (43% P = 0.043). Of 129 women having three conceptuses replaced, in those greater than 35 years (63 patients) 23 (37%) became pregnant whereas in those less than 31 years (65 patients), 34 (52%
