Endometriosis related to infertility. Endometriosis is a disease affecting fertility in many women. However, the mere presence of what is defined as endometriosis cannot be accepted per se as a cause of infertility or an indication for therapy. In the minimal or mild stage the activity rather than the presence should be the criterion for diagnosis as a disease. It is also clear that the endpoint of treatment of endometriosis in infertility is not the elimination of the implants but rather the inactivation or neutralization of its activity.
