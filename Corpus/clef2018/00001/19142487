Umbilical endometriosis without previous pelvic surgery. to present a series of cases of umbilical endometriosis in patients in reproductive age, with no previous pelvic surgery.four patients aged between 33 and 43 years were included in the study. They all presented umbilical bleeding associated or not with pelvic pain, and medical history varied from two months to four years. Abdominal wall ultrasound was performed for diagnosis support before surgical excision of the umbilical lesions, and histological examination was also performed.the ultrasonographic evaluation of the four patients showed hypoechogenic umbilical lesion suggestive of endometriosis. All patients were submitted to surgical excision and histological examination of the lesions. CA-125 serum levels were measured in three of the patients, but they were within normal ranges (from 6.8 to 10.1 U/mL). In addition to umbilical surgery, laparoscopy was performed in all patients, but only one presented concomitant pelvic endometriosis. In a one-year follow-up, patients maintained asymptomatic and there was no recurrence of the lesions.umbilical endometriosis is a rare entity, but it may be remembered as a possibility in cases of umbilical nodulations or bleeding, even if there is no previous history of pelvic surgery with endometrial manipulation. Its treatment is always surgical and, in general, it is enough to promote complete elimination of the lesion and of the symptoms.
