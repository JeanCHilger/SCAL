Nonhuman primate models for translational research in endometriosis. Endometriosis, defined as the ectopic presence of endometrial-like cells, is associated with infertility and pelvic pain in women. Whereas pathogenesis and spontaneous evolution of endometriosis are still poorly understood, recurrences after surgical therapy or after medical treatment are common. Spontaneous endometriosis occurs only in women and in nonhuman primates (NHPs). Inbred rhesus monkeys kept in colonies offer an attractive preclinical model to study the inheritance of spontaneous endometriosis. Baboons with spontaneous or induced endometriosis appear to be the best NHP model to study pathogenesis, pathophysiology, spontaneous evolution and new medical treatment options. In baboons, induction of endometriosis after intrapelvic injection of menstrual endometrium leads to biological changes in peritoneal cavity and in endometrium. This induction process may allows the study of cause-effect relationships which may lead to the discovery of new biomarkers for the development of new non-invasive diagnostic tests and drugs that may prevent or treat endometriosis.
