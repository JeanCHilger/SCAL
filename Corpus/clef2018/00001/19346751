Implantation: physiology, pathology and therapeutic options in disorders of implantation. So far, implantation is a poorly understood process, which involves several paradoxical cell-biological mechanisms. First, 50% of the embryo is paternal and immunologically foreign material, and second, both the endometrium and embryo are covered by epithelial tissue to prevent cellular fusion. The adhesion and invasion of the blastocyst require an accurate coordination of embryonic and endometrial physiology and the modulation of maternal immune tolerance. Endometrial function plays an important role in assisted reproduction. Pathologies such as fibroids, hydrosalpinges, endometriosis and the polycystic ovary syndrome have a significant negative impact on implantation but can be treated in most cases. Therapeutic strategies to improve endometrial and embryonic function in recurrent implantation disorders are however still controversially discussed.
