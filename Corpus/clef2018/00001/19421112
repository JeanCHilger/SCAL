Pelvic MRI at 3.0 Tesla. High resolution MR imaging is ideal for pelvic imaging. To achieve good image quality at 3.0 Tesla MR, one may not simply import protocols used at 1.5 Tesla MR. Issues specific to 3.0 Tesla MR imaging must be considered including chemical shift, magnetic susceptibility, dielectric effect, specific absorption rates (SAR), motion artifacts and optimal echo time (TE) and repetition tome (TR) to achieve the desired tissue contrast. High quality pelvic MRI (prostate, rectum, and female pelvis) at 3.0 Tesla is possible. In addition, it offers potential advantages due to its ability to provide excellent vascular imaging and advances with functional imaging (diffusion, spectroscopy). This article discusses the parameters required to achieve quality pelvic imaging at 3.0 Tesla, the specifics of high-field MR imaging, and illustrates achievable clinical results.
