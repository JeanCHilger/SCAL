GnRH analogue remarkably down-regulates inflammatory proteins in peritoneal fluid proteome of women with endometriosis. To determine the changes in the peritoneal fluid proteome of women with endometriosis determined by the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH-a).Peritoneal fluid samples were collected during laparoscopy from patients under GnRH-a and from women who did not receive any type of hormonal treatment in the 6 months before surgery. Samples were subjected to 2-D gel electrophoresis and compared by computerized analysis. Protein spots differentially expressed between the study groups were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.More than 470 protein spots were analyzed. Several proteins with significant alterations were found. The down-regulated molecules were isoforms of alpha 2-HS glycoprotein, alpha 1-antitrypsin, S100-A8, haptoglobin alpha chain and vitamin D-binding protein. No protein spot had significantly higher expression in peritoneal fluid of women under GnRH-a than in untreated patients.Several inflammatory molecules present in peritoneal fluid are down-regulated during treatment with GnRH-a administration of this drug reduces the inflammation in the peritoneal cavity.
