Expression of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) and angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptors in human granulosa-lutein (GL) cells: correlation with infertility diagnoses. To correlate angiotensin II (AngII) receptor expression by granulosa-lutein (GL) cells from gonadotropin-stimulated follicles with infertility diagnosis and IVF parameters.The mRNA of angiotensin receptors type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) was studied in aspirated GL cells.University laboratory and private IVF center.Seventy-three IVF patients.Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis for relative expression of AT1 and AT2 receptor mRNA in women with no ovarian factor (NOF), poor ovarian reserve (PR), endometriosis (ENDO), and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Expression of AT1 and AT2 receptor mRNA.There was a constant approximately 7:1 ratio between AT1 and AT2 receptors and a negative correlation between the AT1/AT2 ratio and patient age. There were statistically significant differences in AngII receptors in individual conditions: NOF showed a correlation between AT1 and AT2 receptors and a negative correlation between AT1 receptor expression, embryo fragmentation and number of metaphase II (MII) oocytes PR showed a negative correlation between AT2 receptor expression and number of MII oocytesMural GL cells express AT1 receptor much more than AT2 receptor. AngII receptor expression varies with age and infertility diagnosis. Low expression of AngII receptors was associated with high-dose stimulation in women with PR. Embryo fragmentation in NOF is associated with decreased AT1 receptor expression, supporting a role for AngII in GL cell apoptosis.
