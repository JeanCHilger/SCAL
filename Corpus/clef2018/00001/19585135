Post-hysterectomy menstruation: a rare phenomenon. Post-menopausal bleeding is a common problem with varied etiology in the age group between 50 and 60 years. It is more likely to be of some pathologic cause which needs to be ruled out. Bleeding in a patient after hysterectomy is even rarer with varied causes like atrophic vaginitis, cervical stump cancer, infiltrating ovarian tumors, estrogen secreting tumors in other parts of the body. Endometriosis of the vault sometimes can cause post-menopausal bleeding. Diverticulitis of the bowel may give rise to vaginal discharge due to fistula, but bleeding is rare. Bladder pathology may cause vaginal bleeding. Our case is a rare case of vault endometriosis and should always be kept as a differential diagnosis in patients with bleeding after hysterectomy.
