Immunophenotypic features of MELF pattern invasion in endometrial adenocarcinoma: evidence for epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas (EEC) may show a distinctive morphological alteration characterized by the presence of microcystic, elongated and fragmented ('MELF') glands. These changes share features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in carcinomas arising at other sites. The aim was to compare the immunophenotypic profile of MELF-type epithelium with conventional glandular areas of EEC.Twenty-one EEC were stained immunohistochemically for cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, CK7, vimentin, oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and E-cadherin. Conventional tumour glands usually showed preserved membranous E-cadherin immunoreactivity with peripheral accentuation of vimentin and hormone receptor expression. MELF-type invasion was characterized by strong CK7 expression, sometimes in contrast to adjacent unstained tumour glands. MELF areas were usually negative for hormone receptors and showed reduced E-cadherin expression.The expression of hormone receptors and intermediate filaments shows specific distribution patterns within EEC. MELF pattern invasion shows an altered immunophenotype compared with conventional glandular tumour areas. These findings suggest that MELF-type invasion represents a specific tumour alteration, and the reduction in hormone receptor and E-cadherin expression would be consistent with EMT. Immunohistochemical studies of EEC should consider micro anatomical variations in immunoreactivity, since these may be relevant to tumour invasion and progression.
