Association of interleukin 1beta gene (+3953) polymorphism and severity of endometriosis in Turkish women. Endometriosis is regarded as a complex trait, in which genetic and environmental factors contribute to the disease phenotype. We investigated whether the interleukin (IL) 1beta (+3953) polymorphism is associated with the severity of endometriosis. Diagnosis of endometriosis was made on the basis of laparoscopic findings. Stage of endometriosis was determined according to the Revised American Fertility Society classification. 118 women were enrolled in the study. 78 women did not have endometriosis, 6 women had stage I, 3 had stage II, 13 had stage III and 18 had stage IV endometriosis. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), and agarose gel electrophoresis techniques were used to determine the IL 1beta (+3953) genotype. Frequencies of the IL-1beta (+3953) genotypes in the control group were: CC, 0.397 TT, 0.115
