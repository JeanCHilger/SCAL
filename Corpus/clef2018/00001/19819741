Ovarian gonadotropic inhibition and endometriosis. About fighting false dogmas.... Ovarian gonadotropic inhibition is today an efficacious tool in the treatment of endometriosis mainly when associated with surgery and sometimes by itself. However, to be useful, this inhibition must be stable - without any cyclical looseness - of long duration, sometimes during years and sufficiently powerful. Depending on the severity of symptoms and that of the disease, the choice will be among GnRH agonists, gestagens and combined OCs. The recent development of continuous oral contraception with protracted amenorrhoea makes treatment by continuous hormonal administration easier for the patients with endometriosis.
