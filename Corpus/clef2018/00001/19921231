Decreased expression of Beclin 1 in eutopic endometrium of women with adenomyosis. Researchers have launched a new area of febrile investigations on the autophagy-related gene Beclin 1. Our aim is to investigate whether Beclin 1 expression is altered in eutopic endometrium of women with adenomyosis and its association with clinical characteristics.We collected tissue samples from the eutopic endometria of 30 women with adenomyosis and 32 healthy women undergoing surgery for benign indications. We cultured the stromal cells of the eutopic endometria. Beclin 1 expression of the cultured stromal cells and tissues was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis.Beclin 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in cultured stromal cells of eutopic endometria and endometrial tissues of women with adenomyosis was significantly lower than that of controls (P < 0.05). Beclin 1 protein expression in cultured stromal cells of eutopic endometria and endometrial tissues of adenomyosis was also significantly lower compared with that of controls (P < 0.01). Beclin 1 protein expression in eutopic endometrial tissues was negatively correlated with serum CA125 (r = -0.307, P = 0.015), and pelvic pain (r = -0.542, P = 0.000).The study revealed Beclin 1 mRNA and protein expression were significantly decreased in eutopic endometria of women with adenomyosis. Moreover, Beclin 1 was negatively correlated with serum CA125 and pelvic pain. Beclin 1 might contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of endometriosis. Further research on autophagy of adenomyosis is required.
