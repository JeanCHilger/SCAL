Basic research into endometriosis. Are we going in the right direction?. Endometriosis is a common gynaecological syndrome of unknown aetiology. The most widely accepted hypothesis for the development of endometriosis is retrograde menstruation. However, some other factor renders certain women susceptible to the implantation and growth of ectopic endometrium. Angiogenesis appears to be one of the process involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Angiogenic factors are increased in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis in peritoneal implants and in ovarian endometriomas. We believe that the optimal serum marker should be used to monitor the response of new antiangiogenic agents in endometriosis treatment.
