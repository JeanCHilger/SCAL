Abnormal regulation of chemokine TECK and its receptor CCR9 in the endometriotic milieu is involved in pathogenesis of endometriosis by way of enhancing invasiveness of endometrial stromal cells. The chemokine thymus-expressed chemokine (TECK), which regulates T-cell development and tissue-specific homing, has been identified as a potential contributor to the pathogenesis and progression of endometriosis. Dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, TCDD), an air pollutant, and estrogen also appear to be involved in endometriosis. Both endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) and the combination of 17beta-estradiol and TCDD increase the secretion of TECK in the endometriosis-associated cells and promote the invasiveness of ESCs by increasing expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. Anti-TECK neutralizing antibodies can effectively inhibit the invasiveness of ESCs and the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the cells. Interestingly, the expression of chemokine C receptor 9 (CCR9) and its ligand TECK increases significantly in the endometriotic milieu of patients with endometriosis. Therefore, the over-expressed TECK interacts with CCR9 on the ESCs in the endometriotic milieu, which may contribute to the onset and progression of endometriosis.
