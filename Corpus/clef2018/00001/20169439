Anterior pelvic endometriosis: MRI features. Many atypical locations for deep endometriosis exist that are not well known to both the radiologist and gynecologist. This work explores these unusual localizations, which we have arbitrarily grouped under the term "anterior endometriosis" in contrast to the more common posterior presentation of deep endometriosis that has been so well described in the literature. Parietal and inguinal involvement is first detailed, followed by a description of deep endometriosis involving the urinary system and anterior supporting ligaments of the uterus. A necessary adaptation to the MRI protocol in order to accurately diagnosis deep anterior endometriosis as well as specific diagnostic criteria for each type of lesion is reviewed.
