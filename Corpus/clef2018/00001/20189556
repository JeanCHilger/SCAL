Effects of excision of ovarian endometrioma on the antral follicle count and collected oocytes for in vitro fertilization. We compared the response of operated and nonoperated ovaries to gonadotropin stimulation in 38 women who had had excision of ovarian endometrioma. The antral follicle count, numbers of dominant follicles, and number of oocytes collected in the operated ovaries were significantly lower than in the nonoperated ovaries suggesting reduced ovarian reserve after excision of ovarian endometrioma.
