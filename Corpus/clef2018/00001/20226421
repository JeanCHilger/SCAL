Large-muscle endometriosis involving the adductor tight compartment: case report. Extrapelvic endometriosis is an uncommon condition but can involve nearly every organ, resulting in a wide range of clinical manifestations. Herein, we describe the case of a 45-year-old woman not a candidate for hormonal therapy who had cyclic pain in the left thigh associated with progressive impairment of walking ability. Clinical, instrumental, and laboratory data supported the diagnosis of endometriosis involving the adductor muscles compartment associated with ovarian endometriomas. Laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and local wide excision in collaboration with an experienced orthopedic oncologist were performed, and definitive histologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of endometriosis. The patient was pain-free at 6-month follow-up and demonstrated substantial improvement in ambulation and quality of life. Large-muscle endometriosis is a rare entity that can compromise musculoskeletal integrity and decrease quality of life. In this case, surgical excision in collaboration with an orthopedic oncologist was the cornerstone of treatment.
