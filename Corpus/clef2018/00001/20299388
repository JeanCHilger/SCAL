Multifocal polypoid endometriosis in a young woman simulating vaginal and pelvic neoplasm. A 27-year-old nulliparous woman presented with large finger-like projections protruding from her vagina. Intraoperatively there were deposits in the pouch of Douglas. Clinical presentation and history of vaginal bleeding suggested malignancy. Histopathology of both the vaginal and pouch of Douglas masses showed endometrial glands and stroma. There was no architectural complexity or cytological atypia of glands or stroma. Immunohistochemistry for oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and CD10 was positive. Based on morphological and immunohistochemical findings, multifocal polypoid endometriosis was diagnosed this is a recently described entity having a clinical presentation and age range completely different from conventional or non-polypoid endometriosis. Although an association between tamoxifen use, unopposed oestrogen therapy and polypoid endometriosis has been suggested, the patient had no history of tamoxifen or oestrogen intake. Polypoid endometriosis should be part of the differential diagnosis in young women presenting with vaginal growth.
