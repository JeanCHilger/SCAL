Imatinib decreases endometrial stromal cell transmesothial migration and proliferation in the extracellular matrix of modeled peritoneum. To characterize imatinib's effect on endometrial stromal cell (ESC) attachment, proliferation, and invasion in modeled peritoneum.In vitro study.Academic medical center.Twelve normally cycling women.Imatinib treatment in ESCs from women without endometriosis.Rate of ESC attachment, proliferation, and invasion.Imatinib treatment at 10 μM had no effect on ESC attachment. Treatment with 0.5 μM, 2 μM, and 10 μM of imatinib reduced ESC proliferation by 30%, 72%, and 76%, respectively. The 0.1 μM dose of imatinib had no effect on proliferation. Treatment with 5 μM and 10 μM of imatinib reduced ESC invasion by 30% and 73%, respectively. The 2 μM dose had no effect on invasion.Imatinib treatment reduces ESC proliferation and invasion in modeled peritoneum without altering attachment. Imatinib may have a therapeutic role in endometriosis treatment.
