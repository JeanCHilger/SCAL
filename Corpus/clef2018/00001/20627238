Detection of mitochondrial biomarkers in eutopic endometria of endometriosis using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. To detect specific mitochondrial proteins in eutopic endometrial samples from women with and without endometriosis and to build diagnostic models.Eutopic endometrial samples from women with endometriosis (excluding adenomyosis) and women with benign indications as control were studied by using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry protein-chip technology. After finding the biomarkers, the diagnostic model was evaluated and validated by leave-one cross-validation.Collaborative investigation in an academic research environment.Twenty-four patients with endometriosis (excluding adenomyosis) and 29 patients with benign indications as control.Surgical excision of eutopic endometrial biopsy of patients with endometriosis and controls.Mitochondrial protein expression.Seventy-eight qualified mitochondrial protein peaks were detected, ten of them had a significant difference. Three combined potential biomarkers, with mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of 15,334, 15,128, and 16,069, were found, and the diagnostic system distinguished endometriosis from control samples with a specificity of 86.2% and a sensitivity of 87.5%.We discovered potential mitochondrial biomarkers of eutopic endometrium in endometriosis and set up a diagnostic model. Further identification of the proteins we found will help to explain pathology, new diagnoses, and therapeutic approaches for endometriosis.
