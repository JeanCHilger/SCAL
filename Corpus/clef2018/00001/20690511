Scar endometriosis in the abdominal wall: a predictable condition for experienced surgeons. Endometriosis in surgical scars develops in 0.1% of those women who undergo Caesarean section or other obstetric surgery. Herein we analyse and discuss the clinico-pathological characteristics of 15 patients with scar endometriosis in the abdominal wall.Fifteen cases of scar endometriosis in the abdominal wall that were treated surgically in our department between 2003 and 2009 were examined retrospectively. Age, parity, complaint, medical or surgical history, pre/postoperative hormonotherapy, size of the mass, surgical procedure, follow-up and disease recurrence were analysed.This retrospective study included 15 patients presenting with 17 postoperative abdominal wall masses. The mean age of the patients was 32.1 +/- 6.0 years (range, 23-48). Eleven of the patients had a painful mass that became bigger before menstruation, two had palpable masses only, and two were hospitalised because of a mass with persistent pain. The locations of the masses were as follows: eight were close to the right side and three were close to the left side two were in the middle of the Pfanenstiel incision and two were in trocar tracts. The patients' surgical histories included Caesarean section in thirteen, bilateral laparoscopic ovarian cyst excision in one, and laparoscopic appendectomy in one.If a patient presents with incision pain and a palpable mass after gynaecologic surgery, an incisional endometrioma should be considered. Surgical excision and hormone therapy are effective treatment approaches in these patients.
