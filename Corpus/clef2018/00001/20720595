Neurotrophin in obstetrics and gynaecology. Since Rita Levi Montalcini and Stanley Cohen received Nobel Prize for their pioneering work on nerve growth factor (NGF), its role in female reproductive system has been reinforced in last two decades. The neurotrophins (NT) including nerve growth factor (NGF) are a family of related growth factors and their respective receptor tyrosine kinases that are of major importance in the regulation of neuronal survival and differentiation. While role of NGF in mast cell-mediated egg implantation and inhibition of rejection were primary concern at their time, in the ovary NGF can help in the differentiation process by which ovarian follicles become responsive to gonadotrophins. They help in follicular maturation, steroid secretion and ovulation in the ovary, by inducing the FSH receptor (FSHR). Due to the pleiotropism, NGF is mandatory for the success of pregnancy, while progesterone helping to maintain local levels of NGF in utero. In endometriosisi and polycystic ovarian disease it has major role to play. An autocrine role of NGF in breast cancer and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is evident now. Thus its study will infuse new insight in diseases of both obstetrics and gynaecology.
