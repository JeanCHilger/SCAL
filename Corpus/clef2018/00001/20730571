Immunohistochemical evidence for the over-expression of Glutathione peroxidase 3 in clear cell type ovarian adenocarcinoma. Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3) is a member of glutathione peroxidase family, exerting one of the most important cellular defense mechanisms against stress signals, including oxidative damage. In this study, the expression of GPX3 mRNA and protein was analyzed for ovarian cancer tissues to test its applicability as a biomarker that can distinguish the four major histologic types of epithelial ovarian cancer. A public microarray dataset containing 99 ovarian cancer and 4 normal ovary samples was downloaded, and GPX3 mRNA expression was analyzed. The expression of GPX3 protein was measured by immunohistochemical staining in 40 epithelial ovarian cancer tissues, 10 for each of the serous, endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell type. Histoscores were made from the immunohistostaining, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to quantitate the differences in protein level. Analysis of genomic dataset confirms a GPX3 overexpression in clear cell type ovarian adenocarcinoma compared with normal ovary and 3 other subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer at mRNA level. GPX3 also shows the highest average antibody staining intensities in clear cell type ovarian adenocarcinomas over the other 3 types in immunostaining on tissue arrays. This is the first validation of GPX3 as a clear cell type-specific biomarker in ovarian cancer patients' tissues by immunostaining. GPX3 may serve as an important molecular marker for the diagnosis and molecular understanding of clear cell carcinoma of the ovary.
