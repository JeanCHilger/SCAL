Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate inhibits nuclear factor-κB pathway activation, and regulates adhesion, migration, invasion and apoptosis of endometriotic stromal cells. The activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) has been implicated in the development and progression of endometriosis. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential application of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a potent NF-κB inhibitor, in the treatment of endometriosis. NF-κB-DNA-binding activity, IκB phosphorylation and expression of nuclear p65 protein in endometriotic ectopic stromal cells (EcSCs), endometriotic eutopic stromal cells (EuSCs) and normal endometrial stromal cells (NESCs) were detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and western blot analysis. Adhesion, migration, invasion and apoptosis of EcSCs were observed by means of adhesion, migration, invasion and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUDP nick-end labeling assay, respectively. Gene and protein expressions of CD44s, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and survivin in EcSCs were measured by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The results showed that PDTC in the absence or presence of interleukin (IL)-1β showed stronger inhibitory effects on NF-κB-DNA-binding activity, IκB phosphorylation and expression of nuclear p65 protein in EcSCs than those in EuSCs or NESCs. PDTC enhanced apoptosis, and suppressed IL-1β-induced cellular adhesion, migration and invasion of EcSCs. Pretreatment of EcSCs with PDTC attenuated IL-1β-induced expressions of CD44s, MMP-2, MMP-9 and survivin at gene and protein levels. All these findings suggest that PDTC induces apoptosis and down-regulates adhesion, migration and invasion of EcSCs through the suppression of various molecules. Therefore, PDTC could be used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of endometriosis.
