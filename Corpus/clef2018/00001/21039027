Correlation of mast cell density, tumor angiogenesis, and clinical outcomes in patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer. Tumor angiogenesis has been demonstrated in several kinds of neoplasms. There are evidence that mast cells can produce many kinds of chemical mediators with angiogenic properties. The specific role of mast cells in female genital tract cancer has not been well understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between the mast cell density, tumor angiogenesis, and clinical outcomes in patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium.Histologically, four-micrometer-thick haematoxylin and eosin stained slides of the hysterectomy specimens were evaluated. Microvessels were highlighted by CD31 immunostain and mast cells were stained by 0.1% toluidine blue. All clinicopathological characteristics were reviewed to determine their possible correlation to microvessel density and number of mast cells.A total of 46 patients who underwent a complete staging surgery were eligible for this study. The median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 32-70 years). The median follow-up was 27.0 months (range 3.6-83.8). Microvessel appeared significantly to correlate with the number of parity. The mean microvessel count was likely to be higher in women with non-menopausal status (p=0.07), advanced FIGO stage (p=0.09), and lymph node metastasis (p=0.08). There was no significant correlation between microvessel counts, mast cell density, and disease recurrence.Our data suggested that the number of microvessel counts and mast cell density did not affect the clinical progression or recurrence of endometrioid endometrial cancer.
