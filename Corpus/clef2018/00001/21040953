Conservative treatment of early endometrial cancer: preliminary results of a pilot study. This study evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of combined operative hysteroscopy (HSC) and hormone therapy as fertility-preserving treatment in a cohort of selected young women with early endometrial carcinoma (EC).Fourteen patients (median age 38 years, range 26-40) with FIGO stage IA (intramucous) EC wishing to preserve fertility were enrolled with the following inclusion criteria: age â‰¤40 years no evidence of Lynch II syndromeWith a median follow-up of 40 months (range 13-79), one patient recurred after 5 months from operative HSC and underwent definitive surgery, one patient showed an endometrial hyperplasia without atypia at the 3 and 6 month HSC control, with negative controls thereafter. Three patients have attempted to conceive and one of them conceived and term delivered a healthy baby.Combined operative HSC and progestin therapy may have a role for safe and effective conservative management of early EC in selected patients wishing to preserve fertility.
