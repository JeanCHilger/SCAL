Expression of γ-H2AX in endometrial carcinomas: an immunohistochemical study with p53. OBJECTIVE.: The most frequently mutated gene in human cancer is p53, a gene that functions in the checkpoint response to DNA double-strand breaks. γ-H2AX is a marker of activated DNA damage and is overexpressed in many malignancies and their precursor lesions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between p53 and γ-H2AX expression and the clinical value of γ-H2AX in endometrial carcinoma. METHODS.: We investigated 106 patients with primary endometrial carcinoma (type I/endometrioid, n=84 type II/non-endometrioid, n=20
