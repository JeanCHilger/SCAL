Immunological aspects of a case of extragenital endometriosis localized in the mouth. To appreciate the role of the immune system in transportation and development of endometer cells in mouth, authors reported the results of immunological parameters analysis in one patient suffering to a mouth localisation healed endometriosis out of hormonal therapy in experimental and analytic study. Immunoglobulin A, G, M and C3, C4 complement fractions were measured by Mancini radial immunodiffusion. The count of CD4+, CD8+and B Cell was performed by BD FASCalibur flow cytometer. Autoimmune diseases were searched after by measuring autoantibodies using agglutination and immunofluoresence methods. The results showed any antibodies detected and the count of CD4, CD8 and B cells was normal. However, IgG and IgA increased. But C3, C4 factions and IgM decreased. This seems an immunological disorder which could be more explored in NK cells and cytokines study.
