Associations between free fatty acids, cumulus oocyte complex morphology and ovarian function during in vitro fertilization. To determine if follicular free fatty acid (FFA) levels are associated with cumulus oocyte complex (COC) morphology.Prospective cohort study.University in vitro fertilization (IVF) practice.A total of 102 women undergoing IVF.Measurement of FFAs in serum and ovarian follicular fluid.Total and specific follicular and serum FFA levels, correlations between follicular and serum FFAs, and associations between follicular FFA levels and markers of oocyte quality, including COC morphology.Predominant follicular fluid and serum FFAs were oleic, palmitic, linoleic, and stearic acids. Correlations between follicular and serum FFA concentrations were weak (r=0.252, 0.288, 0.236, 0.309, respectively for specific FFAs r=0.212 for total FFAs). A receiver operating characteristic curve determined total follicular FFAs≥0.232 μmol/mL distinguished women with a lower versus higher percentage of COCs with favorable morphology. Women with elevated follicular FFAs (n=31) were more likely to have COCs with poor morphology than others (n=71Elevated follicular FFA levels are associated with poor COC morphology. Further work is needed to determine what factors influence follicular FFA levels and if these factors impact fertility.
