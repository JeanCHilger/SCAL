Relationship between adenomyosis and uterine polyps. To evaluate whether adenomyosis is associated with uterine polyps.To perform an ethical human study, we planned a large retrospective observational study covering the entire patient population of the ULSS 17-Veneto district who underwent resectoscopy in 2007 and 2008 (959 patients). We enrolled all the patients underwent resectoscopy with resection of uterine polyps, with resection of myomas, with endometrial ablations by slicing, and with endometrial biopsies in both the presence and absence of hysteroscopically visible lesions. The diagnosis of adenomyosis was made by pathological examination of tissue specimens obtained using a resectoscope loop. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine if adenomyosis was one of the various risk factors for the presence and number of uterine polyps. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 16.0) was employed, and pâ‰¤0.05 was the minimum for significance.Age (p=0.005), adenomyosis (p=0.013), high fasting glucose levels (p=0.004), and hypertension (p=0.045) were significantly associated with endometrial polyps. The presence of multiple endometrial polyps seemed to be associated with the presence of adenomyosis (p=0.016). The presence of cervical polyps was significantly associated only with presence of adenomyosis (p=0.002). The presence of multiple cervical polyps did not seem to be influenced by any of the variables considered.The results clearly demonstrate an association between adenomyosis and uterine polyps. The pathogenetic role of adenomyosis in the development of polyps should therefore be investigated further.
