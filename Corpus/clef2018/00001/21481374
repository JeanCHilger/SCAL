Colony-stimulating factor-1 exerts direct effects on the proliferation and invasiveness of endometrial epithelial cells. Although macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1) has been suggested to play a role in maintaining the chronic inflammatory response in endometriosis, our data suggest that CSF-1 may also play a role in early endometriosis lesion formation. We have shown that CSF-1, in an autocrine fashion, has a direct effect on endometrial epithelial cell proliferation and attachment to peritoneal mesothelial cells, early steps in endometriosis lesion formation on the peritoneum.
