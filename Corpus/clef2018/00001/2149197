Is peritoneal endometriosis painful?. Using a study of 306 coelioscopies as a basis, the authors try to define the relationship existing between the observation of lesions of peritoneal endometriosis and the symptom of pain. Certain observations raise the doubt of there being a cause/effect relationship (i.e. high incidence of peritoneal endometriosis in women without symptoms of pain, only 40% of cases of peritoneal endometriosis are associated with pain, very high incidence of associated lesions or psychiatric history in women with painful peritoneal endometriosis). While unable to rule out the responsibility of lesions of peritoneal endometriosis in the genesis of pelvic pain, they nevertheless believe that such an observation should lead the physician to be critical (is the pain psychogenic?) and thorough (investigation of genital or extra-genital associated lesions) before any conclusion is drawn. In certain cases, the reply will be given by the therapeutic test.
