Imaging features of granulosa cell tumors of the ovary: about three cases. Granulosa cell tumors of the ovary are rare, and included in the sex cord-stromal tumor category. They have a low malignancy potential and generally have a good prognosis. They are the most frequent hormone-secreting tumors of the ovary and may lead to suggestive clinical symptoms. Some biological markers (serum inhibinÂ B and AMH) may be helpful for diagnosis, though their sensitivity is not perfect. Preoperative imaging diagnosis remains challenging due to the wide variability in morphology and lack of epidemiological data in the imaging literature (small patient populations). From a review of the clinical and MR imaging features of three cases of granulosa cell tumor of the adult and a review of the literature, we will describe a few imaging features that may suggest the correct diagnosis.
