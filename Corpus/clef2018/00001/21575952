High prevalence of endometrial polyps in endometriosis-associated infertility. In a retrospective study, examination of 431 infertile women (158 cases with endometriosis and 273 without endometriosis) showed a significantly increased frequency of endometrial polyps in patients with endometriotic infertility and no significant differences among different stages and locations of endometriosis. Hysteroscopic polypectomy and removal of endometriotic foci significantly increased the chances of achieving a pregnancy compared with those without polyps.
