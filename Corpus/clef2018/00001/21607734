Polyps of the colorectum: non-neoplastic and non-hamartomatous. Non-neoplastic and non-hamartomatous colorectal polyps or tumor-like lesions comprise a very heterogeneous group of changes in the colorectal mucosa or the colon wall. Mucosal prolapse-associated lesions and inflammatory polyps, which are predominantly associated with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, are the most prominent examples for polypoid lesions difficult to distinguish from neoplastic lesions such as adenomas, hyperplastic/serrated polyps/adenomas and invasive carcinomas. The considerably less frequent tumor-like lesions like heterotopias, endometriosis, amyloid tumors and pseudolipomatous changes are histologically often well defined and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of colorectal lesions. The etiology, endoscopic and histological appearance of these entities and their most important differential diagnoses are discussed.
