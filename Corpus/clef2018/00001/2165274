Endosalpingosis or microcystic and proliferating glandular inclusion disease of the genital tract and peritoneum. Apropos of 6 cases. Endosalpingosis, defined by the presence in an ectopic site of epithelium comparable to that of the tubal mucosa, is not a well-known entity. In reference to 6 cases of our department, the authors have been able to assess this lesion. Clinical manifestations and laboratory tests offer no arguments. Cytology represents a diagnostic trap. The diagnosis may only be made histologically and is very often fortuitous. This benign lesion is often the result of a metaplasic process but, considering the difficulty of the diagnosis, the treatment is often surgical (total hysterectomy with castration). The course is uneventful.
