Combination of polymorphisms in luteinizing hormone β, estrogen receptor β and progesterone receptor and susceptibility to infertility and endometriosis. To determine whether the combination of PR (PROGINS), ERβ G+1730A and/or LHβ G1502A polymorphisms in infertile women with and without endometriosis and in a control group increases the risk of infertility and/or endometriosis.Case-control study including 201 infertile women with endometriosis, 80 infertile women without endometriosis and 206 fertile women as control group. PROGINS was identified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and ERβ G+1730A and LHβ G1502A were identified by PCR-RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism).A statistically significant difference was found for the combination of LHβ+ERβ polymorphisms among infertile patients with endometriosis and control group (p=0.003, OR=2.468), among infertile patients with endometriosis I/II and control group (p=0.002, OR=3.081), among infertile patients with endometriosis III/IV and control group (p=0.035, OR=2.136) and for the combination of LHβ+PROGINS polymorphisms among infertile patients with endometriosis I/II and control group (p=0.014, OR=3.081). However, the odds of developing endometriosis are not enhanced in the presence of the two polymorphisms, being similar to the odds when only LH polymorphism is present.Individually, the presence of LHβ G1502A and ERβ G+1730A polymorphisms is associated with infertility and endometriosis associated infertility. However, when two polymorphisms are present in the same individual it does not appear to increase the chance of developing endometriosis or infertility.
