Assessment of endometrial receptivity. To provide a focused review of the scientific literature pertaining to endometrial receptivity.Review of the literature and appraisal of relevant articles.Academic teaching hospital.Women with infertility.None.Critical review of the literature.Although a consensus has been achieved regarding the existence of a temporally defined period during which embryo attachment and invasion can occur (called the "window of implantation"), reliable methods to assess "receptivity" have not been established or adequately validated. In women with certain gynecologic disorders, including endometriosis, tubal disease, and polycystic ovary syndrome, endometrial receptivity seems to be compromised, leading to infertility and pregnancy loss. The establishment of reliable biomarkers for the detection of defects in endometrial receptivity has been a long-sought goal that remains an elusive target. The validation of endometrial biomarkers will require properly designed and implemented studies based on the recognition that endometrial receptivity defects are not equally distributed in women with endometriosis or these other conditions.Rapidly advancing technologies are bringing new biomarkers to the clinical arena that promise to further reveal the complexities of the implantation process.
