Prospective study of the correlation of ultrasonography and CA125 in the management of ovarian cysts: a study of 77 cases. To study the correlation between ultrasound, Doppler,measurement of CA 125 and histology in the preoperative diagnosis of ovarian cysts.Prospective and analytical study about 77 patients in whom we analyzed the contribution of ultrasound, the assay of CA125, the couple CA125 ultrasonography and laparoscopy in the diagnosis and management of cysts the ovary. The value of CA125 was considered pathological like the one adopted by our biochemistry laboratory of the CHU Habib Bourguiba, Sfax (> 35 UI / ml).The mean age was 35.6 years. On the whole, ultrasound has a sensitivity of 71.41% and a specificity of 80%. The positive predictive value was 35.71% and negative predictive value was 96.55%. The sensitivity of CA125 to detect malignant lesions among ovarian cysts was 85.71% and a specificity of 85.93%. The PPV was low (42.85%). The combination Ultrasound-CA125 had a sensitivity of 85.7%, a specificity of 82.8%, a PPV and NPV respectively 35.3% and 98.1%. The concordance between the macroscopic perlaparoscopic and histological diagnosis of different tumors was 83.3% for functional cysts, 77.7% for serous cysts, and 100% for dermoid cysts, endometriosis and bleeding.The contribution of Doppler ultrasound and tumor markers is essential in the diagnosis of ovarian cysts.
