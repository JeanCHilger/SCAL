Immunoexpression of PAX 8 in endometrial cancer: relation to high-grade carcinoma and p53. PAX 8 is a crucial transcription factor for organogenesis of the thyroid gland, kidney, and the MÃ¼llerian system and plays an essential role in cell proliferation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between p53 and PAX 8 expression and the clinical value of PAX 8 in endometrial carcinoma. We detected 106 consecutive patients with primary endometrial carcinoma (type I/ endometrioid, n=84 type II/ nonendometrioid, n=20
