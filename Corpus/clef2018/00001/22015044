Synuclein-γ (SNCG) protein expression is associated with poor outcome in endometrial adenocarcinoma. Synuclein-γ (SNCG) is a marker for adverse and aggressive disease in breast cancer. In previous study, we found SNCG mRNA to be overexpressed in uterine serous carcinoma compared to uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study is to explore the prognostic value of SNCG in patients with endometrial cancer.279 endometrial cancer patients were retrieved from the archives. The tissue paraffin blocks were stained for SNCG antibody and its expression was correlated with clinicopathological prognostic factors.There was a positive association between SNCG(+) immunoexpression and tumor grade, tumor stage, type II carcinomas, deep myometrial invasion and lymphovascular invasion. A correlation between SNCG(+) and adverse outcomes, such as shorter overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS), was also detected. Following adjuvant therapy (radiation and chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone), we observed a difference in 5years DFS rate between SNCG(+) (41.6%) and SNCG(-) patients (59.5%).Overexpression of SNCG seemed to be a predictor biomarker for aggressive tumor behavior and adverse outcome in patients with endometrial cancer. Future exploration of SNCG as a potential therapeutic target for selected patients could be of interest.
