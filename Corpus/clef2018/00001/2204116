Prospects of the use of neoplasm antigens as markers of gynecologic diseases. CA-125 antigen was assayed in 108 patients with the most prevalent gynecologic diseases by enzyme immunoassay. Its blood levels were found to be under 35 U/ml in the patients with inflammatory diseases. In endometriosis and benign ovarian tumors CA-125 concentrations in the blood were elevated. Malignant tumors of the ovaries were detected in 80 percent of the examinees. CA-125 levels reduced after surgical treatment in 72 percent of patients. These data permit a conclusion that CA-125 diagnostic agent may be used to monitor the course of the postoperative period and assess the late results of treatment.
