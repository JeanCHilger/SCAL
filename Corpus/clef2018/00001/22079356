E-cadherin nuclear staining is useful for the diagnosis of ovarian adult granulosa cell tumor. We recently have demonstrated nuclear localization of E-cadherin in ovarian adult granulosa cell tumors (Histopathology 201158:423). The purpose of the present study is to investigate the diagnostic utility of E-cadherin nuclear staining for the differential diagnosis between ovarian adult granulosa cell tumor and its morphological mimics. Tissue samples taken from 81 ovarian tumors and 20 extraovarian tumors were immunohistochemically stained using monoclonal anti-E-cadherin antibody recognizing cytoplasmic domain (clone 36 supplied by BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The ovarian tumors consisted of 30 adult granulosa cell tumors, 3 Sertoli-stromal cell tumors, 14 fibrothecomas, 5 carcinoid tumors, 1 large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, 18 endometrioid adenocarcinomas, and 10 poorly differentiated serous adenocarcinomas. Extraovarian tumors consisted of 16 uterine endometrial stromal neoplasms and 4 pulmonary small cell carcinomas. Only tumor cells with nuclear staining were considered positive in this study. Ninety percent of adult granulosa cell tumors, 67% of Sertoli-stromal cell tumors, 64% of fibrothecomas, 75% of endometrial stromal neoplasms, 75% of small cell carcinomas, and the one large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma showed E-cadherin nuclear expression, whereas all the ovarian carcinoid tumors, endometrioid adenocarcinomas, and poorly differentiated serous adenocarcinomas were negative. E-cadherin nuclear staining is useful in distinguishing between adult granulosa cell tumors and ovarian adenocarcinomas or carcinoid tumors. However, it is of limited use for distinguishing between adult granulosa cell tumors and endometrial stromal neoplasms or small cell carcinomas. E-cadherin should be included in the immunohistochemical panel for an accurate diagnosis of ovarian adult granulosa cell tumors.
