Stem cells: are they the answer to the puzzling etiology of endometriosis? Endometriosis is a chronic benign disease characterized by the presence of abnormally located tissue resembling the endometrium with glands and stroma. This disease has a high degree of morbidity due to chronic pelvic pain and infertility. The disease is likely to be polygenic and multifactorial, but the exact pathogenic mechanisms are still not entirely clear. Recently, adult stem cells have been identified in several tissues, including the endometrium. These cells are probably involved in the regenerative ability of the endometrial cycle, and also in the pathogenesis of proliferative gynaecological diseases, such as endometriosis. The identification of stem cells in animal and human tissues is very complex and the putative stem cells are supposed to be found through several assays such as clonogenicity, label-retaining cells, "side-population" cells, undifferentiation markers, and cellular differentiation. Bone marrow-derived stem cells transplanted into humans and animals have also been identified in eutopic endometrium and endometriotic implants. This review evaluates the available evidence regarding stem/progenitor cells in the human endometrium and explores the possible involvement of these cells in the etiology of endometriosis.
