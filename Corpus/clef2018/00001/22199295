Association of p53 and CDKN1A genotypes with endometriosis. The tumor suppressor p53 protein plays a critical role in different cellular processes in response to DNA damage and it is responsible for transcriptional induction of the p21 (CDKN1A/WAF1/CIP1) gene. Both p53 and p21 are thought to play major roles in the development of human malignancy. Polymorphic variants of p53 at codon 72, and CDKN1A at codon 31, have been found to be associated with cancer susceptibility, but few studies have investigated their effect on endometriosis risk.In this hospital-based case-control study, we investigated the association of p53 codon 72 and CDKN1A codon 31 polymorphisms with endometriosis susceptibility in a Taiwanese population. In total, 180 patients with endometriosis, and 330 age-matched controls in Central Taiwan were recruited and genotyped.We found a significant difference in the distribution of the p53 genotype, but not the CDKN1A genotype, between the endometriosis and control groups. Individuals with the C (Pro) allele at p53 codon 72 had a 1.6-fold increased odds ratio of endometriosis, and those with Arg/Pro and Pro/Pro genotypes for p53 codon 72 had a 1.84- and 2.74-fold (95% confidence interval=1.17-2.92 and 1.58-4.74) increased risk of endometriosis compared to those with Arg/Arg, respectively. The distribution of haplotype combinations of p53 codon 72 and CDKN1A codon 31 was statistically different in the endometriosis and control groups. The percentages of the three subgroups with p53 CC homozygote were all higher in the endometriosis group than in the control group.Our findings suggest that the C (Pro) allele of p53 codon 72 may be associated with the development of endometriosis, and could serve as a potential biomarker for early prediction of this disease.
