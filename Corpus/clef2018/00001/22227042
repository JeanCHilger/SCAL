Proteomic analysis reflects different histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer. Ovarian carcinoma is a significant cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide. As a heterogeneous disease, distinct clinical and molecular characteristics exist among different histologic subtypes. With the developments in proteomics, surfaced-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) is sensitive enough to detect minute quantity of proteins from serum or microdissected cryostat sections. Herein we hypothesized that differentially expressed protein profiles exist in ovarian carcinomas with distinct histologic subtypes. Compared with endometrioid carcinoma, two peaks were significantly higher in serous carcinoma with the m/z of 3622 Da and 4778 Da, reinforcing the need to treat different histologic subtypes of ovarian cancer as different disease entities. Better understanding of these potential diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers followed with proof-of-target effect will finally contribute to rational combinations of novel therapy and improve individual ovarian cancer patient outcome.
