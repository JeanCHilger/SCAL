Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5) as a potential therapeutic target for vascular and other disorders. Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone-5 (Hic-5) is a focal adhesion scaffold protein primarily expressed in vascular and visceral smooth muscle cells. We recently generated mice lacking Hic-5, which grew with no apparent abnormality (Kim-Kaneyama J, et al. J Mol Cell Cardiol. 201150(1):77-86). However, we discovered that recovery of arterial media following vascular injury is delayed significantly in Hic-5 knockout mice consequent to enhanced apoptosis of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells after mechanical stress
