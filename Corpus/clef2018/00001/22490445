Genes with bimodal expression are robust diagnostic targets that define distinct subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer with different overall survival. In some cancer types, certain genes behave as molecular switches, with on and off expression states. These genes tend to define tumor subtypes associated with different treatments and different patient survival. We hypothesized that clinically relevant molecular switch genes exist in epithelial ovarian cancer. To test this hypothesis, we applied a bimodal discovery algorithm to a publicly available ovarian cancer expression microarray data set, GSE9891 [285 tumors: 246 malignant serous (MS), 20 endometrioid (EM), and 18 low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian carcinomas]. Genes with robust bimodal expression patterns were identified across all ovarian tumor types and also within selected subtypes: 73 bimodal genes demonstrated differential expression between LMP versus MS and EM 22 bimodal genes distinguished MS from EM
