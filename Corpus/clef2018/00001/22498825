Molecular profile of grade 3 endometrioid endometrial carcinoma: is it a type I or type II endometrial carcinoma? Two types of endometrial carcinoma (EC) have been delineated on the basis of clinicopathologic studies. Low-grade endometrioid carcinoma (EEC) is the prototype of type I EC and is characterized by microsatellite instability and PTEN, K-ras, and/or Î²-catenin gene mutations, whereas type II EC is typically represented by serous and clear cell carcinomas (SCs/CCCs), the former frequently showing p53 mutations and c-erb-2 overexpression however, the molecular profile of grade 3 EEC has not yet been well characterized. The goal of this study was to define the immunohistochemical and molecular profile of grade 3 EEC. We studied 25 patients with grade 3 EEC ranging in age from 35 to 87 (mean 61) years. At the time of initial diagnosis, 16 patients had stage I tumors, whereas 3, 5, and 1 had stages II, III, and IV tumors, respectively. Only 1 patient with stage IV tumor had disease in the peritoneum because of direct extend of tumor through the uterine wall. Two tissue microarrays were constructed from paraffin-embedded blocks and stained for MLH-1, MSH-2, p16, cyclin D1, C-erb-B2, WT-1, and p53. Loss of MLH-1 and MSH-2 was seen in 3 of 25 and 1 of 24 tumors, respectively
