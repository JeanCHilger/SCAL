Single nucleotide polymorphisms of VEGF gene in endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common gynaecological disease of unknown etiology. Angiogenesis appears to be one of the processes involved in its pathogenesis. Angiogenic factors VEGF level is increased in patients with endometriosis. Studies have shown that endometriosis maybe associated with VEGF single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) polymorphisms. Results from studies that assayed VEGF polymorphism in endometriosis are reviewed. Data in the literature suggest that VEGF SNPs such as: -460C/T +405G/C and 936C/T seem to be a risk factor for endometriosis.
