Gynaecology and Obstetrics Dpt. at the University Hospital of F.D. Roosevelt, Banská Bystrica, Slovakia.Diagnostic management and laparoscopic technique.Congenital agenesis of the cervix is a rare anomaly of the inner genital. It may be associated with vaginal aplasia and less frequently with other anomalies like an incomplete fusion of müllerian ducts. Hysterectomy was frequently used to resolve main symptoms with respect to frequent complications associated with reconstructive surgery. Recently we can see a comeback to reconstructive surgery as a result of new medical technologies (new antibiotics and antibacterial sutures). Laparoscopic surgery is considered to be the main approach. The treatment strategy is related to a detailed individual pre-surgery investigation. Success of the surgical treatment is measured by normal menstruation and restored fertility. In this article we report the laparoscopic approach in creating the uterovaginal anastomosis in 20-year old women with cervical agenesis and duplex uterine anomaly and review the treatment options.Laparoscopic treatment of cervical agenesis is eligible and might be considered as a first-line treatment option.
