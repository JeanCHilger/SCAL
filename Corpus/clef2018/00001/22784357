Clinicopathological significance of fascin and CD44v6 expression in endometrioid carcinoma. Fascin and CD44v6 may have significant roles as biomarkers in tumour progression and metastasis. In endometrioid carcinomas, the fascin expression profile is less defined, and the significance of CD44v6 is uncertain. We aimed to investigate the expressions of both fascin and CD44v6 in endometrioid carcinomas and to evaluate their inter-relation with clinicopathological parameters.Fascin and CD44v6 expressions were evaluated, individually and in combination, in a series of 47 endometrioid carcinomas and 10 proliferative endometrium samples. The staining extent and intensity of both markers in tumour cells were scored semiquantitatively. The relationship between immunoexpressions and clinicopathological variables was assessed.The expression rates of fascin and CD44v6 in endometrioid carcinoma were 72.34% and 46.80%, respectively. Although these expression rates were higher than those in proliferative endometrial samples, fascin expression showed a statistically significant difference from the normal group (p = 0.02), but CD44v6 did not differ (p = 0.54). Fascin expression was significantly correlated with tumour grade (p = 0.003) and neural invasion (p = 0.036) in a univariate analysis. In contrast, no significant correlation was found between CD44v6 and any of the clinicopathological parameters.Our findings suggest that fascin might be an independent prognostic indicator in the different steps of extracellular matrix invasion. On the other hand, CD44v6 was not a predictive factor in endometrioid cancer.The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/8511594927206899.
