Psychoimmune interactions in women of reproductive age with endometriosis. Psychoimmune interactions were studied in women of reproductive age with endometriosis. Pronounced immunological shifts manifested in a shift of the T-cellular immunity, resulting in imbalanced production of pro- (IL-1β, IL-2, IFN-γ) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4) cytokines. Significant correlations between the severity of mental shifts and immunopathogenetic factors in the studied patient population demonstrated the psychoneuroimmune nature of endometriosis.
