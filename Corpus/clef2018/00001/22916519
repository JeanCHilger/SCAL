Vulvar endometrioma: a case report. Endometriosis is a benign and common disorder that is characterized by ectopic endometrium outside the uterus. Extrapelvic endometriosis, like of the vulva, is rarely seen. We report a case of a 47-year-old woman referred to our clinic due to complaints of a vulvar mass and periodic swelling of the mass at the time of menstruation. During surgery, the cyst ruptured and a chocolate-colored liquid escaped onto the surgical field. The cyst was extirpated totally. Hipstopathological examination showed findings compatible with endometriosis. She was asked to follow-up after three weeks. The patient had no complaints and the incision field was clear at the follow-up.
