Genetic polymorphisms and endometriosis: contribution of genes that regulate vascular function and tissue remodeling. Endometriosis is a benign gynecological disease characterized by the presence and growth of endometrial cells outside the uterus. Genetic, endocrine, immunological, and environmental factors have been suggested in its pathogenesis. A great number of studies have related genetic polymorphisms as a factor that contributes to the development of endometriosis. This review presents a detailed description of the contribution of genetic polymorphisms in genes that regulate vascular function and tissue remodeling in endometriosis (alpha 2-HS glycoprotein [AHSG], epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], endostatin, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 [PAI-1], angiotensin I-converting enzyme [ACE], and matrix metalloproteinases [MMPs]). Some polymorphisms of the VEGF (-460 C/T, +405 G/C, +936 C/T), PAI, MMP-1, 2, and 3 genes were widely studied, while polymorphisms of the AHSG, EGF, endostatin, and VEGF (-1154 G/A, -2578 A/C) genes were not. In this latter case, additional studies are required to confirm the findings of the few studies that have analyzed these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Additionally, studies that found a positive or negative association of SNP with endometriosis emphasize the relevance of studies with a large number of control cases to confirm their findings. The haplotype analysis was performed only for the VEGF (-460, +405, -1154 and -2578), ACE (-240/2350) and MMP-1, 2, 3, and 9 genes, and in most of them, there was no association with endometriosis. Of the eight works that analyzed haplotypes of the VEGF gene, five did not associate them with endometriosis. Haplotypes of ACE and MMP-2 genes were not associated with endometriosis, while those of MMP-1, 3, and 9 genes were related to a high risk for the disease.
