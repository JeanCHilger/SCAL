Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues reduce the proliferation of endometrial stromal cells but not endometriotic cells. We investigated the potential of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and GnRH antagonists to inhibit cell proliferation in endometriotic and endometrial stromal cells.Twenty patients with ovarian endometriomas and 18 patients with uterine fibromas were recruited. Endometriotic and endometrial stromal cells were obtained from the ovarian chocolate cyst linings and the eutopic endometria of premenopausal women with uterine fibromas, respectively.GnRH agonist or antagonist treatment attenuated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced cell proliferation in the endometrial stromal cells, whereas endometriotic stromal cells did not respond to treatment. The endometriotic stromal cells exhibited a decreased expression of the type I GnRH receptor compared with the endometrial stromal cells. GnRH agonists or antagonists did not repress TNF-α-induced IL-8 production in endometriotic stromal cells.GnRH agonists and antagonists have similar effects in slowing the growth of endometrial stromal cells. Endometriotic stromal cells resist the antiproliferative effect of GnRH agonists and antagonists.
