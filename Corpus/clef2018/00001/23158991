Expression and significance of Twist1 and MMP-2 in endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma. To investigate the expression of Twist1 and MMP-2 protein and their significance in endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma.The expression of Twist1 and MMP-2 protein in 70 cases of endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma was detected on tissue chips using immunohistochemical staining.The positive rates of Twist1 and MMP-2 protein expression were 65.7% and 67.1%, respectively. Both of the high expressions of Twist1 and MMP-2 were positively correlated with FIGO staging and tumor myometrial invasion (P < 0.05, respectively). Also the high expression of Twist1 was positively correlated with ovarian metastasis and the expression of MMP-2 was positively correlated with tumor grading (P < 0.05). The patients' overall survival and relapse-free survival in the group of high Twist1 expression were shorter than that in the group of low Twist1 expression (P < 0.05). The expression of MMP-2 was positively correlated with Twist1 expression (P < 0.01, respectively).The expression of Twist1 may be closely correlated with the tumor invasion, metastasis and prognosis in patients with endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The expression of Twist1 has a close relationship with MMP-2 in endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
