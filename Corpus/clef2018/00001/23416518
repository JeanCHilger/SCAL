Ileo-colic endometriosis: a rare localization of a frequent disease. Case report. Endometriosis is a common entity affecting females of reproductive age. Clinical manifestations are not specific, making the preoperative diagnosis difficult to establish. Intestinal endometriosis is common, but ethiology is unknown. The complications of intestinal endometriosis include intestinal obstruction, perforation, hemorrhagic ascites, protein-losing enteropathy, anasarca, and intussusception. We report a case of a young woman, 26 years old, that for 3 years had a conditioned life by monthly sub-occlusion due to a small-bowel obstruction for an ileocaecal endometriosis. A high index of suspicion is required to have a diagnosis of this rare localization of endometriosis.
