ER+ /PR+ /TFF3+ /IMP3- immunoprofile distinguishes endometrioid from serous and clear cell carcinomas of the endometrium: a study of 401 cases. Differentiating endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC) from uterine serous carcinoma (USC) and clear cell carcinoma (CCC) of the endometrium can be challenging. We undertook an immunohistochemical study to address this issue.We evaluated 401 endometrial carcinomas cases by using four immunomarkers - oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), insulin-like growth factor II mRNA - binding protein 3 (IMP3), and intestinal trefoil factor 3 (TFF3)-on a tissue microarray. The cases included 311 EACs (G1, 146 G2, 104We recommend using an ER/PR/TFF3/IMP3 immunohistochemical panel in selected cases of endometrial carcinoma where the differential diagnosis is challenging.
