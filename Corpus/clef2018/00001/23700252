Immunohistochemical alterations of cajal-like type of tubal interstitial cells in women with endometriosis and tubal ectopic pregnancy. The aim of the study was to observe alterations of pacemaker cells termed cajal-like type of tubal interstitial cells (t-ICC) in oviduct from early-stage EMs and tEP, discuss underlying mechanisms and potential role in tubal factor infertility (TFI).Ten patients with early-stage EMs, 10 with unruptured tEP and 10 control subjects were included in this retrospective comparative study, received adnexectomy (salpingectomy) and/or hysterectomy. Paraffin-embedded full-thickness isthmic segment of oviduct specimens received immunohistochemistry with c-kit/CD117 antibody. Network distribution and area density of cells with features of t-ICC were analyzed.t-ICC was detected mainly in lamina propria and smooth muscle layers. t-ICC lost its network integrity, became less densely stained, sparse and almost invisible with relatively very rare connections in EMs and tEP, apparently differing in morphology of t-ICC from control, which demonstrated rich t-ICC immunostaining and intact network. Further quantitative analysis showed the area density of t-ICC decreased significantly in early-stage EMs and tEP compared with the control (73.9 ± 8.8 vs. 156 ± 18.3 mm(2) and 76 ± 7.4 vs. 156 ± 18.3 mm(2)We revealed that t-ICC underwent certain degree of cell damage, suggested that decreased expression of t-ICC network may be involved in early development of EMs and tEP, and might serve as an explanation for TFI in these patients.
