Hormonal therapy for women with stage IA endometrial cancer of all grades. To estimate the oncologic and pregnancy outcomes after oral progestin treatment of women of reproductive age with stage IA endometrial adenocarcinoma with stage IA, grade 1 differentiation with superficial myometrial invasion or stage IA, grade 2-3 differentiation with or without superficial myometrial invasion.Medical records of 48 women (age 40 years or younger) with endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus who met inclusion criteria and were treated conservatively with oral progestin were reviewed. Follow-up was performed primarily with imaging techniques followed by endometrial biopsy when indicated.The median age was 30 years (range, 23-40 years). Fourteen patients (29.2%) received daily oral megestrol acetate (median dose 160 mg per day, range 40-240 mg per day) and 34 (70.8%) received daily oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (median dose 500 mg per day, range 80-1,000 mg per day). Complete responses were observed for 37 patients (77.1%) after the median treatment duration of 10 months (range 3-20 months). Complete response rates were 76.5%, 73.9%, and 87.5% for patients with stage IA, grade 2-3 without myometrial invasion (n=17), for patients with stage IA, grade 1 with superficial myometrial invasion (n=23), and for patients with stage IA, grade 2-3 with superficial myometrial invasion (n=8), respectively (P=.731). Recurrence rates for 37 patients who achieved complete response after a median follow-up time of 48 months (range 7-136 months) were 23.1%, 47.1%, and 71.4%, respectively (P=.104). None experienced disease progression or died of the disease. Nine patients gave birth to 10 healthy newborns.Progestin treatment appears to be reasonably effective for patients with stage IA, grade 2-3 differentiation without myometrial invasion and patients with stage IA grade 1 differentiation with superficial myometrial invasion.III.
