Association of blood type and patient characteristics with ovarian reserve. To assess whether blood type was associated with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) (day-3 follicle-stimulating hormone level >10 IU/L), controlling for history of tobacco smoking, body mass index (BMI), history of endometriosis, ovarian surgery, previous pregnancy, and maternal age.Cross-sectional study.Academic medical center, Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility.Women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) from 2006-2011 (n = 305).None.Presence of DOR in relation to a patient's blood type.Other investigators have reported an increased risk for DOR in patients with blood type O and a protective effect on ovarian reserve for blood type A. We observed no association between a woman's blood type and DOR. We found an increased risk for DOR in patients aged 35 and older. Obesity (BMI â‰¥ 30 vs. BMI <25) was associated with lower odds of DOR.In comparison with blood type A, blood type O is not associated with an increase in DOR. We found no clinical implications for using blood type as a risk factor for DOR.
