Tissue and circulating microRNA influence reproductive function in endometrial disease. microRNA (miRNA) have emerged as important epigenetic modulators of gene expression in diverse pathological and physiological processes. In the endometrium, miRNA appear to have a role in the dynamic changes associated with the menstrual cycle, in implantation and in the pathophysiology associated with reproductive disorders such as recurrent miscarriage and endometriosis. This review explores the role of miRNA in endometrial physiology and endometrial disorders of reproduction and also raises the prospect that circulating miRNA may modulate endometrial function or reflect disordered endometrial activity. The clinical potential to use miRNA in diagnostic tests of endometrial function or in the treatment of endometrial disorders will also be discussed.
