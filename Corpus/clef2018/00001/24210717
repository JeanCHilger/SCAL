Treatment strategies in presumed benign ovarian tumors. Benign ovarian tumors can be separated in three groups: teratoma, unilocular cyst and endometrioma. Laparoscopy should always be preferred for the surgical approach. Before menopause, conservative treatment should be preferred apart from previous oncologic history (breast and ovary). After menopause, the surgical approach (conservative or radical) should be discussed on case-by-case basis. Concerning teratoma, follow-up is one of the options for small cyst (less than 4 to 6 cm). For larger cyst, surgery seems to be justified but there is no definitive argument for this attitude. Concerning unilocular cyst, hormonal treatment or ultrasound-guided puncture are not recommended. For symptomatic patient, laparoscopic surgery is the gold standard. For asymptomatic patient, there is no definitive argument for systematic surgery. There is no justification for systematic ultrasound follow-up. For cyst larger than 10 cm, the data in the literature are very poor and surgery can be proposed. Concerning endometrioma, there isn't strong data that allows preferring one treatment (surgical, medical, follow-up) over another. Preoperative medical treatment is not recommended. Stripping technique is the gold standard. Hormonal postoperative treatment is recommended (if there is no desire for pregnancy).
