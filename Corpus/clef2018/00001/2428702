Hyperamylasemia associated with endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary: case report and immunohistochemical study. Hyperamylasemia was noted in a patient with a stage I well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the ovary. Serum levels of amylase decreased rapidly after removal of the ovarian tumor. Immunohistochemical study revealed intracytoplasmic localization of amylase in many tumor cells. Although it was strongly suspected that the tumor cells had produced amylase in the present patient, further studies are required to be sure that amylase can be considered an important tumor marker for the endometrioid type of ovarian tumors.
