Ovarian clear cell carcinoma. A clinicopathologic analysis of 44 cases. The clinical aspects and pathologic findings in 44 cases of pure clear cell carcinoma of the ovary are presented. The patients ranged in age from 28 to 78 years (mean, 50.6 years) 54% were nulliparous. Thirty-three percent of the patients had endometriosis in the involved ovary, and an additional 25% had endometriosis only in sites distant from the tumor. Microscopically, three architectural patterns (papillary, tubulocystic, and solid) and four cell types (clear, hobnail, eosinophilic, and flattened) were seen. A predominant tubulocystic architectural pattern was a good prognostic factor (p less than 0.01)
