Acute phase protein (alpha 1 AT) as a tumor marker in patients with ovarian cancer (OC). Serum alpha 1 AT was measured in 30 healthy women, 30 pregnant women, in 97 patients with various benign gynecologic diseases, and 38 patients with OC. The positive ratio (cut off level: 317 mg/dl) in OC patients was 78.9% (30/38), 11.3% (11/97) in patients with a benign gynecologic disease, 90% (27/30) in pregnant women, and 0% (0/30) in healthy women. Histologically 92.3% of the patients (12/13) with a serous cystadenocarcinoma, 50% (4/8) with an endometrioid carcinoma, and 77.8% (7/9) with a mucinous cystadenocarcinoma were positive, but only 5.9% of the patients with a chocolate cyst were positive. Thus it was found that alpha 1 AT is a useful tumor marker in diagnosing OC.
