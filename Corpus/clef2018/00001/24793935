Dienogest improves human leucocyte antigen-DR underexpression and reduces tumour necrosis factor-α production in peritoneal fluid cells from women with endometriosis. To determine the immunological effect of dienogest (DNG), an oral anti-endometriosis drug, on peritoneal fluid (PF) macrophages collected from women with endometriosis. Although it has been suggested that DNG has direct effects on endometriotic cells, including decreased cell proliferation and decreased anti-inflammatory cytokine production, the effects of DNG on PF cells are unclear.The effects of DNG on PF cells from 34 women with endometriosis and 22 women without endometriosis (controls) were investigated. Expression of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR in PF macrophages, obtained from the peritoneal cavity during laparoscopic surgery, was determined by flow cytometry. HLA-DR expression was measured again after PF cells had been cultured for 72 h in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in 5% CO₂-95% air with or without DNG. After 72 h of incubation, the concentration of pro-inflammatory tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the media was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.HLA-DR expression was lower in PF macrophages from women with endometriosis compared with controls. However, after DNG treatment, HLA-DR expression in PF macrophages from women with endometriosis was increased to the same level as in controls. The TNF-α concentration in the media was decreased by DNG.DNG can restore the antigen-presenting ability of PF macrophages by increased HLA-DR expression, and may have an anti-inflammatory effect on PF macrophages in women with endometriosis.
