Polypoid nodular histiocytic hyperplasia associated with endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium: report of a case. A 45 year old woman underwent Laparoscopy-assisted total hysterectomy with staging procedure following a diagnosis of endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma on her endometrial biopsy. The hysterectomy specimen showed a FIGO I stage 1a, endometrioid carcinoma. A separate polypoid lesion in the endometrium, distinct from the carcinoma, was also identified. Microscopically the polypoid lesion was "nodular histiocytic hyperplasia". The H&E, immunohistochemical staining findings and the differential diagnoses are discussed in this report. Although description of similar lesions is available in the literature, the current lesion is unique as it is identified in a hysterectomy specimen in its entirety and its association with an endometrial endometrioid carcinoma.The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1060511915121922.
