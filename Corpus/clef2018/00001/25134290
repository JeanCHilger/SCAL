Increased platelet count in severe peritoneal endometriosis. Platelet count (PC) is higher in chronic inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the PC in patients with severe pelvic endometriosis.Patients with advanced stage pelvic endometriosis were retrospectively evaluated in a tertiary center between January 2009 and December 2011. Patients with pelvic endometriosis were divided into two groups advanced stage peritoneal endometriosis were classified as Group 1 (n = 28). Group 2 consisted of 29 patients which had ovarian endometrioma without clinically apparent peritoneal endometriosis foci. Group 3 included 51 women as control subjects. PC between the groups was tested by Student's t test. The mean values of three groups were analyzed by using one way ANOVA test followed post-hoc test Bonferroni.PC in patients with pelvic endometriosis were found to be higher from the control group (290 +/- 67 10(9)/1 264 +/- 63 10(9)/1, respectivelyIncreased PC in advanced stage pelvic endometriosis may be a sign of increased systemic inflammation. The systemic inflammation may be more apparent in advanced stage peritoneal endometriosis.
