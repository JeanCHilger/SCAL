Relation between outcomes and expression of estrogen receptor-α phosphorylated at Ser(167) in endometrioid endometrial cancer. Both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation of estrogen receptor (ER)α is modulated by receptor phosphorylation and results in activation of the ERα-dependent pathways that are involved in endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) pathogenesis. It is also known that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and MAPK/p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) signaling pathways coordinately regulate phosphorylated-ERα at Ser(167) (p-Ser(167) -ERα). However, the expression of p-Ser(167) -ERα in EEC and its prognostic role in ECC is largely unexplored. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the expression of p-Ser(167) -ERα in ECC and its relationship with prognosis. Immunohistochemical staining of primary EEC surgical specimens (n = 103) was carried out using antibodies specific for p-Ser(167) -ERα and for p-mTOR/p-S6K1 and p-MAPK/p-RSK. The correlation of p-Ser(167) -ERα expression with clinicopathological features and survival of ECC was studied. Patients that were positive for nuclear p-Ser(167) -ERα had significantly shorter relapse-free survival, and although the result was not significant, levels of nuclear p-Ser(167) -ERα tended to be higher in advanced-stage ECC patients. Nuclear p-Ser(167) -ERα was significantly positively correlated with p-MAPK and p-S6K1, and with significantly shorter relapse-free survival in EEC.
