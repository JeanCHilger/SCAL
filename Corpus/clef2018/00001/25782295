Capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging to diagnose infiltrating pelvic endometriosis. Deep infiltrating endometriosis is a disease in reproductive-aged women, resulting in varying chronic pelvic pains and infertility, which requires surgical treatment. Objective--to determine the capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose pelvic endometriosis and to elaborate an optimal scanning protocol if this disease is suspected. Small pelvic MRI has a high accuracy in the diagnosis of endometriosis and can visualize most endometrioid implants, including those that are located under adhesions and in the subperitoneal regions. Just the same, a radiodiagnostician should not forget that MRI is of low informative value in identifying bowel endometriosis. Hence, when diagnosing deep infiltrating endometriosis, MRI should be complemented with transvaginal ultrasonography to detect endometrioid implants on the bowel walls as the informative value in this aspect is above.
