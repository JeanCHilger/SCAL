Peritoneal macrophages and their activity in sterile patients with endometriosis. The authors analyzed the peritoneal fluid (PF) during laparoscopic examination in 50 sterile women, incl. 27 where endometriosis was found. The control group was formed by 23 sterile women without signs of endometriosis. In both groups the volume of PF, concentration and absolute number of peritoneal macrophages and their phagocytic activity were evaluated. In the group of sterile women with endometriosis there was significantly increased volume of PF, higher concentration and absolute number of macrophages than in the group of patients without endometriosis. The phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages did not differ significantly in the control group and in patients with endometriosis.
