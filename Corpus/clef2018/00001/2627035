Enzyme activity in the blood serum and lymphocytes of patients with chronic salpingo-oophoritis combined with benign tumors of the genitalia. The activity of some enzymes was examined in blood serum and lymphocytes of women with chronic salpingo-oophoritis in combination with tumourous processes of the genital organs. The objects of the study were 96 women, divided into three groups: first group (control)-20 healthy women, second group-37 women with chronic salpingo-oophoritis and third group-39 women, who suffered from chronic salpingo-oophoritis together with tumours and tumourous processes of genital organs-uterine myoma, endometriosis, cysts and cystomas of the ovaries. The studies showed that in women with continuous course of inflammatory processes there were phenomena in the lymphocytes characteristic of tension of adaptation-compensatory reactions, but inhibition and lowering of the activity of energy metabolism was observed in women with tumours and tumourous processes at the same time. Lymphocyte acid phosphatase, asparataminotransferase, hydroxy-butiratdehydrogenase and lactatdehydrogenase appears to be a prognostic sign for early discovery of features of tumourous process in the female organism on the background of chronic inflammatory process of genital organs.
