CA-125 is an effective marker for patients with external endometriosis and on danazol: case reports. Serum levels of CA-125 in women with external endometriosis and on danazol were assayed for an extended period, and changes in the CA-125 pattern were analyzed. Whereas the prognosis for the patients in case 1 was good, those for cases 2, 3, and 4 were poor. We propose that the Ca-125 levels should be carefully determined for individual patients, because a relapse can be predicted.
