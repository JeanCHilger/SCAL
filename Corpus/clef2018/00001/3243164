Fine-needle aspiration of spleen: diagnosis of a solitary ovarian metastasis. We report a patient in whom a solitary splenic lesion detected by computed tomography (CT) was successfully diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy under CT guidance. The ability to distinguish metastatic carcinoma from lymphoma in the spleen assisted the clinician in making therapeutic decisions. Fine-needle aspiration of spleen is a reasonable diagnostic approach that has been underutilized.
