Serum CA-125 antigen levels increase during menses. Serum CA-125 antigen levels were measured by radioimmunoassay before and during menses in women with and without endometriosis. Mean CA-125 levels were significantly increased in both groups during menses. Samples obtained during menses represent a potential source of elevated levels and false positive results.
