Electron microscopical and immunohistochemical study of human endometrial carcinoma with special reference to localization of estrogen receptors and carcinoembryonic antigen. Human endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma were observed by light microscope. Endometrial carcinoma was histologically divided into Grade I (53 cases), Grade II (10 cases), and Grade III (7 cases). According to the results of electron microscopical analysis, cancer cells in GIII were smaller and showed a higher N/C rate and less mitochondria in the cytoplasma than those of GI and GII. Rough endoplasmic reticula were well developed in GI and GII compared with GIII. Immunohistochemically, ER localized in 54% cases of endometrial carcinoma, and decreased in positive rates of undifferentiated carcinoma. The metaplastic area in carcinoma showed the localization of ER and CEA. A close correlation between ER and CEA was demonstrated in endometrial carcinoma. Ultrastructurally, rough endoplasmic reticula were well developed in the cytoplasma of cancer cells in the strong positive cases of ER and CEA. It has been proved that histological detection of ER and CEA in endometrial carcinoma is very important in deciding the diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.
