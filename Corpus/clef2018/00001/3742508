Preliminary report on postmenopausal endometrial hyperplasia treatment with Danazol: histological and endocrinological aspects. The synthetic steroid Danazol is commonly used in the hormonal treatment of endometriosis however, little is known about its effects on human endometrium. This study was performed to verify the efficacy of Danazol on the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia in postmenopausal patients. Ten patients with histologically proven endometrial hyperplasia were treated with Danazol at a dosage of 600 mg/day for 30 days. The E1S and E1 plasma levels were also determined before and at the end of therapy. In all patients the regression of endometrial hyperplasia was observed in the endometrial biopsy specimens obtained after the treatment. Furthermore, the increased E1S/E1 ratio as compared to the basal values suggests an impairment of the peripheral sulfatase activity. The inhibition of the conversion of E1S to active unconjugated estrogens appears to be one of the mechanisms by which Danazol may act on the endometrium.
