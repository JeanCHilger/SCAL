Detection of secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) and secretory component (SC) in cystic fluids from ovarian tumors and ovarian cysts. Secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) and secretory component (SC) were estimated by means of double radial immunodiffusion and single radial immunodiffusion in 22 cystic effusions from 22 patients with cystic ovarian tumours and ovarian cysts. For the quantitative estimations of S-IgA a S-IgA standard preparation was used. S-IgA and/or SC were demonstrable in all cases of the mucinous cystadenomas and also in the cystic effusions of an endometrioid adenocarcinoma and of a serous cystadenoma. The S-IgA values were estimated between 230 and 1330 mg/1. The estimation of S-IgA in cystic effusions is useful to support and extend the histological diagnosis of ovarian tumours.
