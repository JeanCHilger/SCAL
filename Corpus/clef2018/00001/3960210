Ovarian and endometrial endometrioid carcinoma: diagnostic implications of flow cytometry. Surgical specimens from two patients with simultaneously occurring ovarian and endometrial endometrioid carcinoma were studied by flow cytometry (FCM) and routine histological examination. Tissue derived from the uterine and the ovarian lesion showed similar FCM curves in each case. The information obtained from FCM was more relevant than the study of frozen histological sections as far as confirming or ruling out a common histogenesis was concerned. Study of paraffin sections provided additional data, suggestive of metastatic spread from ovary to uterus in Case 1, and from uterus to ovary in Case 2.
