Endometriosis of the appendix. Endometriosis has been encountered in different sites of the gastrointestinal tract. Involvement of the vermiform appendix, however, is rather unusual. Two cases of appendiceal endometriosis are reported in the present study: one patient had symptoms simulating acute appendicitis in another patient it was an incidental finding during pelvic surgery. There are no clinical signs and findings pathognomonic of endometriosis of the appendix, but the condition may present as appendicitis. At surgery, the diagnosis can only be suspected when it is associated with obvious genital endometriosis. Correct diagnosis is established by microscopic examination of the lesion. Symptomatic endometriosis of the appendix will be cured by appendectomy.
