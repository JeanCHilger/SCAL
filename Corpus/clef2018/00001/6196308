Immunoglobulin content of the endometrium in women with endometriosis. A study of the immunoglobulin content of endometria from women with and without endometriosis has shown that, in women with endometriosis, both IgG and IgA are more commonly found in the interstitium of the endometrial stroma than is the case in endometria from women without this disease. It is thought that the increased stromal content of immunoglobulins in endometriosis is simply a passive reflection of elevated serum IgG and IgA levels. Both the incidence and extent of positive endometrial glandular epithelial staining for IgG and IgA are markedly increased in women with endometriosis: the excess of intraepithelial IgA is probably simply a consequence of the excess of stromal IgA, but the increased epithelial staining for IgG lends support to the concept that many women with endometriosis develop autoantibodies directed against an endometrial epithelial antigen. No relationship could be demonstrated, however, between IgG deposition in the endometrium of women with endometriosis and a history of infertility.
