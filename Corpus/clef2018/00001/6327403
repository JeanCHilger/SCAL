Luteinizing hormone receptor disorder in endometriosis. Luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor concentrations in ovarian follicles and corpora lutea were measured in 51 patients with histologically proven endometriosis and in 41 control patients. The LH receptor concentrations in cases of endometriosis were lower during the early (0.43 +/- 0.11 [mean +/- standard error] versus 1.31 +/- 0.27 fmol/mg protein P less than 0.001) and late (0.48 +/- 0.10 versus 1.59 +/- 0.22 fmol/mg protein
