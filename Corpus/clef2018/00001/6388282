Magnetic resonance imaging of the abnormal female pelvis. Twenty-three women with 27 instances of pelvic pathology were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Different pulse sequences were used, which varied the dependence of the images on T1 and T2. Sonography was performed on 22 of the 23 patients. Five patients had CT examinations, including the patient who did not have sonography. MRI was also done in four normal volunteers. The spatial resolution of the MRI scans with short TR and TE intervals approached that of CT. There was overlap of MRI signal characteristics between various pathologic entities and also within the same entity (e.g., cystadenomas and endometriomas).
