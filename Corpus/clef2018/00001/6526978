Cytology of peritoneal fluid in the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis. Fluid was collected from the Ponch of Douglas at laparoscopy or laparotomy in 104 women. Macrophages were always present. The Schiff's histochemical reaction was positive inside the cytoplasm in cases of pelvic endometriosis in our study. This technique allows characterization of the cell population in cases of chronic pelvic inflammation and confirmation of the diagnosis of mild endometriosis.
