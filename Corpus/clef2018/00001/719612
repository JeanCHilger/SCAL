Characterization of an ovarian carcinoma cell line. A long-term ovarian carcinoma cell line is described in terms of its morphology, original histopathology, electron microscopic features and chromosome features before and after transplantation into an athymic nude mouse. The microscopic features of the tumor nodule grown in the nude mouse are compared with the original pathology. Epithelial characteristics of the cells were maintained in culture and after retrieval from the nude mouse. Three markers were identified in all karyotypes and trisomy was noted in chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 12, 16, and X and monosomy of 17 and 21.
