Adenomyoma of the pylorus presenting as intestinal obstruction with pseudomyxoma peritonei--a case report. Adenomyoma of the stomach is an exceedingly rare and benign tumour. We report here what we believe to be the first documented case in Singapore. Our patient is unique in three respects an eight-week old infant presented with signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction. Operative findings showed a small tumour in the pylorus of the stomach. The abdominal contents were covered with a colourless mucous slime, giving an appearance of pseudomyxoma peritonei. This is a feature which has not been hitherto reported. Microscopically, the lesion was consistent with adenomyoma of the pylorus. The interesting feature is an abundant production of mucin, with rupture and spillage of mucin in some of the glandular structures. We believe that this may account for the appearance of a pseudomyxoma peritonei seen in our patient.
