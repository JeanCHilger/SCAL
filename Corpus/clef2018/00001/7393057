Danazol treatment and platelet function. Platelet count and platelet function have been studied in detail in 14 women before and during treatment with danazol for endometriosis. A progressive and highly significant increase in platelet count was recorded from the pretreatment value (311 x 10(9)/L) to the value after six months of treatment (366 x 10(9)/L P less than 0.001). Five patients developed minor platelet release defects, which may have been caused by the drug. However, the abnormalities shown are only likely to be of clinical importance in patients with preexisting platelet abnormalities.
