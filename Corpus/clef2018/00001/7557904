Atypical polypoid adenomyomas of the uterus. We performed a clinicopathological immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and flow cytometric study on six cases of atypical polypoid adenomyoma of the uterus including one with an adenocarcinoma within it. The tumours occurred in nulliparous women aged 22-48 years (average, 33.0 years) three arose in the uterine corpus, and three in the endocervix. Histologically, they were composed of endometrial glands admixed with a stromal component of interlacing bundles of smooth muscle cells. The glands exhibited varying degrees of architectural and cytological atypia. Most of the stromal cells showed strong staining for HHF35, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and vimentin, and some cells contained desmin. Electronmicroscopy, in one case, confirmed the presence of a well-differentiated smooth muscle component. The stromal component may arise as a result of extensive metaplasia of endometrial stromal cells. Uninvolved endometrium showed ciliated cell metaplasia in three patients, and atypical complex hyperplasia in two. One patient had a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of endometrioid type arising in an endocervical atypical polypoid adenomyoma. All tumours had a diploid DNA content and relatively small S phase fraction (average, 6.23%). The follow-up periods ranged from 4 to 42 months (average, 13.5 months), and all patients were alive and well. Although the histogenesis of atypical polypoid adenomyoma of the uterus remains uncertain, it is suggested that it may arise because of oestrogen-related factors.
