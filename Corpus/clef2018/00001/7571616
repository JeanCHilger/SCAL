Laparoscopic image of sexual organs in women after ovulation induction. The assessment was performed of laparoscopic images of the sex organ in 58 women after induction of ovulation. Abnormalities were found in 29 women with permanent lack of ovulation and in six women with achieved ovulation. The changes in the oviducts predominated with an astonishingly low per cent of incidence of endometriosis (5) which probably was not a clinical problem in non-effective ovulation induction. The decision of laparoscopy should be considered also in the cases in which HSG performed earlier gave positive results.
