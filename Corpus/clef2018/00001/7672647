Gestrinone in pelvic endometriosis. A one-year evaluation. The therapeutical effectiveness of gestrinone in endometriosis treatment, as well as its long term side effects, were evaluated. Prospective, clinical trial. At "Dr. Alejandro Castanedo Kimball" Hospital (PEMEX). Salamanca, Guanajuato. MÃ©xico. Thirty women with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis, were studied. Subjects received 2.5 mg. of gestrinone two times per week for 6 months. Laparoscopy was performed before treatment, and clinical response was determined by second laparoscopy after 6 months. The pregnancy rate, frequency of side effects and recurrence of symptoms were determined. Median total endometriosis scores and symptoms decreased significantly after treatment. Four pregnancies were observed after treatment. The principal side effects were: ponderal increase, changes in the voice and hirsutism. However, the side effects disappeared after one year of clinical survey. The results indicate that gestrinone is effective in the treatment of pelvic endometriosis. In despite of a clear benefic effect on stage of the disease and symptoms the use of gestrinone should weigh the risk-benefit (cost versus metabolic side effects) of treatment.
