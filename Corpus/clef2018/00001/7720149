Cyclic changes of serum reproductive hormone levels on patients with endometriosis and infertility. Fourteen cases of endometriosis (Em) with infertility were studied by laparoscopy in our hospital from Dec. 1988 to Oct. 1989. 2 cases were minimal, 6 cases were moderate and 6 cases were severe. The salpingo examinations of 13 cases were normal by laparoscopy. There were no stigma on ovaries in 7 cases (LUFS). Levels of hormone (E2,P,LH,FSH) were compared in Em with normal women. The level of E2 during the follicle phase in Em was lower (86.4 +/- 6.9 pg/ml) than in normal women (119.9 +/- 7.7 pg/ml, P < 0.01). The LUFS group was compared with the no-LUFS group in Em. During the mid-late follicle phase and ovulatory phase, the E2 values in the LUFS group was significantly lower than in the non-LUFS group (P < 0.05), while the FSH value in LUFS group was significantly higher than in non-LUFS group (P < 0.05).
