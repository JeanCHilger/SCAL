Zona pellucida antibody detection using the passive hemagglutination reaction. II. Clinical part. The authors examined sera of patients suffering from idiopathic infertility, unsuccessful IVF, the diagnosis of habitual abortion and endometriosis, using the test of the passive haemagglutination reaction with sheep erythrocytes sensitized by 11 antigenic fractions of pig zona pellucida, molecular weights from 13.3-114 kilodaltons. The authors analyze the assembled results with regard to individual antigenic fractions and with regard to the diagnoses. The frequency of positive reactions in patients is investigated in particular in the area of higher molecular weights, as compared with the control group of healthy fertile women.
