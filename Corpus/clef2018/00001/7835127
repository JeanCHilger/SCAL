Tumor necrosis factor in peritoneal fluid of infertile women with endometriosis and its relation to sperm motility. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) of 16 infertile women with endometriosis was measured in their peritoneal fluid (PF) with double monoclonal antibody ELISA method, and its effect on sperm motility and membrane integrity was evaluated by semen analysis and hypoosmotic swelling test (HOS). Comparing with that of infertile women without endometriosis (n = 11) and normal fertile women (n = 7), the level of PF-TNF was significantly higher in women with endometriosis (P < 0.01), in accord with the stage of the disease. In the PF of these patients after incubation with the donor sperms, the percentages of forward movement, total motility and hypoosmotic swelling of the donor sperms were significantly decreased (P < 0.01), showing a negative correlation to TNF levels. These results indicate that the elevation of PF-TNF in endometriosis has detrimental effect on sperm function.
