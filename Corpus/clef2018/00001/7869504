Endocervicosis of the bladder. We report a case of endocervicosis of the bladder. The tumor was successfully resected transurethrally. Histopathology of this rare condition is discussed and the literature is reviewed. The natural course of this entity is poorly documented and close followup is mandatory. When endocervicosis is differentiated confidently from adenocarcinoma, local treatment may be satisfactory.
