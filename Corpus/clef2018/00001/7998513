Ureteral endometriosis. Report of a case. Presentation of one case of ureteral tumour with the patho-anatomical label of intrinsic multifocal endometriosis, who underwent surgical treatment. Endometriosis is a clinic-gynaecological problem affecting 10-20% of pre-menopausal women. The urinary tract compromise happens in 1-10% of women with endometriosis. In spite of being an uncommon pathology, early diagnosis is of great importance due to the large number of non-saveable kidneys that it causes (25-43%). In our opinion, in cases with established fibrosis we regard surgery as the choice therapy. A presentation is made of the clinical case, pathological anatomy, treatment and comments on the disease.
