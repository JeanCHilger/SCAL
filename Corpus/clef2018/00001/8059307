Laparoscopic disk excision and primary repair of the anterior rectal wall for the treatment of full-thickness bowel endometriosis. We used a new laparoscopic technique to treat infiltrative symptomatic intestinal endometriosis. Eight women, ages 29-38, with extensive symptomatic pelvic endometriosis were included in this series. All were diagnosed as having severe pelvic endometriosis and had not responded to previous conservative surgical and hormonal therapy. In a 5-18-month postoperative followup, six women have reported complete relief of the symptoms. Two have right lower quadrant pain and menstrual cramping. Second-look laparoscopy was offered to all patients and so far, two have accepted. These procedures were performed 6 weeks postoperatively. At that surgery, we found that the anastomotic site had healed completely with filmy adhesions between the posterior aspect of the uterus and the rectosigmoid colon in one patient. The second woman had undergone extensive adhesiolysis at the first surgery, and these adhesions recurred however, the anastomotic site had healed completely. One of the two infertility patients has achieved pregnancy. The only complications was one patient with ecchymosis of the anterior abdominal wall. Sigmoidoscopy was performed 6 weeks postoperatively, and has been or will be performed at 6 months postoperatively. To date, all anastomotic sites have healed well with no sign of stricture. Our results with this technique in a small series were positive, and it appears that, in the hands of experienced laparoscopists, it may prove useful in treating symptomatic infiltrative endometriosis.
