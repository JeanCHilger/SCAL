The laparoscopic findings in patients with chronic pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea. Forty-nine laparoscopic findings of women with chronic pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea, were reviewed. In all of them a laparoscopy was performed under general anesthesia. Endometriosis was found as principal cause of the pain, followed by chronic pelvic inflammatory disease and adhesions. In 10.2% of the patients the pelvis was normal. We can conclude that in the patient with chronic pelvic pain, laparoscopy is a useful method to achieve the correct diagnosis to prescribe the most accurate treatment.
