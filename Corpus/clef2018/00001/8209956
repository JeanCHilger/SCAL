Change in phospholipid content in platelets, immunocompetent cells and myometrial tissue in patients with internal endometriosis. A method of flow horizontal chromatography has been developed permitting investigation of blood and tissue cellular phospholipids ruling out lipid peroxidation effects on cellular membranes. Phospholipid levels of blood and myometrial tissue cells were measured by this method in 67 patients with histologically verified internal endometriosis. Phospholipid and phosphatidyl inosite levels in platelets and immunocompetent cells of these patients reliably differed from those in healthy women. Phosphatidyl inosite levels of heterotopic endometrial tissue was increased by 1.4 times vs. the norm on an average. In parallel with this, a reliable change of phosphatidyl cholines and inosites levels in endometriosis foci were detected as against their levels in intact tissue. The authors suggest a method for the diagnosis of internal endometriosis by phosphatidyl inosite levels in blood lymphocytes.
