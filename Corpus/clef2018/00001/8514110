Hermaphroditism verus: clinical aspects, diagnosis and therapy in adulthood. A 20-year old woman, who underwent an intersex operation during infancy, was presented for evaluation of the gonads because of suspected true hermaphroditism. The phenotype was female with regular menstruations. Examination revealed an ovarian tumour of 8 cm on the left side and a normal right ovary. During the operation, the tumour was revealed as an endometriosis cyst, which could be excised whilst preserving the ovarian tissue. The right gonad was an ovotestis. The testicular part was removed because of a 4% risk of malignancy. The different combinations of ovary/testis and ovotestis are described. Diagnosis and therapy of true hermaphroditism should be performed as early as possible to obtain an adequate gonadal function and an undisturbed psychosexual development.
