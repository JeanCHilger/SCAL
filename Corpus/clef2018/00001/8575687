Relationship of endometrial thickness and sonographic echo pattern to endometriosis in non-in vitro fertilization cycles. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of endometriosis on the proliferation of the endometrium as determined by sonographic measurements of endometrial thickness and echo pattern at peak follicular maturation. A prospective study of 60 infertility patients was conducted in which the endometrium was evaluated sonographically, both before and after laparoscopy. Prior to laparoscopy, the mean endometrial thickness was 10.5 +/- 1.9 mm in the group without endometriosis (n = 20) and 11.7 +/- 2.8 mm in the group with endometriosis (n = 40) (p > 0.05). Following the laparoscopy, there was no change in the mean thickness within each group. The incidence of an unfavorable echo pattern was negligible in both groups. Endometriosis does not cause a reduction in endometrial thickness, nor does it appear to influence the development of an unfavorable echo pattern at time of peak follicular maturation.
