Pulmonary blastoma: an ultrastructural and immunohistochemical study with special reference to nuclear filament aggregation. A case is presented of pulmonary blastoma occurring in the right upper lobe of a 25-year-old man without distinct clinical features and laboratory abnormality. Light microscopic analysis revealed that the tumor was composed of branching glands and morulae embedded in a primitive but bland mesenchyme. Immunohistochemically the epithelial cells were immunoreactive for cytokeratins, S-100 protein, protein gene product 9.5, chromogranin A, calcitonin, and Ki-67 (MIB-1) the mesenchymal cells were immunoreactive for vimentin, actin, cytokeratins, and Ki-67
