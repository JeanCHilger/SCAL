Obstetrical complications of adenomyosis. Literature review and two case reports. Adenomyosis of the uterus is a frequent disorder often associated with pregnancy. Diagnosis is difficult during pregnancy and usually is made after an obstetrical complication. In a review of the literature from 1904 to 1994, only 31 cases of obstetrical complications related to adenomyosis have been reported. We report two cases revealed by obstetrical complications: one causing spontaneous rupture of the uterus during labor in a primiparous woman and the other with cornual ectopic pregnancy diagnosed, due to an episode of massive intraperitoneal bleeding.
