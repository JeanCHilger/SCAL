The impact of the total motile sperm count on the success of intrauterine insemination with husband's spermatozoa. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the total motile sperm count and the success of IUI treatment cycles with postwashed husband spermatozoa in couples with infertility in a large patient population.When 939 couples underwent 1375 cycles of IUI with varying etiologies of infertility which included male factor, endometriosis, tubal factor, ovulatory dysfunction, uterine factor, cervical factor, and unexplained infertility, the results were 207 pregnancies.The overall pregnancy rate per cycle was 15.1% (207/1375). The total motile sperm count were significantly increased in the pregnant group than the nonpregnant group (38.7 x 10(6) versus 28.6 x 10(6) P < 0.001). There was a trend toward an increased success rate with increased total motile sperm count. Significance was reached when the total motile sperm count exceeded 5 x 10(6). Life table analysis was performed and the curve representing a cumulative chance of pregnancy calculated from our data reached 72%.Our findings suggest that a final postwashed total motile sperm count used for IUI may be considered predictive of the success for pregnancy and allow couples to be informed of the chances of success.
