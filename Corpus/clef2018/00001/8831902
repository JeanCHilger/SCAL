The role of estradiol, progesterone, and transforming growth factor on human endometrioma cell culture. The present study demonstrates several aspects of endometrioma cells in culture, namely, 1) cell growth, proliferation, and morphology, 2) effect of cell culture on estrogen and progesterone receptor concentration, 3) effect of estradiol, progesterone, and transforming growth factor. The tissue sample was obtained from ovarian endometriomas that were removed via laparotomy or laparoscopy. The tissue sample was digested with collagenase. After washing, the tissue was cultured in endothelial cell culture medium. Cell count was done by flow cytometry. Receptor study was done by immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated the growth and proliferation of endometrioma cell in culture medium. Electron microscopy showed stroma-like cells. The cells lost their estrogen and progesterone receptors. Estradiol and progesterone added to these cultures did not affect the rate of growth and proliferation of the cells. Transforming growth factor significantly increased the rate of growth and proliferation of these cells.
