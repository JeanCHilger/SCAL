EGF/EGF-R system and benign breast disease during and following the treatment of gynaecological pathologies with an analogue of LH-RH. Clinical and pathological changes of the mammary gland have been studied in 64 women affected by symptomatic Benign Breast Disease (BBD) coexisting with endometriosis or uterine leiomyomata. These patients were rendered hypoestrogenic by subcutaneous administration of the LH-RH analogue Goserelin depot [D-ser (tBu)6 Aza-Gly10-GnRH (ICI118630)] performed every 28 days, for six months. They were evaluated clinically and ultrasonographically before and after treatment to find possible changes of BBD as well as of endometriosis or uterine leiomyomata. Mammary biopsies were performed before and after treatment in all the patients to study the changes of EGF-R expression. Results showed that clinical improvement is accompanied with a reduction of EGF-R expression.
