Cervical endometriosis: a potential pitfall in the evaluation of glandular cells in cervical smears. The use of the cytobrush and other endocervical sampling instruments has resulted in an increasing rate of detection and attention to glandular abnormalities of the cervix. Lesions that have been identified as look-alikes to endocervical gland dysplasia or adenocarcinoma in situ include squamous carcinoma in situ, atypical squamous metaplasia involving glands, and tubal metaplasia. In this report, we describe our recent experience with another condition that can mimic glandular abnormalities--cervical endometriosis. An in-depth review of the features seen in cervical smears from patients with cervical endometriosis is presented.
