Endometriosis of the rectum causing bowel obstruction: a case report. A 42-year-old pre-menopausal woman complaining of lower abdominal pain was referred to our hospital. A barium enema showed rectal stenosis and colonoscopy revealed that the mucosa at the stenotic site was normal with no cancerous changes. Pelvic computed tomography demonstrated an adhesion between the rectum and uterus and a thickened rectal wall. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy under a diagnosis of rectal stenosis. The rectum was found to be surrounded by inflammatory fibrous tissue, which caused the stenosis. As no dissection plane was discernible between the rectum and uterus, low anterior resection of the rectum and hysterectomy were performed. Histological examination showed that endometrial-type glands extended circumferentially around the rectum and invaded the rectal submucosal layer and subsequently, endometriosis of the rectum was diagnosed.
