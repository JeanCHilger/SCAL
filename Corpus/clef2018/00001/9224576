Health and fertility outcomes among women surgically treated for endometriosis. To assess health and fertility status among women after surgical treatment of endometriosis.Prospective study.Community-based gynecologic specialty practice.Two hundred ninety women with newly diagnosed endometriosis.Medical records of all women were abstracted at baseline self-administered questionnaires were used to collect follow-up data. Most women (68-79%) reported some or great improvement in symptomology after surgical treatment. One hundred twenty-four (53%) of 232 women reported one or more pregnancies, two-thirds of which resulted in live births. Secondary sex ratios were below 1 (range 0.92-0.50), reflecting a female excess. Logistic regression analysis identified previous live birth as the only significant predictor of pregnancy after surgeryOverall, these women reported improvement in symptoms at follow-up. Operative and clinical findings were not significant predictors of pregnancy likelihood. Prior live birth conferred more than a twofold increase in pregnancy likelihood, whereas advancing age decreased the likelihood. Reasons for reversed sex ratios are unknown but warrant further study.
