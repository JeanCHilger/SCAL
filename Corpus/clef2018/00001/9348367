A protocol for conscious sedation in microlaparoscopy. To establish a protocol for conscious sedation in microlaparoscopy, we conducted a prospective, observational study of 74 women undergoing the procedure under local anesthesia with conscious sedation for the evaluation and treatment of chronic pelvic pain. Our protocol for conscious sedation allowed us to perform diagnostic microlaparoscopy under local anesthesia in all 74 women and operative microlaparoscopy in 52 (70.2%). This procedure is a safe and effective alternative to general anesthesia during microlaparoscopy in selected patients.
