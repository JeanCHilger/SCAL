Ileal endometriosis masquerading as Crohn's ileitis. Endometriosis is usually confined to the pelvis but may involve distant organs. When the small bowel is affected, endometriosis has a propensity to develop in the distal ileum, which may lead to fibrosis and stricture formation that can be confused with Crohn's disease. Here were describe two women, one with antecedent Crohn's colitis in whom ileal endometriosis mimicked obstructing Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum. These reports illustrate that ileal endometriosis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the ileum, even in the presence of Crohn's disease elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract.
