Splenosis: autotransplantation of splenic tissue. Splenosis is the autotransplantation of splenic tissue that usually follows traumatic rupture of the spleen. Generally, the splenic implants are numerous and are located within the peritoneal cavity however, extra-abdominal splenosis does occur. The implants are rarely clinically significant and are incidental findings at autopsy or at abdominal operation, unrelated to and distant from the splenic trauma and splenectomy. Splenic implants retain their ability to function, and recurrence of a hematologic disease for which the spleen was previously removed should alter the  clinician to the possibility of splenosis. The differential diagnosis includes accessory spleens, endometriosis, hemangiomas and metastatic cancer. We report three cases, two of which represent unusual complications of splenosis: a twisted pedicle of a splenic implant, which apparently caused abdominal pain, and recurrent Felty's syndrome associated with splenosis and an accessory spleen.
