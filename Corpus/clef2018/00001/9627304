Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 concentrations are attenuated in peritoneal fluid and sera of women with endometriosis and restored in sera by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy. To establish tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) concentrations in peritoneal fluid (PF) and sera of women with endometriosis and compare them to disease-free controls.Prospective randomized study.Academic medical center.Women with laparoscopically documented endometriosis and disease-free women of reproductive age.Peritoneal fluid and sera were collected, and some women received gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) therapy for endometriosis.Peritoneal fluid and sera TIMP-1 concentrations were measured with a specific RIA.The TIMP-1 concentrations were significantly lower in PF and sera of women with endometriosis compared with disease-free women. The GnRH-a therapy restored serum TIMP-1 concentrations.Aberrant expression and localization of TIMP-1 may derange the proteolytic milieu of the peritoneal cavity and contribute to the etiology and underlying physiologic sequelae associated with endometriosis. Measurement of TIMP-1 in serum may aid in diagnosing endometriosis and assist with monitoring treatment efficacy in women with this disease.
