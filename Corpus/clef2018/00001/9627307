Basic fibroblast growth factor: peritoneal and follicular fluid levels and its effect on early embryonic development. To investigate the effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) on preimplantation embryos and to evaluate the levels of basic FGF in follicular and peritoneal fluid.Prospective study.University-based laboratory.Follicular fluids (FFs) were obtained from women undergoing ovulation induction (n = 62) and peritoneal fluids were obtained from women with (n = 49) or without (n = 12) endometriosis.The effect of basic FGF on mouse embryos was assessed. Basic FGF concentrations were measured in pre-hCG and post-hCG FFs and in peritoneal fluids.Two-cell murine embryos were treated with basic FGF and followed for the rate of blastocyst formation and embryo hatching. Follicular and peritoneal fluid basic FGF levels were measured by ELISA.Basic FGF (10 ng/mL) decreased the rate of blastocyst formation and embryo hatching. The level of basic FGF did not change in the FF around ovulation, and there was no correlation between FF basic FGF levels and reproductive parameters, with the exception of age. The levels of basic FGF in the peritoneal fluid of women with or without endometriosis were not different.Basic FGF is present in follicular and peritoneal fluids, but its concentration in these fluids does not change during the menstrual cycle or in the presence of endometriosis. Basic FGF inhibits murine preimplantation embryonic development at concentrations 10-100 times higher than the levels detected in follicular and peritoneal fluids.
