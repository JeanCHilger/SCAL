Microlaparoscopy for suspected pelvic pathology--a comparison of 2mm versus 10mm laparoscope. This study presents an independently-assessed comparison of the laparoscopic view obtained using a 2mm versus 10mm laparoscope in women with suspected pelvic pathology. Fifteen female volunteers booked for laparoscopy with clinical evidence of pelvic abnormality according to clinical findings and/or pelvic ultrasound were recruited for this study. Sequential observations were carried out by independent observers for clinically significant differences. Although discrepancies were noted in 3 patients the view obtained with the 2mm microendoscope was considered to be comparable to that obtained with the 10mm telescope. The cases with discordant findings included mild or minimal endometriosis and distal tubal disease. The results of this study suggest that microendoscopy is likely to be entirely adequate for many routine laparoscopic procedures and sterilization.
