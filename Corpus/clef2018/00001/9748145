Functionality of the progesterone receptor in ovarian cancer and its regulation by estrogen. Here, we sought to obtain evidence that the progesterone receptor (PR) may be functional in ovarian cancer and regulated by estrogen. Megestrol acetate inhibited growth of the PR-positive PE04 ovarian carcinoma xenograft but not the PR-negative HOX 60 xenograft. PR concentration was higher in early-stage (I/II) tumors than in advanced-stage (III/IV) tumors (P = 0.007) and in tumors of endometrioid histology compared to other carcinoma subtypes (P = 0.009). Patients with a tumor PR concentration of >40 fmol/mg protein had significantly improved survival over those patients whose tumors contained <40 fmol/mg (P = 0.0007 log-rank). Evidence of PR regulation by estrogen was obtained by endocrine manipulation of the PE04 xenograft. PR content of PE04 xenografts fell from 145 to 7 fmol/mg protein in ovariectomized mice and was 2 fmol/mg in male mice. Administration of 17-beta-estradiol increased PR content to 745 fmol/mg. In primary ovarian carcinomas, PR was significantly associated with ER concentrations (P < 0.0001), suggesting regulation of PR levels by estrogen. This association was present for tumors of endometrioid histology (P < 0.0001) but not for those with serous histology (P = 0.31). These data point to the regulation of PR levels by estrogen in ovarian cancer and to a mediatory role for PR in the inhibition of growth induced by progestin.
