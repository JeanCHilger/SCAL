Loss of heterozygosity and mutational analysis of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene in synchronous endometrial and ovarian carcinomas. Mutations of the human putative protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTEN/MMAC1) gene at chromosome 10q23 have been found frequently in type I endometrial carcinomas. Endometrioid adenocarcinoma is the most frequent histology seen in patients with clinically determined synchronous endometrial and ovarian carcinomas. We report a high incidence of PTEN/MMAC1 mutations and 10q23 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in patients with synchronous endometrial and ovarian carcinomas. Paraffin-embedded precision microdissected tumors were analyzed for 10 matched synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers and 11 matched control metastatic endometrial cancers. Single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis was used to screen for mutations in all tumors and corresponding normal lymphocyte DNA. LOH was determined using a panel of four microsatellite markers within the PTEN/MMAC1 locus. PTEN/MMAC1 mutations were found in 43% (9 of 21) of the endometrial cancers studied, similarly represented in the clinically synchronous group (5 of 10 or 50%) and the advanced metastatic group (4 of 11 36%
