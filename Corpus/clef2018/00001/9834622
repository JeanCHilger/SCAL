Lower antigenecity of long-term in vitro cultured eutopic endometrial stromal cells from endometriotic patients: a possible evidence of genetic disorders in endometriosis. In order to investigate an evidence for genetic disorders in endometriotic patients, eutopic endometrial stromal cells were cultured in vitro for more than 4 months and their antigenecities were characterized by flowcytometry. Eutopic stromal cells from 3 endometriotic patients showed lower expressions of the seven antigens (4 cytokine receptors and 3 leukocyte antigens) than the stromal cells from 5 non-endometriotic women. The preliminary results suggest a possibility that endometriotic patients have certain irreversible genetic abnormalities in the stromal cells, and suggest that endometriosis does not occur as a result in vitro unknown transient stimulation.
