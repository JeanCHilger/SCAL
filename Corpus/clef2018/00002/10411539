Regulation of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression in human endometrial stromal cells by integrin-dependent cell adhesion. Shed menstrual endometrium is viable and has the ability to implant and grow in women, who eventually develop endometriosis. Many of the cell-to-cell or cell-to-extracellular matrix (ECM) connections are mediated by integrins. Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, a potent chemotactic factor produced in many cell types, is elevated in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. In this study, we investigated whether endometrial stromal cell (ESC) adhesion itself induces the expression of MCP-1 and whether this process is integrin mediated. ESC were plated on Petri dishes and 24-well plates coated with fibronectin, laminin, collagen IV, poly-L-lysine, or mouse anti-human integrin beta(1) and beta(2) monoclonal antibodies. Adherence of ESC to various ECM substrates, except for poly-L-lysine, a non-integrin-dependent adhesion matrix, induced the expression of MCP-1 at both mRNA and protein levels. Engagement of beta(1)-containing integrins was associated with ESC adhesion and resulted in up-regulation of MCP-1 gene expression and protein secretion. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by treating ESC with cytochalasin D completely blocked the increase of MCP-1 induced in response to integrin activation. These findings indicate a novel mechanism of MCP-1 regulation. Cell adhesion to ECM is an important event that leads to stimulation of MCP-1 expression, and this process is mediated by integrins.
