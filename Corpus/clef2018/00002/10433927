Comparison of c-met expression in ovarian epithelial tumors and normal epithelia of the female reproductive tract by quantitative laser scan microscopy. The transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor c-met with its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), acts as a mitogen, motogen, and morphogen in many normal epithelia. HGF/SF-met signaling has also been implicated in neoplastic progression and metastasis. In this study, immunofluorescence staining and quantitative laser scanning confocal microscopy were used to measure c-met expression in ovarian surface epithelial tumors from 17 oophorectomy specimens. These specimens were from patients aged 25 to 81 (mean age, 52) and included 10 malignant tumors, 4 borderline tumors, and five benign tumors including a Brenner tumor. For comparison, c-met expression was measured in normal tissues from the same patients, including 4 ovarian surface epithelia, 4 fallopian tube epithelia, 2 endometria, and 3 endocervical epithelia, as well as 3 cases of endometriosis. Relative pixel intensity values of c-met expression ranged from 0.4 in a normal ovarian surface epithelium to 22.3 in a borderline serous tumor. Malignant tumors (mean, 9.6) and borderline tumors (mean, 12.9) had higher average c-met expression levels than normal tissues (mean, 3.6) and endometriosis (mean, 1.8). The expression levels of benign tumors were intermediate (mean, 7.9). Among the normal tissues, c-met expression in fallopian tubes (mean, 8.2 range, 3.4-12.9) was higher than that of the other normal epithelia (mean, 1.6
