Massive ascites secondary to severe endometriosis. Massive ascites is an unusual association with endometriosis. This case report is of such a condition in an Afro-Jamaican woman. The diagnosis was made at laparotomy and conservative treatment was adopted allowing for retention of reproductive function. Postoperative therapy was Goserelin, a Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) agonist, for six months. This relieved all of her symptoms. However, long term follow-up is needed, as recurrence is possible.
