The SCID mouse: an experimental model for endometriosis. The purpose of this study was to validate the suitability of the severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse as an experimental model for endometriosis, by defining the morphological and histological features of induced endometrial implants, and characterizing specific biochemical properties of these implants. Human secretory endometrial tissues were injected into the peritoneal cavity of SCID/SCID CB17 mature female mice. Successful peritoneal implantation was observed in 55 of 57 (96.5%) SCID mice and consisted of circumscribed elevated nodules. Haematoxylin-eosin staining of implanting lesions demonstrated the presence of endometrial glandular tissue in a mixed background of stromal and inflammatory cells. When progesterone was administered to mice, epithelial glands underwent well-defined secretory changes. Immunohistochemical analysis using polyclonal human pan-cytokeratin antibodies demonstrated selective positive staining in the glandular epithelium of the human implants with none in the surrounding stroma. In-situ hybridization analysis using complement component 3 cDNA radiolabelled riboprobes yielded significantly more intense signals in glands compared to stroma. As human endometrial implants in SCID mice were shown to retain specific histological, functional and biochemical properties, we conclude that the SCID mouse is an attractive animal model for the study of endometriosis.
