Managing endometriosis. Strategies to minimize pain and damage. Endometriosis is a common condition affecting a significant number of women of childbearing age. The diagnosis is clinical and thus can be difficult to make. History taking is generally most helpful, and diagnostic tests have a limited role. Diagnostic laparoscopy remains the "gold standard" for diagnosis of endometriosis. Treatment is geared toward improving fertility and controlling pain and is often not curative. However, both medical and surgical therapies are of value in controlling the disease. Attention to the psychosocial needs of the patient are also critical. Future therapies will be based on a further understanding of the pathogenesis of endometriosis and the effect of hormones on the disease. For the primary care physician who may not be comfortable prescribing GnRH analogs or other medical therapies, referral to a gynecologist or endocrinologist should be considered.
