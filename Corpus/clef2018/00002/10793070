Degranulating eosinophils in human endometriosis. Degranulating eosinophils have been described in most endometrial cancers. We hypothesized that endometriosis (ectopic, nonneoplastic endometrial tissue) would be an appropriate model system for determining whether eosinophil degranulation is part of a specific immune response to endometrial cancer or if it is related to the more general phenomenon of tissue remodeling (wound healing) that is common to both disorders. To test this hypothesis, we performed immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to evaluate the presence of eosinophil peroxidase (a marker of eosinophil degranulation) in normal endometrium (n = 20) and endometriosis samples (n = 24) and to define the coexpression of three eosinophil chemoattractants: interleukin-5 (IL-5), eotaxin, and regulated on activator-normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). There was focally intense deposition of eosinophil peroxidase in the fibrotic connective tissue and blood vessels of 21 of 24 human endometriosis specimens two samples showed weak staining, and only one tissue was negative for eosinophil degranulation. None of the 10 normal proliferative endometrial specimens had evidence of eosinophil degranulation, and four of 10 secretory tissues stained only weakly for eosinophil peroxidase. The presence of degranulating eosinophils was also associated with the presence of eotaxin and IL-5 in some samples and with RANTES in others. We conclude that the abundant presence of degranulating eosinophils in the fibrous regions of endometriosis supports the interpretation that eosinophils are involved in general tissue remodeling and wound healing rather than a tissue-directed immune response.
