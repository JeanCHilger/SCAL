Cervical cytology and immunohistochemical features in endometrial adenocarcinoma simulating microglandular hyperplasia. A case report. The histology of a few cases of adenocarcinoma simulating cervical microglandular hyperplasia (MGH-AdCa) has been reported. However, the cytologic features of MGH-AdCa in cervical smears and the immunohistochemical profile have not been described.A 73-year-old female presented with vaginal bleeding. The cervical Pap smear was initially interpreted by the cytotechnologist as "reactive endocervical cells" and was referred for cytopathologist review. The final interpretation was atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS), probably neoplastic. Endometrial biopsy and total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy showed International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians grade 1 endometrial carcinoma. The superficial component of the tumor resembled cervical microglandular hyperplasia (MGH) the deeper component had an endometrioid pattern. The Pap smear predominantly showed a glandular component with features of MGH. However, the presence of scattered single cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, one to three nucleoli, easily detectable mitotic figures, randomly scattered apoptotic bodies and focal, watery diathesis suggested a neoplastic process. Immunohistochemistry was studied on paraffin sections. In addition to other markers, the tumor cells were immunoreactive for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).Although the cervical Pap smear in this case had an MGH-like pattern, some features were atypical enough to suggest a diagnosis of AGUS, probably neoplastic. CEA immunoreactivity of MGH-AdCa could also help to differentiate it from MGH.
