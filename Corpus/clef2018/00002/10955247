Relationships between concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and nitric oxide in follicular fluid and oocyte quality. Our objective was to explain a relationship between concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) in follicular fluid, oocyte quality, and outcomes of in vitro fertilization--embryo transfer (IVF-ET).The concentrations of TNF-alpha and NO were measured in 115 follicular fluid samples collected from 43 patients undergoing IVF-ET program, due to tubal obstruction, some with endometriosis (8 patients) or hydrosalpinx (5 patients). A correlation of these factors concentrations and the oocyte quality, the oocyte maturity, and infertility-associated diseases was analyzed.No correlation was found between concentrations of NO and TNF-alpha in follicular fluid. NO concentrations in follicular fluids were significantly higher in patients with endometriosis (P < 0.001) or hydrosalpinx (P < 0.01) compared to the patients with just tubal obstruction. Follicular NO concentration differences according to oocyte maturity and oocyte quality were not found. In contrast, TNF-alpha concentrations in follicular fluids were significantly higher in poor quality oocytes (P < 0.05) but were not associated with infertility-associated diseases, such as hydrosalphinx or endometriosis,and the oocyte maturity. No significant differences in follicular levels of NO and TNF-alpha as well as IVF-ET parameters of pregnant and nonpregnant groups were revealed.There is no significant correlation between the concentrations of NO and TNF-alpha in follicular fluid. NO levels in follicular fluid are altered in infertility-associated diseases. However, TNF-alpha levels but not NO levels influence oocyte quality. These results suggest that the production of NO and TNF-alpha in follicular fluid may be regulated via different pathways and can be tempered with infertility-associated diseases, thereby influencing oocyte quality locally.
