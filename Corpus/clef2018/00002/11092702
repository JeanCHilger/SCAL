The effect of follicular fluid reactive oxygen species on the outcome of in vitro fertilization. To examine the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the follicular fluid of women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) and identify its role in pregnancy outcome.In this prospective study, ROS and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels were measured by the chemiluminescence method in the follicular fluid of 53 women. Age, number of oocytes recovered, percentage of oocytes fertilized, ROS and TAC levels were compared in women who did and did not become pregnant.Patients who become pregnant had significantly higher log-transformed ROS levels (1.01 +/- 0.14, P = 0.031 than those who did not (0.69 +/- 0.08). Women with endometriosis or male factor infertility who became pregnant had significantly higher ROS levels (1.44 +/- 0.23 and 1.31 +/- 0.19) than those who did not (0.60 +/- 0.17 and 0.67 +/- 0.16 P < .006 and P < .01).Follicular fluid ROS, at low concentrations, may be a potential marker for predicting success in IVF patients.
