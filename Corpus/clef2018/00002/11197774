Direct effect of danazol on endometrial hyperplasia in adenomyotic women: treatment with danazol containing intrauterine device. It is well known that danazol has a direct effect on endometriosis tissue and cell. We have been treating adenomyotic women with danazol containing intrauterine device (D-IUD) from June 1993 to August 2000 and significant decrease of dysmenorrhea and serum CA-125 levels were observed. Of fifty-nine adenomyotic women, eight women were also diagnosed by endometrial biopsy as endometrial hyperplasia and one woman was diagnosed as atypical endometrial hyperplasia. In these endometrial hyperplastic patients, endometrial tissues were obtained before insertion and at the time of removal or exchange of D-IUD and examined pathologically. In all of the 9 women, histopathological findings of endometrial hyperplasia disappeared after D-IUD treatment. In particular, in one patient, findings of atypical endometrial hyperplasia also disappeared after D-IUD treatment. She is now closely observed at our clinic using D-IUD. By these evidences, we postulate that D-IUD is one of the treatment choices of endometrial hyperplasia given exposure of the endometrium to such an extraordinary high concentration of danazol released by D-IUD and avoidance of adverse effects of oral danazol or general administration of GnRH and progesterone. In particular, in atypical endometrial hyperplasia case, its mechanisms might give great benefit to patient. However, mechanisms of direct effect of danazol on endometrial hyperplasia remain to be elucidated in the future study.
