Standardized AgNOR analysis as a prognostic parameter in endometrial carcinoma, endometrioid type. To evaluate interobserver reproducibility of histologic grade in endometrial adenocarcinomas of endometrioid type (EC), to assess the relationships between nuclear grade and the amount of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region (AgNOR) proteins and to determine the prognostic value of AgNOR proteins and the main clinicopathologic parameters.Architectural and nuclear grading were independently assessed by two pathologists in 64 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical samples of EC obtained from an equal number of patients (age range, 38-84 years mean, 63.5). Interobserver agreement was determined using the kappa statisticThe kappa values for interobserver agreement were substantial for architectural grading and moderate for nuclear grading. When NORA values were compared to the nuclear grade assessed by different observers, the most significant linear correlation (r = .713, P < .001) was found for the nuclear assessment obtained by consensus of the two pathologists. Moreover, statistical analysis allowed discrimination of architectural grade 1 from grade 2 and 3 EC. By the Kaplan-Meier method, the prognosis was worse for patients with higher NORA values (> 4.212 micron 2), while, by Cox multivariate analysis, AgNOR quantity emerged as an independent prognostic variable.Use of standardized AgNOR analysis may be an additional and objective tool in the assessment of histologic grade as well as a reliable method of determining prognosis in EC.
