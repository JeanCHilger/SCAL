Interleukin 1beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in endometriotic tissue and in endometrium. To compare the levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNFalpha in endometriotic tissue and in endometrium from women with endometriosis and healthy controls.Open.Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at a university hospital.Twenty-six women with endometriosis and 22 controls operated on for clinical indications.ELISA in homogenized tissue samples collected during surgery.Levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNFalpha in tissue homogenates.The three types of tissue differed significantly with respect to all three cytokines. Endometriotic tissue had significantly higher concentrations of IL-1beta than endometrium from both patients with endometriosis and healthy controls. Both endometriotic tissue and endometrium from patients had significantly higher concentrations of IL-6, and endometriotic tissue had significantly lower concentration of TNFalpha than did endometrium from controls. IL-1beta showed a cycle phase dependence that was significant in endometrium from patients, being higher in the secretory than in the follicular phase. IL-1beta was significantly higher in endometrioma than in lesions of other localizations. Concentrations of IL-1beta and IL-6 were positively correlated in endometriotic tissue and in endometrium from controls. No other significant correlations were found.This study has shown a significant production of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNFalpha in endometriotic tissue and endometrium, with significant differences between the tissue types, indicating a deviating cytokine pattern in both endometriotic tissue and endometrium from women with endometriosis compared with that from healthy controls.
