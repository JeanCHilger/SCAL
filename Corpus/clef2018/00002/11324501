Overexpression of p53, EGFR, c-erbB2 and c-erbB3 in endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary. To determine overexpression of p53, EGFR, c-erbB-2 and c-erbB-3 in endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary and to evaluate the prognostic significance of these results, especially, coexisting overexpression of p53 and one of the member of type I growth factor receptor family.Overexpressions of the p53, EGFR, c-erbB-2 and c-erbB-3 protein were studied by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue from 28 patients with endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary.11 (39.3%), 13 (46.4%), and 14 (50.0%) were stained positively with p53, c-erbB-2 and c-erbB-3 monoclonal antibodies. 13 (46.4%) was stained positively with EGFR polyclonal antibody. There were no relationship between p53, EGFR, C-erbB-2, c-erbB-3 and histologic grade, lymph node metastasis. The percentage of tumors with over expression of p53, EGFR, C-erbB-2 and c-erbB-3 was higher in those with stage II-III tumors compared with those with stage I, in patients with residual tumor after initial surgery compared with those without. A high survival rate was observed in patients without p53, EGFR, c-erbB-2 and c-erbB-3 overexpression respectively than those with. A highest survival rate was observed in patients with both p53 and one of EGFR, c-erbB-2 and c-erbB-3 negative compared with those both positive or either of both positive.Overexpression of p53, EGFR, c-erbB-2 and C-erbB-3 resulted in a poorer prognosis respectively. Overexpression of both p53 and one of the EGFR, c-erbB-2 and c-erbB-3 is a worse prognostic indicator in patients with endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary.
