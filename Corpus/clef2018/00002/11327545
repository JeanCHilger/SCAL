Correlation between decreased type-II interleukin-1 receptor and increased monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression in the endometrium of women with endometriosis. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), a potent inducer of macrophage recruitment and activation, is overexpressed in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. Eutopic endometrial cells of women with endometriosis secrete higher levels of MCP-1 than those of normal women, following stimulation with interleukin-1 (IL-1). The aim of this study was to examine whether there is any correlation between the expression of IL-1 receptor type II (IL-IRII), a specific downregulator of IL-1 activity, and that of MCP-1 in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis.Endometrial biopsies of 46 women with endometriosis and 22 healthy women were evaluated simultaneously for IL-1RII and MCP-1 expression by immunohistochemistry.Our study revealed a highly significant correlation between the decreased expression of IL-1RII and the increased expression of MCP-1 in the endometrial tissue of women with endometriosis (Spearman correlation coefficient r = -0.377, P = 0.002), particularly in the initial stages of the disease (stages I and II r = - 0.368, P = 0.020 and r = -0.480, P = 0.002, respectively). Furthermore, this correlation was observed in the proliferative (r = -0.366, P = 0.047) and the secretory phases (r = -0.321, P = 0.049) of the menstrual cycle.These results suggest that the reduced capability of endometrial tissue to downregulate IL-1 proinflammatory effects may be involved in the increased expression of MCP-1 in the endometrium of women with endometriosis and the establishment of an inflammatory state. The results also indicate a sustained process of cell activation throughout the menstrual cycle.
