Cell culture of biopsied endometriomas after danazol/hormonal therapy: a study of growth features and fertility effects. The growth features of cells from endometriomas biopsied from patients who had been treated with Danazol or with hormones have not been studied in vitro. Danazol is a versatile drug and despite its recognised efficacy in controlling endometriosis, little is known about is cytotoxicity and mechanism of action. Culture of the biopsied endometriomas permitted qualitative cytotoxic assessments by way of comparison with cultured normal uterine endometrial cells treated in vitro with Danazol. The growth characteristics were studied in monolayer and collagen gel cultures. Cytopathology was characterised by light and electron microscopy. Since endometriosis is associated with infertility in women, data from in vitro fertilisation (IVF) were analysed with respect to treatment modalities as compared with cases suffering fallopian occlusion. Danazol reduced pregnancy chances. Two factors may be responsible: (a) altered follicle development resulting in poor oocyte quality (b) reduced nidation because of long-lasting endometrial cytotoxicity. The experimental findings reported here support the latter explanation. Consequently, Danazol therapy should be conditional patients wishing to achieve pregnancy should preferably receive hormonal therapy.
