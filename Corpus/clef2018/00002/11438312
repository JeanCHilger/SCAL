Role of cytokines in endometriosis. To review the literature on the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and endometriosis-associated infertility.Pertinent studies were identified by a computer search of MEDLINE. References of selected articles were hand-searched for additional citations.Recent studies suggest that the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis contains an increased number of activated macrophages that secrete various local products, such as growth factors and cytokines. Levels of several cytokines were reported to be elevated in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. Because the peritoneal environment may be controlled by locally regulated factors, cytokines are believed to play a role in the development and progression of endometriosis and endometriosis-associated infertility. A possible pathogenic mechanism links cytokines with endometriosis.Cytokines, which are produced by many cell types including endometriotic tissues, play diverse roles in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and endometriosis-associated infertility. More studies about the specific role of these cells and soluble factors are needed to improve understanding of endometriosis and to develop novel therapies.
