Study on in vitro cytokines levels induced from peripheral mononuclear cells in patients with endometriosis. To study the changes and significance of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8(IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) levels in vitro cultured system of peripheral mononuclear cells in patient with endometriosis(Em).Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 31 cases of endometriosis, classified into mild group (stage I and II, n = 11), and severe group (stage III and IV, n = 20) according to the Revised American Fertility society criteria 1985, and 15 normal controls were separated and induced by lipopolysaccharide and phytohemagglutinin, followed by 48 hour incubation in vitro, then the supernatant were collected. The levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, the concentrations of NO, expressed by nitrite and nitrate (NO2-/NO3-) content were measured by Griess methods.The concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha and NO were significantly higher in both mild and severe Em groups than those in controls (P < 0.01). No differences between the mild and severe Em groups was seen. There were strong positive correlation between the levels of IL-6 and IL-8, TNF-alpha and NO in patients with endometriosis (P < 0.01).The immune function of peripheral mononuclear cell in patients with endometriosis was disordered. It may activate peripheral mononuclear cells to produce high levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha and NO, which may take part in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
