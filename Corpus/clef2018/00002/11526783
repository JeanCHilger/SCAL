The assessment of dendritic cells cultured from peritoneal fluid macrophages: first report and new perspectives in the treatment of endometriosis. Dendritic cells represent discrete leukocyte subpopulation of specialist or "professional" antigen-presenting cells (APC). They play a crucial role in the activation of naive T cells "in vivo" They have monocyte/macrophages origin. There are no data in literature on the presence of dendritic cells derived from peritoneal fluid monocytes/macrophages. In our study we tried to culture PF macrophages from patients who undergone surgery so that to obtain dendritic cells. PF was aspirated during laparoscopy from patients with endometriosis, unexplained infertility or benign noninflammatory ovarian tumor. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated using adherence method then were cultured and stimulated with GM-CSF and IL-4. Phenotype of cultured cell was estimated using flow cytometry after incubation with monoclonal antibodies CD45/14, CD 40/HLA-DR, CD28/3, CD3/40L, CD25/5 and CD69/HLA-DR. Morphology of cultured cells was confirmed microscopically after May-Grunvald-Giemsa staining. PF leukocytes concentration varied from 1.2 x 10(6) cells/mm3 to 22.6 x 10(6) cells/mm3. Cultured monocytes/macrophages from PF had morphology typical for dendritic cells. We also found that only dendritic cells from patients with endometriosis had higher expression HLA-DR antigen (93.6% of cells) and low expression of CD40 (2.7% of cells) on their surface in comparison to reference group. It is worthy to notify that dendritic cells from patients with endometriosis expressed also CD25 antigen characteristic for T leukocytes. To our data it is the first report in literature on dendritic cells obtained from PF macrophages.
