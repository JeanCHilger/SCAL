VEGF, TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the peritoneal fluid of women with unexplained infertility. Unexplained infertility is an important problem in diagnosis and therapy in everyday gynecologist's practice. Looking for possible reasons of the unexplained infertility we studied the concentrations of selected cytokines (VEGF, TNF-alpha and IL-6) in the peritoneal fluid of women suffering from the unexplained infertility. We compared the results in the studied group with the control group and with the patients with endometriosis. Immunological disorders of the peritoneal fluid in endometriosis are thought to take part in its pathomechanism. Our results suggest that the levels of one of the main factors of endothelium proliferation (VEGF) in the peritoneal fluid from women with unexplained infertility and women with endometriosis are comparable. Concentration IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the peritoneal fluid in case of unexplained infertility and control group was lower than in the endometriosis patients.
