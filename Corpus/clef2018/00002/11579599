Ureteral endometriosis: a case report and a review of the Japanese literature. A 42-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of abdominal fullness and a large abdominal mass. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated bilateral ovarian tumors, uterine myoma and left hydronephrosis. On excretory urography the left kidney was not visualized and retrograde pyelography (RP) revealed left hydronephrosis and a filling defect in the left lower ureter. Based on the diagnoses of endometriosis of bilateral ovaries, uterine myoma and a left ureteral tumor, abdominal total hysterectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy and partial ureterectomy were performed. Pathologically, in the uterus, both leiomyoma and adenomyosis, and endometriosis of the right ovary and ureter were diagnosed. Medication with buserelin acetate was started.
