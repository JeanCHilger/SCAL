Validation study of nonsurgical diagnosis of endometriosis. To determine whether the surgical diagnosis of endometriosis can be predicted using symptoms, signs, and ultrasound findings.Prospective study (study sample) retrospective record review (test sample).Hospital of Desio (study sample) and Mangiagalli Hospital (test sample), Italy.Ninety women scheduled to undergo laparoscopy or laparotomy (study sample) 120 women who underwent laparoscopy (test sample).The study sample group was interviewed before surgery about infertility and dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and noncyclic pelvic pain and each member had a pelvic examination and a transvaginal ultrasound. At surgery, endometriosis was noted. For the test sample, the same information was abstracted from medical records after laparoscopy.The ability of symptoms, signs, and ultrasound to predict endometriosis at surgery. A classification tree was developed with the study sample and evaluated with the test sample.Ovarian endometriosis, but not nonovarian endometriosis, could be reliably predicted with noninvasive tools. Ultrasound and examination best predicted ovarian endometriosis, correctly classifying 100% of cases with no false positive diagnoses in the study sample. Similar results were found in the test sample.Noninvasive tools may be used to identify women with ovarian, but not nonovarian endometriosis, with excellent agreement with surgical diagnosis.
