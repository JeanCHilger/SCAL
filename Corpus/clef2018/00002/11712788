Immunohistochemical expression of topoisomerase IIalpha (Topo IIalpha) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), plus chemosensitivity testing, as chemotherapeutic indices of ovarian and endometrial carcinomas. The purpose of this study was to investigate the chemosensitive and chemoresistant indices of gynecologic malignancies.We studied the expression of topoisomerase II alpha(Topo II alpha) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), and then correlated them with the in vitro chemosensitivities of gynecologic tumor cells using immunohistochemistry and a tetrazolium dye (MTT) assay.In the 19 ovarian carcinomas examined, the mean Topo II alpha index (%) and the tumor cell growth inhibition rate (I.R.: %) for doxorubicin and etoposide in the clear cell adenocarcinomas [15.8, 21.4, 32.3] were all lower than in the endometrioid [33.9 p<0.001, 58.3, 61.9The Topo II alpha index and the results of in vitro chemosensitivity testing may be of assistance in selecting the appropriate chemotherapeutic drugs against gynecologic malignancies based on their histological type and differentiation, along with MRP expression.
