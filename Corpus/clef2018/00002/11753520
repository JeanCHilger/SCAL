New placental factors: Between implantation and inflammatory reaction. The trophoblast invasion is a dynamic changes in cell-cell and cell matrix interaction and it create in the endometrio a reaction similar to the inflammatory reaction. In the recent past most of the investigator in this field had focus on the mediator of this process especially on cytokine and on vasoactive agent. We have studied the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), adrenomedullin (AM), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and S-100 protein. Several evidences had lead our choice: the two first factors are essentially local mediator of vasospasm which works in synergy during the inflammatory reaction, but the AM I addition stimulates the DNA synthesis and cell proliferation of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, induces the cell cycle progression from G0 to G1 phase and the malignant cell lines express AM mRNA and mRNA for its receptor and the pattern of distribution of ir-AM and its mRNA during murine development is similar to that of other growth factors (TGFb isoforms, PDGF, FGF, IGF 1 and 2) Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is a major biosynthetic enzyme of intracellular fatty acid synthesis, its expression and activity is enhanced in proliferative tissues, such as malignant cells
