Expression of monocyte chemotacticp protein-1 in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. To examine the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in the endometrium of patients with and without endometriosis.A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was utilized to examine and quantitate MCP-1 mRNA expressions and levels in the eutopic endometrium. Thirty patients with endometriosis were included as study group, and 20 patients without endometriosis selected as control group.26 (87%) of 30 samples of endometrium from patients with endometriosis expressed MCP-1 mRNA, 19 of which were strong expression, while 15 (75%) of 20 samples of endometrium from patients without endometriosis express MCP-1 mRNA (P > 0.05). When endometriosis were grouped by Revised American Fertility Society (RAFS) stages, there was no obvious correlation between stage and MCP-1 mRNA expression level (P > 0.05). Semi-quantitative PCR showed the expression level of MCP-1 in endometrium of patients with endometriosis were higher than those of patients without endometriosis (0.746 +/- 0.345 Vs 0.460 +/- 0.341 respectively, P < 0.05).The MCP-1 mRNA is over expressed in the eutopic endometrium from patients with endometriosis, which may play some roles on the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
