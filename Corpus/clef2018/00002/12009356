Spontaneous and stimulated secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor by peritoneal macrophages in women with and without endometriosis. To assess spontaneous and stimulated secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) by peritoneal macrophages in women with and without endometriosis.Macrophages were isolated from the peritoneal fluid and cultured for different periods of time (6, 20, and 44 hours) without any stimulation to determine spontaneous secretion of MCP-1 and MIF. Macrophages were also exposed to 1 microg/mL lipopolysaccharide for 6 hours to evaluate the stimulated secretion of these cytokines.Gynecology clinic and human reproduction research laboratory.Twelve fertile women and 11 women with endometriosis.Peritoneal fluid obtained at laparoscopy.Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and MIF concentrations in the culture medium using ELISA.Peritoneal macrophages of women with endometriosis demonstrated an increased capacity to secrete MCP-1 either spontaneously or after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. They also showed a marked tendency for an increased secretion of MIF, but no statistically significant difference was found.Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and MIF production by peritoneal macrophages may contribute to paracrine and autocrine activation and to macrophage accumulation in the peritoneal cavity of women with endometriosis. These mechanisms may exacerbate peritoneal inflammation and favor the growth of endometrial implants.
