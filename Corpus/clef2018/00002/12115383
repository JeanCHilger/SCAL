Ribosomal DNA methylation in patients with endometrial carcinoma: an independent prognostic marker. Surgery is curative for the majority of patients with endometrial carcinoma: Consequently, the use of adjuvant therapy has been controversial. More effective methods to identify patients who are at risk for recurrence and who would benefit from adjuvant therapy are needed. The objective of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) methylation in patients with endometrial carcinoma.rDNA methylation was assessed in 215 endometrial tumors by Southern blot analysis of HpaII-digested DNA using a probe corresponding to the 5.8 and 28S ribosomal subunits. Tumor rDNA methylation status was correlated with patient outcome.The majority of tumors demonstrated high levels of rDNA methylation (rDNA-high 74%). Both disease free survival and overall survival were significantly worse for patients with low-level rDNA methylation (rDNA-lowrDNA methylation is an independent prognostic indicator for patients with endometrial carcinoma that may serve to identify women with early-stage disease at who are at high risk for recurrence. Racial differences in DNA methylation may explain the historically observed disparity in survival between African-American patients and Caucasian patients.
