Elevated level of CA 125 antigen in women in reproductive age without neoplastic diseases in pelvis minor. Behaviour of CA 125 antigen in women in reproductive age without neoplastic diseases in pelvis minor was presented. The study material was divided into 4 groups: 29 women with endometriosis, 16 women with inflammation of pelvis minor, 7 women with cirrhosis, developmental malformation of reproductive organs and pregnancy, 8 women of middle gynaecological age 6.75 had endometriosis. It has been revealed that the inflammatory state of the uterine adnexa and the appendix as well as cirrhosis, developmental malformation of reproductive organs may evolve with elevated level of CA 125 marker. It has also been shown that endometriosis in pelvis minor may be expressed by a raised level of CA 125 marker.
