Endometriosis of umbilical cicatrix: a case report and review of the literature. The present report refers to a case of "primitive" endometriosis of the umbilical scar in a 50-years-old woman who complained of the appearance at the umbilicus of two nodules measuring 7 and 2 mm in diameter. These nodules, which were brownish in colour, were responsible for prickly pain and itching unrelated to the menstrual cycle. Both nodules were excised after a preoperative non-specific diagnosis of granuloma. Pathology findings revealed "cutaneous endometriosis". The authors believe that the appearance of a nodular swelling at the umbilicus of a woman of child-bearing age should lead to a suspicion of endometriosis among the possible diagnoses.
