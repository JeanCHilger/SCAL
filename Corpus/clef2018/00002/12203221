Endometrioid carcinoma of the endometrium with an invasive component of minimal deviation carcinoma. Minimal deviation endometrioid adenocarcinoma is a rare pathological variant of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. We describe a case representing another rare variant of endometrioid adenocarcinoma composed of both typical and minimal deviation endometrioid adenocarcinoma in a 45-year-old woman. Macroscopically, the cervix was of normal size but it had an indurated consistency. The myometrium was unremarkable. Microscopically, in addition to the typical endometrioid adenocarcinoma that involved 75% of the endometrium, there was a proliferation of mildly atypical endometrial type glands sparsely distributed in the fibrovascular tissue, typical of minimal deviation endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The latter component extended downward from the endomyometrial junction and involved focal areas of the uterine body and isthmus, diffusely invaded the entire cervix and focally the cervical resection margins. Focal transitional areas between typical and minimal deviation endometrioid adenocarcinoma were identified. Due to a relatively normal gross appearance and the microscopic deceptively benign looking appearance, minimal deviation endometrioid adenocarcinoma may pose problems of obtaining adequate sampling and evaluating the thickness of invasion of the endometrial carcinoma on gross, as well as microscopic, examination.
