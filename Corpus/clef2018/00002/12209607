PTEN expression is associated with prognosis for patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma undergoing postoperative chemotherapy. The prognostic significance of PTEN expression in endometrial carcinoma has not been clear. We conducted the present study to clarify the relationship between PTEN expression and prognosis in advanced endometrial carcinoma. Of 784 patients with endometrial carcinoma who underwent primary treatment between 1985 and 2000 at 5 institutions, 98 pure endometrioid carcinomas with retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis were provided for our study. PTEN expression was determined by immunohistochemic staining. Negative or mixed PTEN staining was observed in 64 (65.3%) patients. The survival rate for PTEN-positive patients was significantly higher than that for PTEN-negative or -mixed patients. PTEN-staining status was not associated with patient age, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, myometrial invasion or histologic grade. Of the 98 patients, 87 received radiation therapy (n = 25) or chemotherapy (n = 62) after surgery. PTEN expression did not relate to survival for patients receiving radiation therapy. In contrast, the survival rate for PTEN-positive cases was significantly higher than that for PTEN-negative or -mixed cases when patients underwent chemotherapy (62.4% vs. 11.8%). Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed that PTEN staining was an independent prognostic factor for patients undergoing chemotherapy. PTEN-positive staining was a significant prognostic indicator of favorable survival for patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma who underwent postoperative chemotherapy.
