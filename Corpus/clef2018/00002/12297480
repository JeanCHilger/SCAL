Expression of trophinin in the cycling endometrium and its association with infertility. To observe the expression of trophinin in the cycling endometrium and investigate its relationship with infertility.Trophinin expression in the endometrium was observed in 39 normal cycling women during different menstrual phases and 24 women with infertility during mid-luteal phase by immunohistochemical technique.Trophinin expression was detected in the luteal-phase endometrium of both normal and infertile women, which peaked in the mid-luteal phase. In comparison with normal women, infertile women with endometriosis or unexplained infertility had significantly weakened trophinin expression in the endometrium in the mid-luteal (P<0.001).Trophinin may play an important role in the process of implantation, and abnormal endometrial trophinin expression might be one of the major causes of infertility.
