Soluble interleukin-1 receptor type II blocks monocyte chemotactic protein-1 secretion by U937 cells in response to peripheral blood serum of women with endometriosis. To assess the ability of peripheral blood serum from women with endometriosis to induce monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) secretion by monocytes and the putative role of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) system in endometriosis-associated monocyte activation.Cultures of U937 monocytic cells exposed to serum from normal women (control group) or women with endometriosis.Gynecology clinic and human reproduction research laboratory.Seventy-nine women with endometriosis and 38 control women with no evidence of endometriosis at laparoscopy.Peripheral blood obtained a few days before laparoscopy.MCP-1 secretion in the culture medium and serum concentrations of soluble IL-1 receptor type II (sIL-1RII), IL-1beta, and IL-1alpha by ELISA or by enzyme immunometric assay.Serum concentrations of sIL-1RII were significantly lower in women with stage I-II endometriosis than in control women, whereas serum concentrations of IL-1beta and IL-1alpha were comparable between the two groups. The serum of women with endometriosis induced higher secretion of MCP-1 by U937 cells than that of control women, particularly in the initial stages of endometriosis (stages I-II), and recombinant IL-1RII (rIL-1RII) significantly blocked that secretion.These findings point toward a deficiency in the mechanisms involved in the down-regulation of IL-1 actions at the systemic level and reveal sIL-1RII as a key factor involved in that process.
