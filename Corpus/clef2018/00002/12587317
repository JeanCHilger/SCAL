Thoracoscopy in verification of thoracal endometriosis. The authors submit data from the published literature, showing that endometriosis is a grave disease in young women of reproductive age. The incidence of endometriosis tends to be on the increase. At the same time, cases have come to be seen of polyorgan localization of the process, the thoracal one included. The paper contains a presentation of a case of thoracal endometriosis accompanied by spontaneous pneumothorax diagnosed after her having been ill with the disease for ten years. Arguments are submitted in favour of a pleural investigation to be conducted in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax, which reasoning determines further therapeutic policy in such patients. In the authors' opinion, it is thoracotomy that is to be embarked upon, the volume of intervention being determined by revision of organs of the pleural cavity.
