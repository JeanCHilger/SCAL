Influence of missense mutation and silent mutation of LHbeta-subunit gene in Japanese patients with ovulatory disorders. The frequency of variant LHbeta containing two point mutations (T(986)-C and T(1008)-C) and its relationship to reproductive disorders differ widely between ethnic groups. In a Japanese population, variant luteinizing hormone (LH) correlates with ovulatory disorders. Here we examined the relationship between two missense mutations and five silent mutations (C(894)-T, G(1018)-C, C(1036)-A, C(1098)-T and C(1423)-T) in the LHbeta gene, and ovulatory disorders. We studied 43 patients with ovulatory disorders, 79 patients with normal ovulatory cycles, and 23 healthy men who agreed to join our DNA analysis. PCR-amplified LHbeta-subunit gene sequences were compared with a base sequence of wild-type LH reported after direct sequencing. The highest frequency (0.945) of novel allele was observed at the position of the C(1036)-A transition. No homozygotes for wild-type LHbeta (C(1036)) were identified. The frequency of novel allele in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, premature ovarian failure and luteal insufficiency was significantly different from that of healthy women. The frequencies of novel alleles (C(894)-T, C(1098)-T and C(1423)-T) in patients with ovulatory disorders were significantly higher than those with normal ovulatory cycles. The mean incidence of point mutation in patients with ovulatory disorders was higher than in those with normal ovulatory cycles. Among patients with variant LH, five silent mutations were identified in 87.5% of patients with ovulatory disorders, whereas only a few silent mutations were identified in patients with normal ovulatory cycles. In a Japanese population, five silent mutations of variant LH could have influenced two missense mutations and/or other unknown missense mutations, causing ovulatory disorders.
