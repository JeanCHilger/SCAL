The role apoptosis in the extent of endometriosis and its clinical symptomatology. To evaluate the presence and intensity of apoptosis in lesions of peritoneal endometriosis. To consider the role of different intensity of apoptosis in the progression of the disease and in the manifestation of clinical symptoms.Prospective study.Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Department of Histology and Embryology, 1st Medical Faculty, Charles University and General Faculty Hospital, Prague.Lesions of peritoneal endometriosis were excised at laparoscopy in women with 1st to 3rd stage of the disease. Specimens were fixed in the Karnowski solution. The presence of apoptosis was assessed immunohistochemically.Biopsies of peritoneal endometriosis were consecutively taken in 48 women. Altogether, 29 patients were symptomatic, and 19 did not complain of any symptoms. The average duration of symptoms was 16.6 months. The presence of apoptosis was detected in 11 out of 35 evaluated specimens. In comparing the groups with and without apoptosis, no differences were found in the stage of the disease, in the proportion of asymptomatic patients, and in the manifestation of different subjective complaints.The study confirmed a frequent presence of apoptosis in biopsies of peritoneal endometriosis. However, there were no relationships found between the presence of apoptosis and the stage of the disease or manifestation or character of subjective complaints.
