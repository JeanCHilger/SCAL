Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment reduced serum interleukin-6 concentrations in patients with ovarian endometriomas. To determine whether serum interleukin (IL)-6 can be measured in patients with ovarian endometriomas and whether these measurements are useful in managing this disease.A controlled clinical study and an in vitro study.Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tottori University, Japan.Twenty-two patients with ovarian endometriomas.Laparoscopic cystectomy for ovarian endometriomas was performed. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist was administered for 3 months in nine patients before laparoscopic surgery. Endometriotic stromal cells obtained from patients with endometriomas with or without GnRH agonist treatment were cultured.IL-6 concentrations in serum or supernatant of the cell culture were measured using ELISA.The serum concentration of IL-6 in patients with endometriomas was higher at the time of diagnosis than in those without endometriomas. Laparoscopic surgery significantly reduced serum levels of IL-6. Serum IL-6 concentrations also decreased after treatment with GnRH agonist. IL-6 production was attenuated in the endometriotic stromal cells obtained from patients with GnRH agonist treatment compared with patients without such treatment.GnRH agonist treatment may decrease IL-6 production in endometriotic cells. Measurement of serum IL-6 concentrations may be of value in managing patients with endometriomas.
