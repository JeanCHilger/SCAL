Usefulness of clinical, radiologic, and endoscopic studies in chronic diseases of the terminal ileum: analysis of 36 cases. With the purpose of defining which is the most frequent chronic pathology of the terminal ileum in a reference center (INNSZ), and establish the diagnostic accuracy of the preoperative procedures used, 36 resection specimens were reviewed histopathologically. The diseases found in decreasing frequency were: Crohn's disease, tuberculosis, carcinoids, lymphomas, endometriosis and leiomyomas. Seventy-seven percent of the cases were benign and the rest malignant. The number of cases in which the preoperative diagnosis was right or included among the differential diagnosis was as follows: clinical study 44%, radiological study 48%, endoscopical study 32% and histological study by means of endoscopic biopsy 20%. The most frequent differential diagnosis were Crohn's disease, tuberculosis and intestinal lymphoma. It is concluded that chronic disease of the ileum represents frequently a diagnostic problem due to their clinical, endoscopical and radiological similarities which may only be solved by histological analysis of the surgical specimens.
