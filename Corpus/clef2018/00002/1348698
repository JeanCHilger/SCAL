CA-125 in menstrual discharge in patients with chronic pelvic pain. CA-125 levels in menstrual discharge were determined in 55 patients with chronic pelvic pain to evaluate whether this test would be useful in differentiating between pelvic pain due to endometriosis and other causes. Of the 28 women with endometriosis, 25 (89%) had CA-125 concentration greater than or equal to 72,000 units/ml. The frequencies of elevated levels in Stage I, Stage II and Stages III/IV were 85.7, 85.7 and 92.8%, respectively. When used for the detection of endometriosis, the test had a sensitivity of 89.3% and a specificity of 96.3%. These results suggest that CA-125 in menstrual discharge may be helpful in the evaluation of women with chronic pelvic pain.
