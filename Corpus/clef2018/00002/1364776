Radiologic diagnosis of urinary tract disorders in genital endometriosis. The paper is concerned with the results of combined investigation of 157 women suffering from genital endometriosis, operated on for this disease. The involvement of the lower parts of the ureters in a pathological process was detected in 48 patients before operation and in 6 patients at operation. Comparison of x-ray and operative findings with histology specimens made it possible to define endogenous and exogenous forms of ureteral endometriosis and three variants of an x-ray picture in this pathology (the absence of abnormal changes of the urinary tract, hydroureter is over the narrowed part of the ureter, hydroureteronephrosis). The authors have shown a high informative value of combined x-ray investigation and the effectiveness of its use in clinical practice.
