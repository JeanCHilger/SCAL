Endometriosis--a stem cell disease?. Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent and chronic disease with an unknown etiology and pathogenesis. It is however likely and well accepted that retrograde menstruation of endometrial cells into the pelvic cavity is the origin of this disease in many cases. Here we discuss a model in which retrogradely menstruated endometrial cells have different inherent developmental properties because they represent in fact a mixture of different developmental cell stages. These stages can be distinguished in part by the expression of marker proteins such as cytokeratin (intermediate filament protein of epithelial cells) or E-cadherin (intercellular adhesion protein of epithelial cells and metastasis suppressor molecule). Cytokeratin-positive E-cadherin negative cells, for example, would be less differentiated epithelial cells than cytokeratin-positive E-cadherin positive cells. In analogy to findings in other cell systems we assume that the cells which are undifferentiated or not fully differentiated still have the potential to give rise to differentiated daughter cells and, on the other hand, could be maintained as a pool of rather undifferentiated cells and capable of self renewal. This feature would be similar to stem cells (SC) and cells with plasticity. Interestingly we find epithelial cells of different developmental stages in deep infiltrating (e. g. of colon) or peritoneal endometriotic lesions. Therefore we conclude that less differentiated cells in retrogradely menstruated endometrial cell populations possibly representing SC features or plasticity might be the cellular source of primary endometriotic lesions and those present in lesions may contribute to the persistence of the disease by detaching and forming secondary lesions.
