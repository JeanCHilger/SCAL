The importance of angiogenesis for the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The pathogenesis of endometriosis is dependent on implantation. Therefore, angiogenesis of the ectopic endometrium is discussed as a crucial step in the development of an endometriotic lesion. It is not only the main condition for implantation, but also a parameter for the clinical activity of endometriosis. Pigmented and non-pigmented endometriotic lesions differ according to their clinical activity and angiogenic potential. Using a model system of endometriosis, the chorioallantoic membrane assay, mRNA expression of VEGF and matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 2 was analysed. As the most representative angiogenic factors, they were correlated to the angiogenic reaction on the CAM by the vessel index. We assume that angiogenic activity of ectopic endometrium is a condition sine qua non for the pathogenesis of endometriosis, but is regulated by different other factors.
