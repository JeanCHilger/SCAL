Endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus: surgico-pathological correlations and role of pelvic lymphadenectomy. In 1988, FIGO added lymph node surgery to the staging system for endometrial cancer. This change remains controversial to date. From our study we aim to determine the significance of surgico-pathological parameters of endometrioid carcinoma for pelvic nodal metastases and survival, as well as to study the role of pelvic lymphadenectomy in the surgical treatment of this disease.A retrospective study was conducted in 198 women with endometrioid carcinoma who underwent full surgical staging including pelvic lymphadenectomy. The multiple variant regression analysis and the multi-variant logistic regression analysis were applied in the analysis of relationship.A positive correlation between nodal metastases and grade, myometrial invasion, peritoneal cytology, adnexal involvement, lympho-vascular space involvement and tumour size was found. For survival, significant prognosticators were grade, myometrial invasion, peritoneal cytology, lympho-vascular space involvement, adnexal involvement, associated atypia and pelvic nodal metastases. Thirty-five per cent of the patients had high risk of recurrence based on uterine pathological factors but were node negative. They were spared external beam radiation and its associated morbidities, and were treated with adjuvant vault brachytherapy instead. Six per cent of the patients would have been understaged based on uterine factors alone if pelvic lymphadenectomy had not been done.We infer that routine pelvic lymphadenectomy should be considered for all surgically fit patients with endometrioid carcinoma. The accurate staging will allow individualized adjuvant therapy and prevent understaging and overtreatment.
