Physiopathology, diagnosis and therapeutic management of stage III and IV endometriosis. Stage III endometriosis is defined by a r-AFS score respectively ranging from 16 to 40 and stage IV over 40. Deep pelvic endometriosis presents essentially in the form of a painful syndrome dominated by chronic pelvic painful, dysmenorrhea and deep dyspareunia. Pathophysiology of pelvic pain associated with endometriosis remains unknown. In the literature, correlation between extension of the endometriosis and severity of the painful remains controversies. Contraception by levonorgestrel-releasing intra-uterine systems appears to decrease pain related to deeply infiltrating endometriosis. Surgery by laparoscopy remains the first intention treatment when infertility is associated with endometriosis, whereas medical treatment is only palliative in the majority of cases. Success of treatment depends on how radical surgical exeresis is. Spontaneous pregnancy rates are significantly increased after surgical treatment. Recurrent ovarian surgery is not recommended in women with infertility, as it might be deleterious for ovarian reserve. Medical treatment using Gn-RH agonists is indicated when recurrence occurs after surgery.
