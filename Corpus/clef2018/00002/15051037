Concentrations of alpha-fetoprotein, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, c-erbB-2, and epidermal growth factor in serum of patients with endometriosis. Endometriosis, although it is a benign disorder, shares many similarities with cancer. There is increasing levels of evidence suggesting that some circulating factors involved in gynecologic cancers, such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), c-erbB-2 (HER-2/neu), and epidermal growth factor (EGF), could also play a role in endometriosis. Hence, the present study was aimed at evaluating whether the levels of these molecules are modulated in the serum of patients with endometriosis.Levels of AFP, IGFBP-3, c-erbB-2, and EGF were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum from 36 subjects with surgically confirmed endometriosis and 36 controls with no surgical evidence of the disease. In addition, information such as demographic characteristics, personal habits, menstrual characteristics, and clinical profile was collected from each participating subject.No significant difference was found between serum levels of AFP, IGFBP-3, c-erbB-2, and EGF in patients with endometriosis and controls, even when we adjusted for potential confounders and took into account the menstrual cycle. Moreover, no correlation was observed between the serum concentrations of these molecules and the stage of the disease. However, a correlation was detected between soluble levels of IGFBP-3 and presence of uterine leiomyoma.Although AFP, IGFBP-3, c-erbB-2, and EGF are not altered in the circulation of patients with endometriosis, their involvement in the development of endometriotic lesions cannot be excluded.
