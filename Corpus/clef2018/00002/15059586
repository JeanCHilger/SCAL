Clinical characteristics of abdominal wall endometrioma and its recurrence-related factors. To analyze the clinical characteristics, and treatment, recurrence-related factors of abdominal wall endometriomas (AWE).Fifty-seven cases of AWE treated at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1983 to 2002 were reviewed.The incidence of AWE was 1.04% (57/5478) in patients with endometriosis after surgical treatment. It was 0.046% in patients undergoing cesarean section in the same period. Of 57 cases with AWE, 56 had low-abdominal operation previously and one was primary umbilicus endometrioma. Fifty-five cases of AWE were secondary to cesarean section. The latent period of AWE was positively correlated to patient's age at onset (P < 0.001). Fifty-five cases received surgical treatment while 2 were given medical treatment. Follow-up duration was 1.1 - 235 months. Five cases recurred and one was transformed to malignancy. The recurrence was correlated to the size and depth of the lesions.AWE could be diagnosed prior to operation according to its typical clinical manifestations. Ultrasonic examination may be valuable for the diagnosis of atypical cases. Surgical treatment is effective. A complete excision with clear margin is very important to prevent recurrence.
