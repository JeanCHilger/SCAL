Relationship between endometriosis and glutathione S-transferase M1, T1 genes of the Uygurs and Hans in Xinjiang. To examine the association between glutathione S-transferase (GST)M1, T1 null genotypes and endometriosis of the Uygurs and Hans in Xinjiang.The polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect the presence or absence of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes in genomic DNA from the Uygurs (107 controls and 41 cases) and the Hans (105 controls and 80 cases) in Xinjiang.The frequencies of the GSTM1-null genotype, GSTT1-null genotype, combined GSTM1-null and GSTT1-null genotype in endometriosis of the Uygurs (51.2%, 36.6%, 24.4%) were not significantly different from those in controls (53.2%, 29.9%, 13.1%). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was observed in the frequency of GSTM1-null genotype in cases of endometriosis of the Hans (56.8%) compared with the controls (51.8%), but the frequencies of GSTT1-null genotype, combined GSTM1-null and GSTT1-null genotype in endometriosis of the Hans (73.7%, 42.5%) were significantly different from those in controls (44.3%, 22.8%). When comparing the Uygurs with the Hans, we found no significant difference in the frequencies of GSTM1-null genotype, GSTT1-null genotype, combined GSTM1-null and GSTT1-null genotype between the two control populations, neither in the frequencies of the GSTM1-null genotype, combined GSTM1-null and GSTT1-null genotype between the two endometriosis populations. However, the frequency of GSTT1-null genotype in cases of the Hans (73.7%) was significantly higher than that in cases of the Uygurs (36.6%).No evidence was found to suggest an association between GSTM1-null genotype and endometriosis in the Hans and Uygurs. An association was found between GSTT1-null genotype and endometriosis in the Hans, but not in the Uygurs. The two nationalities have different genetic predisposing factors to the development of endometriosis.
