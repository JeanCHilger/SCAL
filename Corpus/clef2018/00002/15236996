Elevations in peritoneal fluid macrophage migration inhibitory factor are independent of the depth of invasion or stage of endometriosis. To quantify levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in the peritoneal fluid (PF) of women with endometriosis, and to correlate these levels with the extent of disease.Controlled clinical study.Academic medical center.Peritoneal fluid samples were collected during laparoscopic surgery in 60 women with endometriosis and 16 controls undergoing tubal ligation 52 of the women with endometriosis had received no hormonal treatment in the 6 months prior to surgery, while 8 were using gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists.Peritoneal fluid migration inhibitory factor (PF MIF) levels.Women with endometriosis had significantly higher PF MIF levels (10.8 +/- 0.9 ng/mL) than controls (3.0 +/- 0.7 ng/mL). However, no correlation existed between MIF levels and the stage of disease (r = 0.05) or the depth of endometriotic invasion (r = 0.08). Moreover, treatment with a GnRH agonist did not suppress PF MIF levels. Peritoneal fluid MIF levels did not vary significantly between the proliferative and secretory phases of the cycle, and did not distinguish women with endometriosis-associated infertility from women with endometriosis-associated pain.Peritoneal fluid migration inhibitory factor levels are markedly elevated in women with endometriosis but are independent of the extent of disease.
