Genomic alterations in the endometrium may be a proximate cause for endometriosis. To test the hypothesis that endometriosis may originate from genomic alterations in the endometrium by genomic analysis of endometrial tissues in patients with endometriosis and compare them with those from normal controls.Endometrial tissue samples were taken from five women with endometriosis. For controls, we used endometrial tissue samples from four women who underwent elective abortions and one sample from placenta. Using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), we determined the normal range of variation in CGH signals using normal controls. CGH results were further confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR and loss of heterozygosity analysis.We identified several regions of genomic alterations in all five patients. Some of these regions were the same regions identified previously in endometriotic lesions. For select markers, the genomic alterations were confirmed by real-time PCR and LOH analyses.There is evidence that the endometrium in women with endometriosis has genomic alterations. This is consistent with numerous reports that the endometrium of women with endometriosis differ from those of women without. Our finding suggests that genomic alterations in the endometrium may be a proximate cause for endometriosis.
