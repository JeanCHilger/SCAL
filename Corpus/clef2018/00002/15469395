Novel targets for the treatment of endometriosis. Endometriosis is an enigmatic, debilitating disease that affects up to 15% of all women of reproductive age. It is characterised by pelvic pain and infertility. Current treatment regimens control the disease by inducing a hypoestrogenic state. Although the absence of circulating oestrogen levels leads to a regression of the disease, this hypoestrogenism also induces many unpleasant side effects. As such, these and other shortcomings of current drug therapies emphasise their limitations and the necessity for the development of novel endometriosis treatments. In this review, current therapies for medical management of endometriosis are discussed, as are their shortcomings. Potential target areas that may be attractive alternatives to current therapies are also reviewed. Emphasis is placed upon the emerging research using TNF inhibitors, their potential benefits over current treatment regimens and the development of future potential therapeutic targets.
