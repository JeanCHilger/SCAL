Ureteral endometriosis: the role of magnetic resonance imaging. In six women out of 792 who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for management of deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), ureteral involvement was suspected. Ureteral endometriosis was identified as a hypointense nodule on T2- weighted images and hyperintense foci on T1-weighted images. Magnetic resonance urography detected obstruction and hydronephrosis in half the women. Detection with MRI of periureteral involvement (extrinsic endometriosis) in four women rather than ureteral wall lesions (intrinsic endometriosis) in two women is an original finding from this series. Magnetic resonance imaging features were correlated and matched with intraoperative and pathologic findings. Magnetic resonance imaging is a useful preoperative tool for the diagnosis and assessment of ureteral endometriosis in rare cases when such lesions have been suspected.
