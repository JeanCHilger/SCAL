Immunohistochemical detection of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), topoisomerase IIalpha expression, and apoptosis in endometrial adenocarcinoma and atypical hyperplasia. This study evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in endometrial carcinoma and atypical endometrial hyperplasia, and related it to the expression of topoisomerase (TP)IIalpha (a proliferation associated enzyme) apoptosis as determined by the frequency of apoptotic bodies (ABI)
