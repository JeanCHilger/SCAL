Endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary presenting with an enlarged inguinal lymph node without evidence of abdominal carcinomatosis. It is generally recognized that ovarian cancer tends to remain intraabdominal even in advanced cases and that dissemination is usually by invasion of adjacent viscera, diffuse intraperitoneal implantation, and metastatic involvement of aortic and pelvic lymph nodes. Primary ovarian lymphatic drainage occurs via the infundibulopelvic ligament to the paraaortic nodes. The presence of an ovarian tumor extending into adjacent pelvic viscera may allow direct lymphatic continuity with inguinal, external, and common iliac lymph nodes. In the absence of such extension it is traditionally believed that the drainage via the infundibulopelvics is so important that only with its blockage, presumably by tumor emboli, can retrograde drainage to pelvic and inguinal nodes occur. We report a case of a patient presenting with a large metastatic inguinal lymph node from a primary epithelial ovarian cancer without evidence of disseminated intraabdominal disease or gross evidence of pelvic or paraaortic lymph node involvement.
