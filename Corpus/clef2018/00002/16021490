Cervical endometriosis: a diagnostic and management dilemma. Cervical endometriosis is usually a retrospective finding on histology. We describe the diverse symptomatology of the disease, wherein a suspicion of diagnosis may be raised. A series of five patients with cervical endometriosis confirmed on histology was identified. One patient was asymptomatic but examination revealed a mass arising from the cervix. Two patients presented with persistent postcoital bleeding, one patient with intermenstrual bleeding and one patient with both intermenstrual and postcoital bleeding. All patients were followed up with colposcopy and cervical biopsy. Persistence of symptoms determined the mode of treatment which included surgical management in the form of large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) biopsy in four patients. Cervical endometriosis is a benign condition which may present with symptoms such as persistent post-coital bleeding or intermenstrual bleeding. Colposcopy and cervical biopsy are pivotal to the diagnosis. This condition can be managed expectantly in asymptomatic patients and persistent symptoms may warrant surgery.
