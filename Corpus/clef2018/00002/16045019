Evaluation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and tumor necrosis factor-beta in serum of patients with endometriosis. To evaluate the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-beta) before and after conservative laparoscopic surgery in patients with endometriosis.The levels of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta in the serum of both 82 patients with EMS and 68 controls were determined by ELISA.The levels of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta in the serum of patients with EMS were significantly higher than those of the controls (P < 0.01), and they increased with the clinical terms ( P < 0.05). After clearance of endometrosis foci with laparoscopic conservative surgery, the TNF-alpha levels decreased significantly in EMS III - IV, and TNF-beta levels decreased significantly in EMS I - IV.Measuring TNF-alpha and TNF-beta levels in the serum of patients with EMS may have important value in postoperative follow-up, surveillance and evaluation of the effectiveness of the surgery.
