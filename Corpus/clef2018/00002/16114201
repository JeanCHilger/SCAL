Value of sonography and MR imaging for the evaluation of deep pelvic endometriosis. Deep pelvic endometriosis may involve the uterosacral ligaments, cul-de-sac of Douglas, vagina, rectum, and occasionally the bladder. Evaluation by physical examination is difficult, and imaging techniques are needed to evaluate the location and extent of endometriosis. In this review, we review the transvaginal and transrectal sonographic and MR imaging features suggestive of deep pelvic endometriosis and their diagnostic value.
