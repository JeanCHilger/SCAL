Endometriosis. Is it a problem of the immunological signs?. Endometriosis syndrome affects 5% to 35% of women in reproductive age. Many theories have been suggested, but the true importance is the survival mechanism of endometriotic tissue, which seems to be related to a defect of the immunological vigilance from macrophages, which are responsible for secretion of a variety of biochemical substances such as cytokines, prostaglandins and growth factors, which through different ways stimulates the growth of the endometrial cells. This has been observed for the clear interrelation between the homeostasis of the body and the evident association of the hormonal factors with the processes of the immunological system, in whose field many steps are unknown.
