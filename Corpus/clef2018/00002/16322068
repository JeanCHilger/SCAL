All-trans retinoic acid inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor expression in a cell model of neutrophil activation. Infiltrating neutrophil granulocytes are a particularly rich source of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the endometrium and may contribute to the angiogenesis of endometriosis lesions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the expression and regulation of VEGF in endometrial neutrophils and in a model of neutrophil differentiation relevant to endometriosis. Immunohistochemistry was performed on endometriosis patient biopsies and cultured neutrophil-like HL-60 cells were assessed. The study was set in a reproductive biology division within an academic medical center. Endometrial biopsies were performed on women with endometriosis and HL-60 cells were treated with all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) and dimethyl sulfoxide in vitro. Immunofluorescence histochemistry, VEGF mRNA and protein quantification, and transfection studies of VEGF gene promoter-luciferase constructs were all main outcome measures. Immunofluorescence studies verified the presence of neutrophils in eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis. Examination of the regulation of VEGF using differentiated HL-60 cells as a model, revealed that atRA induced a dose- and time-dependent suppression of VEGF mRNA and protein. Transient transfection, truncation, EMSA, and site-directed mutagenesis of human VEGF promoter-luciferase constructs in HL-60 cells indicated that atRA repressed VEGF gene transcription via a direct repeat 1 element located between -443 and -431 bp relative to the transcription initiation site. Because retinoic acid is synthesized de novo in endometrial cells under the influence of progesterone, our findings suggest that the up-regulated VEGF and angiogenesis in tissue from women with endometriosis may reflect failure of neutrophil differentiation in these cases, and provide a rationale for retinoid therapy in this condition.
