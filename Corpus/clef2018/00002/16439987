Increasing expression of serine protease matriptase in ovarian tumors: tissue microarray analysis of immunostaining score with clinicopathological parameters. Matriptase is a type II transmembrane serine protease expressed by cells of surface epithelial origin, including epithelial ovarian tumor cells. Matriptase cleaves and activates proteins implicated in the progression of cancer and represents a potential prognostic and therapeutic target. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of matriptase in ovarian tumors and to assign clinicopathological correlations. Immunohistochemical analysis of matriptase was performed in tissue microarrays of 164 ovarian neoplasms including 84 serous adenocarcinomas, 23 mucinous adenocarcinomas, 10 endometrioid adenocarcinomas, six yolk sac tumors, 12 clear cell carcinomas, six dysgerminomas, eight granulosa cell tumors, four transitional cell carcinomas, five fibromas, and six Brenner tumors. All ovarian tumors except the fibromas and Brenner tumors showed significant expression of matriptase. The matriptase scores were significantly higher in the tumors than in their nontumor counterparts (304+/-26 for serous adenocarcinoma 361+/-28 for mucinous adenocarcinoma
