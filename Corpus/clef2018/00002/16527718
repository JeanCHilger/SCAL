Efficacy of laparoscopically-assisted extracorporeal cystectomy in patients with ovarian endometrioma. To investigate the usefulness and effectiveness of the extracorporeal surgical technique in the treatment of endometriomas.Retrospective evaluation (Canadian Task Force Classification II-2).Department of gynecology in a tertiary care faculty hospital and training hospital.Of 89 patients with endometrioma, 53 had laparoscopic stripping, and 36 had laparoscopically-assisted extracorporeal cystectomy.Laparoscopic stripping and laparoscopically-assisted extracorporeal cystectomy were performed for the treatment of endometriomas diagnosed laparoscopically.The size of the endometrioma diagnosed by the ultrasonographic examination was not statistically related to the severity of the endometriosis (p = .42). Conversion to extracorporeal technique was required in 17 of 58 cases with moderate endometriosis and 14 of 31 cases with severe endometriosis (p = .04). Operation time, visual analogue pain score, and hospitalization periods were similar between the 2 techniques. Among 53 specimens obtained with laparoscopic stripping, 29 (55%) had no ovarian tissue, and 24 (45%) had ovarian tissue with follicles. Of 36 specimens obtained with extracorporeal technique, 19 (52%) had no ovarian tissue, and 17 (48%) had ovarian tissue with follicles. Preservation of the ovarian tissue was not significantly different between both surgical techniques.Extracorporeal technique with laparoscopically-assisted minilaparotomy is a valuable alternative for laparoscopic stripping in selected cases.
