Management of endometriosis of the urinary tract. Endometriosis of the urinary tract (bladder and/or ureter) is rare and concerns 1-2% of cases of endometriosis. Surgical management is usually mandatory. Rate of peri operative morbidity is low. There is a risk of functional (dysuria, chronic hypogastric pains, imperiosity) and anatomical recurrences (0-15 and 0-10% respectively). Surgical treatment of bladder and/or ureteral endometriosis requires informed consent of patients and multidisciplinary management.
