Umbilical endometriosis. A 40-year-old woman with a history of a growing erythematous nodule in the umbilicus was diagnosed histopathologically with endometriosis. This umbilical endometriosis occurred spontaneously without any previous surgical procedures. The lesion was partially removed surgically she then entered menopause with a spontaneous involution of the residuum during the following months so that further invention was not required. Umbilical endometriosis is very rare with an estimated incidence of 0.5 to 1% of all patients with endometrial ectopia. As the clinical appearance of umbilical endometriosis may share features with a variety of other disorders, we discuss the clinical picture and differential diagnostic considerations in detail.
