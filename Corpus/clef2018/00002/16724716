Bladder endometriosis. Case report and review of the literature. To report a new case of bladder endometriosis and to perform a bibliographic review.We report the case of a 34-year-old female with the diagnosis of bladder endometriosis treated by transurethral resection and subsequent hormonal therapy with good outcome one year after diagnosis.Treatment with analogs was started after TUR, in conjunction with the Gynecology Department, and maintained six months. The patient remained asymptomatic one year after diagnosis, with a negative cystoscopic study.We emphasize the need of early diagnosis due to the increased morbidity and health-care expenses also the need of surgical treatment of all urological lesions before any hormonal therapy, mainly ureteral lesions. We finally emphasize that definitive treatment should be performed by the gynecologist.
