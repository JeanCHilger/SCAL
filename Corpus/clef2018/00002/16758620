Study of cytokine profile and angiogenic potential of peritoneal fluid in patients with external genital endometriosis. The concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6), vascular endothelium growth factor, tumor growth factor-beta, and insulin-like growth factor-1 were measured in the peritoneal fluid of patients with external genital endometriosis and healthy women by enzyme immunoassay. The effect of peritoneal fluid from patients with external genital endometriosis on proliferative activity of EA.Hy926 human endothelial cells was evaluated by the method based on the analysis of cell cycle by flow cytometry. The concentrations of IL-1beta, IL-6, and insulin-like growth factor-1 were increased in patients with endometriosis in comparison with healthy women. The peritoneal fluid from patients with endometriosis (but not from healthy women) significantly increased mitotic activity of endothelial cells and exhibited high angiogenic potential, which can promote implantation and growth of endometrial transplants. Presumably, insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulates this process.
