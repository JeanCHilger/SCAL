An immunohistochemical study of morules in endometrioid lesions of the female genital tract: CD10 is a characteristic marker of morular metaplasia. To analyze immunohistochemically morules in endometrioid lesions to show that CD10 is a sensitive marker for morular metaplasia.Immunohistochemical analysis of 53 instances of morular metaplasia comprising 1 cyclic endometrium and 52 endometrioid lesions associated with focal glandular complexity corresponding to 9 polyps, 4 atypical polypoid adenomyomas, 24 complex endometrial hyperplasias (18 with and 6 without atypia), 12 grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinomas in early clinical stages of both uterus and ovary, and three ovarian adenofibromas. Immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections was done for CD10, beta-catenin, estrogen and progesterone receptors, and cytokeratins 5-6, 7, 8, 13, 18, 19, 20, and 34beta-E12.Morules were negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors and had beta-catenin-positive nuclei. Cytokeratins 8, 18, 19 were positive cytokeratins 7 and 20 were negativeCD10 staining represents a useful marker of morules in endometrioid neoplasms of the female genital tract, permitting identification of lesions usually associated with an attenuated malignancy. Considering the immunohistochemical and genetic similarities of morules in tumors of different organs, it is likely that this marker may be also useful to diagnose morular metaplasia in similar neoplasms of extragenital locations.
