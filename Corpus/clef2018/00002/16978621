Antim√ºllerian hormone and pituitary gland activity after prolonged down-regulation with goserelin acetate. The size of the pool of growing follicles was normal after prolonged down-regulation, as indicated by normal AMH levels 4 and 8 weeks after goserelin administration. However, there was a profound down-regulation of LH levels therefore we suggest administration of exogenous LH to proceed to IVF or alternatively stimulation of endogenous LH secretion with daily administration of GnRH agonist. These need to be assessed prospectively.
