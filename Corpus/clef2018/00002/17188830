Endometrial biopsy by means of the hysteroscopic resectoscope for the evaluation of tumor differentiation in endometrial cancer: a pilot study. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of endometrial biopsy by means of the hysteroscopic resectoscope (EBHR) in evaluating tumor differentiation in patients with endometrial cancer.Between January and December 2005, all the women with a diagnosis of endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus, when admitted to hospital, were enrolled for this study. Patients eligible for surgical treatment underwent a preoperative work-up consisting in pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and EBHR. In all patients submitted to a hysterectomy, a comparison between pre- and postoperative tumor grade was carried out.42 women were enrolled in the study. Hysteroscopic biopsy was carried out in 39 patients (mean age 62.5 years, range 33-79 FIGO stage I: 34, stage II-IV: 5). No complication related to hysteroscopy was observed. The preoperative tumor grade by hysteroscopy correlated with the final grade in 97.1% of cases. No patient had positive peritoneal washing and after a median follow-up of ten months no intraperitoneal tumor relapse was observed.EBHR is a very accurate diagnostic procedure for assessing the preoperative tumor grade in patients with endometrial cancer.
