Comparison of c-DNA microarray analysis of gene expression between eutopic endometrium and ectopic endometrium (endometriosis). As recent studies have suggested abnormalities in the regulation of specific genes in the development of endometriosis, we investigated differentially expressed genes in endometriosis compared to endometrium.Gene expression profiles using the Atlas microarray were performed in endometriotic tissue and endometrium. Nine of the 13 genes of endometriotic tissue showed an up-regulation in relation to endometrium and four of the 13 genes a down-regulation.Of the 1176 genes on the Atlas Human 1,2 array, only 13 differentially expressed identical genes were detected after repeating the gene analysis three times.According to our c-DNA analysis some differentially expressed genes may be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. An imbalance in the genes responsible for the reproductive process may lead to a decrease in embryo implantation in patients with endometriosis.
