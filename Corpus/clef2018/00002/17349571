Xanthogranulomatous salpingitis associated with fallopian tube mucosal endometriosis: a clue to the pathogenesis. Xanthogranulomatous salpingitis is an unusual inflammatory lesion of the fallopian tube, characterized by accumulation of foamy macrophages in the wall of the fallopian tube along with other chronic inflammatory cells. Only a few cases of xanthogranulomatous salpingitis have been reported in the English medical literature, some under different nomenclature. An association, most commonly with pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis, has been suggested. A 41-year-old woman with prior history of breast carcinoma underwent bilateral salpingoophorectomy because of hematosalpinx. The histology revealed xanthogranulomatous salpingitis in the setting of extensive fallopian tube mucosal endometriosis, endometritis, and presence of an intrauterine contraceptive device. Multiple etiologies have been linked to the xanthogranulomatous process at this location in previously reported cases. A whole spectrum of changes may exist in this lesion and probably represent a specialized form of tissue reaction secondary to multiple etiologies. Although it has been associated with pelvic endometriosis, it has never been demonstrated through progressive changes, beginning with mucosal endometriosis to the full-blown xanthogranulomatous inflammation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case that demonstrates different stages in the pathogenesis of this lesion and provides an insight into the histogenesis of this entity.
