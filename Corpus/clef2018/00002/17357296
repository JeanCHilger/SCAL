Profiling of peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis by chemokine protein array. Chemokines play essential role not only in controlling leukocyte function and trafficking but also in the angiogenesis and modulation of inflammatory responses.A novel array-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantitate peritoneal fluid chemokines of 25 infertile women with endometriosis and 18 controls. For our preliminary studies we chose mini-array containing nine different chemokines: MDC/CCL22, TARC/CCL17, MCP-1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, MIP-1alpha/CCL3, -1beta/CCL4, -1delta/CCL15, -3alpha/CCL20, and -3beta/CCL19.We found significantly higher MIP-3beta/CCL19 (P = 0.0036) concentrations in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis as compared to patients with primary infertility without any signs of disease.Our preliminary results suggest that MIP-3beta/ /CCL19 might play a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis but its precise role remains to be established. Novel types of screening methods based on high-throughput technologies offer great opportunities to study immunobiology of endometriosis. It will hopefully provide new possibilities for discovery of new markers and potential drug targets.
