The invasive front in endometrial carcinoma: higher proliferation and associated derailment of cell cycle regulators. The aim of the study was to explore whether expression of proliferation and hypoxia-related proteins differs in the central parts and the invasive front in endometrial carcinomas. Proliferation-associated proteins Ki67 and cyclin A cell cycle regulators p16, p21, p53, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cdk2
