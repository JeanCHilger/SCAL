Accuracy of preoperative tumor grade and intraoperative gross examination of myometrial invasion in patients with endometrial cancer. Preoperative prediction of metastases to the regional lymph nodes in women with endometrioid endometrial cancer is a challenge. According to the Danish Gynaecological Cancer Society guidelines, a pelvic lymphadenectomy is warranted in all poorly differentiated tumors and all stage Ic disease. We have evaluated the accuracy of preoperative tumor grade and intraoperative gross examination of myometrial invasion, in predicting the need for a pelvic lymphadenectomy.Preoperative tumor grade and intraoperative gross examination of myometrial invasion were prospectively registered in 72 women with stage I endometrioid endometrial cancer, operated between 1 September 2004 and 18 April 2006. The pre- and intraoperative findings were compared with the final pathology report.The preoperative prediction of grade (well, moderate or poorly differentiated) was correct in 96% (69/72) of the patients. Gross examination of myometrial invasion correctly differentiated between stage Ia, Ib, and Ic disease in 89% (64/72) of the patients. The combination of preoperative tumor grade and intraoperative gross examination of myometrial invasion, led to wrong clinical decisions in 11% (8/72) of the patients. Three 'unnecessary' lymphadenectomies were performed, and 5 patients were primary operated upon without 'warranted' lymphadenectomy.Our data suggest that preoperative tumor grade and intraoperative gross examination of the uterus provide useful information for pre-and intraoperative planning of pelvic lymphadenectomy. However, wrong decisions were made in 11% of the patients, and more reliable evaluation methods are needed.
