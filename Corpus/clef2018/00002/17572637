Case report: Endometrioma of the abdominal wall. We present the case of a 39-year-old woman with a 2- to 3-month history of a soft tissue mass involving the abdominal wall and increasing symptoms that fluctuated relative to her menses. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a hemorrhagic multiloculated mass within the rectus abdominus muscle. Correlation of the clinical history and imaging finding suggested a preoperative diagnosis of endometrioma of the abdominal wall. This was confirmed on histologic analysis of the resected specimen.
