Expression of the glycodelin A gene and the detection of its protein in tissues and serum of ovarian carcinoma patients. Glycodelin A (GdA), also known as placental protein 14 (PP14), has been detected in endometrial, cervical and ovarian carcinoma cells. It is suspected to be a marker of human ovarian cancer tissues.We investigated serum, tissue and cyst fluid samples of patients with an ovarian carcinoma in contrast to patients with benign and malignant diseases such as uterine myoma, endometriosis, cervical, uterine and breast cancer, and metastases of bladder and colon carcinoma. Used methods were enzyme-immunoassay, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).In 81% of the control group the GdA-expression was negative, which was confirmed by IHC and PCR. Of the ovarian carcinoma group only 52% showed correspondence between IHC and PCR.These results indicate that determination of GdA is not sensitive or specific enough for use as a tumour marker.
