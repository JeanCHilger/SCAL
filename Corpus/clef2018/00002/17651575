Ileocolic intussusception due to endometriosis. Intussusception is a rare cause of bowel obstruction in adults. Clinical manifestations are not specific, making the preoperative diagnosis difficult to establish. We report a case of acute small-bowel obstruction due to ileocolic intussusception. An emergency explorative laparoscopy was performed and revealed a mass in the right colon proximal to the ileocecal valve. Conversion to open laparotomy allowed us to perform a right hemicolectomy. The pathologic examination of the resected sample revealed endometriosis of the terminal ileus.
