Clinical analysis of 30 patients with perineal endometriosis. To investigate the diagnosis and treatment of perineal endometriosis.The clinical date of 30 patients with perineal endometriosis, aged 32.3 (23 approximately 44), who were admitted 1983 - 2006, operated on, and followed up for 0.5 approximately 13 years, were analyzed.The incidence of perineal endometriosis was 0.32% among the total endometriosis cases. Five of these 30 patients (16.7%) suffered from perineal endometriosis combined with pelvic endometriosis. The latent period was 4 months to 13 years. There was no significant difference in onset of age. All patients had cyclical and painful lesions. The level of CA125 was normal. All patients were cured after complete surgical excision.Diagnosis of perineal endometriosis can be made based on the patients' history and clinical manifestations. Surgical excision is the first choice of treatment. The recurrent rate of the cases without anal sphincter involvement is lower than that with anal sphincter invasion since the complete incision can be made. It is important to evaluate pre-operatively if the anal sphincter is involved.
