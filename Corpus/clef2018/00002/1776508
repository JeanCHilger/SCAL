Extreme elevation of serum CA-125 in two women with severe endometriosis: case report. Two women with elevated preoperative serum CA-125 levels were found to have extensive endometriosis - one, the highest level related to endometriosis ever reported in the English literature. Endometriosis was found to be etiologic as seen by the prompt reduction in serum CA-125 levels following surgical treatment limited to endometriosis. Thus, a very high CA-125 level does not necessarily forebode ovarian malignancy.
