Expression of a novel oncofetal mRNA-binding protein IMP3 in endometrial carcinomas: diagnostic significance and clinicopathologic correlations. Insulin-like growth factor-II mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) is a newly identified oncofetal mRNA-binding protein that is involved in embryogenesis and carcinogenesis of some malignant neoplasms. To investigate the diagnostic and clinicopathologic significance of this protein in endometrial carcinomas, we evaluated immunohistochemical expression of IMP3 in the two most common forms of endometrial malignancies, endometrioid adenocarcinoma and serous carcinoma. We selected 167 endometrial adenocarcinoma cases including 122 cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma and 45 cases of serous carcinoma. Twenty samples of benign endometrium obtained from 20 patients with nonmalignant uterine lesions were used as controls. Positive immunohistochemical stain for IMP3 was identified in all serous carcinoma cases, among which, 39 (86%) and 3 (7%) cases showed IMP3 immunoreactivity in >50%, and 21-50, or 6-20% of tumor cells, respectively. Immunohistochemical reaction intensity for IMP3 was identified to be strong in 38 (84%) and intermediate in 7 (16%) cases of serous carcinoma. Fifty-four (44%) cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma were negative for IMP3. Thirty (25%), 20 (16%), 10 (8%), and 8 (7%) cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma demonstrated positive immunoreactivity for IMP3 in 1-5, 6-20, 21-50, and >50% of the tumor cells. Strong IMP3-staining intensity was noted in 34 (28%), intermediate in 26 (21%), and weak in 8 (7%) cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. All 20 control cases were negative for IMP3. To compare p53 with IMP3 expressions, we found that 35 (78%) of the serous carcinoma cases showed strong p53 immunohistochemical activity in >50% of the tumor cell nuclei. In contrast, 11 of 112 (10%) endometrioid adenocarcinoma cases demonstrated strong p53 positivity in >50% of the tumor cell nuclei. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate significant expression of IMP3 in serous carcinoma as compared to endometrioid adenocarcinoma (P<0.0001). Expression of IMP3 and p53 may be helpful biomarkers in the distinction of endometrial serous carcinoma from endometrioid adenocarcinoma. In addition, expression of IMP3 in endometrioid adenocarcinoma correlates with higher nuclear and architecture grades of the tumor (P=0.0000 and P=0.0002, respectively).
