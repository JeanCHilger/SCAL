Prognostic significance of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer and matrix metalloproteinase 2 in epithelial ovarian cancer. We investigated the prognostic significance of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) in epithelial ovarian cancer as well as their relation to hyaluronan (HA) expression.The expression of EMMPRIN and MMP-2 was analyzed immunohistochemically in 295 primary epithelial ovarian cancer patients and 67 metastases.A low membranous EMMPRIN expression was detected more often in serous tumors than in other types (p < 0.0005) and it was associated with tumors of advanced stage (p = 0.012) or with a large primary residual (p = 0.011). A low expression of MMP-2 in cancer cells was associated with a high histologic grade (grade 3) of the tumor (p = 0.005) and endometrioid type of tumors (p < 0.0005). Stromal MMP-2 expression was significantly associated with strong stromal HA expression (p = 0.002, r = 0.187). In univariate analysis, 10-year disease-related (DRS) and recurrence-free survivals were significantly better when MMP-2 expression in cancer cells was high (p = 0.0057 and p = 0.0467, respectively). DRS was also better when membranous EMMPRIN expression was high (p = 0.013). In multivariate analysis, strong MMP-2 in cancer cells (RR = 1.48, CI = 1.07-2.04, p = 0.017) indicated favorable DRS.Our results show that EMMPRIN and MMP-2 in cancer cells are significant indicators of a favorable prognosis of epithelial ovarian cancer.
