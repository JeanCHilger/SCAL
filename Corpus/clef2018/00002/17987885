Intrauterine insemination results in couples requiring extended semen transport time. The purpose of the present study is to compare intrauterine insemination (IUI) pregnancy rates (PR) as a function of diagnosis and ovulation protocol utilizing an extended semen transport time. This allowed clients to conveniently collect IUI specimens in the comfort and privacy of their home. A single IUI per treatment cycle was performed.Three-hundred-ten consecutive infertilty couples having unexplained, male factor, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, tubal factor or combined diagnostic factors receiving a total of 584 cycles of IUI were included. Ovulation protocols included LH surge, clomiphene citrate (CC)-hCG, CC-gonadotropins(Gn)-hCG, Gn-hCG or leuprolide acetate (L)-Gn-hCG followed 36-42 hours by a single IUI. Pregnancy rates per cycle (fecundity) and per couple (fertility) as a function of diagnosis, ovulation protocol and cycle number were evaluated. In each cycle the couples processed the specimen by adding sperm washing medium at room temperature to the specimen 30 min following collection and allowed it to incubate for two hours prior to IUI during transport.Overall, fecundity was 11.8% (69/584) and fertility was 22.3% (69/310) respectively by diagnosis was: unexplained 22.6%, 38.8%We conclude that IUI is effective when utilizing an extended transport time allowing most couples to collect the specimen at home and is most effective when utilizing Gn-hCG therapy. Based on our analysis, endometriosis, tubal factor and combined diagnostic categories should proceed earlier to higher level assisted reproductive technologies.
