Expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) in ovarian adenocarcinomas: difference in hypoxic status depending on histological character. The expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) was immunohistochemically analyzed in ovarian adenocarcinomas with the aim of elucidating whether hypoxic status is associated with histological type or structural character. The following ovarian adenocarcinomas were used: serous adenocarcinoma (SEA), 21 cases mucinous adenocarcinoma (MUA), 19 cases
