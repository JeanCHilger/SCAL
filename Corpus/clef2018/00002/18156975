Combined large cell neuroendocrine and endometrioid carcinoma of the endometrium. We present the surgical and pathological findings and follow-up of 5 women diagnosed with combined endometrioid and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of large cell type (LCNEC) arising in the endometrium. The mean age of the women was 75 years (range, 50-88 years). Of the 5 tumors, 4 formed polypoid endometrial masses associated with extensive lymphovascular involvement of the myometrium by neoplastic cells. A single endometrial tumor was formed by LCNEC alone, and 4 tumors were composite with varying proportions formed by endometrioid (4/5) and small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (1/5). In all 5 LCNEC tumor components, an insular growth pattern was noted, whereas a diffuse (solid) pattern was found in 4 tumors, a trabecular in 2, and rosettes/pseudorosettes in another 2. In all 5 tumors, the LCNEC tumor components were labeled with neuron-specific enolase (NSE). Four tumors were reactive for chromogranin A, CAM 5.2, and p53. Three tumors were labeled for AE1/AE3, CD56 (NCAM), p16, and cytokeratin 7. Synaptophysin was reactive in 2 tumors, and CD117 was found in only a single tumor. Of the 3 endometrioid tumor components examined, all were reactive for NSE. Two tumors were reactive for p16 and p53, 1 for CD56, but none for synaptophysin orchromogranin A. We conclude that LCNEC of the endometrium is a distinct clinicopathological entity with a poor prognosis irrespective of stage. The gross and histomorphological features are often suggestive, but confirmation requires immunoperoxidases, including NSE, synaptophysin, chromogranin A, p16, and p53. Combined endometrioid and high-grade LCNEC possess more characteristics of a type II than a type I endometrial carcinoma.
