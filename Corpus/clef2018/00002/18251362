Diffuse endometritis in the setting of umbilical endometriosis: a case report. Umbilical endometriosis is rare and can be a challenging diagnosis in the absence of classic signs and symptoms.A case of severe, primary, spontaneous umbilical endometriosis with foci of plasma cell endometritis and diffuse stromal lymphovascular presence occurred.Despite a lengthy differential, endometriosis must be considered in the evaluation of an umbilical mass. The presence of plasma cell endometritis and stromal lymphovascular elements in the absence of pelvic endometriosis lends evidence to the theory of lymphovascular transport as an etiology of extrapelvic endometriosis.
