Association of tumor necrosis factor-{alpha} gene polymorphisms with advanced stage endometriosis. This study was performed to investigate whether specific haplotypes and several single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha gene are associated with the risk of advanced stage endometriosis in a Korean population.This study comprised women with (n = 246) or without (n = 248) endometriosis. The TNF:g.[-1031T > C], TNF:g.[-863C > A] and TNF:g.[-857C > T] polymorphism in the TNF-alpha gene were assessed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, which utilized digestion by BbsI, HypCH4IV and HypCH4IV restriction enzymes, respectively. In silico haplotypes were deduced by using the Haploview version 3.32.The genotype distribution of TNF:g.[-1031T > C] was significantly different between total endometriosis patients and the controls (T/T of 56.9 versus 60.1%, T/C of 35.4 versus 37.5% and C/C of 7.7 versus 2.4%, respectively, P = 0.027). This difference at the TNF:g.[-1031T > C] tends to increase in Stage IV endometriosis (P = 0.01). However, there was no difference in the TNF:g.[-863C > A] and TNF:g.[-857C > T] site between the two groups. Even when the endometriosis cases were subdivided into American Society for Reproductive Medicine Stages III and IV, genotype differences were not found. The CC homozygote at TNF:g.-863 was more frequently found in the controls than Non-CC group (P = 0.04 odds ratio = 0.67Our results suggest that the genotype frequencies at the TNF:g.[-1031T > C] and the TNF:g.[-863C > A] sites may be associated with advanced stage endometriosis in the Korean population.
