Should diagnostic hysteroscopy be a routine procedure during diagnostic laparoscopy in infertile women? The aim of this study was to clarify the role of simultaneous combined diagnostic approach using laparoscopy and hysteroscopy in the evaluation of female infertility. In a retrospective study, 360 infertile women underwent complete fertility evaluation. All the patients were examined by simultaneous combined laparoscopy and hysteroscopy as a part of the routine infertility evaluation. Laparoscopy and hysteroscopy were successful in 360 patients. Bilateral tubes were blocked in 18 (5%) and unilateral tubal occlusion were in 30 (8,33%) of patients. Pelvic adhesions were revealed in 40 (11,11%), and myomas in 42 (11,65%) out of that 31 (8,6%) were revealed by laparoscopy and 11 (3,05%) by hysteroscopy. Endometrial polyps were revealed in 26 (7,22%) and Syndrome Asherman in 3(0,83%) of patients. Uterine anomaly was found in 19 (5,27%) of cases and out of that septate uterus in 7 (37,15%), bicornuate uterus in 5 (26,31%), arcuate uterus in 4 (21,26%) and uterus unicornu cum cornu rudimentario in 3 (15,27%) of uterine anomalies. Endometriosis was found in 51 (14,16%), dermoid cysts in 8 (2,22%) and in 16 (4,44%) functional cysts of patients. Also, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome was revealed in 23 (6,11%) of our patients. Laparoscopy and hysteroscopy play very important role as diagnostic tools in the infertility women. Combined diagnostic simultaneous laparoscopy and hysteroscopy should be performed in all infertile patients before the treatment.
