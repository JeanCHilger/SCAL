Mathematical evaluation of prognostic significance of clinico-morphological and immunohistochemical features of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Complex examination was given to 76 patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma and immunohistochemical parameters of estrogen and progesterone receptors, proliferative index (Ki-67), HER2 oncoprotein and clinico-morphological characteristics were entered into Excel database. Five-year relapse-free survival, development of regional metastases and relapse were used to work out three functional mathematical models. Those were employed to investigate endometrial tumorigenesis. A minimal set of the most advanced criteria of prognosis and assessment of tumor course served as tools for practical evaluation on the basis of clinico-morphological parameters, relapse, menopause duration, Ki-67 index and expression of PR and HER2.
