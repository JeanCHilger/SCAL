Pulmonary endometriosis. Clinical case. Pulmonary endometriosis is a rare entity and there is little information regarding its treatment. We report a young female who developed hemoptysis in coincidence with menstruation. Pelvic endometriosis was confirmed histologically and pulmonary endometriosis was inferred. Treatment with Danazol led to suppression of both menstruation and hemoptysis, thus confirming the clinical diagnosis.
