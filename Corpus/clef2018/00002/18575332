Impact of NO in peritoneal fluid on sperm motility in patients with endometriosis. To determine the level of NO in the peritoneal fluids in patients with endometriosis and to evaluate the impact of NO on human sperm motility.Peritoneal fluids were taken from 19 patients with Endometriosis, 16 infertile patients with Endometriosis, and 21 patients without Endometriosis (control group). The macrophages in the peritoneal fluids were segregated and cultivated. The concentrations of NO metabolin (nitrate and nitrite) were measured. Human sperms were incubated with the culture fluids to detect the motility of the sperms.The patients with Endometriosis had significant higher levels of NO in the peritoneal fluids than the controls (P < 0.05). The motility of sperms declined significantly in the culture fluids of infertile patients with Endometriosis compared with the fertile patients with Endometriosis and the controls (P < 0.05).Elevated NO in the peritoneal fluids in patients with endometriosis may play a role in the pathogeneses of Endometriosis-associated infertility.
