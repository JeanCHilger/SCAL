Immunohistochemical expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and COX-2 in Stage IA malignant polyps of the endometrium. To study whether endometrioid type malignant endometrial polyps (MEP) are different from endometrium cancer not associated with polyps (ECNAP) in means of immunohistochemical expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9 and COX-2.Archived tissue samples of eight MEP, eight ECNAP and 16 benign endometrial polyps were selected and immunohistochemically analyzed for MMP-2, MMP-9 and COX-2 expression.MMP-2 and MMP-9 were overexpressed in ECNAP compared to MEP and benign endometrial polyps (p < 0.05). MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions were not different in the malignant part of MEP, benign part of MEP and benign endometrial polyps. COX-2 expression was found to be higher in benign lesions, although this was not statistically significant.Similar immunohistochemical expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and COX-2 within a polyp and with benign polyps may indicate an immunohistochemically indolent characteristic of MEP.
