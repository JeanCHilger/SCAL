Arias-Stella reaction as a diagnostic pitfall in a bladder biopsy with endometriosis: case report and review of the pseudoneoplastic bladder lesions. Arias-Stella reaction is a hormone-induced atypical endometrial change that may involve endometrial, extraendometrial, or endometriotic sites. Establishing a correct diagnosis of Arias-Stella reaction may sometimes be problematic when seen outside of the uterine corpus, particularly in a limited biopsy sample when the pathologist is not aware of the clinical history. We report an Arias-Stella reaction in bladder endometriosis, which presented as a bladder mass in a 25-year-old pregnant woman. Clinical information of intrauterine pregnancy (week 16) was not initially provided when the biopsy was performed. We also discuss endometriosis, endocervicosis, and m√ºllerianosis of the bladder, which are benign glandular lesions that may mimic tumors within the bladder wall.
