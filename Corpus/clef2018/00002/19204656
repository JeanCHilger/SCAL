Pelvic lymphadenectomy as an alternative to adjuvant radiotherapy in early stage endometrial cancer at high risk of recurrent lymphatic metastases (stage I). The aim of this study was to evaluate if the surgical approach without pelvic lymphadenectomy and with adjuvant radiotherapy in the patients suffering from endometrioid adenocarcinoma type at high risk (of lymphatic metastasis) in early stage can be substituted by only surgery with pelvic lymphadenectomy (with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy).A retrospective study was carried out on 56 patients who underwent surgery with eventual adjuvant radiotherapy and were attended during the follow-up in the Operative Unit of Gynecology and Obstetrics from 1997 to 2004. The patients were divided into two groups: the low risk group and the high risk group. The cancer grading (G) was defined before the surgery with an hystological exam on endometrial biopsies. The follow-up had a medium duration of 30 months (range: 9-44 months) and consisted of the evaluation of: cancer related survival (CRS) recurrence free survival (RFS). Both were evaluated according to age, risk type, and therapy adopted.Four patients (7.1%) showed relapse during the period of study in a medium time of 24 months (range: 12-36): 2 of these patients (C and D cases 36%) had a relapse both locally (pelvic wall) and distantlyThe standard surgery offers a good prognosis to the low risk group patients. To the high risk group the CRS and the RFS were better with standard surgery with lymphadenectomy than with standard surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy. The degree of differentiation of the cancer is the most important prognostic factor in relation to the survival free from relapse (RFS).
