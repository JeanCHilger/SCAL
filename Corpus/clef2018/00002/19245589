The expression of six biomarkers in the four most common ovarian cancers: correlation with clinicopathological parameters. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of fascin-1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, cortactin, survivin, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression with clinicopathological parameters for the four most common ovarian surface epithelial carcinomas. Six biomarkers were investigated immunohistochemically using tissue microarrays of 185 specimens including 79 serous cystadenocarcinomas, 47 mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, 45 endometrioid adenocarcinomas, and 14 clear cell carcinomas. The four most common ovarian carcinomas showed significant expression of fascin-1, cortactin, survivin, and EGFR, but not of MMP-2 and MMP-9. In addition, higher immunostaining scores for fascin-1 in mucinous cystadenocarcinomas correlated with T stage, N stage, American Joint Committee on Cancer AJCC clinical stage, and a poorer survival rate for cortactin in serous cystadenocarcinomas correlated with T stage
