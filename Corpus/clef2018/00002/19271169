Effect of Quyu Jiedu granule on microenvironment of ova in patients with endometriosis. To observe the effect of Quyu Jiedu Granules (, QJG) on the micro- microenvironment of ova in patients with endometriosis (EM). environmentTwenty EM patients who received in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) were randomized equally into a treated group and a control group. Further, 20 patients who received IVF-ET due to oviduct factors were enrolled into a non-endometriosis group. The dosage of gonadotrophic hormone used, the number of ova attained, fertilization rate and clinical pregnancy rate were all observed, and the levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-right harpoon over left harpoon) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in follicular fluid as well as their mRNA expressions in ovarian granular cells were detected by RT-PCR on the very day of ovum attainment.The ova attainment (13.80+/-6.87) and fertilization rate (0.69+/-0.31) in the treated group were all higher than the corresponding values in the control group (9.80+/-5.32 and 0.47+/-0.22) the follicular fluid contents of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the treated group were 1.38+/-0.21 ng/mL and 130.56+/-12.81 pg/mL, respectively, which were lower than those in the control group (1.98+/-0.34 ng/mL and 146.83+/-17.65 pg/mL, respectively). Further, the treated group showed much lower mRNA expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in ovarian granular cells.The elevation of TNF-alpha and IL-6 contents in follicular fluid and their mRNA expressions in ovarian granular cells are possibly related to the low quality of ova in EM QJG might raise the ova quality by reducing TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels to improve the living micro-environment for the ova.
