Endometrial development in the luteal phase of women with various types of infertility: comparison with women of normal fertility. In this study, the prevalence of retarded endometrial development in the luteal phase of an infertile population (20/142 = 14%) was found to be significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than in that of a control, fertile population (3/68 = 4.4%). However, when the infertile subjects were subdivided into groups of different aetiology, it was found that women with endometriosis and unexplained infertility had a significantly higher prevalence of retarded endometrium (6/21 = 29%, 10/48 = 21% respectively P less than 0.01 in both cases) than women with normal fertility
