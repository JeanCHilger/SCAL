Diagnosis of a cutaneous endometriosis decidualised and fistualized during pregnancy. A case of a decidualized and fistulized cutaneous endometriosis has been observed in the obstretrical and gynecological department of the Yalgado-Ou√©draogo national hospital. The patient was a 3-year-old pregnant woman in her third pregnancy primipara, without any surviving child, who presented with a large scabby exulcerated plaque on an hyperpigmented lesion, associated with para umbilical. The patient underwent 12 years earlier a laparotomy for peritonitis worsened with parietal suppuration, then by rupture. The lesion has made the diagnosis difficult and the histologist concluded that it was a decidualised cutaneous endometriosis. Based on this observation, the first one until now, the authors have made a publication on the case.
