Endometriosis. Pathophysiological background for treatment. Endometriosis is the third cause of gynecological morbidity and the complications are associated to ectopically endometrial tissue implantation. The interest on this disease is the functional disability and its association with sterility. It has been established that endometrial growth is estrogen-dependent and that progesterone inhibits the cellular proliferation mediated by estrogens, therefore in endometriosis there is not an adequate response to hormonal signals that control the proliferative activity. It has been described that peritoneal fluid in women with endometriosis has high concentrations of cytokines, growth factors and activated macrophages, which have been shown to have adverse effects on fertility. Therefore, these are not the only causes of infertility since it has been described that women with endometriosis seem to have poor ovarian reserve and ovular quality. When there is infertility, the tendency is to treat the endometriosis due to the changes caused by ectopic tissue presented at the immunological level and in the structure of genital organs, which disturbs the conception process. It has been observed that endometriosis recurs after a surgical procedure. For this reason we should be consider all therapeutic possibilities.
