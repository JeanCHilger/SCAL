Comparison of the clinical value of CA 19-9 versus CA 125 for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Preoperative blood samples and intraoperative tissue specimens were obtained from 101 patients with endometriosis and 78 patients without endometriosis referred for benign gynecologic operations to investigate the clinical value of serum and tissue CA 19-9 levels in the diagnostic evaluation of endometriosis as compared to CA 125. Our prospective cohort study showed that serum CA 19-9 is a valuable marker in the diagnosis of endometriosis, and it may be used to predict the patients with severe endometriosis when used with CA 125.
