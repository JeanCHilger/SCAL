Understanding adenomyosis: a case control study. To elucidate the clinical profile of adenomyosis by comparison with uterine leiomyomas.Retrospective case-control study.Academic medical center.The study comprised 76 women undergoing hysterectomy with adenomyosis and 152 women with uterine leiomyomas but no adenomyosis.Retrospective medical record review of hospital and ambulatory records.Comparison of women undergoing hysterectomy with a sole pathologic finding of adenomyosis and women with leiomyomas alone.Adenomyosis was independently associated with younger age (41.1 years vs. 44.3 years), history of depression (57.1% vs. 24.7%), dysmenorrhea (65.7% vs. 42.3%), and pelvic pain (52.9% vs. 21.1%) in a multivariable unconditional logistic regression analysis compared with women with leiomyomas, where women from both groups had gynecologic symptoms. Furthermore, in a second multivariate model where all subjects had uteri weighing>150 g, women with adenomyosis were more likely to have a history of depression (52.6% vs. 22.2%) and endometriosis (26.3% vs. 2.8%) compared with women with leiomyomas.Women undergoing hysterectomy with a histologic diagnosis of adenomyosis have a distinct symptomatology and medical history compared with women with leiomyomas. Better understanding of this disease is required to improve diagnosis and management.
