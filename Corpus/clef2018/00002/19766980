Validation of serum biomarkers for detection of early- and late-stage endometrial cancer. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of 3 previously described ovarian cancer serum biomarkers (apolipoprotein-1 [ApoA-I], prealbumin [TTR], transferrin [TF]) in the detection of endometrioid and papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.ApoA-I, TTR, and TF levels were measured in serum samples that were obtained from 433 individuals that included 90 women with normal endometrium, 210 women with early-stage endometrial cancer, and 133 women with late-stage endometrial cancer. Multivariate regression models were constructed to evaluate the usefulness of the biomarkers in the detection of endometrial cancer.ApoA-I, TTR, and TF distinguished normal samples from early-stage endometrial cancer with a sensitivity of 71% (specificity, 88%) and normal samples from late stage endometrial cancer with a sensitivity of 82% (specificity, 86%).The biomarker panel that consists of ApoA-I, TTR, and TF may prove to be a useful clinical tool for the detection of endometrial cancer.
