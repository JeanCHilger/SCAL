S100A1 expression in ovarian and endometrial endometrioid carcinomas is a prognostic indicator of relapse-free survival. We sought to investigate the expression levels of S100A1 in ovarian cancer cell lines and tissues to correlate S100A1 with subtype, stage, grade, and relapse-free survival. S100A1 messenger RNA and protein were up-regulated in ovarian cancer cell lines and tumors compared with normal ovarian cell lines and tissues by gene microarray analysis, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and Western immunoblotting. In the study, 63.7% of serous, 21.2% of clear cell, 11.2% of endometrioid, and 3% of mucinous ovarian (1/31) cancers were S100A1+ by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays (n = 500). S100A1 expression increased with increasing Silverberg grade but not stage in serous tumors. Endometrial tissue microarrays (n = 127) were 9.4% S100A1+ no correlation with stage or grade and S100A1 was found. In the endometrioid subtype of ovarian and endometrial cancers, relapse-free survival was decreased for patients with S100A1+ tumors. These data suggest that S100A1 is a marker for poor prognosis of endometrioid subtypes of cancer.
