Expression profiling of 22 genes involved in the PI3K-AKT pathway identifies two subgroups of high-grade endometrial carcinomas with different molecular alterations. Previously, we showed that PIK3CA and p53 alterations in uterine endometrial carcinomas correlate with poor prognosis. However, the contribution of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) -AKT deregulation to endometrial carcinogenesis is not completely understood. The purpose of this study was to analyze alterations of this pathway in endometrial carcinomas and correlate them with the most common genetic abnormalities. Expression profiling of 22 genes involved in PI3K-AKT signaling pathway was analyzed in 38 endometrial carcinomas using TaqMan low-density array (TLDA) analysis. The gene expression pattern was analyzed by hierarchical clustering analysis. Unsupervised clustering divided the high-grade endometrial carcinomas into two clusters. One cluster identified tumors with alterations in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway (exon 20 PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN mutations 9/15 60%), and p16 protein overexpression (8/13
