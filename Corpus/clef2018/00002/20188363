Involvement of the nuclear factor-κB pathway in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. To evaluate the role of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.A literature search was conducted in PubMed to identify all relevant citations.Our findings highlight the important role of NF-κB in the pathophysiology of endometriosis. In vitro and in vivo studies show that NF-κB-mediated gene transcription promotes inflammation, invasion, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of endometriotic cells. Constitutive activation of NF-κB has been demonstrated in endometriotic lesions and peritoneal macrophages of endometriosis patients. Agents blocking NF-κB are effective inhibitors of endometriosis development and some drugs with known NF-κB inhibitory properties have proved efficient at reducing endometriosis-associated symptoms in women. Iron overload activates NF-κB in macrophages. NF-κB activation in macrophages and ectopic endometrial cells stimulates synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, generating a positive feedback loop in the NF-κB pathway and promoting endometriotic lesion establishment, maintenance and development.NF-κB transcriptional activity modulates key cell processes contributing to the initiation and progression of endometriosis. Because endometriosis is a multifactorial disease, inhibiting NF-κB appears to be a promising strategy for future therapies targeting different cell functions involved in endometriosis development, such as cell adhesion, invasion, angiogenesis, inflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Upcoming research will elucidate these hypotheses.
