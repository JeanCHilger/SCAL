Uterine tumors with neuroectodermal differentiation. A report of 4 cases. We report four cases of uterine tumors with neuroectodermal differentiation. One tumor had neuroectodermal component only in the three other tumors, the neuroectodermal component was admixed with another component, namely rhabdomyosarcoma (1 case), and endometrioid adenocarcinoma (2 cases). Histologically, the neuroectodermal component consisted of small to medium sized cells arranged in diffuse sheets. The tumor cells had round nuclei with stippled to coarsely granular chromatin, mostly with non-prominent nucleoli, and scant eosinophilic or amphophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, 4/4 tumors showed expression of vimentin, synaptophysin and CD56
