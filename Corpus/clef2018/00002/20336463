Transvaginal NOTES with semi-rigid and rigid endoscopes that allow adjustable viewing angles. To evaluate semi-rigid and rigid endoscopes for transvaginal NOTES surgery.One rigid endoscope (EndoCAMeleon, KARL STORZ GmbH & Co. KG, Tuttlingen Germany) and one semi-rigid endoscope (EndoEYE LTF-VH, Olympus Deutschland GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) that allow adjustable viewing angles have been used during four transvaginal gynecological NOTES procedures for chronic pelvic pain and infertility.Feasibility of transvaginal access to enter the abdominal cavity was shown. Posterior peritoneum, ovaries and tubal patency were evaluated. The evaluated endoscopes did not overcome the inability to explore the anterior pelvic structures.Rigid and semi-rigid endoscopes that allow adjustable viewing angles during transvaginal NOTES approaches cannot explore the whole pelvic anatomical structures.
