Prognostic significance of CUB domain containing protein expression in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. CDCP1, a transmembrane protein with intracellular tyrosine residues which are phosphorylated upon activation, is supposed to be engaged in proliferative activities and resistance to apoptosis of cancer cells. High level of CDCP1 expression proved to be a poor prognosticator for lung adenocarcinoma. Here, expression level of CDCP1 was immunohistochemically examined in 110 cases (median age of 54.7 years) of endometrioid adenocarcinoma, and its clinical implications were evaluated. Tumor stage was stage I in 71 cases (64.5%), II in 5 (4.5%), III in 28 (25.5%), and IV in 6 (5.5%). Staining intensity of tumor cells was divided into two categories tumor cells with no to weak and moderate to strong membrane staining. The intensity of CDCP1 expression in each case was defined by the staining of major population of cells as follows
