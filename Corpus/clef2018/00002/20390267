Deep pelvic endometriosis: MR imaging. The purpose of the pictorial essay is to show the MR imaging (MRI) findings associated with deep pelvic endometriosis.MRI is an excellent imaging modality for the evaluation of patients with deep pelvic endometriosis, showing high accuracy in the diagnosis and prediction of disease extent. Its multiplanar capabilities and superior soft tissue contrast are extremely useful in the detection of deeply infiltrating endometriotic implants, even in the setting of intense desmoplastic response that may result in complete obliteration of the posterior cul-de-sac and fixed retroversion of the uterus, which limits the scope of laparoscopy. The use of endovaginal and rectal contrast is helpful to better delineate the anatomy of interest and map out the extent of disease, contributing to more effective treatment planning.
