Establishment of serum peptidome pattern-based diagnostic model of endometriosis. To establish a diagnostic model of endometriosis by analyzing serum peptidome patterns in patients with endometriosis using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS).Serum samples from 21 endometriosis patients and 29 healthy control subjects were analyzed using MALDI-TOF-MS and Clinprotools 2.0 software to establish the diagnostic model of endometriosis, which was validated using the serum samples from 10 endometriosis patients and 15 healthy controls.Eighteen statistically significant peptide peaks were obtained with the m/z value ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 (P<0.01). Among the peaks, 12 were down-regulated and 6 up-regulated. The sensitivity and specificity of the model was 90.9% and 100.0%, respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 96.2%.This model shows the feasibility of using MALDI-TOF-MS and Clinprotools software to identify the biomarkers of endometriosis.
