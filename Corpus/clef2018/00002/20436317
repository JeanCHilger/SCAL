Genetics and genomics of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common cause of morbidity in women with an unknown etiology. Studies have demonstrated the familial nature of endometriosis and suggest that inheritance occurs in a polygenic/multifactorial fashion. Studies have attempted to define the gene or genes responsible for endometriosis through association or linkage studies with candidate genes or DNA mapping technology. A number of genomics studies have demonstrated significant alterations in gene expression in endometriosis. A more thorough understanding of the genetics and genomics of endometriosis will facilitate understanding the basic biology of the disease and open new inroads to diagnosis and treatment of this enigmatic condition.
