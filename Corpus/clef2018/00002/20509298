Hormone receptors and markers in endometrial hyperplasia. Immunohistochemical study. Endometrial hyperplasia is a proliferation of the endometrium with increased number of glands and the change of the gland-stroma ratio. By histopathologic examination is now accepted the WHO classification. Atypical hyperplasia is accepted to be a precursor for endometrioid carcinoma. In order to find some prognostic elements, immunohistochemical reactivity of hormone receptors and markers in endometrial hyperplasia, was performed.From 162 cases of EH, 32 cases were selected for immunohistochemical investigations. Avidin-biotin-peroxidase method was used for revealing estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER, PGR) and Ki-67 and EGF factors.The immune reactivity for ER and PGR increase in parallel with the complexity of glandular morphological changes. Ki-67 demonstrated a strong immune reactivity together with EGF in atypical hyperplasias.The diagnosis of EH can be made by histopathological examinations. The immunohistochemistry aids for the prognosis, in order to establish the best treatment.
