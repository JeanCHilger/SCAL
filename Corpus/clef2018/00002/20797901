Follicular-fluid anti-Müllerian hormone concentration is similar in patients with endometriosis compared with non-endometriotic patients. This cross-sectional prospective study assessed follicular-fluid anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentrations in infertile patients with mild/minimal endometriosis during natural IVF. Thirty-two women participated in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: tubal obstruction without endometriosis (control group) and minimal/mild endometriosis (study group). All patients underwent laparoscopy for assessment of infertility at the same time, any foci of endometriosis found were cauterized. AMH concentration was measured in the follicular fluid of a single follicle when it achieved pre-ovulatory maturation by ultrasensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Likewise, AMH, FSH and inhibin B content in serum was also measured. Age (30 ± 1.3 and 32 ± 0.8 years) and body mass index (22 ± 0.6 and 22 ± 0.5 kg/m(2)), day-3 antral follicle count (11.3 ± 1.7 and 10.7 ± 1.5), serum FSH concentrations (5.4 ± 0.6 and 5.0 ± 0.3 IU/ml) and follicular-fluid AMH concentrations (1.8 ± 0.3 and 1.5 ± 0.1 ng/ml, study and control group, respectively
