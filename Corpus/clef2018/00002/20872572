Evaluation of serum autoantibody levels in the diagnosis of ovarian endometrioma. We analyzed autoantibodies against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) in the serum of patients with endometrioma and healthy controls to determine whether autoantibodies can be accurate biomarkers for the diagnosis of ovarian endometrioma.Serum samples were obtained from 56 patients with endometriosis and 66 healthy women who served as normal controls. The titers of antibodies against a panel of eight TAAs were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.We found that the serum IGFII mRNA-binding protein 1 (IMP1) autoantibody and cyclin B1 autoantibody could discriminate between healthy controls and endometriosis patients (AUC-ROC 0.777 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.694-0.860, P<0.0005, and AUC-ROC 0.614Our data suggest that IMP1 alone or combined with cyclin B1 seems to fulfill the requirements of sensitivity and specificity to become a useful clinical biomarker of endometrioma. However, further studies will be required to establish the predictive value and to support the clinical use of IMP1/cyclin B1 in the diagnosis and/or screening of endometriosis.
