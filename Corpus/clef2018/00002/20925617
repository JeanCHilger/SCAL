Laparoscopy--or not--for management of unexplained infertility. This study aimed at evaluating the role of laparoscopy in the management of unexplained infertility in a prospective randomised controlled trial. The study comprised of 255 patients as a study group and 257 patients as a control group. All women had unexplained infertility. Patients in the study group had laparoscopy followed by ovarian stimulation and timed intercourse for six cycles, while patients in the control group were treated directly with ovarian stimulation and timed intercourse for six cycles. Severe adhesions were found in one in each of the two groups, respectively. They were referred directly to the IVF/ICSI programme. Moderate pelvic endometriosis was demonstrated in three cases in the two groups. Again, severe endometriosis was found in two cases in the study groups and they were referred to the IVF/ICSI programme. After 6 months of follow-up, clinical pregnancy occurred in 114/255 (44.7%) in the study group and 107/257 (41.7%) in the control group and the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The miscarriage rate was similar in the two groups. We concluded that laparoscopy could be postponed when proceeding in the management of unexplained infertility, until ovarian stimulation and timed intercourse had been found to be unsuccessful in achieving pregnancy.
