Gallbladder endometrioma associated with obstructive jaundice and a serous ovarian cystic adenoma. The occurrence of pelvic endometriosis is not uncommon, but endometriosis of the gallbladder is extremely rare. To our knowledge, only one such case has previously been described in the literature. This report concerns another patient with gallbladder endometriosis, which formed two distinct lesions at the fundus of the organ. The clinicopathological findings and pathogenesis are discussed. Endometriosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a fertile woman with a painful mass, particularly if the mass is associated in size and tenderness with menstrual variability.
