The novel estrogen-induced gene EIG121 regulates autophagy and promotes cell survival under stress. We previously identified a novel estrogen-induced gene, EIG121, as being differentially regulated in endometrioid and nonendometrioid endometrial carcinoma. The function of EIG121 was unknown. Using a tetracycline-inducible system, we found that overexpression of EIG121, but not of LacZ, caused a profound suppression of cell growth. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluroscent labeling indicated that EIG121 was a transmembrane protein localized in the plasma membrane-late endosome–lysosome compartments. Deletion of the putative transmembrane domain abolished the membrane association. In cells overexpressing EIG121, cytoplasmic vacuoles accumulated after EIG121 induction, and the autophagosome marker LC3 translocated into punctuate, dot-like structures. Electron microscopy revealed that in cells overexpressing EIG121, autophagosomes were markedly increased. Overexpression of EIG121 also increased the cells containing acidic vesicles and induced lysosomal degradation of long-lived proteins. In MCF-7 cells, both EIG121 and LC3 were rapidly degraded by a lysosomal mechanism after starvation. Knockdown of EIG121 blocked starvation-induced LC3 degradation. By itself, knockdown of EIG121 did not affect cell survival. When combined with starvation or cytotoxic agents, EIG121 knockdown greatly increased apoptosis. Our results suggest that EIG121 is associated with the endosome–lysosome compartments and may have an important role in autophagy. Under unfavorable conditions such as starvation and exposure to cytotoxic agents, EIG121 may protect cells from cell death by upregulating the autophagy pathway.
