The value of serological markers in the diagnosis and prognosis of endometriosis: a prospective case-control study. We analyzed selected well-known and less well-known serum markers that have been proposed for diagnosis and severity assessment of endometriosis, in a case-control study.This prospective study was carried out in a Clinical Department of Gynecology in Iasi, Romania. Study participants included endometriosis patients, and controls in whom laparoscopy had excluded endometriosis. Each case and control was investigated for serum levels of CA125, TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8. The data were correlated with clinical symptoms and revised American Fertility Society (rAFS) score and stage, and interpreted by Mann-Whitney U-test and ANOVA regression analysis.Over the course of 1 year, 24 cases of endometriosis and 24 controls of matched age were selected. The rAFS stages were: stage I, 12.5% stage II, 16.7%CA125 correlated with endometriosis screening and severity, indicating its superiority as a marker for further, larger studies.
