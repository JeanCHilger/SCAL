Appendectomy in the gynecological setting: intraoperative findings and corresponding histopathology. To evaluate the intraoperative findings and corresponding histopathology associated with appendectomies performed during benign gynecological surgery.Retrospective case series.Twenty-two appendectomies were performed from 2002 through 2008 at Hutzel Women's Hospital due to intraoperative findings of inflammation or erythema (n = 8), periappendiceal adhesions (n = 5), injury to the appendix or mesoappendix (n = 2), fecalith (n = 2), dilation of the appendix (n = 1), adnexal mass involving the appendix (n = 1), and suspected lipoma (n = 1). Final pathology was consistent with significant findings such as acute inflammation, periappendicitis, and adhesions or endometriosis involving the appendix in 68.2% of cases.In the benign gynecological setting, appendectomies were primarily performed due to inflammation or erythema. In the majority of cases, significant appendiceal pathology was confirmed.
