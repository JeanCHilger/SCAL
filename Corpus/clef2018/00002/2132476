Salpingoscopy in patients with endometriosis-associated infertility. Endoscopic evaluation of the tubal mucosa has been shown to be an important prognostic factor in predicting the probability of a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy. A recent classification of the tubal mucosa lesions allows uniformity of evaluation, permitting comparison of results in prospective studies. It has been suggested that endometriosis may be associated with intratubal abnormalities. In this prospective study we evaluated 35 patients with endometriosis-associated infertility. No intraluminal abnormalities were found, and all the patients that subsequently conceived had an intrauterine pregnancy.
