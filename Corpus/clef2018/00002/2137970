Diagnosis and clinical presentation of endometriosis. Despite advances in diagnostic techniques, endometriosis remains an enigmatic condition. Clinical symptoms and signs often do not correlate with the anatomic stage of the disease, and morphologic characteristics very widely. A definitive diagnosis can be established only by direct visualization, usually by laparoscopy. In some cases biopsy may be necessary to confirm the presence of disease.
