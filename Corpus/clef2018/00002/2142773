Pregnancy after ovariectomy as a result of preservation of the embryos. We report the first published case of pregnancy obtained with a self-preserved embryo in a woman who, in 1987, had been castrated for a tumoral and painful pelvic disease retrospectively diagnosed as endometriosis. This woman had an old-standing tuboperitoneal infertility, and in vitro fertilization had been performed, followed by cryopreservation of the embryos. Two embryos were transferred during an artificially induced oestro-progestogenic cycle. Pregnancy developed and progressed normally with a simplified therapeutic regimen. This case suggests that preservation of the embryos is a possible solution to the problem of women about to undergo medical or surgical castration and wishing to become pregnant after cure of the disease which motivated the castration.
