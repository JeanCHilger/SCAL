Quality of life associated to chronic pelvic pain is independent of endometriosis diagnosis--a cross-sectional survey. Pain is strongly related to poor quality of life. We performed a cross-sectional study in a university hospital to investigate quality of life in women suffering from chronic pelvic pain (CPP) due to endometriosis and others conditions.Fifty-seven patients aged between 25 and 48 years-old submitted to laparoscopy because of CPP were evaluated for quality of life and depressive symptoms. Quality of life was accessed by a quality of life instrument [World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment-Bref (WHOQOL-bref)]. Causes of pelvic pain were determined and severity of CPP was measured with a visual analogue scale. According to the intensity of pelvic pain score, patients were classified in two groups (group Low CPP < 25th percentile visual analogue scale and group High CPP > 25th percentile). Four dimensions on quality of life were measured (physical, psychological, social and environmental). We stratified the analysis of quality of life according CPP causes (presence or not of endometriosis in laparoscopy).Patients with higher pain scores presented lower quality of life status in psychological and environmental dimensions. We found a negative correlation between pain scores and psychological dimension of quality of life (r = -0.310, P = .02). Quality of life scores were similar between groups with and without endometriosis (physical 54.2 ± 12.8 and 51.1 ± 13.8, P = 0.504 psychological 56.2 ± 14.4 and 62.8 ± 12.4, P = 0.182Higher pain scores are correlated to lower quality of life however the fact of having endometriosis in addition to CPP does not have an additional impact upon the quality of life.
