Up-regulation of p21-activated kinase 1 by in vitro treatment with interleukin 1-beta and its increased expression in ovarian endometriotic cysts. We evaluated whether the proinflammatory cytokines can regulate p21-activated kinase (Pak1) expression in endometrial cells as well as whether its expression is increased in endometriotic cysts. We found that interleukin-1Î² up-regulates Pak1 expression in endometrial stromal cells (ESC) and that the immunoreactivity of Pak1 is increased in the endometriotic cysts.
