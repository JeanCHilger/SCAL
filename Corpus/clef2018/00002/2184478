Bladder endometriosis: review and presentation of 2 new cases. Two cases of vesical endometritis in two women aged 48 and a 46 years respectively are presented. Both cases were detected incidentally during a gynecological and vesical ultrasound study and the diagnosis was confirmed by cystoscopy and transurethral resection and histopathological exam. An exhaustive literature review is also presented and we insist on the rare presentation and the relatively specific clinical symptoms. A special note is made on the cystoscopic findings and on the different treatment techniques, including the latest approach with LH-RH analogues and/or transurethral photocoagulation with laser rays.
