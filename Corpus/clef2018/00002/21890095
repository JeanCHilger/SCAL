Cervical endometriosis: clinical character and management experience in a 27-year span. The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinicopathologic characters and explore the possible cause of cervical endometriosis.By retrospective review, among 13,566 cases of endometriosis that had been treated in our hospital, 33 cases of pathologically proven cervical endometriosis were extracted.Of 33 cases, 17 women had abnormal vaginal bleeding or visible cervical lesions the other 16 women had no obvious clinical manifestations but were diagnosed retrospectively on histopathologic reports. Vaginal delivery or curettage procedures had occurred in 84.8% of patients. Only 2 patients had undergone cervical surgery of cryotherapy or electric excision. Seven cases were misdiagnosed before final surgery with the primary suspicion of cervical myoma, inflammatory cyst, cervical polyp, uterine submucous myoma, melanoma or melanin mole, and cervical cancer. Surgical treatment was performed for all symptomatic patients. No recurrence was seen.Cervical endometriosis should be distinguished from other benign or malignant cervical lesions. Surgical excision is suggested for symptomatic patients.
