Radiologic findings of pelvic venous congestion in an adolescent girl with angiographic confirmation and interventional treatment. We present a case of pelvic venous congestion in a 13-year-old girl who complained of pelvic pain for 9 months. The diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome was suggested by imaging modalities, including sonography, CT and MRI, with classically described imaging findings. The girl underwent diagnostic laparoscopy, where visual inspection demonstrated congested pelvic veins and endometriosis. After removal of endometrial implants, the child's pain persisted and she subsequently underwent venography and embolization of the ovarian veins. We found no literature describing pelvic venous congestion (PVC) in children. Knowledge that PVC exists in children is important, particularly for pediatric radiologists who are imaging patients with complaints of pelvic pain.
