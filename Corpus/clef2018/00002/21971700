Correlations among ERCC1, XPB, UBE2I, EGF, TAL2 and ILF3 revealed by             gene signatures of histological subtypes of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. The aim of this study was to better understand the mechanisms of tumor development             and disease progression in human epithelial ovarian cancer. Fifty genes were screened             for gene signature 20 expressed genes were assessed in tumor and normal samples             of EOC patients by RT-PCR. Expression of UBE2I, EGF, TAL2 and ILF3 was validated             by qPCR on the ABI Prism 7000 Detection System. ERCC1 and XPB expression was previously             determined by RT-PCR in these specimens. Statistical analyses include two-sided             Kruskal-Wallis test, pairwise comparison, Pearson correlation coefficient and             paired t-test. In comparison to normal samples, 6 genes demonstrated distinct             expression patterns in tumor tissues, with high expression observed for ERCC1,             XPB and ILF3 (p=0.001, 0.0007 and 0.002, respectively) and low expression observed             for TAL2 and EGF (both p<0.0001). This differential expression pattern between             normal and tumor tissues may reflect in part the development of ovarian cancer.             Significant differences in expression patterns of these genes in clear cell, endometrioid,             mucinous and serous ovarian cancer were observed. Comparison of expression of             any two EOC subtypes revealed multiple gene involvement in histopathological differentiation             and cancer progression. A positive association was found between ERCC1 and XPB             expression (r=0.53, p<0.0001) and between TAL2 and EGF expression (r=0.817,             p<0.0001) suggesting the existence of gene linkage in these tumors. The differences             in expression patterns of studied genes between tumors and normal specimens, between             histological subtypes and correlations among studied genes, may indicate their             involvement in tumor growth and disease progression in human epithelial ovarian             cancer. Further investigation of these genes may enable better understanding of             the molecular mechanism of tumorigenesis and identification of potential biomarkers.
