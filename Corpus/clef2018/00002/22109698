In vitro model of stromal and epithelial immortalized endometriotic cells. Endometriosis is a relatively common chronic gynecologic disorder that usually presents with chronic pelvic pain or infertility. It results from implantation of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. Despite its frequency and its impact on quality of life, the understanding of pathogenesis of endometriosis remains incomplete and its treatment remains controversial. In this work, we established a suitable in vitro model system of immortalized human endometriotic cell line taking advantage of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase. The results demonstrate that these cells retain the natural characteristics of endometrial cells in term of phenotype and of functional expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors, without chromosomal abnormalities. In conclusion, these cells are potentially useful as an experimental model to investigate endometriosis biology.
