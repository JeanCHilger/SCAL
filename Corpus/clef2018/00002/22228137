Expression of tumor suppressor gene ING4 in ovarian carcinoma is correlated with microvessel density. Angiogenesis, estimated by microvessel density (MVD), has been shown to predict poor progression-free survival in women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. Inhibitor of growth (ING) family proteins inhibit angiogenesis in a number of cancers. We evaluated the role of ING4 in regulation of angiogenesis in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine ING4 mRNA levels in 40 ovarian cancer patients and 40 normal controls. Also, we used immunohistochemistry to evaluate (1) ING4 protein expression levels and (2) the level of MVD by staining CD34, a microvessel marker, in these patients. Through statistical analysis, the possible correlation between the ING4 expression and angiogenesis was explored.ING4 mRNA and protein were significantly downregulated in all ovarian cancer patients compared to normal controls (P < 0.001). Endometrioid carcinoma tissue had significantly lower ING4 levels compared to serous or mucinous ovarian cancer. ING4 expression correlated negatively with stage and histological grade of ovarian cancers. MVD correlated negatively with ING4 protein and mRNA levels (ρ = -0.865 P < 0.001 and ρ = -0.724Loss of ING4 may promote microvessel formation and plays a role in facilitating the development of ovarian cancer. Although the specific mechanisms are not yet understood, our data suggest that ING4 may be a promising target for the treatment for ovarian cancer.
