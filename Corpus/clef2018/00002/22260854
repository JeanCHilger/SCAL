Does colorectal endometriosis alter intestinal functions? A prospective manometric and questionnaire-based study. To objectively evaluate using anorectal manometry whether endometriotic nodules influence intestinal function and to reveal subjective intestinal dysfunctions in patients with rectosigmoid deep infiltrating endometriosis.Prospective study.Tertiary care university hospital.Patients (n = 25) with a preoperative diagnosis of rectosigmoid endometriosis.Patients underwent anorectal manometry after that, they filled a questionnaire about defecatory functions and ranked their pain symptoms.The parameters studied were resting pressure, maximum squeezing pressure, pushing, rectoanal inhibitory reflex, and rectal sensibility. We analyzed the responses to the defecatory function questionnaire and the scored the endometriosis pain symptoms using a Visual Analogue Scale.No alterations of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex were found. Hypertone of the internal anal sphincter was found in 20 of 25 patients. Almost half of the patients had an increase of the threshold of desire to defecate, and 7 patients had a reduction of the anal sphincter squeeze pressure. According to the responses to the defecatory function questionnaire, incomplete evacuation was the most common symptom.We did not find marked motility or sensitive dysfunctions at the anorectal manometry, whereas subjectively patients reported some defecatory disorders. We revealed the presence of hypertone of the internal anal sphincter in most of the patients.74/2010/O/Sper.
