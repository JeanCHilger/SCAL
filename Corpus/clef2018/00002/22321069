Proteomic characterization of ovarian cancers identifying annexin-A4, phosphoserine aminotransferase, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 2, and serpin B5 as histology-specific biomarkers. Numerous studies have suggested that the different histological subtypes of ovarian carcinoma (i.e. clear cell, endometrioid, mucinous, and serous) have distinct clinical histories and characteristics however, most studies that have aimed to determine biomarker have not performed comprehensive analyses based on subtype specificity. In the present study, we performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based differential proteomic analysis of the different histological subtypes of ovarian carcinoma using tissue specimens from 39 patients. Seventy-seven protein spots (55 unique proteins) were found to be up- or downregulated in a subtype-specific manner. The most significant difference was observed for: (i) annexin-A4 (ANXA4) and phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT1), which are expressed strongly in clear cell carcinoma
