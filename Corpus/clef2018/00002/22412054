Clinicopathological significance of podocalyxin and phosphorylated ezrin in uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Podocalyxin is an anti-adhesive glycoprotein that has been associated with highly aggressive forms of cancers. Podocalyxin increases the migration and invasive properties of cancer cells through its interaction with ezrin, which undergoes an increase in phosphorylation through podocalyxin.To study the roles of podocalyxin and phosphorylated ezrin (pEzrin) in uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma (UEA).Using immunohistochemisty the authors investigated the expression of podocalyxin and pEzrin along with some well-known markers of tumour aggressiveness including p53, oestrogen receptor and Ki-67 in UEA.Podocalyxin and pEzrin expression levels were positive in 36.1% (22 of 61 patients) and 50.8% (31 of 61 patients) of UEA cases, respectively. Further, podocalyxin expression was correlated with tumour grade (p=0.0001), FIGO stage (p=0.0062), p53 expression (p=0.0050) and Ki-67 index (p=0.0069). In addition, pEzrin expression was associated with FIGO stage (p=0.0231), p53 expression (p<0.0001) and Ki-67 index (p=0.0010). The expression of podocalyxin was also correlated with that of pEzrin (p=0.0102).These results suggest that overexpression of podocalyxin and pEzrin may indicate a more aggressive phenotype thus, evaluation of these proteins may be useful in prediction of disease progression in UEA cases.
