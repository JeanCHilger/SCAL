Molecular mechanisms linking endometriosis under oxidative stress with ovarian tumorigenesis and therapeutic modalities. Inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Endometriosis-associated ovarian carcinogenesis might be promoted through oxidative stress-induced increased genomic instability, aberrant methylation, and aberrant chromatin remodeling, as well as mutations of tumor suppressor genes. Aberrant expression of ARID1A, PIK3CA, and NF-kB genes has been recognized as the major target genes involved in oxidative stress-induced carcinogenesis. HNF-1beta appears to play a key role in anti-oxidative defense mechanisms. We discuss the pathophysiologic roles of oxidative stress as somatic mutations as well as highly specific agents that effectively modulate these targets.
