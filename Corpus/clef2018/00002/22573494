The G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) is expressed in normal human ovaries and is upregulated in ovarian endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease involving the ovary. Estrogens play a crucial role in maintaining ovarian function. Deregulation of estrogen signals is associated with fertility-impairing disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) is present in the human ovary. Additionally, weÂ  analyzed the folliculogenesis and ovarian endometriosis in GPER expression. Seventy-nine patients (ovarian endometriosis, n = 26 ovarian pelvic inflammatory disease [PID], n = 10
