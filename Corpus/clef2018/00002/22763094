Surgical treatment of ovarian endometriomas: state of the art? To define the role of surgery in the treatment of endometriomas, we review the literature available via PubMed and cross-reference the published data. We analyze the arguments in favor of and against surgical treatment of endometriomas and compare surgical techniques. Pain relief and pregnancy rates of more than 50% after surgery are the most important arguments in favor of surgery. Histologic and biologic markers of ovarian reserve show a risk of decreased ovarian reserve that should be taken into consideration, especially in cases of repeated surgery. Considerable surgical expertise is required, and the lack of comparative studies yields no conclusions on the best surgical technique. Despite the risk of decreased ovarian reserve due to the surgical procedure, surgery has an important role in the treatment of ovarian endometriomas, and more studies are required to define the most appropriate surgical technique.
