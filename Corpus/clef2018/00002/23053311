Endocrine and inflammatory factors and endometriosis-associated infertility in assisted reproduction techniques. Our research aimed to evaluate the effect of endometriosis on folliculogenesis and pregnancy, and to assess the involvement of inflammatory factors (IL1b, PGE2, PGF2α, and TGFβ2) in follicular fluid.A total of 65 follicular fluid aspirates were collected. Concentrations of inflammatory factors (IL1b, PGE2, PGF2α, and TGFβ2) and steroid hormones (E2, progesterone, FSH, and LH) within follicular fluid as well as serum E2 and LH concentrations were measured. The mRNA expression of IL1b, Ptgs2, aromatase, and PPARγ in granulosa cells was determined. The outcome of ART was monitored and recorded.The oocyte retrieval, rate of metaphase II oocyte, cleavage rate, effective embryo rate, and pregnancy rates of patients with endometriosis were all significantly lower than those of the control patients. In those with endometriosis, serum E2 concentrations were lower than those observed in controls. Aromatase levels in the granulosa cells of the endometriosis group were lower while concentrations of PGE2 in follicular fluid were higher than in the control group. Concentrations of PGE2, PGF2α, TGFβ2, and IL1b were significantly correlated with each other.These results suggest that the outcomes of ART, in relation to serum E2 concentration, were adversely affected by the presence of endometriosis. Furthermore, the results supported that, among the endocrine and inflammatory factors, PGE2 within the follicular fluid impairs the number and quality of oocytes.
