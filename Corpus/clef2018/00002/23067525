Study of the sentinel node in endometrial cancer at early stages: preliminary results. To investigate the applicability of the sentinel lymph node biopsy technique in early stages of endometrial cancer.A prospective study that included consecutive patients with a histological diagnosis of clinical state I endometrial carcinoma was performed. Two doses of 2 mCi (74 MBq) of (99m)Tc-albumin nanocolloid were injected in the uterine cervix, and planar and SPECT-CT images were obtained at one hour, and at 24 hours if no migration of the tracer was observed. Methylene blue dye was also injected into the cervix immediately prior to the surgery. A gamma probe was used during the surgical procedure for sentinel lymph node identification. In all cases, a hysterectomy, double adnexectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy were performed, carrying out a histological analysis (hematoxylin-eosin) of the sentinel lymph nodes and the lymphadenectomy specimen.We included 19 patients, with a final diagnoses of endometrioid carcinoma (18 cases) and endometrial stromal sarcoma (1 case). At least one sentinel lymph node was identified in 17 of them (89.5% detection rate). Twenty-nine sentinel lymph nodes were identified during surgery, all of them negative for neoplastic infiltration. No metastatic invasion was found in the pelvic lymphadenectomy specimens as well.The sentinel lymph node biopsy technique seems to be a reliable tool in nodal staging of endometrial cancer at early stages, with an acceptable detection rate and high histological correlation. The low prevalence of lymphatic spread in this group of patients and the encouraging results obtained could make the sentinel lymph node an alternative to routine complete lymphadenectomy.
