Endometriosis. To summarize current knowledge of pathogenesis, diagnostics and treatment of endometriosis.Review article.Centre for diagnostics and treatment of endometriosis, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, General Faculty Hospital and 1st Faculty of Medicine of Charles University, Prague.Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, which induces a chronic, inflammatory reaction. The condition is predominantly found in women of reproductive age, from all ethnic and social groups. The associated symptoms - pain, infertility - can impact on general physical, mental and social well being. Treatment must be individualised, taking the clinical problem in its entirety into account, including the impact of the disease and the effect of its treatment on quality of life. Pain symptoms may persist despite seemingly adequate medical and/or surgical treatment of the disease. In such circumstances, a multi-disciplinary approach involving a pain clinic and counselling should be considered early in the treatment plan.Endometriosis is a medical condition with high recurrence rate and especially those patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis should be centralized to the centres experienced in diagnostics, complicated surgical treatment and providing multi-disciplinary approach with adequate postoperative care.
