The value of pelvic MRI in the diagnosis of posterior cul-de-sac obliteration in cases of deep pelvic endometriosis. The objective of our study was to define relevant MRI signs allowing preoperative diagnosis of posterior cul-de-sac obliteration in patients with deep pelvic endometriosis.This retrospective study included patients who underwent pelvic MRI completed by a laparoscopic examination. Three radiologists performed the MRI review blinded and recorded the following signs: sign 1, retroflexed uterus sign 2, retrouterine massSixty-three patients were included in the study. Posterior cul-de-sac obliteration was diagnosed in 43 patients at laparoscopy. The mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each sign and impression of posterior cul-de-sac obliteration were, respectively, as follows: sign 1, 24.4%, 77.5%, 41.3% sign 2, 97.1%, 83.7%, 92.8%MRI allows posterior cul-de-sac obliteration diagnosis. Pelvic fluid displacement may be the sign with greatest utility when considering both diagnostic accuracy and interobserver agreement.
