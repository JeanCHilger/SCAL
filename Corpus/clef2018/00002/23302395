RHOC: a key gene for endometriosis. Considerable efforts have been invested in elucidating the potential mechanisms involved in the physiopathology of endometriosis. The aims of our study were to investigate whether RHOC expression is differentially altered in the endometrium and in endometriotic lesions. A total of 40 patients diagnosed with endometriosis and 15 healthy fertile women were selected for the study. Paired biopsies of endometrial tissue (eutopic endometrium) and endometriotic lesions (ectopic endometrium) were obtained from the patients with endometriosis. Endometrium from women without endometriosis was used as a control. Expression of the RHOC gene was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in autologous endometrial tissues of women with endometriosis and in the endometrium of control women. Increased RHOC expression was detected in endometriotic lesions compared to the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis and control women. RHOC changes may be among the key elements involved in the origin and the maintenance of endometriosis.
