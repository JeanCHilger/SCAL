The statement of Polish Society's Experts Group concerning diagnostics and methods of endometriosis treatment. Endometriosis is defined by endometrial glands and stroma outside of the endometrial cavity Three types of endometriosis have been described: peritoneal endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis and deep infiltrating endometriosis. Endometriosis afflicts 6-15% of women population. It occurs mainly in the group of women in reproductive age, but also in the group of minors and approximately 3% of women after menopause. Within the group of women suffering from infertility the frequency of endometriosis increased to 35-50% of cases. Endometriosis is associated with pain symptoms which can bear the character of pain occurring periodically and altering into constant pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria and dyschezia. The correlation between the stage of endometriosis and intensity of pain symptoms not always has to be proportionate. Laparoscopy can be perceived as a standard procedure in endometriosis diagnostics as it allows simultaneous treatment. Profound interview as well as visual diagnostics (USG, MRI) should precede laparoscopy Treatment of endometriosis can be divided into pharmacological and surgical treatment, which can be invasive or non-invasive. The type of treatment depends on patient's age and her procreation plans, occurring ailments and endometriosis type. Important role is played by adjuvant treatment such as appropriate diet and lifestyle. Treatment of advanced endometriosis should be conducted in reference centres that are appointed with adequate equipment and have the possibility of interdisciplinary treatment. Presented standards can digest and outline the order of proceedings both in diagnostics and endometriosis treatment. The research group believes that the above compilation will facilitate undertaking appropriate decision in diagnosis and treatment of the disease, which will subsequently contribute to therapeutic success.
