Prognostic significance of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 in endometrial cancer. We investigated the prognostic significance of matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP 2) and 9 (MMP 9) in endometrial cancer (EC). The expression of MMP 2 and MMP 9 was analyzed immunohistochemically in 73 primary EC patients. In most cases, the gelatinases were predominantly localized to epithelial cell of tumor origin. In univariate analysis histological type, tumor grade, FIGO (1988) surgical stage and high stromal MMP 2 expression were identified as a significant determinant for EC recurrence, while epithelial MMP 2 expression and epithelial and stromal MMP 9 expression were not. Multivariate analysis revealed a subgroup of patient age > or = 63.6 years with endometrioid adenocarcinoma and papillary serous carcinoma, all FIGO (2009) stage I disease where strong staining of stromal MMP 2 increase risk of EC recurrence (p = 0.037).
