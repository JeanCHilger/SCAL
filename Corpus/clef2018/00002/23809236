Splenosis: an uncommon differential diagnosis in gynecology. Splenosis consists of ectopic functioning splenic tissue that can be located anywhere within the abdomen or pelvis. It is a benign condition usually found incidentally and is usually asymptomatic. The need for therapy is controversial, and treatment is suggested only in symptomatic cases, primarily those related to pelvic or abdominal implants.
