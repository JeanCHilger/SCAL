Three related near-haploid clones in a primary endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary. We report the cytogenetic findings in a primary endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary from a 29-year-old woman. Three clones with counts of 30, 29, and 27 chromosomes were observed. The predominant clone had 29 chromosomes and the following karyotype: 29, X, -X, -3, -3, +der(3)ins(3?) (q21
