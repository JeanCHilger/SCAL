Localization of anti-endometrial antibody binding in women with endometriosis using a double-labelling immunohistochemical method. Anti-endometrial antibody binding was localized using a double-labelling immunohistochemical method on frozen sections of endometrium taken from a woman without pelvic disease. Serum from 40 women with endometriosis was tested and, as controls, serum samples from 20 adult males and 20 umbilical cords. The method allowed compensation for endogenous immunoglobulins in endometrium and accurate localization of anti-endometrial antibody binding in the cytoplasm of the glandular epithelium. Significantly more women with endometriosis (14/40) were found to have anti-endometrial antibodies than controls (1/40) (P less than 0.001 chi 2). There was no correlation between disease severity and the presence of anti-endometrial antibodies or the intensity of staining.
