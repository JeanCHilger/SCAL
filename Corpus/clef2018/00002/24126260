Effect of surgery for endometrioma on ovarian function. Endometriosis affects a significant proportion of reproductive-aged women. The impact of the disease on ovarian function is an important consideration when planning treatment in women who want to retain the potential of future childbearing. This review will specifically address the association between endometriomas and diminished ovarian reserve, with a particular focus on the impact of surgical endometrioma resection on ovarian function. The existing literature supports an adverse effect of ovarian endometriomas on spontaneous ovulation rates, markers of ovarian reserve, and response to ovarian stimulation, although data on clinical pregnancy and live birth rates remain inconsistent. Surgical removal of endometriomas may worsen ovarian function by removing healthy ovarian cortex or compromising blood flow to the ovary. It is evident that surgical excision of endometriomas acutely impairs ovarian function as measured by ovarian reserve markers whether this represents progressive or long term impairment remains the subject of ongoing investigation.
