Evaluation of serum anti-Mullerian hormone levels to assess the ovarian reserve in women with severe endometriosis. The aim of this study was to measure anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) serum levels in women with severe endometriosis, in order to demonstrate the effect of the disease on ovarian reserve.Prospective case-control study. One hundred and ninety-five patients were enrolled: 130 fertile patients (group A) and 65 patients with stage III and IV endometriosis, diagnosed by laparoscopy and histological examination (group B). AMH serum levels were measured in both groups and were compared using Student's t-test.The two groups were homogenous for main demographic data. Group B had statistically significantly lower mean AMH serum levels (0.97±0.59ng/ml) than group A (1.72±0.63ng/ml) (p=0.001).This study is a demonstration of the damage of endometriosis on ovarian reserve, leading to a form of incipient ovarian failure, which is considered as an early sign of advanced ovarian depletion in young women. These findings suggest that AMH could be used in the follow-up of patients with endometriosis, in order to assess promptly the decrease of ovarian reserve.
