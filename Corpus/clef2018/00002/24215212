Histological features associated with occult lymph node metastasis in FIGO clinical stage I, grade I endometrioid carcinoma. Lymph node involvement affects prognosis/treatment in endometrial carcinoma patients. We assessed various histological features associated with nodal metastasis in patients with grade I, stage I endometrial endometrioid carcinoma (EEC).Eighteen stage I EECs with occult positive lymph nodes and 36 controls were assessed for depth of myoinvasion microcystic, elongated and fragmented (MELF) pattern of myometrial invasionLymph nodes from grade I EEC exhibiting cellular budding or LVI should be examined for occult metastases, especially in the form of histiocyte-like cells.
