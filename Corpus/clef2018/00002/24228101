Expression analysis of URI/RMP gene in endometrioid adenocarcinoma by tissue microarray immunohistochemistry. Multiple studies have recently demonstrated the oncogenic property of URI (or RMP, a member of the prefoldin family of molecular chaperones) during progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and possibly prostate cancer. Most recently, we have shown that URI/RMP is up-regulated in cervical cancer, another reproductive system tumor beside ovarian and prostate cancers. To investigate if URI/RMP also plays a role in other reproductive system tumors, especially in endometrioid adenocarcinoma, we analyzed URI/RMP expression in a TMA (tissue microarray) containing tissues from 30 cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma (which covers tumor tissues from Grade I through Grade III) and adjacent endometrium by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and densitometry analysis using image-pro plus 6.0 software. Our results showed that the mean density of URI/RMP expression in cancerous tissue is slightly higher than that of the adjacent endometrial tissue, though not statistically significant (p>0.05). There is no significant difference either between the mean density of Grade III cancerous tissue and that of Grade I and II cancers. Notably, we detected significantly higher signal intensity in cancerous tissue of all 7 Grade III cases than that of their adjacent endometrial tissue (p<0.05), suggesting a correlation of URI/RMP expression with the differentiation and pathological classification of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Together, our results demonstrate the heterogeneous expression of URI/RMP in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The higher level of URI/RMP expression in high-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas compared to tissues of adjacent endometrium or gland suggests a diagnostic and possibly, a prognostic value of URI/RMP in endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
