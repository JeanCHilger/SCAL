Role of environmental organochlorinated pollutants in the development of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a gynecological disease, which involves the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, commonly in the pelvic region. The etiology of the disease is unclear, but multiple factors may contribute to its pathogenesis. Environmental organochlorinated pollutants, particularly dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are thought to play a role in the development of this disease however, the results of clinical trials are discordant, and it is not clear how the effect of exposure to these compounds is linked to endometriosis. Their effects on cytokines, immune system, hormones, and growth factors are thought to increase the risk of endometriosis. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of epidemiological studies, which have evaluated the relationship between endometriosis and exposure to persistent organochlorinated pollutants.
