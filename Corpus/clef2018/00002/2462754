Comparative studies on the value of acute phase proteins and CA-125 for monitoring patients with ovarian cancer. In a study of 71 patients with malignant ovarian tumors serum levels of CA-125, C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-1-antitrypsin and coeruloplasmin were analysed. In contrast to the tumor-free group significantly higher values of CA-125, CRP and alpha-1-antitrypsin were found in the group with recurrent disease. However, the serum-concentrations of coeruloplasmin remained unchanged in both groups. In the group with progressive disease the median values of CA-125 were greater than 65 U/ml and of CRP greater than 12 micron/ml, respectively. The median serum concentrations of alpha-1-antitrypsin (2 to 4 mg/ml) and coeruloplasmin (150 to 600 ng/ml) did not reach their cut-off levels. Beside CA-125 the analysis of CRP and alpha-1-antitrypsin is an additional helpful procedure for the monitoring of patients with malignant ovarian tumors.
