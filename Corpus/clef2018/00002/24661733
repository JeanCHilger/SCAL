Elevated expression of CD147 in patients with endometriosis and its role in regulating apoptosis and migration of human endometrial cells. To examine the expression of CD147 in 60 human endometriosis lesions and how CD147 regulates migration and apoptosis in human uterine epithelial (HESs) cells.Experimental clinical study and laboratory-based investigation.Hospital and academic research center.Sixty women with chocolate cysts and 16 control women without endometriosis.Human uterine epithelial cells were treated with anti-CD147 antibody.Real-time polymerase chain reaction for detecting CD147 expression in 60 human endometriosis lesions migration assay and CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) assay for cell functional investigationExpression of CD147 was significantly higher in ectopic endometrial tissues from patients with endometriosis than in normal endometrial tissues. Interference with CD147 function led to decreased migration and cell viability in HESs cells. Surprisingly, MMP-2 expression and activity were not changed after treating HESs cells with anti-CD147 antibody. Further examination revealed that immunodepletion of CD147 induced apoptosis in HESs cells, leading to the activation of caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.The results of the present study suggest that abnormally high expression of CD147 in ovarian endometriosis lesions with enhanced cell survival (reduced apoptosis) and migration, in an MMP-2-independent manner, may underlie the progression of endometriosis in humans.
