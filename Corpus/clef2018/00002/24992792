Celiac disease and endometriosis: an insidious and worrisome association hard to diagnose: a case report. Primary infertility is an unusual presentation of celiac disease (CD). When non-classical symptoms are present, the diagnosis is not easy and it becomes even more difficult when CD is associated with endometriosis, representing a diagnostic challenge for medical practitioners and gynecologists.A 34-year-old patient presented to the authors' observation with primary infertility. Formerly she was treated for endometriosis and the diagnosis of CD was delayed. A favorable clinical and serological response following a gluten-free-diet (GFD) was achieved and a successful pregnancy was obtained.This case report emphasizes the role of the CD in women's infertility and the possible association between CD and endometriosis. Even if the relationship between these two diseases is still unclear and further studies to address this issue are required, more attention from gynecologists is needed, considering that the later this association is diagnosed, the greater the probability of adverse outcomes of health developing.
