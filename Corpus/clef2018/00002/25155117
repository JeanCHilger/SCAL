The approach to chronic pelvic pain in the adolescent. Adolescents present to outpatient and acute care settings commonly for evaluation and treatment of chronic pelvic pain (CPP). Primary care providers, gynecologists, pediatric and general surgeons, emergency department providers, and other specialists should be familiar with both gynecologic and nongynecologic causes of CPP so as to avoid delayed diagnoses and potential adverse sequelae. Treatment may include medications, surgery, physical therapy, trigger-point injections, psychological counseling, and complementary/alternative medicine. Additional challenges arise in caring for this patient population because of issues of confidentiality, embarrassment surrounding the history or examination, and combined parent-child decision making.
