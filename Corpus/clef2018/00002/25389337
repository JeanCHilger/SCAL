The lung-restricted marker napsin A is highly expressed in clear cell carcinomas of the ovary. We recently observed expression of the "lung" marker napsin A in ovarian clear cell carcinomas and therefore sought to determine the extent of napsin A expression in a subset of ovarian neoplasms.We identified an archival series of ovarian clear cell carcinomas (n = 36), serous borderline tumors (n = 21), high-grade serous carcinomas (n = 37), and endometrioid adenocarcinomas (n = 29). Using standard immunohistochemical techniques on whole sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens, we employed a panel of antibodies: napsin A (IP64), estrogen receptor (SP1), WT-1 (6F-H2), PAX-8 (BC12), and TTF-1 (SPT24).Thirty-six of 36 clear cell carcinomas showed napsin A expression, typically in a uniform pattern. None of the serous borderline tumors or high-grade serous carcinomas manifested napsin A expression. Napsin A was expressed in three (10%) of 29 endometrioid adenocarcinomas, generally in a focal pattern.Our study showed that napsin A is an extremely sensitive (100%) marker of ovarian clear cell carcinomas and exhibits very high specificity (100%) in distinguishing clear cell carcinomas from high-grade serous carcinomas and serous borderline tumors and 90% specificity in discriminating clear cell carcinomas from endometrioid carcinomas.
