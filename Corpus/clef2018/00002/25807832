The role of chemokine and non-chemokine factors in pain-related complaints in patients with endometrial cysts. Endometriosis is a chronic disease manifested as peritoneal endometrial implants and adhesions, as well as endometrial cysts, with pain as the dominant component.The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of chemokine (MCP-1, MCP-2, MIP-1, MIP-1 and RANTES) and non-chemokine (urocortin, ghrelin, and leptin) factors in the intensity of pelvic pain in women with endometrial cysts.A total of 86 women, aged 18-38, treated laparoscopically between September 2009 and November 2012, due to adnexal changes, i.e. endometrial cysts and mature teratomas, were recruited for the study. On a numeric rating scale, i.e. PSS (Pain Sensation Scale--according to Johnson), the patients rated pain intensity. The level of pain-related stress was investigated with the Pain Distress Scale (PDS, according to Johnson).Medians for MCP-1, MCP-2, MIP-1, MIP-1 and RANTES concentrations were not statistically significantly different. The respondents rated pain intensity during menses as 6 and 3 points in the E and T groups, respectively (6 vs. 3 points p=0.001). Statistically significant differences were also observed for pain intensity during work (apart from menses), (2 vs. 2 points, p=0,014) and during sexual intercourse (apart from menses) (3 vs. 1 points, p=0.006). Pain-related stress levels were higher in the T group as compared to the E group (3 vs. 5 pointsIt seems safe to conclude that chemokines and leptin may play a significant role in the occurrence of pain complaints among women with endometrial cysts. Further research might result in implementation of new treatment methods for pain management, especially in terms of pharmacotherapy.
