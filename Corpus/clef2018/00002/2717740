Endometriosis: appearance and detection at MR imaging. Thirty-nine magnetic resonance (MR) studies were performed on 31 women with surgically proved endometriosis. A total of 88 endometriotic lesions ranging in size from 0.2 to 7.5 cm were detected on 24 of 30 MR images of women. The signal intensities ranged from hyperintense on all pulse sequences (41 of 88) to hypointense on all sequences (24 of 88) the remainder demonstrated signal intensities corresponding to the appearances of acute, subacute, and chronic hematomas. Hypointense or signal-void rims on both T1- and T2-weighted images were detected in 35 lesions. Identification of the disease with MR imaging versus concurrent surgery was compared for 76 sites in 19 patients. Findings were true-positive in 24 cases, false-negative in ten, true-negative in 32, and false-positive in seven, resulting in an MR sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 82%. Adhesions obscured the disease at laparoscopy in three patients. MR imaging cannot be used as a substitute for laparoscopy in the definitive diagnosis or staging of endometriosis. However, it can be used to monitor treatment response in place of laparoscopy once a diagnosis is firmly established.
