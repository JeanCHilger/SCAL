The effect of tumor necrosis factor on human sperm motility in vitro. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha) is present in elevated levels in peritoneal fluid from infertile women with endometriosis. The effect of TNF alpha on human sperm motility in vitro was evaluated utilizing peritoneal fluid from infertile women with minimal endometriosis containing 0, 100, 400, or 800 U of TNF alpha/ml as well as similar concentrations of recombinant human TNF alpha. No reduction in progressive and total motility was found at recombinant TNF alpha concentrations of 100 U ml. However, 500 and 1000 U of recombinant TNF alpha/ml caused a significant reduction in progressive and total sperm motility after 4 and 21 hours of incubation when compared with controls. Similarly, peritoneal fluid containing 100 U of TNF alpha/ml did not significantly reduce progressive and total sperm motility after either 4 or 21 hours of incubation but peritoneal fluid containing 400 U of TNF alpha/ml reduced progressive sperm motility after 4 and 21 hours and total sperm motility after 21 hours of incubation. Peritoneal fluid with a TNF alpha concentration of 800 U/ml caused a significant reduction in both progressive and total sperm motility after 4 and 21 hours when compared with controls of TNF alpha-negative peritoneal fluid. The addition of polyclonal rabbit anti-TNF alpha antibody or 30-min heat inactivation at 56 C of TNF alpha-positive peritoneal fluid reversed the inhibitory effect on sperm motility. The ability of TNF alpha to cause a significant reduction of sperm motility in vitro suggests that this may be a mechanism for the infertility observed in women with minimal endometriosis.
