Endometriosis in diagnostic laparoscopy in Isfahan, Iran. In 200 consecutive routine diagnostic laparoscopies, 31 cases (15.5%) of endometriosis were found. Of these 200 cases, 131 patients (65.5%) were referred for laparoscopy because of infertility. In 22 (71.0%) out of 31 patients with endometriosis infertility was the indication for laparoscopy. In the remainder of the patients laparoscopy was performed because of other indications. Half of the patients with endometriosis showed moderate or severe degrees of the disease. Seventy-one percent of the patients were below the age of 29. According to our findings, the presumption that endometriosis is a rare disease in Iran is considered to be erroneous.
