Assay characteristics of the immunoradiometric method for CA-125. A nonlinear standard curve for the immunoradiometric method for determining CA-125 may result in an overestimation of values below 20 U/ml. Since the modification of the assay as described in the report eliminates the problem, we propose the use of this simple modification when using CA-125 determinations for evaluating women with endometriosis.
