Laparoscopic diagnosis and evaluation of danazol or gestrinone therapy for endometriosis in sterility. In forty-six sterile women, endometriosis externa was diagnosed and classified laparoscopically. 21 patients were treated with Gestrinone 5mg-10mg/week and 25 patients were treated with Danazol 300mg-400mg/day for 6 months. The effects of these hormonal treatments were evaluated by second-look laparoscopy according to adhesion severity, number of blueberry spots and chocolate cyst size, as well as dysmenorrhea and other complaints. The results were as follows 1) Dysmenorrhea was relieved in 60.0% of the Gestrinone-treated group and 45.5% of the Danazol group. 2) Adhesion was weakened or partially separated spontaneously in 66.7% of the Gestrinone group and 63.6% of the Danazol group. 3) Blueberry spots decreased in number or paled in 61.9% of the Gestrinone group and 75.0% of the Danazol group. 4) Chocolate cyst size became smaller in 60.0% of the Gestrinone group and 77.8% of the Danazol group. 5) Peritoneal fluid volume was not decreased after the hormonal treatments but the prostaglandin E2 concentration in peritoneal fluid was decreased (p less than 0.05) after Gestrinone therapy. 6) The patients complained of some side effects, liver function especially was disturbed in 48.0% of the Danazol group and 9.5% of the Gestrinone group. Hoarseness was complained of in 33.3% of the Gestrinone group and 12.0% of the Danazol group. 7) Finally, 23.8% of the Gestrinone group and 28.0% of the Danazol group conceived after the hormonal treatments.
