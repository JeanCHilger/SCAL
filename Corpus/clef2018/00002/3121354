Influence of experimental rhinitis on the gonadotropin response to intranasal administration of buserelin. The influence of experimental rhinitis on the absorption of buserelin, measured as the serum luteinizing hormone (LH) response, has been investigated. A single dose of 200 micrograms buserelin was given to 24 healthy male volunteers after induction of experimental rhinitis with histamine and after use of a saline spray (placebo control). Except on one occasion, when the pump-spray apparently was incorrectly operated, serum LH concentration rose after buserelin. There was no difference in the LH response between histamine-induced rhinitis and saline controls. It was concluded that intranasal application of buserelin represents a reliable mode of application and that modification of the administration route or a change in the dosage schedule during naturally-occurring nasal inflammations, such as the common cold and allergic rhinitis, is unnecessary in patients undergoing chronic treatment with intranasal buserelin, e.g. for prostatic cancer, endometriosis, precocious puberty, and contraception.
