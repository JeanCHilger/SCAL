CO2-hysteroscopy today. A survey of intra-uterine endoscopy over the last years is given showing the increased demand for hysteroscopy for diagnosis and therapy of intra-uterine diseases. Its indications include the search for unknown causes of uterine bleeding or sterility. It is also applied for various therapeutic reasons such as for example the search and removal of lost or embedded intra-uterine devices. The different methods of hysteroscopy--particularly the CO2 hysteroscopy, which we developed, are described. The new examination procedures such as for example the extensive penetration test applied in cases of sterility and others, which through the advances made in technology are now possible, are also discussed.
