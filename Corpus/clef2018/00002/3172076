Early diagnosis of a diverticular colovaginal fistula with colposcopy. A case report. Seventy cases of colovaginal fistula complicating diverticular disease are documented in the literature. Predisposing factors are advanced age and previous hysterectomy. We diagnosed a case early on with careful colposcopic observation of the volcanic ejection of pus from multiple sites in the vaginal apex we propose naming that phenomenon the "Io" sign after the most eruptive celestial body known. We also documented the association of a coloovarian fistula, ureteral obstruction and endometriosis with this disease process. Considering the expected growth in the geriatric population and the frequency of hysterectomy, clinicians should familiarize themselves with this life-threatening illness.
