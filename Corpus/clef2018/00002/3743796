Comparison of fecundability with fresh and frozen semen in therapeutic donor insemination. A series of 401 therapeutic donor insemination (TDI) cycles was analyzed for determining the effect on fecundability of fresh versus cryopreserved semen, the number of inseminations per cycle, recipient age, and the reproductive health of the TDI recipient. We followed a protocol in which inseminations were performed during the periovulatory period determined by urinary luteinizing hormone surge or ultrasound-timed human chorionic gonadotropin injection. The minimum standard for insemination with fresh or cryopreserved semen was a total of 40 X 10(6) grade 3 sperm. We found no decreased fecundability when using frozen semen, rather than freshly ejaculated specimens. The number of inseminations per cycle did not affect the pregnancy outcome after TDI. The reproductive health of the recipient had a significant effect on the pregnancy rate. Fecundability was 15.6% for healthy women, as compared with 6.7% for women with a diagnosis of moderate, severe, or extensive endometriosis, pelvic adhesions, tubal disease, or ovulatory dysfunction. To avoid transmission of human T-lymphotropic virus type III from sperm donor to TDI recipient, we have recently utilized an exclusively frozen TDI program. With well-timed inseminations of 40 X 10(6) grade 3 motile sperm, we have been able to attain pregnancy rates similar to those previously obtained with fresh samples.
