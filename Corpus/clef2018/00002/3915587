The occurrence of human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) in extracts of normal, benign and malignant tissues of the female genital tract. In addition to its presence in extracts of carcinomatous tissues from the vulva, endometrium and ovary, PLAP can also be found in tissue extracts of benign conditions of the endometrium and myometrium. We detected slightly elevated levels of PLAP in patients with myoma, raised levels in 2/2 patients with endometrial polyps and high values in 2/2 patients with glandulocystic hyperplasia. Moreover, normal endometrium and fragments of normal Fallopian tube also contained fairly high amounts of endogenous PLAP. These results have important implications with regard to the possible use of PLAP as a tumour marker or of anti-PLAP monoclonal antibodies in radioimmunolocalization or radioimmunotherapy.
