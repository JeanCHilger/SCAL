Ultrasonography in the diagnosis of tumors of the ovary. Ultrasonography was performed prior to operation upon 60 patients with tumors of the ovary. This procedure was accurate in differentiating tumors of the ovary from other types of tumors of the pelvis in more than 90 per cent of the patients. Likewise, a determination between benign and malignant lesions of the ovary could be reliably made on the basis of ultrasonic patterns. These findings suggest that ultrasonography should be performed on all patients suspected of having a tumor of the ovary.
