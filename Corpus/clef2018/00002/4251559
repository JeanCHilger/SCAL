Culdoscopy and laparoscopy: competitive or complementary technics? A description and analysis is presented of 500 culdoscopies by the Decker Method and 60 laparoscopies.  Twenty photographs of the equipment, procedures, and typical finding as seen through the telescope are included.  How to observe "ballooning sign," to choose anesthesia, and to prevent hernia at laparoscopy site is discussed.  Culdoscopy is prefered in obese patients, when general anesthesia is contraindicated, and when fimbria and ovaries need visualization.  Culdoscopy is not suitable if masses or pelvic or cervical inflammation are present.  Laparoscopy is preferred for surgery and viewing of all peritoneal organs, particularly if the pathology is in doubt.
