Alterations in progesterone metabolism and luteal function in infertile women with endometriosis. The concentrations of pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PGD) and pregnanolone (PN) were measured in daily morning urine specimens from 66 infertile women (40 with varying degrees of endometriosis and 26 control subjects) and correlated with daily changes in basal body temperature (BBT) and with midluteal levels of serum progesterone (P). PN and BBT rose at midcycle in women with endometriosis, as expected, indicating secretion of some P at that time. However, PGD, the major endpoint of P metabolism, was delayed in its excretion. Endometrial biopsies were similarly delayed (out of phase) in women with endometriosis, and a significantly higher incidence of follicular luteinization was seen. It appears that while P secretion begins at midcycle, the bulk of P secretion is delayed, perhaps because of the process of follicular luteinization, and that a shortened functional luteal phase thus exists in women with endometriosis.
