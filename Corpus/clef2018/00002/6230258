Diethylstilbestrol exposure in utero and endometriosis in infertile females. Endometriosis was found in 39% and in utero diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure in 5% of 397 infertile women who had undergone laparoscopy and/or laparotomy among 750 consecutively evaluated infertile couples. Fifty percent of the DES-exposed infertile women also had endometriosis, similar to the 39% with endometriosis among non-DES-exposed women. Cervical stenosis was found in 25% of all DES-exposed patients and in 83% of those who had undergone cryocautery or conization. However, 40% did not have endometriosis. Thus, while the frequency of endometriosis and cervical stenosis is extremely high in infertile women exposed in utero to DES, a significant association beyond that found in non-DES-exposed patients could not be established. Some of the infertility may be associated with cervical stenosis alone.Endometriosis was found in 39% and in utero diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure in 5% of 397 infertile women who had undergone laparoscopy and/or laparotomy among 750 consecutively evaluated infertile couples.  50% of the DES exposed infertile women also had endometriosis, similar to the 39% with endometriosis among non-DES exposed women.
