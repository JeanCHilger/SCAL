Nongynecologic bladder and perivesical ultrasound. Ultrasound is effective in evaluating pathologic entities in and around the urinary bladder. Abnormalities may be classified into 2 groups: lesions primarily affecting the bladder, including the bladder wall and perivesical lesions, which secondarily affect the urinary tract. Intrinsic bladder diseases include inflammatory lesions, stones, and tumors, both primary and metastatic. Extrinsic perivesical abnormalities include lesions of the prostate, seminal vesicles, urethra, rectum, and perivesical soft tissues. Since the bladder is routinely visualized on pelvic ultrasonography, awareness and recognition of the ultrasonic appearance of disease in and around the urinary bladder can lead to more accurate diagnosis and detection of unsuspected disease.
