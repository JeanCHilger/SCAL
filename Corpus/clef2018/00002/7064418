Endometriosis and cancer. Such features as single-phase cycling, endocrine infertility, endometriosis concomitant endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial carcinoma and endometriosis with concomitant uterine myoma and proliferative processes in the mammary glands as well as hormono-metabolic disorders frequently occur both in endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma and, therefore, suggest that pathogenesis of these hormone-dependent diseases has something in common. It was established experimentally that the likelihood of proliferation development and malignancy in the endometrium is great, when it is dislocated and, particularly, when hormonal disorders occur. An autoimmune nature of endometriosis is suggested. The similarity and differences in diagnosis of endometriosis and some types of cancer as well as common principles of treatment of the diseases are discussed. It is recommended in conclusion that patients with endometriosis of the uterus, ovary and other sites should be referred to a group at high risk for cancer.
