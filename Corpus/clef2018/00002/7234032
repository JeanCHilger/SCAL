Endometriosis of the terminal ileum: differential diagnosis to the Crohn's disease (author's transl). We report on the clinical course of a 30 year old female patient with endometriosis of the terminal ileum. The course was complicated by development of intestinal abscesses, entero-cutaneous and entero-vesical fistulas and stenosis of the terminal√∂ ileum. A diagnosis of Morbus Crohn was made and was only corrected after the patient had to be operated upon because of mechanical obstruction of the terminal ileum. The problems of diagnosis and management are presented.
