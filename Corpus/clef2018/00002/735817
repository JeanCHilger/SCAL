Endolymphatic stromal myosis with autoradiographic observation. A biopsy case of endolymphatic stromal myosis, a rare neoplasm of the uterus, which occurred in a 33-year-old female was described. The histology was typical and resembled stromal cells of proliferative phase endometrium. The tumor extended in the endometrium and diffusely infiltrated into the myometrium and the parametrium. However, 3H-thymidine labeling index was low suggesting slow growth of the tumor.
