Cutaneous Endosalpingiosis. Endosalpingiosis is the aberrant growth of Fallopian tube epithelium outside of its normal location. This phenomenon has long been recognized by gynecologists, since it most often occurs in the pelvic cavity after salpingectomy. We describe a 30-year-old woman with cutaneous columnar ciliated cysts of the umbilicus and adjacent skin that developed shortly after salpingectomy. Evidence is presented that these cysts are cutaneous endosalpingiosis.
