Characteristics of the endometrial estrogen-receptor system in physiological and various pathological states of the body. The state of endometrial estrogen-receptor system was evaluated under physiological and pathological conditions characterized by changes in estradiol dynamics during the menstrual cycle. It is suggested that external endometriosis is accompanied by changes in the state of the endometrial estrogen-receptor level.The state of endometrial estrogen-receptor systems was evaluated under physiological and pathological conditions characterized by changes in estradiol dynamics during the menstrual cycle.
