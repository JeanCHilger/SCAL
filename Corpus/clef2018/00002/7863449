Danazol in the treatment of endometriosis. 48 females with uterine endometriosis stage 1 and 2, 26 female with mild and moderate external endometriosis and 9 females with external in combination with internal endometriosis with the disease duration from 6 months to 10 years were given danazol in doses 200-400 mg/day for 6 months. The effect of the treatment proved to be very high: 37 patients were cured, 14 improved, 3 got pregnant. 11 patients needed the second treatment course. Side effects were rare. Depressed hyperactive menstrual cycle normalized quickly. It is inferred that danazol doses 200-400 mg/day are adequate for induction of complete or partial responses in internal and external endometriosis.
