The number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive cells in endometriotic lesions differs from that in the endometrium. Analysis of PCNA positive cells during the menstrual cycle and in post-menopause. Immunohistochemical expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was studied in the endometrium and in endometriotic lesions during the menstrual cycle and in post-menopausal patients. During the menstrual cycle, in the basal layer of the endometrium, an increase in the number of positive indices (PI) of PCNA was observed in epithelial cells from the menstrual phase. It reached a maximum in the proliferative phase and decreased in the secretory phase. However, no change was observed in the stromal cells of the basal layer. In the functional layer of the endometrium, the PI of the epithelial cells showed a high peak in the late proliferative phase, decreased sharply in the secretory phase and remained unchanged thereafter. The PI of the stromal cells in the functional layer showed two peaks, one in the late proliferative and the other in the mid and late secretory phase. In the endometriotic lesions, except for the proliferative phase, the number of PI was significantly higher than that of the corresponding endometrium and no significant changes were observed during the menstrual cycle. In post-menopausal endometriotic lesions, the number of PI was also higher than that of the corresponding endometrium. Thus the numbers of PI differed between the endometrium and endometriotic lesions in the same patients. These results imply that the endometriotic lesions are constantly more proliferative than the endometrium irrespective of the hormonal milieu during both the menstrual cycle and in a post-menopausal environment.
