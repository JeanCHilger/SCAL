Expression of EGFR, HER-2/neu, P53, and PCNA in endometrioid, serous papillary, and clear cell endometrial adenocarcinomas. Expression of four biologic markers was studied in 69 cases of endometrial cancer to identify their association with cell type, decreased survival, and increased tumor metastasis. Cell types included endometrioid (n = 45), serous papillary (n = 16), and clear cell (n = 8). Immunohistochemical stains were employed to detect the presence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER-2/neu, p53, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Analysis revealed that EGFR was expressed in 49%, HER-2/neu in 59%, p53 in 9%, and PCNA in 16% of tumor specimens. HER-2/neu overexpression was significantly associated with depth of myometrial invasion. p53 and PCNA immunoreactivity significantly correlated with nonendometrioid histology, although PCNA was less specific in labeling these less favorable cell types. EGFR immunoreactivity also significantly correlated with nonendometrioid cell types and tumor metastases at time of diagnosis. Seventy-seven percent of patients with metastatic disease were EGFR-positive versus 36% positivity in patients with no evidence of metastases (P < 0.002). For patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, evidence of EGFR overexpression decreased survival from 89 to 69% (P < 0.04). In the serous papillary and clear cell category, EGFR positivity decreased survival from 86 to 27% (P < 0.03). EGFR strongly correlates with tumor metastasis and patient survival in endometrial cancer. Altered expression of this oncoprotein may serve as a guide to prognosis and treatment in these patients.
