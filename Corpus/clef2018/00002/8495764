Vaginal patterns during danazol and buserelin acetate therapy for endometriosis: structural and ultrastructural study. To evaluate histologic and ultrastructural changes of the vaginal mucosa in patients given buserelin acetate or danazol treatment for endometriosis.Controlled clinical study.Infertility clinic of an academic unit.Infertile women with endometriosis randomized to receive buserelin acetate or danazol and undergoing vaginal biopsies during treatment were selected.Buserelin acetate was administered IN 400 micrograms three times per day and danazol orally 600 mg/d. Vaginal biopsies were performed baseline and at 3 and 6 months of treatment, and specimens were examined by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. 17 beta-Estradiol and P levels were determined in each patient at the time of each biopsy.Structural and ultrastructural patterns of vaginal mucosa after 3 and 6 months of treatment.Buserelin acetate treatment induced early, marked hypotrophy of the vaginal mucosa with aspects typical of the menopause. The modifications caused by danazol occurred mainly in the intermediate layer, which was weakly hypotrophic only at the end of the treatment.Vaginal mucosa undergoes constant and well-defined modifications during both buserelin acetate and danazol treatment for endometriosis. The modifications are compatible with the biological effects of the drugs.
