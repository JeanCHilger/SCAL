Effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha on adhesion of human endometrial stromal cells to peritoneal mesothelial cells: an in vitro system. To assess the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on adhesion of endometrial stromal cells to peritoneal mesothelial cells, a possible step leading to endometriosis.Analysis of cell adhesion in vitro.University research laboratory.Peritoneal fluid and biopsies were obtained from volunteers with regular cycles without endometriosis or endometrial pathology.Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (0.1 to 1,000 U/mL) was added to nutrient media with the following supplements: 10% fetal calf serum, epidermal growth factor 20 ng/mL, and gentamicin 10 ng/mL.Radioactivity of chromium-51 was used as a reflection of adherent stromal cells.The adherence of endometrial stromal cells to mesothelial cells was significantly increased by pretreatment of mesothelial cells with TNF-alpha.Tumor necrosis factor-alpha may play a facilitory role in the development of endometriosis.
