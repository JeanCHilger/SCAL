Aromatase expression in endometriosis. The conversion of C19 steroids to estrogens occurs in a number of tissues, such as the ovary and placenta, and is catalyzed by aromatase P450 (P450arom the product of the CYP19 gene). P450arom expression has also been detected in a number of uterine tumors, such as leiomyomas and endometrial cancer. On the other hand, P450arom expression was undetectable in normal endometrial and myometrial tissues. The present study was conducted to determine the presence or absence of aromatase expression in peritoneal endometriotic implants and in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. Endometriotic implants in pelvic peritoneum (n = 17
