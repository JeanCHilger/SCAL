The determination of CA-125, CA-19-9 and CEA antigens in gynecologic patients for differential diagnosis and the assessment of the efficacy of surgical treatment and subsequent monitoring. Tumor markers CA 125, CA 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were measured in the blood sera of 396 inpatients of different age. In 139 patients the measurements were carried out over time. Hoffman La Roche enzyme immunoassay test kits were used. Eight groups of women were tested: controls without gynecological diseases, women in need of plastic repair of the genitals, patients with inflammatory diseases, with cervical endometriosis, internal endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis, uterine myoma, benign ovarian tumors, and malignant tumors of the ovaries. The results indicate a relatively high diagnostic value of measuring CA 125 in gynecological patients, particularly in those with endometriosis. Parallel measurements of three markers in the blood serum (CA 125, CA 19-9, and CEA) are more informative for the differential diagnosis of endometriosis and malignant tumors. Follow-up of CA 125 concentration may be used to assess the efficacy of therapy and help early detect the disease recurrences.
