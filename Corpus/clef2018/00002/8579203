Myometrectomy--a method of choice for the therapy of adenomyosis patients in the reproductive period. Seventy-six patients with adenomyosis were examined using computer-aided hysterosalpingography and transvaginal ultrasonic scanning in the "pseudocolor" mode. Organ-sparing operation, myometrectomy (removal of the involved myometrium with preservation of the uterus) was performed in 8 patients aged 18 to 34. In the postoperative period, conservative therapy was administered. Fifty percent of patients became pregnant within a year after the operation.
