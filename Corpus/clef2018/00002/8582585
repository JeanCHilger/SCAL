Endometriosis--diagnosis and therapy. Results of a current survey of 6,700 gynecologists. The aim of this study is to obtain an actual survey of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of endometriosis (EMT) in gynaecological practice in West Germany. A questionnaire was sent to 6,700 gynaecologist 1,364 responded. Approximately 5% of all the patients in daily practice have symptoms related to EMT. Most of the patients are in their twenties. The common clinical symptoms of EMT are dysmenorrhoea (91.8%), infertility (79.7%), pelvic pain (70.9%), menstrual irregularity (46.3%), dyspareunia (21.8%) and painful defaecation (12.8%). The diagnostic standard is laparoscopy, but there are many doctors diagnosing EMT also by means of gynaecological examination (23.8%) or ultrasound (21.3%) - especially in young patients. Hormones are the first choice of therapy. Progestins and danazol are preferred. GnRH-analogues are only used by a smaller proportion of gynaecologists - particularly in infertile patients. Surgical procedures with or without hormonal suppression are another line of therapy adapted by 70.9% of the gynaecologists, which are often preferred in infertile patients. Psychological problems in EMT are caused by the uncertainties between EMT and infertility and by the difficulties between physiological menstrual discomfort and pain caused by EMT. 68.5% of the gynaecologists suggest that more information beyond diagnosis and therapy should be given to the patients. Promotion of self-supporting groups should be encouraged by the doctors.
