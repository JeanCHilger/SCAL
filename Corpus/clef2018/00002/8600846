Laparoscopic resection of sigmoid endometrioma. Endometriosis as a cause for pelvic pain is quite common in women of child-bearing age. However, colonic an rectal involvement is relatively rare and may have a wide array of clinical symptomatology and radiographic findings. We recently treated a patient who presented with constipation and bloating. She was found to have an extrinsic mass compressing the rectosigmoid junction. Subsequent diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a large lesion involving the sigmoid colon, and resection with primary anastomosis was performed using the laparoscope. Final pathology revealed benign endometrioma. The patient did well, was discharged on postoperative Day 3, and has had no further complaints. As this case shows, laparoscopy can be beneficial in both the diagnosis and treatment of patients with intestinal endometriosis.
