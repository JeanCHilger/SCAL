Basal and stimulated secretion of cytokines by peritoneal macrophages in women with endometriosis. To evaluate basal (constitutive) and stimulated synthesis of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10 by peritoneal macrophages (PM) in women with endometriosis.Peritoneal macrophages were cultured in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 hours. Peritoneal fluids (PF) and PM supernatants were assayed for cytokines using ELISA.Institute for the Study and Treatment of Endometriosis and university-based research laboratories.Fertile controls undergoing tubal ligation (n = 8) and women with endometriosis (n = 17).Peritoneal fluid samples were obtained at the time of diagnostic laparoscopy (endometriosis group) or laparoscopy for tubal ligation both were performed in the midluteal phase of the cycle.Both basal and LPS stimulated production of TNF alpha, IL-8, and IL-10 by the PM were elevated significantly in women with endometriosis as compared with the fertile controls.This study demonstrated that cytokines TNF alpha, IL-8, and IL-10 are synthesized at greater than normal levels by basal and stimulated PM from women with endometriosis. The levels of TNF alpha and IL-8 correlated with the levels in the PF, suggesting that PM are the principal source of these cytokines in the PF.
