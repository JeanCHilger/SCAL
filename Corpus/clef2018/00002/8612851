Epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. To determine and compare the concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) in the peritoneal fluid of women with and without endometriosis.Prospective study.Tertiary care center affiliated with university medical school.Forty-two women with endometriosis and 34 women without endometriosis confirmed by laparoscopy.Epidermal growth factor and basic FGF concentrations were determined by highly sensitive enzyme immunoassays using monoclonal antibodies.Approximately 50% of the PF samples had EGF concentrations of > 0.4 pg/mL (conversion factor to SI unit, 0.17) and 90% had basic FGF concentrations of > 1 pg/mL (conversion factor to SI unit, 0.058). Concentrations of EGF or basic FGF in PF did not differ significantly between the two groups. In normal women, there was a significant correlation between EGF and basic FGF during the luteal phase. In women with endometriosis, EGF levels were higher during the luteal phase, but there was no correlation of either EGF or basic FGF levels with the severity of endometriosis.The concentrations of EGF and basic FGF were highly variable in the PF of women with or without endometriosis and did not differ significantly. The concentrations were so low that neither EGF nor basic FGF in PF could bind to its receptor.
