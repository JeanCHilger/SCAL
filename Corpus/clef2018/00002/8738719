Expression of gamma delta T cells and adhesion molecules in endometriotic tissue in patients with endometriosis and adenomyosis. Are T cell subsets including gamma delta T cells. HLA antigens or adhesion molecules, expressed in eutopic and ectopic endometria in patients with endometriosis and adenomyosis?Subjects consisted of 23 patients with adenomyosis and 21 patients with endometriosis. Controls consisted of 15 patients with adenomyoma and 42 infertile women without habitual abortion and autoimmune diseases. Staining of the glandular cells in eutopic and ectopic endometria or T lymphocyte subsets or macrophages in the stroma were analyzed immunohistochemically to localize the expression of the antigens.Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly increased expression of the antigens, particularly of the number of gamma delta T cells in the stroma and adhesion molecules and HLA antigens on the glandular cells in eutopic and ectopic endometria, compared with materials from patients with adenomyoma and infertile patients.It is likely that three distinct pathways of cell-cell interactions are activated in patients with endometriosis or adenomyosis.
