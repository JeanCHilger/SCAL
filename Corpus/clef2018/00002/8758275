Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary. To determine the expression of EGFR expression in endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary and its relationship to clinicopathologic features and prognosis.Expression of EGFR oncoprotein was studied by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from 28 patients with endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary.Tissues from 13 patients (46.4%) were stained positively with EGFR polyclonal antibody (1005). The staining was membranous and/or cytoplasmic. There was no relationship between EGFR expression and age at diagnosis, preoperative CA125 titer, clinical stage, histologic grade, and lymph node metastases. A higher expression rate was observed in patients with residual tumors (56.3% versus 33.3%). The mortality rate was higher in patients with EGFR expression than in those without EGFR expression (46.2% versus 14.3%), but the difference was not statistically significant.EGFR expression was not related to the clinicopathologic features in endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary, but was related to the poor prognosis of this disease.
