Endometrial progesterone receptors and markers of uterine receptivity in the window of implantation. To compare the expression of endometrial P receptors (PR) levels with markers of endometrial receptivity during the window of implantation.Prospective, controlled study to examine endometrial PR and three cycle-specific integrins in endometrial biopsies obtained during the window of implantation.An academic teaching hospital.One hundred seventy-five endometrial biopsies from regularly cycling women with luteal phase defect (LPD group 1Immunohistochemical staining intensity of each antigen using the semi-quantitative grading system (HSCORE), compared using analysis of variance with Scheffe's correction.Among the five groups studied, nuclear PR expression was significantly elevated in glandular epithelial cells from tissue samples with histologic delay > or = 3 days consistent with luteal phase deficiency (LPD group 1). Failure of PR down-regulation was associated with aberrant alpha v beta 3 integrin expression. Medical correction of LPD was associated with return of normal endometrial histology, normal integrin expression, and the loss of epithelial PR, similar to controls. The other two cycle-dependent integrin markers, alpha 1 beta 1 and alpha 4 beta 1, were not different between groups. In women with aberrant alpha v beta 3 and "in phase" endometrium, epithelial PR expression was not different from controls.The establishment of normal endometrial receptivity appears to be tightly associated with the down-regulation of epithelial PR. Histologic delay, consistent with LPD, is associated with a failure of PR down-regulation and the lack of normal markers of endometrial receptivity. Occult uterine receptivity defects (aberrant beta 3 expression in otherwise normal histology) are regulated differently, suggesting alternate mechanisms also exist which influence endometrial receptivity.
