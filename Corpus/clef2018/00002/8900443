PGE2 and PGF2 alpha release by human peritoneal macrophages in endometriosis. To test for differences in the amount and activity of peritoneal macrophages present in the peritoneal fluid of women with, and without endometriosis using prostaglandin release by macrophages in culture as a marker.Women of reproductive age undergoing laparoscopy for infertility or chronic pelvic pain with postoperative diagnosis of endometriosis and women undergoing laparoscopy for sterilization.Peritoneal fluid was aspirated during laparascopy, volume was recorded, macrophages were isolated via a Ficoll Paque gradient and kept in primary culture. PGE2 and PGF2 alpha release of the cells were measured before and after stimulation with zymosan.Women with endometriosis had significantly more peritoneal macrophages than controls. Peritoneal macrophages of women with endometriosis released significantly more PGE2 than those of the control group: 8.4 +/- 2.0 versus 1.4 +/- 0.4 ng/ml/10(6) cells (mean +/- SEM, p = 0.0005) and PGF2 alpha: 10 +/- 4.3 (endometriosis) versus 1.8 +/- 0.4 (control) ng/ml/10(6) cells (mean +/- SEM, p = 0.045).There is a significant increase in the amount of prostaglandins released by peritoneal macrophages from women with endometriosis. These prostaglandins might alter uterine and tubal contractility, thereby affecting fertility.
