AGUS in cervical endometriosis. To evaluate cervical endometriosis as a source of abnormal glandular cells in cervicovaginal smears.Histologically documented cases of cervical endometriosis with concurrent cervicovaginal smears were reviewed. The cytologic specimens were evaluated for the presence of glandular abnormalities.There were eight cases of superficial endometriosis (five of which had concurrent tuboendometrioid glandular metaplasia) and two cases of deep endometriosis in this series. Five of the eight cases of superficial endometriosis had abnormal glandular cells in the smears neither of two cases of deep endometriosis had glandular abnormalities. Four of the eight cases of superficial endometriosis had previously undergone conization for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (squamous intraepithelial lesion [SIL]) and were being monitored for recurrence. Of the five cases of atypical glandular cells of unknown significance (AGUS), one case had concurrent high grade CIN (SIL). Another case was originally misinterpreted as recurrent glandular dysplasia.Physicians monitoring patients after treatment for CIN need to be aware that endometriosis and tuboendometrioid metaplasia may be the source of atypical glandular cells and on occasion may be subject to misinterpretation.
