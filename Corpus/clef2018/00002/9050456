Laparoscopic excision of endometriosis with 3-mm scissors: comparison of operating times between sharp excision and electro-excision. To determine if laparoscopic excision of endometriosis by electrosurgery is more rapid than by sharp dissection, a retrospective comparative study was made of operative times for the two procedures. Median operating times for laparoscopic electro-excision of endometriosis were 26% to 49% faster than excision by sharp dissection. A chi2 analysis of the frequency counts of surgical intervals, and disease stage revealed this difference to be statistically significant and not due to acquired experience or differences in extent of disease in the two groups. The reduction in operating time achieved with monopolar electro-excision seems primarily associated with a more rapid cutting action with simultaneous coagulation of bleeders.
