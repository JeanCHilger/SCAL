Molecular analysis of synchronous uterine and ovarian endometrioid tumors. The presence of simultaneous carcinomas involving both the ovary and uterine corpus presents a diagnostic challenge, particularly if the tumors have a similar histology. The classification of these lesions as either two separate primary tumors, or as a single primary tumor with a metastasis has significant implications with respect to patient prognosis and recommendations for therapy. Although several morphologic criteria have been proposed as guidelines for the classification of these lesions, certain cases remain difficult to confidently classify. The application of current molecular biology techniques to pathological specimens can provide genetic information than can be helpful in establishing the relationship between synchronous neoplasms. Specifically, the use of tissue microdissection and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA can be helpful. In this study we used polymorphic DNA markers on chromosomes 17q21.3-22 and 11q13 to study loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 13 patients who presented with endometrioid tumors in both the uterus and ovary. Ten of the 13 cases showed LOH in one or both tumors. In eight of the 13 cases the detected LOH either chromosome 17q21.3-22 or 11q13 occurred selectively in only one of the two tumor sites. The results of this study suggest that the eight cases with LOH selective for one tumor site represent patients with two separate primary tumors. Molecular analysis may be useful in determining the relationship of synchronous uterine and ovarian endometrioid neoplasms.
