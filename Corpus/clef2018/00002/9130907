Microlaparoscopy: a comparative study of diagnostic accuracy. To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of microlaparoscopy in comparison to laparoscopy with a standard 10-mm laparoscope.Prospective evaluation by two independent observers.Academic Medical Center.Ten patients scheduled to undergo diagnostic laparoscopy for the indications of infertility and/or chronic pelvic pain.Two surgeons were present for each operation. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed using the Microlap 2-mm laparoscope (Imagyn Medical Inc., Lagun Niguel, CA). Standard diagnostic laparoscopy was then performed using a 10-mm laparoscope. After each procedure, each surgeon reported his or her observations in a confidential manner to a third person to record.Endometriosis and adnexal adhesions were staged. Observations made with the microlaparoscope were compared with those obtained with a standard 10-mm laparoscope for each surgeon. The observations of both surgeons were also compared with each other's to evaluate interobserver differences.Operative findings reported by each individual surgeon using the microlaparoscope correlated with the operative findings reported using the larger laparoscope. Scores for both endometriosis and adnexal adhesions did not differ in any significant way. Endometriosis scores differed by no more than 6 points, and adhesion scores differed by no more than 2 points, with no subsequent change in severity classification for either finding. Furthermore, when comparing the additional operative findings of the two surgeons, no difference was noted when using either the microlaparoscope or a standard 10-mm laparoscope.The diagnostic accuracy achieved with microlaparoscopy is comparable to that achieved with standard 10-mm laparoscopy.
