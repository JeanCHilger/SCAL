Management of benign adnexal masses by vaginal route. Until recently, surgical treatment of a benign adnexal mass implied a laparotomy. In recent years, the development of laparoscopic surgery, as well as ultrasound-guided aspiration techniques, have significantly modified the treatment options for these patients. These procedures have shown considerable advantages. They have reduced surgical trauma and have shortened the hospital stay. We present the results of our experience on the feasibility of a trans-vaginal surgical approach for the removal of benign adnexal masses. This technique, using traditional and cheap surgical instruments, allows the surgeon to excise benign adnexal masses, by entering the peritoneum through the posterior vaginal fornix and thus avoids the trauma of laparotomy. Fifty-four patients were operated on by this technique at our Department. The mean age was 39 years (range 21-66). In all cases, the operation was completed by the trans-vaginal approach. The median operative time was 30 minutes (range 20-45), and no blood transfusion was needed. The pathological diagnoses were as follows: functional ovarian cyst 19, endometriotic cyst
