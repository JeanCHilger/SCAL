Correlation of basal menses CA-125 levels and 6 month pregnancy rates in women undergoing treatments for infertility without assisted reproductive methods. The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation of menstrual CA-125 levels with pregnancy rates (PRs) after 6 months of treatment for infertility.The sample consisted of a heterogenous group of 160 women who sought treatment for infertility. Treatments include progesterone supplementation, donor insemination, intrauterine insemination, and ovulation induction therapy. No laparoscopies were done during the study period. A baseline CA-125 level was drawn during menses before the initiation of therapy. Patients were followed for 6 months of treatment or until a pregnancy was achieved.There was no difference in the 6 month PR or viable PR by CA-125 level.Elevated CA-125 levels are not predictive of poor fertility potential at least during the first 6 months of infertility therapy. Even though these higher levels sometimes suggest that endometriosis is present, the data suggest that correction of male factor, cervical factor or ovulation factor provides effective PRs without the need for laparoscopic intervention.
