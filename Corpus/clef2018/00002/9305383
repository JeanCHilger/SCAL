Cytologic study of ascites and the endometrium in ovarian carcinoma. Clinical significance. To ascertain the usefulness of endometrial cytology with ovarian cancers when examining extension of the disease and to analyze significant factors associated with migration of ovarian cancer cells into the uterine cavity.Cytologic results on ascites and the endometrium were analyzed in 87 patients with primary ovarian cancer in the absence of metastasis to the endometrium or cervicovagina.Positive results for cytology were found in 62/87 of ascites cases (71.3%) and in 20/87 endometrium cases (23.0%). The 15 cases (15/62 or 24.2%) positive for ascitic and endometrial cytology, divided clinically into stage III (6 cases) and stage IV (9 cases), were classified histologically as serous, 7 cases mucinous, 2 casesPapillae with basement membrane material in the cores may be structurally associated with migration of ovarian cancer cells into the uterine cavity, especially in clear cell carcinomas. Cytologic positivity of the endometrium and ascites significantly correlated with ascitic volume.
