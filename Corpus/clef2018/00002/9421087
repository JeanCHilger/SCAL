Telomerase expression in normal endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrial adenocarcinoma. Telomerase activity has been detected in a broad range of human cancers and its expression could be an important step in tumor progression. Here, telomerase activity by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol in cases of benign endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrial adenocarcinoma was tested. Telomerase expression was detected in 13 of 14 cases of proliferative phase endometrium, in 7 of 12 cases of secretory phase endometrium, but was not detected in any of 7 cases of atrophic endometrium. Three of three cases with evidence of luteal phase defect and one of four cases of chronic endometritis also expressed telomerase activity. Hyperplastic endometrium was positive for telomerase in 13 of 17 cases. Telomerase activity was detected in 40 of 48 cases of endometrial adenocarcinoma, which included 36 of 43 cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma and four of five cases of papillary serous carcinoma. The detection of telomerase in endometrial adenocarcinoma was not associated with either architectural grade, myometrial invasion, or stage. There was statistically significant association, however, between telomerase activity in benign atrophic endometrium versus any endometrial abnormality in women 52 years of age or older.
