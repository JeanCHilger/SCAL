The use of biochemical markers in the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate CA 125 II, C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) and anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) concentrations for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis. The study population consisted of 15 women without endometriosis, as confirmed by laparoscopy (group A), and 35 patients with pelvic endometriosis diagnosed by laparoscopy or laparotomy (group B). Group B patients were divided into those at stages I and II of the disease (BI/II) and those at stages III and IV (BIII/IV). Blood samples were obtained twice during the menstrual cycle: on day 1, 2 or 3 of the cycle and on day 8, 9 or 10 of the cycle. CA 125 II and CRP concentrations were higher in group III/IV patients compared with healthy controls, mainly during the first 3 days of the menstrual cycle SAA concentrations were also higher in this group of patients compared with healthy controls, but only during the first 3 days of the menstrual cycle. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M aCL concentrations were higher in all patients with endometriosis compared with healthy controls, mainly during the first 3 days of the menstrual cycle. It is concluded that these determinations may contribute to the diagnosis and the indication of treatment for pelvic endometriosis. Determination of CA 125 II concentrations at the beginning of the menstrual cycle may aid the diagnosis of stage III and IV endometriosis. IgM aCL appears to be associated with the presence of all stages of the disease, while SAA values are elevated in severe situations. Measurement of these molecules may therefore provide a valuable tool in the diagnosis and management of endometriosis.
