Conservative management of post-operative peritoneal cysts associated with endometriosis. To describe the usefulness of fine-needle aspiration cytology and drainage, followed by long-acting GnRH-agonist therapy in the management of post-operative peritoneal cysts with endometriosis.In six women who were diagnosed as having post-operative peritoneal cysts with endometriosis, fine-needle aspiration cytology and drainage was performed. Thereafter, four patients were treated with long-acting GnRH-agonists for 6 months. Two patients refused the treatment.In all patients fine-needle aspiration yielded specimens which consisted of a population of mesothelial cells. The mean follow-up time was 4 years (range 3.5-5). The four patients treated with long-acting GnRH-agonists show no evidence of recurrence. In two patients who had no additional treatment, the recurrence of the cyst was noted 2 months and 5 months after the drainage.Combination of fine-needle aspiration cytology and drainage and subsequent long-acting GnRH-agonist therapy can be a useful conservative management of post-operative peritoneal cysts associated with endometriosis.
