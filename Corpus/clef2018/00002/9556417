Analysis of human papillomavirus infection and molecular alterations in adenocarcinoma of the cervix. Although molecular alterations involved in the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix have been extensively described, these genetic changes have not been as well characterized in the development of cervical adenocarcinoma. Twenty-seven paraffin-embedded adenocarcinomas of the cervix, including three cases of adenoma malignum, were analyzed for molecular alterations associated with other gynecologic malignancies. The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using internally nested consensus primers. HPV types were identified by restriction endonuclease digestion of the PCR products, using DNA sequencing to confirm each digestion pattern. The presence of HPV was correlated with immunohistochemical expression of the p53 gene product, the presence of mutations in codon 12 of Ki-ras, and allelic deletion of markers associated with the development of other gynecologic carcinomas. HPV was identified in 16 (59%) of 27 cases, including type 18 in 7 tumors, type 16 in 7 tumors, and type 45 in 2 tumors. HPV types 16 and 45 were always identified in adjacent uninvolved cervical epithelium, but HPV type 18 was absent from the adjacent non-neoplastic epithelium in four of the seven positive cases. HPV was not identified in any of three cases of adenoma malignum. Diffuse immunohistochemical staining of the p53 gene product was present in only one (HPV-negative) tumor. A mutation in codon 12 of Ki-ras was observed in one endocervical adenocarcinoma (with an endometrioid pattern). Loss of heterozygosity was identified only for a marker on chromosome 6p in one mucinous endocervical carcinoma. Most endocervical adenocarcinomas lack molecular alterations characteristic of other histologically similar gynecologic malignancies, as well as those described in cervical squamous cell carcinomas.
