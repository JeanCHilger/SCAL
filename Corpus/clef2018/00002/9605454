Drastic elevation of serum CA125, CA72-4 and CA19-9 levels during menses in a patient with probable endometriosis. Levels of CA125, CA72-4 and CA19-9, serum markers for ovarian cancer, were measured throughout menstrual cycles in a patient with probable pelvic endometriosis. The patient had CA125 levels >1000 U ml(-1), CA72-4>10 U ml(-1) and CA19-9>150 U ml(-1) during but not after menses (P<0.01). In luteal phase and premenstrual phase, the levels of these markers seemed to return normal ranges, although CA125 remained over the upper normal limit. Knowledge that a physiological elevation of these markers may occur during menses might avoid misinterpretation.
