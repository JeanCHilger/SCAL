Expression of cadherins and CD44 isoforms in ovarian endometrial cysts. We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of cadherins and CD44 variants in 20 endometriomas, 20 cystadenomas, 20 borderline ovarian tumours as well as 20 ovarian carcinomas, and the serological and cystic fluid concentrations of soluble E-cadherin and soluble CD44 standard (sCD44sdt) in 20 endometriomas, 20 cystadenomas, six borderline and 11 carcinomas of the ovary. In endometriomas, immunostaining of E- and N-cadherin was negative (20 and 30% respectively). CD44 H, v3 and v6 immunostaining were detected in 63, 10 and 40% respectively. A difference in immunostaining for E-cadherin was found between endometriomas and cystadenomas (P < 0.001) and for N-cadherin between endometriomas and carcinomas (P < 0.001). A difference in CD44H immunostaining was observed between endometriomas and cystadenomas (P < 0.035) but not with borderline ovarian tumours and carcinomas. No difference in serum concentrations of soluble E-cadherins and CD44 standard was found between the four groups of tumours. Cystic fluid concentrations of E-cadherin were lower in endometriomas than in borderline tumours and ovarian carcinomas (P < 0.001). High concentrations of soluble CD44 standard cystic fluid were found in endometriomas than in other ovarian cysts. Endometriomas and borderline tumours share alterations of cadherins and CD44 isoforms which may help in the understanding of the aggressive and invasive potentials of endometriotic cells.
