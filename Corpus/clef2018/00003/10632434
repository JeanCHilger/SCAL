Vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-6 in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. To determine [1] vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis and compare them with those from oral contraceptive (OC) users and normal cycling women and [2] any correlation between VEGF and IL-6 concentrations.Controlled clinical study.University medical center.Patients undergoing laparoscopy for infertility or other benign gynecologic conditions.Peritoneal fluid samples were collected.Levels of VEGF and IL-6 in peritoneal fluid were determined.Compared with normal controls or women with less severe endometriosis (implant scores of 5 or less), women with more advanced endometriosis (implant scores of 6 or more) have elevated VEGF and IL-6 levels in peritoneal fluid. Compared with normal controls, markedly suppressed IL-6 but similar VEGF levels were found in peritoneal fluid from OC users. Neither VEGF nor IL-6 varied cyclically in normal women or those with endometriosis. There was no correlation between levels of VEGF and IL-6 in peritoneal fluid. There was no correlation between implant scores and VEGF or IL-6 levels.The inflammation associated with endometriosis, through increased levels of peritoneal fluid VEGF, may promote angiogenesis for the progressive growth of endometriosis. Effective treatment of endometriosis by combination estrogen-progestin pills may involve the suppression of such inflammatory responses.
