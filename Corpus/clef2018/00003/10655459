Adhesion of menstrual endometrium to extracellular matrix: the possible role of integrin alpha(6)beta(1) and laminin interaction. Previous in-vitro studies have shown that the endometrium preferentially adheres to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the amnion and peritoneum. This interaction probably involves adhesion molecules, e.g. integrins. We evaluated the expression of integrins in naturally shed menstrual endometrium and the adhesion pattern of this tissue to different components of the ECM. To identify integrins and matrix components involved, blocking studies were performed. Most of the 15 menstrual tissue samples showed positive staining for each of the integrins investigated, except alpha(4)beta(1). Compared with binding to collagen IV, which was set at 100%, adhesion to collagen I was 93% (not significant), to fibronectin 87% (P < 0.05), and to laminin 74% (P < 0.05). Scanning electron micoscopy showed that endometrium adhered to laminin but hardly spread, whereas spreading was observed when layered on the other coatings. Compared with the control (which was set at 100%), incubation with 4B4, a monoclonal antibody against the integrin beta(1) subunit, showed a significant reduction of adhesion (to approximately 50% P < 0.05) when layered on laminin and a smaller reduction (to 82-86%
