Adenomyosis with a sex cord-like stromal element. A case of adenomyosis with a sex cord-like stromal element is described. The element was an incidental, solitary, microscopic finding in a focus of adenomyosis. It was characterized by cord and trabecular arrangements of round to polygonal shaped cells in the endometrioid stroma. The cells were immunohistochemically positive for desmin and alpha-smooth muscle actin but negative for sex cord markers (alpha-inhibin and O13). The element appears to originate from the endometrial stromal cells through smooth muscle metaplasia.
