Peritoneal and peripheral B-1-cell populations in patients with endometriosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency of B-1 cells in the peritoneal cavity and peripheral blood of patients with endometriosis.We examined 31 patients with endometriosis and 14 normal nonpregnant women. Peripheral blood cells and peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) were stained with FITC or PE-labeled anti-CD5/CD19 monoclonal antibodies. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed using a flow cytometer. The significance of differences between the patient and control groups was determined by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test.There was no significant difference in the percentages of B-1 cells in the peripheral blood of women with and without endometriosis (median, 22.7% range, 4.7-92.3% vs median, 20.05%The peripheral B-1-cell population in patients with endometriosis is related to ANA production. B-1 cells might play important roles in the development of endometriosis through autoantibody production.
