Update on the medical treatment of endometriosis. The treatment of women with endometriosis can be a challenge. Therapeutic strategies must be tailored to the individual symptoms, age, and desire for fertility. Medical therapy continues to be based on endocrine treatment, such as oral contraceptives, progestins, danazol, and GnRH agonists. Unfortunately, recurrence rates are high after discontinuation of therapy. Recent clinical research on GnRH analogues plus add-back therapy has produced favorable results. Long-term treatment of patients using this approach has successfully reduced pain while minimizing symptoms of hypoestrogenism and adverse metabolic effects, such as loss of bone mineral density. Currently, GnRH analogues given with add-back therapy seems to be the most effective long-term approach to the treatment of symptomatic endometriosis. In the future, other modalities, such as medicated vaginal rings, inhibitors of steroidogenic enzymes, and GnRH antagonists, will most likely be options.
