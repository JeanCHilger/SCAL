Altered sensitivity to anti-endometriosis medicines in an adenomyosis patient with thyroid dysfunction. We report the rare case of a patient with adenomyosis who showed thyroid dysfunction of unknown etiology during treatment for endometriosis. She responded to nafarelin acetate and danazol when she was euthyroid but not to buserelin acetate when she was hyperthyroid. This suggests that the response to anti-endometriotic medicine in our patient was altered by impaired thyroid function and that this could occur in other such patients.
