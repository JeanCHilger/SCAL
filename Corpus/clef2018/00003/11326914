Expression of integrin beta 3 and intracellular adhesion molecule in endometrium and endometriotic tissue. To study the relationship between integrin beta 3, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and endometriosis.The expression of integrin beta 3 and ICAM protein were determined in 3 batches by immunoblotting method in 15 endometrium and 15 endometriotic tissues of patients with endometriosis and 30 endometrium from non-endometriosis subjects during the same menstrual phase. The results were scanned and semi-quantified, and then analysed by F test and t test.The results from 3 measurements showed the same trend. Endometrium from patients with endometriosis expressed significantly fewer integrin beta 3 and ICAM protein than those without endometriosis. On the other hand, the expression of integrin beta 3 in endometriotic tissue was significantly lower while the ICAM expression was significantly higher than those in controls.In patients with endometriosis, integrin beta 3 and ICAM expression changed significantly from eutopic to ectopic endometrium which may be related to the development of endometriosis and infertility.
