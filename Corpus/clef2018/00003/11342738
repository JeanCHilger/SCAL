Benign or malignant ovarian neoplasms and ovarian endometriomas. To investigate clinical features and biologic behavior of ovarian cancer that might be closely related to endometrioma and/or endometriosis.Retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).University hospital.All 324 women who were operated for endometriomas and/or ovarian tumors 5 cm or greater in diameter between January 1988 and December 1997.One hundred twelve women underwent laparoscopic surgery and 212 had laparotomy.All tissues were evaluated histologically. Clinical examinations including ultrasound and serum tumor makers were performed in all patients preoperatively. No malignancies were found at laparoscopic surgery (76 endometriomas, 36 ovarian tumors). The frequency of endometriosis in benign, borderline malignant, and malignant tumors was 9.7%, 12.5%, and 11.4%, respectively. Endometriosis was present most frequently (40%) in women with endometrioid adenocarcinoma. It was present in 81 patients with endometriomas and 25 with ovarian neoplasms. Of these, nine women (8.5%) had malignant tumors, including borderline malignancy. Among patients with malignant tumors, those without endometriosis were significantly older (mean +/- SD age 54.9 +/- 16.2 yrs) than those with endometriosis elsewhere in the pelvis (45.9 +/- 8.9 yrs).Endometriosis may be closely related to ovarian tumors such as endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Surgeons should be aware of this possibility, and candidates for laparoscopic surgery should be carefully selected based on preoperative evaluations.
