Hyperprolactinemia and luteal insufficiency in infertile patients with mild and minimal endometriosis. The objective of the present paper was to assess the presence of hormonal alterations in infertile women with stage I or II endometriosis (Group III, n = 20) compared to fertile women without endometriosis (Group I, n = 14) and to fertile women with endometriosis (Group II, n = 7). Serum levels of FSH, LH, estradiol, TSH, and PRL were measured between days 1 and 5 of the early follicular phase in the luteal phase, three serum samples were collected for progesterone measurement, and endometrial biopsies were performed. Serum estradiol levels were lower (p = 0.035) in infertile patients with endometriosis than in fertile patients without endometriosis. Six infertile patients with endometriosis presented prolactin levels above 20 ng/ml. This was not observed in the other groups. Luteal insufficiency was more frequent in infertile patients with endometriosis (78.9%) than in fertile patients with (42.9%) or without endometriosis (0%). In a multiple logistic regression analysis, only the presence of endometriosis and infertility was significantly associated with luteal insufficiency. The serum levels of LH, FSH, and TSH were not significantly different among the groups. Luteal insufficiency and altered prolactin secretion were associated with endometriosis, and could be important mechanisms causing infertility in this group of patients.
