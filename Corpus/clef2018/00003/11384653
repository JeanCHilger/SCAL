Vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-8 in ovarian cystic pathology. To determine the levels of the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin (IL-8) in ovarian cysts.Prospective descriptive study.University hospital.One hundred women, of whom 9 had ovarian carcinomas, 38 had ovarian endometriomata, 43 had serous ovarian cysts, and 10 had follicular ovarian cysts.Sampling of serum and ovarian cystic fluid before and during surgery.Levels of VEGF and IL-8 in cystic fluid and serum.Levels of both VEGF and IL-8 were found to be significantly higher in the cystic fluid of ovarian carcinomas and endometriomata than in serous and follicular cysts. In endometriomata fluid, levels of VEGF and IL-8 were found to be directly correlated (r = 0.68 P=.0074). Serum levels of VEGF were significantly higher in women with ovarian carcinomas and endometriomata than in those with serous and follicular cysts. Ovarian cancers and endometriomata were similar in terms of cystic concentrations of VEGF and IL-8 and in serum levels of VEGF.An increase in angiogenic factors that differentiate ovarian carcinomas and endometriomata from other kinds of ovarian pathology is demonstrated.
