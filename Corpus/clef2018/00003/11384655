A case of 46,X,der(X)(pter-->q21::p21-->pter) with gonadal dysgenesis, tall stature, and endometriosis. To report a case of 46,X,der(X)(pter-->q21::p21-->pter) with gonadal dysgenesis, tall stature, and endometriosis.Case report.A university hospital.A 20-year-old primary amenorrheal woman receiving estrogen-progestogen substitution.G-banding, comparative genomic hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and laparoscopy.A recombinant X chromosome, 46,X,der(X)(pter-->q21::p21-->pter), and pelvic endometriosis.The patient's chromosomal abnormality was misjudged by the use of G-banding as a distal part deletion of the long arm in one X chromosome. Comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses with locus-specific probes revealed 46,X,der(X)(pter-->q21::p21-->pter). The laparoscopic examination showed bilateral streak gonads and blue berry spots at the pelvic peritoneum, which were confirmed by evaluation of biopsy specimens.Recent advances of genetic strategies make it easy to determine karyotype and phenotype abnormalities. We have to keep our mind on the potential of endometriosis with patients who are receiving estrogen-progestogen substitution.
