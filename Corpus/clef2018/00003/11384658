Endometrial receptivity in terms of pinopode expression is not impaired in women with endometriosis in artificially prepared cycles. To assess endometrial receptivity in terms of pinopode expression in women with endometriosis.Prospective, observational study.Oocyte donation program at the Instituto Valenciano de Infertilidad.Twelve women with endometriosis as the only cause of infertility.Pinopode expression pattern analysis by scanning electron microscopy in two sequential endometrial biopsies obtained in the same cycle of each patient.Pinopode pattern and pregnancy rates.Pinopode expression in women with endometriosis did not differ from that of patients without endometriosis undergoing artificial cycles. Similarly, the clinical outcome in these women was comparable to that of the general population included in the oocyte donation program. The pregnancy rate per transfer was 46.7%.These results show that in women with endometriosis undergoing oocyte donation under hormone replacement therapy, pinopode expression is not altered, suggesting that endometrial receptivity in women with this disease remains unaltered.
