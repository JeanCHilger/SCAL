Localization of endothelial nitric oxide synthase messenger ribonucleic acid by in situ hybridization in ectopic endometrial tissue in patients with adenomyosis. This study was undertaken to determine the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA in ectopic endometrium in adenomyosis. Endothelial NOS mRNA expression was investigated by in situ hybridization using a human endothelial NOS RNA probe. The subjects comprised six cases of adenomyosis, and 14 women with normal fecundity as controls. Specific expression of endothelial NOS mRNA was found in glandular and surface epithelial cells in eutopic endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle in all groups. It is noteworthy that the expression of endothelial NOS mRNA was moderately positive in ectopic endometrial tissues in three of the six cases of adenomyosis. In conclusion, the endothelial NOS mRNA expression seen in the ectopic endometrium suggests a possible relationship with the various pathologies associated with adenomyosis.
