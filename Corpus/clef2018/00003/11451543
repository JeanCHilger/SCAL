Prognostic value of repeated serum CA 125 measurements in first trimester pregnancy. To assess the diagnostic value of maternal CA 125 in patients with symptomatic first trimester pregnancy and to evaluate the prognostic significance of CA 125 versus beta-hCG in early pregnancies with intact fetal heartbeat, complicated by vaginal bleeding.Two prospective open-label studies with longitudinal follow-up in the second trial.Academic Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Cologne.Study 1: 168 patients presenting between gestational weeks 6 and 12 with: extrauterine pregnancy, 29 missed abortion, 50Study 1: Single serum determinations of CA 125 and beta-hCG were correlated with the different disorders observed. Study 2: Two sequential measurements of serum CA 125 and beta-hCG performed within a 5-7 days interval were related to the outcome of pregnancy as indicated by changes of the ultrasound presentation, miscarriage, future hospitalization, or delivery.Study 1: Patients with vaginal bleeding generally had higher median CA 125 values (38 IU/ml range 1.3-540) compared to non-bleeding patients (17.8 IU/mlSingle serum measurements of CA 125 in symptomatic first trimester pregnant patients failed to discriminate spontaneous abortion, ectopic or normal pregnancies. However, sequential determinations of maternal CA 125 measurements appear to be a highly sensitive prognostic marker in patients with viable pregnancy at risk for abortion.
