P53 overexpression predicts endometrial carcinoma recurrence better than HER-2/neu overexpression. to investigate the prognostic value of p53 and HER-2/neu overexpression in endometrial cancer.p53 and HER-2/neu immunostaining was performed in 114 paraffin-embedded specimens of endometrial cancer diagnosed and treated between 1990 and 1997. Nuclear p53 and membrane HER-2/neu immunostaining were used.p53 and HER-2/neu overexpression was observed in 17 cases (14.9%) and in 19 cases (16.7%), respectively. In univariate analysis p53 (P<0.001) and HER-2/neu (P=0.018) overexpression had a positive correlation with a high risk of recurrence. In multivariate analysis, age (P<0.001), FIGO stage (P<0.001), differentiation (P=0.013), non-endometrioid subtypes (P<0.001) and p53 overexpression (P<0.001), but not HER-2/neu overexpression, were independent prognostic indicators of recurrence. Simultaneous p53 and HER-2/neu overexpression made worse the prognostic (P<0.001).p53 overexpression was an independent predictor of recurrent disease in endometrial cancer. HER-2/neu overexpression had a more limited effect but enhance the effect of p53.
