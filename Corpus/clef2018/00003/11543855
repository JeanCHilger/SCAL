Autoantibody studies of female patients with reproductive failure. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and character of autoimmune derangements in women with reproductive failure. A total of 108 females (age range 17-43, mean 27.5 years), including 16 with primary menstrual cycle disturbances and polycystic ovaries (PCO), 20 with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), 38 with endometriosis (E), and 34 with chronic anovulation, luteal phase insufficiency, subfertility or unexplained infertility (INF) were investigated. A control group of 392 women was formed from an unselected population sample (age range 17-43, mean 31.0 years). All sera were tested by indirect immunofluorescence method to assess common autoantibodies: nuclear (ANA), smooth muscle (SMA), parietal cell (PCA), thyroid microsomal (TMA), reticulin (ARA), mitochondrial (AMA) and liver/kidney microsomal autoantibodies (LKMA). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect antibodies against beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-beta 2GPI) and carbonic anhydrase (anti-CA). Our results showed that 40.7% of patients' sera and 14.8% of control sera contained one or more common autoantibodies, ANA and SMA were most frequently detected (difference between two groups P<0.005). Anti-beta 2GPI were found in eight cases (7.4%), including two patients with INF but without other autoantibodies. Anti-CA were revealed in nine cases (8.3%) including patients' PCOS, E and INF. A comparison of patients' clinical data with antibody assay results did not reveal any significant associations. Our results indicate a high prevalence of autoimmune reactions in women with reproductive failure due to the most common causes PCO, PCOS and E as well as in unexplained infertility. This might reflect the propensity to develop autoimmune reactions in such patients, including pathogenic autoimmune reactions to specific target antigens.
