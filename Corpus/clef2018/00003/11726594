Transvaginal colour Doppler in patients with ovarian endometriomas and pelvic pain. The aim of this investigation was to correlate ovarian endometrioma vascularization with the presence of pelvic pain.The presence of blood flow, peak systolic velocity (PSV, cm/s) and lowest pulsatility index (PI), assessed by transvaginal colour Doppler ultrasonography and CA-125 plasma concentrations, were retrospectively analysed in 74 patients who had undergone operations for cystic ovarian endometriosis. Fifty-two patients were asymptomatic (group A) and 22 presented with pelvic pain (group B). There were 56 endometriomas in group A and 26 in group B.Blood flow was found in 66.1 and 88.5% of endometriomas in groups A and B respectively (P = 0.036). PI was significantly lower (P = 0.009) and CA-125 concentration higher (P = 0.0004) in group B. There were no differences in PSV.We conclude that vascularization of ovarian endometriomas in patients presenting with pelvic pain is higher than in asymptomatic patients. This could be an indicator of endometriosis activity.
