Effect of interleukin-8 (IL-8), anti-IL-8, and IL-12 on endometrial cell survival in combined endometrial gland and stromal cell cultures derived from women with and without endometriosis. To study the affects of interleukin-8 (IL-8), anti-IL-8, and IL-12 on in vitro proliferation of endometrial cells.An in vitro study.Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Aberdeen, UK.Women attending a fertility clinic.In vitro cell cultures using culture media supplemented with IL-8 (100 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL, and 500 ng/mL), IL-12 (1 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL, and 25 ng/mL), and anti-IL-8 (0.1 microg/mL, 1 microg/mL, 10 microg/mL).In vitro survival of dispersed endometrial cells (combined epithelial and glandular) at 5 and 9 days of culture.There was a dose-dependent stimulatory effect of IL-8 on survival of cells. From women with and without endometriosis, IL-12 at 1 ng/mL significantly inhibited the survival of endometrial cells from women without endometriosis as compared with cells from women with endometriosis. At 1 microg/mL, anti-IL-8 significantly inhibited the survival of endometrial cells from women with endometriosis compared with cells from women without endometriosis on day 5 of culture.Our findings confirm the stimulatory effects of IL-8 and its possible role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The effects of IL-12 and anti-IL-8 on endometrial cell survival varied according to the disease state and the concentration of the cytokines. Future in vitro studies on the role of anti-IL-8 and IL-12 should aim to use a greater range of concentrations and a higher density of endometrial cells in cultures supplemented with monocytes.
