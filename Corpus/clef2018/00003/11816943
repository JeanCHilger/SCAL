Sigmoid occlusion due to endometriosis. A case report. The Authors report a case of sigmoid obstruction due to endometriosis and review the literature about. Unusual localisation and difficult preoperative differential diagnosis with IBD and bowel carcinoma are stressed. A 45-years old woman with previous history of oophorectomy was admitted at the hospital with symptomatic bowel obstruction. A barium enema showed a sigmoid stenosis thought to a carcinoma of bowel. A laparoscopic approach confirmed the diagnosis and a laparotomy was performed with a subsequent anterior resection (end-to-end anastomosis with stapler) plus myomectomy. The Authors do believed, during surgery, to be treating a carcinoma which disappeared with opening the specimen. The mucosa were intact and muscular layers so think to form a strong ring to be able to invaginate the upper colon for 3-4 cm. A stromal tumor was supposed and the definite diagnosis of endometriosis was very surprisingly. Intestinal resection to be necessary, with associated salpingo-oophorectomy and hysterectomy in older patients and treatment with oral contraceptive in younger female. Laparoscopy may be helpful in the diagnosis showing pelvic endometriosis with bowel wall involvement. Laparoscopic treatment in our opinion must be confirmed to particular situation and to well experience of surgeons.
