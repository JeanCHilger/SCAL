Analysis of genetic aberrations in uterine adenomyosis using comparative genomic hybridization. To use comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to analyzefrozen tissuesfrom adenomyosis cases to discover and map genomic regions for chromosomal gains and losses.In a retrospective study, upper and lower threshold values of 1.20 and 0.80, respectively, were used to define positive findings.No positive recurrent gene copy number alterations were detected in the 25 cases of pathologically proven adenomyosis.Although CGH is extremely useful in investigating candidate genes in the development of adenomyosis, CGH was not useful in this study. Genetic changes might be indeed extremely rare in adenomyosis, or CGH was not sensitive enough to detect candidate genes.
