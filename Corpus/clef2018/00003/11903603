Patterns of episialin/MUC1 expression in endometrial carcinomas and prognostic relevance. To investigate episialin/MUC1 expression in the normal, hyperplastic and neoplastic endometrium, and relate patterns of tumour MUC1 reactivity with histopathological characteristics, oestrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PR) status, bcl-2 and p53 oncoproteins and with clinical behaviour.We studied 42 normally cycling endometria, 45 endometrial hyperplasias of various forms, and 111 endometrial carcinomas of endometrioid and non-endometrioid cell types with specific monoclonal antibodies employing standard immunohistochemical techniques. The follow-up period ranged from 34 to 182 months with a median of 86 months. Epithelial mucin episialin/MUC1 was consistently expressed in the normal endometrium, following a cyclical pattern: "apical membrane staining" in early and mid-proliferative endometrium "purely cytoplasmic staining" in late proliferative endometriumEpisialin/MUC1 is an integral component of the normal premenopausal endometrium and is probably hormonally regulated. It is frequently expressed in endometrial hyperplasias and carcinomas. The loss of MUC1 expression from endometrial carcinomas is associated with a favourable prognosis.
