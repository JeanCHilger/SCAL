Steroid hormonal receptors, heat shock protein and p53 of endometrioid and clear cell cancers in different localization. Most endometrioid, well differentiated cancers are positive for ER and PgR.By using specific monoclonal antiER, PgR, p53 and hsp 90 antibodies, immunohistochemical reaction was used to study paraffin-embedded specimens from 53 patients with primary endometrioid and clear cell cancers.Most carcinomas with p53 overexpression showed no reactivities of ER and PgR.Presence of p53 and absence of steroid hormone receptors suggest a poor clinical prognosis for patients with endometrioid and clear cell cancers.
