A long-term follow-up study of women with asymptomatic endometriosis diagnosed incidentally at sterilization. To evaluate whether asymptomatic endometriosis diagnosed in connection with tubal sterilization is likely to cause symptoms later in the woman's life.Controlled, clinical follow-up study of women who were examined for endometriosis in connection with tubal sterilization performed between 1986 and 1989.University hospital.Thirty-nine women with mostly minimal endometriosis discovered at sterilization and 157 control women with no endometriosis discovered at sterilization.Interview in 2001 by a posted questionnaire.Report on pain, pelvic operations, menopausal status, and use of hormone replacement therapy.Pelvic pain was more frequently reported by controls than by women with endometriosis (28% vs. 6%). There was no significant difference between the groups concerning dysmenorrhea, premenstrual pain, or dyspareunia, nor was there any significant difference in the hysterectomy rate.There is little risk that asymptomatic, minimal endometriosis found incidentally will become symptomatic.
