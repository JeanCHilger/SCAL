Sigmoid endometriosis in a postmenopausal woman. Bowel obstruction resulting from endometriosis is an infrequently observed phenomenon in postmenopausal women. A 69-year-old woman without hormone replacement had clinical and radiologic findings consistent with a pelvic tumor invasive into the wall of the sigmoid colon. The patient underwent resection of the sigmoid colon and total hysterectomy. Histologic examination revealed endometrioma. This case documents the possible occurrence of symptomatic bowel endometriosis after years of a hormonally castrated state.
