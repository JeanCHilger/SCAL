Umbilical endometriosis without previous pelvic surgery: a case report. A 27-year-old woman with a periodically bleeding out of the umbilicus was found to have umbilical endometriosis. She was never pregnant before and had no pelvic surgery. The umbilical lesion was excised following a diagnostic laparoscopy revealing extragenital endometriosis. Umbilical endometriosis is a very rare disease, but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of umbilical lesions.
