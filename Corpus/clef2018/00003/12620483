Adhesion of endometrial cells labeled with 111Indium-tropolonate to peritoneum: a novel in vitro model to study endometriosis. To evaluate, in a new original in vitro assay, putative factors that could modulate the adhesion of endometrial cells to peritoneum.Prospective, controlled in vitro study.Academic research laboratory.Fourteen nonmenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy or laparoscopy for benign gynecologic indication.Endometrial cells obtained from women with regular cycles without endometriosis were labeled with 111Indium and confronted in vitro with mouse peritoneum in the presence of various cytokines and/or antiadhesive compounds.Radioactivity in 111Indium-labeled endometrial cells.The adhesion of human endometrial cells to mouse peritoneum was increased by treatment with pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF alpha, TGF-beta1). Whereas heparan sulfate had no effect on cell adhesion, a gel of ferric hyaluronate (Intergel) was able to counteract the pro-adhesive effect of cytokines. Interestingly, the pretreatment of peritoneum with cytokines, 24 hours before cell seeding in the presence of the ferric hyaluronate gel, restored the cytokine-promoting effect on cell adhesion.Proinflammatory cytokines promote the in vitro peritoneal adhesion of endometrial cells. An antiadhesive hyaluronate gel used in clinics decreases the adhesion in a dose-dependent manner and reduces cytokine bioavailability.
