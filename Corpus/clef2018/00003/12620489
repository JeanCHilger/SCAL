Cytokine regulation by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in human endometrial cells. To determine whether peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma ligands can affect the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cytokines related to the pathogenesis of endometriosis.In vitro study to determine whether PPARs are expressed in human endometrial cells and determine the effects of various PPAR-gamma ligands on IL-6 and other cytokine expression in these cells.Academic medical center.Women presenting for infertility workup.Endometrial cell cultures were treated with PPAR-gamma ligands.Interleukin-6, IL-8, colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and macrophage chemotactic factor (MCP-1) protein secretion, messenger RNA expression of IL-6, PPAR-alpha, -beta, and -gamma.Using a human endometrial cell line (EM42), as well as primary stromal and epithelial endometrial cells, we show the presence of PPAR-alpha, -beta, and -gamma by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in these cells. PPAR-gamma ligands stimulated IL-6 secretion and induced enhancement of IL-6 mRNA levels. These ligands also stimulated the secretion of IL-8 and CSF-1.PPAR-gamma may play a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis related to the production of IL-6 and some other cytokines.
