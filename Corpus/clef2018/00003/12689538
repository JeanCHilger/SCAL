Primary umbilical endometriosis--a rare variant of cutaneous endometriosis. A case of primary umbilical endometriosis is being reported here, who presented with a dark brown nodule on the umbilicus with black pigmentation around it for the last seven months, associated with cyclical pain and bleeding from the nodule. Wide local excision of the nodule, laparoscopic tubal ligation and visualization of pelvic cavity was performed, revealing no sign of pelvic endometriosis.
