Laparoscopic mobilization of the rectosigmoid and excision of the obliterated cul-de-sac. To evaluate the feasibility and surgical and clinical outcomes of laparoscopic excision of anterior recto-sigmoid wall endometriosis and en bloc dissection of the obliterated cul-de-sac.Retrospective cohort (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).University-affiliated teaching hospital.Eighty-one women with infertility and/or chronic pelvic pain. Intervention. Laparoscopic excision of all endometrial implants and uterosacral ligaments, and dissection of the cul-de-sac using a horseshoe-shaped approach to mobilize, but not resect, the rectosigmoid.Eleven women (24%) had endometriomas. Cumulative pregnancy rates in 34 women with primary infertility and 12 with secondary infertility were 62% and 42%, respectively. Eighty-eight percent of 61 women with pain reported significant improvement of symptoms.Laparoscopic excision of cul-de-sac and rectovaginal endometriosis by this approach is feasible and safe when performed by an experienced surgeon, and results in high rates of cumulative pregnancy and relief of pain. Some patient variables may give higher rates of success for pregnancy than others.
