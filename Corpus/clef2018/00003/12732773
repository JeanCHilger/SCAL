Chemically assisted dissection of tissues in laparoscopic excision of endometriotic cysts. To evaluate the capacity of chemical dissection of tissues using a mucolytic substance, Mesna, in improving laparoscopic excision of endometriotic cysts.Randomized, double-blind, controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification I).University-affiliated training hospital.Forty-four women with symptomatic ovarian endometriotic cysts. Intervention. Laparoscopic excision of endometriotic cysts in 22 women with the aid of Mesna solution and in 22 with the aid of saline solution.In comparison with saline solution, Mesna as a chemical dissector resulted in significant reductions in operating time, in difficulty encountered by the surgeon to enucleate the cysts, and in less bleeding. No differences were found in length of hospital stay, costs of surgeries, analgesic requirement, and fever. Postoperatively, patients treated with Mesna achieved more pregnancies than those treated with saline.Chemical dissection of tissues with Mesna proved to be a safe and suitable support in laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometriotic cysts.
