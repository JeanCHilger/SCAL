Isolated umbilical endometriosis--a rare finding. A 32 yr old multiparous Nigerian woman presented with histological confirmed umbilical endometriosis. There was no evidence of endometrotic deposits elsewhere. Apart from cyclical bleeding from the umbilicus, she was relatively free of any of the other signs and symptoms of Endometriosis. She had excision of the endometeriotic lesion and responded favourably to treatment. A high index of suspicion is required in making a diagnosis of endometriosis in remote extra pelvic sites especially with little or no characterisitic pointers to the disease.
