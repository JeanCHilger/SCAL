Detection of chronic endometritis by diagnostic hysteroscopy in asymptomatic infertile patients. Chronic endometritis has been related to infertility and recurrent abortion. It is usually asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is rarely clinically suspected. We performed a prospective study to evaluate both the role of diagnostic hysteroscopy in the detection of chronic endometritis in infertile patients and Chlamydia trachomatis is a potential etiologic factor. Fifty consecutive patients who sought treatment for infertility in a tertiary academic hospital were submitted to diagnostic hysteroscopy and an endometrial biopsy for histopathological study and for diagnosis of C. trachomatis by polymerase chain reaction. The patients' mean age was 33.7 +/- (SD) 5.4 years, and the duration of the couples' infertility ranged from 1 to 18 years. The overall prevalence of chronic endometritis was 12% (6 patients). Among all patients, no cases of chlamydial infection were detected by polymerase chain reaction. In the detection of chronic endometritis, with 95% confidence intervals, the hysteroscopy sensitivity was 16.7% (range 0.9-63,5%), the specificity was 93.2% (range 80.3-98.2%), the positive predictive value was 25% (range 1.3-78.1%), and the negative predictive value was 89.1% (range 65.6-95.9%). These data suggest that hysteroscopy is not useful in the screening for chronic endometritis in asymptomatic infertile women. Further studies are needed to establish the etiology of endometritis in infertile patients.
