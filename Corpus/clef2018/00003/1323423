An immunohistochemical study of ferritin in ovarian epithelial tumours. Ferritin in 93 ovarian epithelial tumors, 10 normal adult ovaries and 4 fetal ovaries were studied with double-PAP technique. Ferritin was demonstrated in 38.89% of the benign ovarian tumors, 46.67% of the borderline and 70.0% of the malignant tumors (P less than 0.05). The positive distribution of ferritin in the serous tumors was more than that in the mucinous and endometrioid tumor (P less than 0.05) and the positive grading of ferritin starring was corresponding to the pathohistopathologic grading of the ovarian tumors. It is considered that ferritin might be used as an immunohistochemical marker in the study of ovarian tumors.
