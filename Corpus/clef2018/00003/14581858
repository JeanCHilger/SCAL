Peritoneal fluid environment in endometriosis. Clinicopathological implications. Endometriosis is a puzzling disorder with obscure pathogenesis. The objective of this review was to evaluate the complex role of peritoneal fluid in the etiopathogenesis of endometriosis. Several studies suggest that peritoneal fluid is a key inflammatory environment associated with endometriosis. Many active substances (cytokines, growth factors, hormones and oxidative stress parameters) have been identified in endometriosis patients at different stages of the disease. Inflammatory mediators may be involved in the endometriosis associated-infertility and possibly pain. Furthermore, these mediators may represent a non surgical method for diagnosing endometriosis. Better understanding of the mechanism of cytokines, growth factor and reactive oxygen species production and detoxification and further investigation of their effects on the peritoneal fluid environment are essential to obtain new insight into this disease and eventually develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic remedies.
