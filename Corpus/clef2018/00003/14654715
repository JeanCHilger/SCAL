Expression of adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase in endometrial cancer. Association with tumor grade and CA-125. Adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase (A-LAP) is a novel zinc-metallopeptidase involved in angiotensin II (AngII) metabolism, cell migration and antigen presentation. These functions are implicated in the progression of cancer, whereas A-LAP expression and involvement have not been studied in any type of cancer. We investigated the expression of A-LAP in endometrial cancer as well as its association with angiogenesis and clinicopathological features. Immunohistochemical staining of 58 endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma specimens revealed that 37 were A-LAP immunoreactive. We also found that A-LAP staining correlated with histological tumor grade in a significant and reverse manner. In addition, serum CA-125 levels in patients with A-LAP positive cancers were significantly higher. However, contrary to our hypothesis that A-LAP suppresses angiogenic activity via AngII metabolism, A-LAP expression was not associated with the microvessel count determined by CD34 immunostaining. Our results suggest that A-LAP is involved in endometrial cancer cell growth and differentiation. However, further studies, especially of the biological roles of A-LAP, are required to confirm this notion.
