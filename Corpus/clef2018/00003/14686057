Influence of sperm morphology on results of intrauterine insemination. To determine the influence of sperm morphology, according to WHO criteria, on pregnancy rates of couples who were submitted to intra-uterine insemination (IUI).Retrospective study that included 787 IUI cycles performed in the Instituto para el Estudio de la Concepci√≥n Humana in Monterrey, Mexico, from January to December 2002. Main diagnosis were anovulation, male factor, endometriosis, and cervical factor. All patients were allocated into a controlled ovarian hyperstimulation protocol with either clomiphene citrate, menotropins and/or recombinant FSH.A total of 115 pregnancies were achieved (pregnancy rate per cycle of 14.61%). When seminal parameters were analyzed as independent factors it was found that a motility less than 10%, total motile count after sperm preparation less than 1 million/ml and sperm motility less than 20% had a pregnancy rate of zero.Patients with normal sperm forms less than 20% according to WHO criteria have no benefit with the IUI and these patients should be canalized to ART.
