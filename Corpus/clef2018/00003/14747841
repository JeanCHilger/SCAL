Endometriosis: a genetic disease. Endometriosis is a multifactorial disease affecting up to 15% of women of reproductive age. This condition is characterized by the presence and growth of endometrial cells outside the uterus. Susceptibility to endometriosis depends on complex interactions of immunologic, hormonal, environmental and genetic factors. Although familial inheritance plays a role, multiple candidate genes appear to be involved. New studies investigating the influence of genetic variants on endometriosis are published with increasing frequency. A number of technologies have emerged to facilitate progress in this field, including subtractive cDNA hybridization to identify secretory endometrial genes, DNA chip technology, differential display polymerase chain reaction, cytogenetics evaluation of endometriotic cells and tissues, and complementary methods in proteomics and informatics. One general approach to uncovering genes pivotal to endometriosis is to search systematically for perturbations in selective candidate genes or chromosomal regions using polymerase chain reaction. We describe here novel association studies on obvious candidates, including genes governing cancer susceptibility, hormone sensitivity or immunology. The assessment of mutations and polymorphisms may allow individualization of therapies as well as primary and secondary prevention strategies for endometriosis, aimed at high-risk populations.
