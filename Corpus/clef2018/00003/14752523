Analysis of HER-2/neu amplification in endometrial carcinoma by chromogenic in situ hybridization. Correlation with fluorescence in situ hybridization, HER-2/neu, p53 and Ki-67 protein expression, and outcome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the most widely used technique to detect HER-2/neu gene amplification however, it is only available in some institutions. In contrast, chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) can be evaluated by routine light microscopy. In endometrial carcinoma there are few data concerning HER-2/neu status and prognosis. Therefore, we determined HER-2/neu gene status by CISH using a digoxigenin-labelled probe on 60 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded endometrial carcinomas. The data were compared with the immunohistochemistry of HER-2/neu (A0485, TAB250), p53, Ki-67, clinicopathological factors, and survival. By conventional light microscopy, HER-2/neu amplification (>/=6 copies >50% cancer cells) was detected in 14% (8/59) tumours, HER-2/neu overexpression (>10% cells moderate/strong complete membrane staining) in 22% (13/60) for A0485, and 18% (11/60) for TAB250, p53 (>10% +cells) in 61% (36/59), and Ki-67 (>50% +cells) in 50% (30/60). Discordant cases for CISH and immunohistochemistry, as well as all (2+) were further analysed by FISH (Vysis). Among 10 cases (2+) and not amplified by CISH, two showed low-level amplification by FISH. Significant correlation was found between amplification and protein overexpression (P</=0.001), and a trend with nonendometrioid type, higher grade, and older age. A better outcome (Kaplan-Meier) was observed for patients with nonamplified (1-5 copies per nucleus) or low-level (6-10 copies) amplification tumours, low Ki-67 expression, age <50 years, endometrioid type, low FIGO (International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology) grade and stage, superficial myometrial infiltration, and no lymph-vascular invasion (P</=0.036), but only as a trend for HER-2/neu protein negative (P=0.13). Cox analysis revealed age, FIGO grade and stage, myometrial infiltration, and lymph-vascular invasion to be independent prognostic factors (P</=0.05), and a trend for HER-2/neu gene copy number (0.18). In endometrial carcinoma, HER-2/neu gene status can be readily assessed by CISH in routine clinical practice, and it gives more prognostic information than HER-2/neu by immunohistochemistry. FISH analysis in (2+) cases but negative by CISH may detect additional tumours with low-level amplification.
