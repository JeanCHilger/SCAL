Ovarian steroid receptor expression in endometriosis and in two potential parent epithelia: endometrium and peritoneal mesothelium. Endometriosis is an oestrogen dependent condition and it is expected that the tissue of origin of endometriosis will express receptors for the ovarian steroids. Two epithelia, endometrium and peritoneal mesothelium, are the potential parent epithelium. Oestrogen and progesterone receptor expression has been studied immunohistochemically in (i) timed endometrial biopsies from 25 normal subjects and 27 patients with endometriosis, (ii) 25 endometriotic biopsies and (iii) 42 peritoneal biopsies. Endometrium but not peritoneal mesothelium expresses both oestrogen and progesterone receptors. No difference in the intensity of staining between endometria of normal subjects compared with the endometria of patients with endometriosis was noted. In paired endometrial and endometriotic biopsies, the intensity of staining for the oestrogen receptor in stromal cells and for the progesterone receptor in both glandular and stromal cells was less in the endometriotic biopsies. These data provide circumstantial evidence for an endometrial origin for endometriosis although quantitative differences exist in receptor expression between endometrium and endometriosis.
