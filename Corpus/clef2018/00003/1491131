Immunologic aspects of endometriosis. Endometriosis is thought to result from implantation of endometrial tissue swept back into the pelvic cavity during menstruation, or from coelomic metaplasia of the peritoneum. Yet not all women with menstrual reflux develop endometriosis. The authors present and analyse the arguments in favour of immune system involvement in the physiopathology of this frequent disease. A knowledge of the antigens that have been recognized and of the operative mechanisms will probably make it possible to understand better the repercussions of endometriosis on fertility, to develop diagnostic methods less traumatic than those available at present and to modulate treatments and improve their effectiveness.
