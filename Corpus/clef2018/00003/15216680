Extragenital endometriosis as a subject of interest for the surgeon. Endometriosis is a common gynaecological disorder, affecting 10-15% of the fertile female population. Most frequently, it affects internal genitalia, the main symptoms being pelvialgia and infertility. In 5% of the cases the disorder may also affect extragenital structures and present itself as endometriomas of the appendix, the small or the large intestine, the umbilicus, the inguinal canal, the residual scars after laparotomies or the diaphragm. They may also imitate a malignancy. The diagnostic key is the cyclic character of the pain or of the bleeding to the tract and the laparoscopic confirmation of the presence of the foci. When the diagnosis is known, a simple excision, extirpation or resection suffices. In case the malignancy cannot be excluded, a more extensive procedure is indicated. The authors present two case-reviews during a twelve-year period, in both cases the sigmoid was affected. In the first case, a radical resection of the rectosigmoid due to a suspected malignancy was performed, while in the second case, a simple excision of the endometrioma where the diagnosis was known was performed. The authors stress-out advantages of the interdisciplinary approach to the treatment of the complicated cases of endometriosis, so that the disorder would be solved in one surgical procedure.
