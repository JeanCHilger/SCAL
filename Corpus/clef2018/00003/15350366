Overexpression of HER-2/neu is not a risk factor in ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma. To evaluate the significance of the expression of HER-2/neu as a prognostic factor, we retrospectively examined its overexpression rates chiefly in ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCA) and their relationships with FIGO stage, lymph node metastasis, and prognosis.In addition to 90 specimens of CCA (stage I, 52 stage II, 7The rate of HER-2/neu overexpression in CCA was 45.6% (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+ in 14, 35, 36, and 5 cases, respectively), and no differences in the overexpression rate were noted among histologic types: 52.7% in S, 42.1% in M, and 26.4% in E. In CCA, no association was observed between HER-2/neu overexpression and cumulative survival rate (P = 0.5708), FIGO stage (P = 0.5147), or lymph node metastasis (P = 0.3624).The absence in CCA of an association between HER-2/neu overexpression and outcome, stage, or lymph node metastasis indicates that HER-2/neu overexpression is not a prognostic risk factor.
