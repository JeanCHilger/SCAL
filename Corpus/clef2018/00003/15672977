Endometriosis and ovarian dysgenesis: a case report. The pathogenesis of endometriosis remains unclear. The latest studies have integrated information which clarify various aspects, but the data remain incomplete. The term "ovarian dysgenesis" represents a wide variety of syndromes, in which Turner syndrome is the most prevalent. The coexistence of endometriosis and Turner syndrome is extremely rare, and therefore poses certain questions on the mechanisms of endometriosis. We present a case of a 33-year-old woman with Turner syndrome, primary amenorrhea and menopausal hormonal profile in which peritoneal endometriosis (white opacification type) was revealed laparoscopically.
