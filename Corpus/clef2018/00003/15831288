Basal release of urokinase plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and soluble plasminogen activator receptor from separated and cultured endometriotic and endometrial stromal and epithelial cells. To investigate whether separated and cultured endometriotic and endometrial stromal and epithelial cells release urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and soluble plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) antigens in vitro.In vitro study.University hospital clinic.Regularly menstruating women with and without endometriosis.Tissue samples were collected at surgery performed for clinical reasons.The antigen concentrations of uPA, PAI-1, and suPAR in culture medium were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Both stromal and epithelial cells from endometriotic and endometrial tissue released the three types of antigens, but the release of PAI-1 was significantly higher from stromal cells in the three types of tissue than from epithelial cells. Furthermore, the release of PAI-1 was significantly higher from endometriotic cells than from endometrial stromal cells.This study has demonstrated the basic capacity of separated epithelial and stromal cells from all three types of tissue to release uPA, PAI-1, and suPAR without any paracrine influence, as in vivo. The higher release of PAI-1 from endometriotic stromal cells might have importance for the invasive growth.
