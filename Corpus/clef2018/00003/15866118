Immunohistochemical expression of p53, MDM2, and p21Waf1 oncoproteins in endometriomas but not adenomyosis. p53, MDM2, and p21Waf1 are oncoproteins that regulate the cell cycle. The purpose of this study was to examine the distribution of p53, MDM2, and p21Waf1 oncoprotein expression in endometriomas and in adenomyosis.Tissue samples from 25 women with pathologically confirmed endometriomas and 31 women with pathologically confirmed adenomyosis were analyzed. Expression of p53, MDM2, and p21Waf1 oncoproteins was assessed by immunohistochemical nuclear staining.p53, MDM2, and p21Waf1 expression were detected in 20%, 60%, and 80% of endometrioma tissue samples, respectively. All endometrioma tissue samples expressing p53 also tested positive for both MDM2 and p21Waf1. MDM2 expression was significantly higher in the proliferative than in the secretory phase of the cycle. In contrast, all 31 adenomyosis tissue samples were negative for p53, MDM2, and p21Waf1 expression.The expression of p53, MDM2, and p21Waf1 suggests a role for these oncoproteins in the regulation of endometrioma cell growth, but not in adenomyosis.
