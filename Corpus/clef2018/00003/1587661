Dysplastic nevi, cutaneous melanoma, and gynecologic disorders. We compared the frequency of reproductive system diseases and disorders among 206 female patients with dysplastic nevi (DN), and/or melanoma, in comparison with random samples of women of comparable age without melanoma. The highest odds ratio (OR) for these age-related diseases and reproductive disorders occurs among the youngest age group of the patients with DN alone (mean age 35.1 +/- 1.2 yr): 44.2% of the DN subjects had one or more reproductive disorders compared with 19.8% of the random sample (OR 3.2, 95% CL (1.6, 6.5), P less than 0.001). The patients with melanoma and DN (mean age 41.5 +/- 1.4 yr) also had a significantly greater percentage of subjects with one or more reproductive disorders, though less so than the DN subjects: 49.4% compared to 33.7% (OR 1.9, 95% CL (1.1, 3.3), P = 0.02).
