High serum levels of interleukin-6 in endometrial carcinoma are associated with uterine serous papillary histology, a highly aggressive and chemotherapy-resistant variant of endometrial cancer. To evaluate and compare autocrine expression and production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine involved in the resistance to cytotoxic agents and inhibition of anti-tumor immune function in endometrial carcinoma in vitro as well as in vivo.IL-6 gene expression levels were evaluated in twenty-four primary endometrial tumors including 14 endometrioid carcinomas (EC) and 10 uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USPC) as well as in normal control endometrial cells (NEC) by real-time PCR. Secretion of IL-6 protein by 6 primary endometrial tumor cultures including USPC and EC was measured using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in vitro. Finally, IL-6 concentration in 71 serum samples including 20 apparently healthy women, 19 women with benign abdominal diseases, 19 women with primary EC, and 13 USPC patients was studied.IL-6 gene expression levels were significantly higher in USPC when compared to EC (mean copy number by RT-PCR = 313 +/- 55 vs. 53 +/- 11, USPC vs. EC, respectively: P < 0.01). IL-6 serum concentrations between normal healthy females (range 0.01-21.23 pg/ml mean 3.1 pg/ml) and benign disease patients (range 0.01-95.77 pg/mlIL-6 is highly expressed in USPC, and it is released in high concentration in the serum of USPC patients. IL-6 may be a novel biomarker for USPC. Drugs used to inhibit the expression of IL-6 or the IL-6 signal transduction pathway may potentially be highly beneficial in USPC.
