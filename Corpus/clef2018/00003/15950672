Expression and regulation of CCR1 in peritoneal macrophages from women with and without endometriosis. CCR1 is a CC chemokine receptor with high affinity for RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted). CCR1 protein and mRNA concentrations in native peritoneal cells were twofold greater, in cultured peritoneal cells threefold greater, in patients with endometriosis compared to patients without endometriosis, as determined by Western blotting fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and in situ hybridization.
