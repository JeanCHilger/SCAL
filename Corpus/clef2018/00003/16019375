Vascular endothelial growth factor in the plasma, follicular fluid and granulosa cells of women with endometriosis submitted to in vitro fertilization--a pilot study. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic factor that is altered in endometriosis, supports the immunological mechanism involved in this disease. The aim of the present study was to assess VEGF concentration in the plasma, follicular fluid (FF) and culture medium (CM) of granulosa cells from patients with endometriosis submitted to in vitro fertilization (IVF). A case-control study was conducted on 14 patients with endometriosis and 14 women without endometriosis submitted to IVF. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and after administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), in addition to FF and CM samples. Plasma VEGF levels increased after hCG administration in women with endometriosis and in controls, but were significant only in controls. VEGF levels were lower in FF but were significantly increased in the CM of patients with endometriosis. There was no correlation between VEGF and age, response to ovarian stimulation, oocyte or embryo quality, and pregnancy result. The increase of VEGF levels after hCG in both groups demonstrated a positive effect of this hormone on VEGF. VEGF in the FF and CM presented opposite results in endometriosis, suggesting that granulosa cells may show a different behavior in vivo and in vitro.
