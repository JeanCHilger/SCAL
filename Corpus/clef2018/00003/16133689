Long-term effects on bone mineral density and bone metabolism of 6 months' treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues in Japanese women: comparison of buserelin acetate with leuprolide acetate. Our objective was to assess the effects of 6 months' treatment with two types of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues on lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolism. We studied 27 women who had been given a diagnosis of endometriosis or uterine myoma. The subjects received drug therapy for 6 months and were subsequently followed up for 1 year. The BMD of the lumbar spine (L2, L3, L4) was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry four times: at baseline, after 6 months, after 12 months, and after 18 months. The serum concentrations of sex steroids and bone metabolic markers were measured at the same times as BMD. Compared with the baseline value, the mean decrease in the buserelin group L2-4 BMD was 3.7% at 6 months, 1.7% at 12 months, and 0.4% at 18 months. In the leuprolide group, L2-4 BMD decreased respectively by 5.1%, 6.2%, and 4.3%. Serum concentrations of calcium increased significantly after 6 months of treatment (P < 0.05) and returned to the baseline level at 12 months in both groups. In the leuprolide group, the intact osteocalcin concentration after 6 months was significantly higher than the baseline value, and after 12 months, it decreased to the baseline level. Our results indicate that the effect on BMD of 6 months' treatment with GnRH analogues virtually resolves by 1 year after treatment, provided that drugs affecting bone metabolism are not given during this period.
