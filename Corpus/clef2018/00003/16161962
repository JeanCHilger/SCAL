Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs. Pituitary-gonadal axis activity depends on pulsative hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. Two groups of GnRH analogs, agonists and antagonists, are presently used for the treatment of clinical conditions in which modulation or interference with sex hormone production is beneficial. They are administered in assisted reproductive technologies to prevent premature luteinizing hormone surges during controlled ovarian stimulation. Due to an inhibitory effect on the growth of hormone-dependent tumors, GnRH analogs are used in the treatment of some cancers. In the present study we discuss in details both these applications. Moreover, we review the potential role of these agents in pharmacotherapy of endometriosis, uterine myomas and central precocious puberty. Based on the available literature we try to show their exact place in the medical therapy of gynecological disorders.
