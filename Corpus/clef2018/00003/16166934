Medical treatment of endometriosis. The medical treatment of endometriosis is a critical aspect of the therapeutic approach to this disease. This review will present an overview of current literature about the medical treatment of endometriosis, without referring to the surgical treatment or a combination of both. The main purpose of the current medical treatment of endometriosis is to create an amenorrheic state, in other words, to create a hypoestrogenic environment by suppressing estrogen secretion of the ovary. Current research has focused upon medications designed to attack specific aspects of the development and maintenance of endometriosis. This includes progesterone receptor modulators, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs, aromatase inhibitors and, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors and estrogen receptor beta agonists like inmunomodulators. These drugs show decreased spreading of lesions and reduced disease related symptoms. Medical treatment is moderately effective in reducing pain but ineffective in improving fertility a combination of medical treatment with assisted reproductive technology may be beneficial in improving fertility.
