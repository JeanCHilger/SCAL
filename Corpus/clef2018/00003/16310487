Bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation in a patient with cancer-associated retinopathy. To describe a patient with bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation (BDUMP) and cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR).Interventional case report.A 66-year-old woman developed progressive vision loss 4 months after total hysterectomy. Ophthalmologic examination, Western blot test of sera and aqueous humor, and immunohistochemistry of carcinoma cells were performed.Testing revealed BDUMP and severe retinal dysfunction. Autoantibodies against recoverin and heat shock cognate protein 70 (hsc 70) were detected in serum. Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for recoverin and hsc 70 was observed in endometrioid carcinoma cells.Simultaneous cases of BDUMP and CAR are rare. Aberrantly expressed recoverin and hsc 70 triggered serum autoantibody production, which caused photoreceptor degeneration.
