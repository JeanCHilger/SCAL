Is glycodelin an important marker of endometrial receptivity?. Glycodelin A (GdA) is viewed as a uterine endometrium receptivity marker. The expression of GdA in the endometrium is mirrored in uterine fluid and in the serum. Thanks to its immunosuppressive properties GdA might regulate mechanisms of fertilization, implantation and further development of the embryo.The authors assessed the GdA concentration during implantation window of nonconceptional cycles in women with impaired reproduction.Fluid from uterine cavity, serum and endometrial samples were obtained from 116 women, among them 43 have had 2 or more miscarriages, while 52 were infertile. Control constituted 21 fertile women. In uterine fluid and serum the GdA concentration was assessed with ELISA Bioserv Diagnostic kits, and progesterone with electrochemiluminescence. Endometria obtained during hysteroscopy were evaluated in terms of conformity with the cycle dating.Statistically lower (p < 0,0001) compared to control GdA concentration in uterine fluid was found in infertile women. The lowest GdA values were obtained in women with idiopathic infertility and infertile women with endometriosis. GdA level of women with 2 or more miscarriages was no statistically significant different compared to control. The lowest concentration of GdA in this group of patients was found in women with luteal phase deficiency. The GdA concentration in the serum was three times lower compared to values noted in uterine fluid, and there was no difference between studied groups.Based on our research we might conclude that GdA has a more important role during implantation than in further development of the embryo.
