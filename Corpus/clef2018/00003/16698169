Apoptosis pattern in human endometrium in women with pelvic endometriosis. In the present study we aimed to describe apoptosis patterns in eutopic endometrium in women suffering from endometriosis in order to assess its value as a marker of early forms of endometriosis, and also to try to answer whether endometriosis is caused by changes within the eutopic endometrium or whether endometriotic lesions change the characteristics of eutopic endometrium.The study was performed on 125 women treated in Division of Reproduction. In 52 patients peritoneal endometriosis was diagnosed (I(0)-23 II(0)-29). Seventy-three patients in whom no endometriotic foci could be found at laparoscopy were qualified as the control group. Endometrial biopsy 7-9 days after ovulation was taken for assessment of apoptosis (TUNEL) and routine histology.Apoptosis indices in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis were lower compared to women without endometriosis. In the endometrial glands apoptosis indices were 2.94+/-1.66 versus 5.23+/-2.06 (p<0.01) in the group of women with and without endometriosis, respectively. In the endometrial stroma apoptosis indices were estimated at 2.04+/-1.72 in women with endometriosis and 4.12+/-1.62 in the control group (p<0.01).The observed changes could support the hypothesis of the different properties of eutopic endometrium in endometriotic women as a causing factor of peritoneal endometriosis.
