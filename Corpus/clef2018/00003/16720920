Comparison of osteopontin expression in endometrioid endometrial cancer and ovarian endometrioid cancer. This study compared the DNA, RNA, and protein levels of osteopontin (OPN) in endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) and ovarian endometrioid cancer (OEC). In total, 63 cancer cases (EEC: 33, OEC: 30) were included. Of these, 47 (EEC: 26, OEC: 21) were examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 48 (EEC: 25, OEC: 23) were examined by quantitative PCR. OPN expression was detected in 15 (50.0%) of 30 EECs and in 14 (50.0%) of 28 OECs. There was no significant difference in the percentage of positive cytoplasmic OPN staining between the EECs and OECs (12.8 vs 10.4 p = 0.6811). The correlation between relative mRNA and protein expression levels was significant in both the EECs and OECs
