Fertiloscopy: Clermont-Ferrand's experiment. Evaluation of fertiloscopy's place in the management of female infertility.Retrospective study including 229 women presenting primary or secondary infertility without pathology raising of an evident surgical sanction and benefitting from a fertiloscopy. Perioperative data analysis (context of the infertility, operating technique, complications).Two hundred and three fertiloscopic procedures succeeded (88.6%), revealing lesions in 58 cases (28.6%) requiring a laparoscopy. These are represented by adherences (21 cases), endometriosis (17 cases), an abnormality of the tubal permeability (10 cases), complete or partial failure to visualize the adnexae (6 cases) and ovarian cysts visualization (4 cases). Five complications (2.5%) without major consequence will be deplored: two rectal injuries, two hemorrhagic complications and a postoperative salpingitis. Most of procedures (97.5%) have been performed in an ambulatory setting except when a geographic remoteness did not allow it (5 patients).Fertiloscopy is a safe and reliable procedure. It can be substituted to laparoscopy in the routine assessment of infertile women management in case of not obvious surgical indication.
