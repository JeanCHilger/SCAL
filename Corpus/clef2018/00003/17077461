Transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy: treatment of ovarian endometriomas-preliminary identification of their dislocation by method of aspiration drainage. Transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (THL) is considered as a first-line endoscopic method in the investigation of infertility. During the last period it has played important role in the rehabilitation of the natural fertility. The rapid development of this method in the operative settings is very attractive by it's low-invasiveness. Coagulation of endometrial cysts using THL method is very effective. In this case operation can be performed on an outpatient basis. The detection of small endometriomas that are not seen during THL is not a problem only for fertiloscopy. We offered method detecting the location of ovarian small endometrial cysts, which are not discovered by THL. For this purpose we suggest to perform aspiration drainage of small cysts under ultrasound control before THL. This routine manipulation allows not only the determination of the amount of endometrial cysts, but also leaves the aspiration hole on the ovarian surface which indicates on the localization of endometrial inversion. Thus it helps to determine, without any difficulties, the site of coagulation during THL.
