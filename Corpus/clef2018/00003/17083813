Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system for treatment of dysmenorrhea associated with adenomyosis. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) for the treatment of dysmenorrhea associated with adenomyosis.We recruited 48 women with moderate or severe dysmenorrhea associated with adenomyosis. All women were inserted of LNG-IUS into their uterine cavity from days 5 - 7 of their periods and maintained for 12 months. We compared the visual analogue scale (VAS) scores and verbal rating scale (VRS) scores of their dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia at baseline and 12 months follow-up.Forty-four women completed the study. There were significant differences between mean VAS and VRS scores changes of dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia at baseline and 12 months follow-up, those of dysmenorrhea dropping from 75 +/- 13 to 11 +/- 11 and 2.3 +/- 0.4 to 0.4 +/- 0.3, those of dyspareunia dropping from 54 +/- 19 to 4 +/- 4 and from 1.6 +/- 0.8 to 0.2 +/- 0.2 respectively. Overall 29 women (66%) were very satisfied or satisfied with the one-year treatment.Insertion of LNG-IUS alleviates moderate or severe dysmenorrhea associated with adenomyosis remarkably.
