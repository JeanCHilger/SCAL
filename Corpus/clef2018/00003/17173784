Positron emission tomography with fluordesoxyglucose-F18 in follow-up of endometrial cancer. To assess the utility of FDG-PET in the follow-up of patients treated for endometrial cancer and with suspicion of recurrence according to conventional imaging methods (CT, MRI) and/or elevation of serum tumour markers.Between April 2002 and December 2005, eleven patients underwent 17 FDG-PET studies (six with 2 studies) mean age was 63.4 yrs (range, 52-69 yrs) and time since diagnosis ranged from 11 months to 12 yrs (mean of 56 months). Initially, seven patients were in stage I, three in stage III and one in stage IV (FIGO classification). Histologically, they corresponded to 8 endometrioid carcinomas and 3 non endometrioid carcinomas.FDG-PET showed infradiaphragmatic uptake in 3 patients and disseminated disease in 7 cases. FDG-PET showed no uptake in one patient. CT (n = 7) or MRI (n = 7) detected infradiaphragmatic lesions in 5 patients and visceral lesions in 2. In 11 patients, tumour markers were elevated (CA125, n = 9 CA19.9, n = 2FDG-PET is superior to CT and MRI for detecting recurrences in the follow-up of patients with endometrial cancer.
