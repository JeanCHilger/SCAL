Angiotensin I-converting enzyme insertion-related genotypes and allele are associated with higher susceptibility of endometriosis and leiomyoma. Endometriosis and leiomyoma display features similar to malignancy, requiring neovascularization to proliferation and growth. Altered vascular-related genes might be related to the development of endometriosis and leiomyoma. Polymorphisms of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) genes have been linked with some vascular diseases. This study investigates whether ACE I/D gene polymorphisms could be used as markers of susceptibility in endometriosis and leiomyoma. Women were divided into three groups: (1) endometriosis (n = 125) (2) leiomyoma (n = 120)
