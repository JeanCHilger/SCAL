Two unsuccessful clinical trials on endometriosis and a few lessons learned. In 1999, a phase II clinical trial on the use of fulvestrant to treat endometriosis was launched yet after 7 years there is still no report on its outcome. In 2005, another trial on the use of raloxifene to treat endometriosis was terminated early due to unfavorable outcome. The two apparently unsuccessful clinical trials on endometriosis have taught us a few important lessons. First, we need to understand endometriosis through more basic research. We have also been reminded that human endometriosis trials differ from animal studies
