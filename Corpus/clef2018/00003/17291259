Expression of claudin-3 and claudin-4 in normal, hyperplastic, and malignant endometrial tissue. To clarify the roles of claudins in endometrial tumorigenesis, we determined levels of protein and messengerRNA (mRNA) expression of claudin-3 and claudin-4 in human endometrial tissue (proliferative phase [PE, n= 25] secretory phase [SE, n= 25]
