MUC1 in endometriosis and ovarian cancer. Endometriosis is a chronic, debilitating disease, associated with pelvic pain and infertility. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that women with endometriosis are at increased risk for ovarian cancer. Although the causative factors for both endometriosis and ovarian cancer remain largely unknown, several similarities between the proposed etiology of ovarian cancer and the observed pathophysiology of endometriosis have been reported. MUC1 glycoprotein is present in endometriotic lesions and overexpressed in epithelial ovarian tumors. We are currently studying immunity to MUC1 antigen in newly emerging preclinical models for endometriosis and ovarian cancer and exploring the potential for immune therapy/prevention with MUC1 in both diseases.
