Progestogens in reproductive endocrinology. The progestogens are described by chemical class, and 2 of their uses  in gynecology, prevention of miscarriage and treatment of  endometriosis, are briefly discussed.  The progestogens, compounds that  behave like progesterone in eliciting secretory transformation in the  estrogen-primed endometrium, fall into 3 classes, pregnanes,  nortestosterone derivatives of gonanes and estranes, and gonanes.  The  question whether progestogens can prevent habitual miscarriage has been  subjected to meta-analysis:  progestogens given in 1st trimester  improves the likelihood of pregnancy going to term.  Progestogens were  used to manage endometriosis before LH-RH analogs and Danazol became  available.  Gestrinone (R2323) a weak, unsaturated 19-norsteroid that  binds loosely to the progesterone receptor, has also been tried for  endometriosis.
