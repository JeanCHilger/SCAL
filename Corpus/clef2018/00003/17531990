Decreased human leukocyte antigen-DR expression in the lipid raft by peritoneal macrophages from women with endometriosis. To investigate the macrophage response in endometriosis by determining the expression and localization of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-ABC and HLA-DR by the peritoneal fluid (PF) macrophages and PF concentrations of interferon (IFN)-gamma that regulate HLA expression.Case-control study.University hospital.64 Japanese endometriosis patients, and 65 women with other laparoscopic diagnoses.Venipuncture and laparoscopic peritoneal fluid collection.Expression and localization of HLA-ABC and HLA-DR in PF macrophages were determined by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The concentration of IFN-gamma in PF was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.In women with endometriosis, expression of HLA-ABC and HLA-DR by PF macrophages, and the IFN-gamma concentrations in PF were statistically significantly lower than in controls. Women with endometriosis showed a statistically significant positive correlation between HLA expression and IFN-gamma concentration. By confocal microscopy, HLA-ABC was distributed homogenously on the macrophage surface whereas HLA-DR expression on these cells corresponded to the lipid raft.In women with endometriosis, low HLA expression and particularly reduced HLA-DR in the lipid raft may be influenced by low IFN-gamma and may compromise antigen presentation, limiting the immune response to peritoneal cavity antigens such as implanted or metaplastic endometrial tissue.
