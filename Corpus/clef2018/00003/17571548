Ureteral endometriosis: diagnosis and management. Ureteral endometriosis is a rare disease with only about 300 cases reported. The diagnosis is difficult. The symptoms are non-specific and the diagnosis is based on abdominal ultrasonography suspicion confirmed by intravenous pyelography. The management of ureteral endometriosis usually requires surgery. Hormone therapy should be offered to patients of childbearing age who desire to have children and have the disease in an early stage. Open or laparoscopic surgical treatment gives long-term favorable results.
