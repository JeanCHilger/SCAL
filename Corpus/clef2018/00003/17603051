Successful management of a massive hemorrhage due to rupture of cystic cervical endometriosis by a loop electrosurgical excision procedure. To report a case of cystic cervical endometriosis that caused a massive hemorrhage due to rupture of a cyst and successful management with a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP).Case report.University Hospital.A 37-year-old nulliparous woman.Medical management including surgical treatment.Clinical follow-up and pathologic diagnosis.A hemorrhagic cystic cervical mass was excised with emergent LEEP. The mass was found to be cervical endometriosis. There was no evidence of recurrence until 1 year after excision.Cystic formation of cervical endometriosis--like ovarian endometrioma, which causes a massive hemorrhage due to rupture--is extremely rare, although cervical endometriosis is generally asymptomatic. Hysterectomy is considered in such cases but can be avoided via LEEP that incorporates partial excision of the uterine cervix.
