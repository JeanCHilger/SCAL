Endometriosis--a frequently underestimated disease. Endometriosis is one of the most frequent gynecological disorders. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by laparoscopy. As the etiology and pathogenesis of endometriosis are still mostly obscure, a causal therapy has not been found yet. As for the medicinal treatment of endometriosis, all modern therapeutic approaches aim at ovarian downregulation or at antagonizing the estrogen effects in the endometriosis focus. Surgery aims at a preferably complete resection of all endometriosis focuses. In addition to individual distress, the economic aspect must not be neglected because of its high morbidity, loss of workforce and the repeated therapeutic interventions. As treatment strongly depends on the specific complaints and the personal life circumstances of the patient, an individual therapy concept should always be considered.
