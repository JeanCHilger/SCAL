Predicting the presence of rectovaginal endometriosis from the clinical history: a retrospective observational study. Rectovaginal endometriosis is a severe variant of endometriosis. Common presenting symptoms for endometriosis include dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain and dyspareunia. It is now recognised that there are other less traditional symptoms of endometriosis that are also relatively common. The aim of this study is to assess the relative strength of each of the potential symptoms of rectovaginal endometriosis and compare these with the laparoscopic and histological findings. In this retrospective, observational study the overall prevalence of rectovaginal endometriosis in the group was 31.4%. The presence of dyschesia gave a likelihood ratio of 1.27 (95% CI: 0.56 - 2.89) with a predictive prevalence of rectovaginal endometriosis of 37%. Apareunia and nausea or abdominal bloating were particularly strong markers for rectovaginal disease with a predictive prevalence of 87% and 89%, respectively. The classical symptoms often attributed to irritable bowel syndrome are also common in women with rectovaginal disease.
