Serum antiendometrial antibodies and diagnosis of endometriosis. The purpose of the present prospective multi-center study is to investigate the relationship between laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis and results of a serum antiendometrial antibody (AEA) assay.Indirect immunofluorescence detection of AEA was performed on serum specimens from patients presenting with dysmenorrhea or chronic pelvic pain and infertility (n = 2609) utilizing frozen sections of endometrium acquired on cycle days 18-21 from normally cycling women without endometriosis. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed within 1 year of AEA assay on 527 tested women.The relationship between the serum AEA and laparoscopic verification was characterized by a positive predictive value = 88%, negative predictive value = 86%, sensitivity = 87% and specificity = 87%.The AEA assay is a very good screening test for patients suspected of having endometriosis and should be utilized prior to laparoscopy in diagnostic categories of dysmenorrhea or chronic pelvic pain and infertility.
