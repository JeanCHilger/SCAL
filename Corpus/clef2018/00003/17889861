Transcript profile and localization of Wnt signaling-related molecules in human endometrium. The mRNAs encoding several Wnt ligands, Frizzled receptors, and Wnt antagonists were detected in human endometrium, including SFRP1 the levels of SFRP1 mRNA were higher in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle and increased in endometriotic tissue compared with control eutopic endometrium, and they were detected in both glandular and stromal cells but were more abundant in the stroma. Our results suggest that Wnt signaling could function in normal endometrial physiology and the the Wnt signalling inhibitor SFRP1 might play a role in endometrial growth and endometriosis development.
