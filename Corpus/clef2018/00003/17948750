Endometriosis. The major symptom is dysmenorrhea. Chronic, sometimes non-cyclic pain due to pelvic adhesions is often seen in the long course of the disease. Infiltration into the blader or bowel is a rare but serious complication. A group of patients presents with sterility. Endometriosis histologically resembles endometrium. There can be ovarian cysts and foci either on the peritoneum or in the muscularis of the uterus. The etiology is unknown. There are a number of existing theories. A rare condition is an endometriosis caused iatrogen during a caesarean section. It can develop between uterus and bladder or within the suture or scar tissue. Since we know so little, the treatment options are unsatisfying. Operative resection followed by endocrine medication is the standard therapy. Alternative medicine can be an useful additional factor in the treatment concept.
