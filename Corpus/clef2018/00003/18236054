Lipoadenofibroma of the endometrium: a rare variant of benign mullerian mixed tumor. Adenofibroma is a form of mixed mesodermal tumor in which epithelial and stromal components are benign, and usually arises in the endometrium of postmenopausal women. We report a case of lipoadenofibroma of the endometrium that appeared as an intracavitary mass, which is very unusual because endometrioid adenofibroma rarely contains mature adipose tissue, only the second such case described in detail.An endometrial polypoid mass measuring 1,5 cm with maximum diameter was found incidentally during total abdominal hysterectomy for keratinizing large cell carcinoma of the cervix in a 60-year-old woman. The endometrial polypoid mass was found to be a lipoadenofibroma composed predominantly of collagenated fibrous stroma populated by cystically dilated and occasionally crowded glands lined with proliferative endometrium, intermingled with abundant mature adipose tissue.We suggest that uterine adenofibromas with lipomatous areas belong to the family of mixed tumor of Mullerian origin. We discuss the pathogenesis of this entity and review the previously documented similar cases.
