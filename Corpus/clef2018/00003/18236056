Appendiceal endometriosis: two case reports. The incidence of appendiceal endometriosis is lower than 1% among pathologies of pelvic endometriosis. They may occur with findings such as acute appendicitis, invagination, colic or melena, though they are mostly seen with an asymptomatic character. Diagnosis can be made only after a histopathological examination following the operation. We present here two appendiceal endometriosis cases, which were operated on for a prediagnosis of acute appendicitis, but postoperatively diagnosed as appendiceal endometriosis.
