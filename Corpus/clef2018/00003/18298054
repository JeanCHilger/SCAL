Association of the leukemia inhibitory factor gene mutation and the antiphospholipid antibodies in the peripheral blood of infertile women. To characterize the impact of the potentially functional mutation--the G to A transition at the position 3400 of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF a pluripotent cytokine that plays a central role in the control of the embryo implantation) gene that leads to the exchange of valine with methionine at codon 64 we evaluated the association of the LIF gene mutation and the levels of antiphospolipid antibodies (aPLs) in the peripheral blood of infertile women (the aPLs examination was part of our routine immunological test during the infertility check-up). Eight infertile mutation-positive women were diagnosed with idiopathic infertility (n=5) and endometriosis (n=3) and their levels of aPLs in serum were compared with 115 infertile women without any LIF gene mutation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for the detection of seven antiphospholipid antibodies
