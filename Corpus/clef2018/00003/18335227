Juvenile cystic adenomyosis mimicking uterine malformation: a case report. Cystic adenomyosis is a rare form of adenomyosis mostly seen in middle aged women. We report a case of cystic adenomyosis in a juvenile patient presenting with severe dysmenorrhea refractory to any given medication. The patient initially was diagnosed as uterus bicornis with an obstructed rudimentary horn. Surgical exploration and excision of the cystic mass relieved the symptoms of the patient.
