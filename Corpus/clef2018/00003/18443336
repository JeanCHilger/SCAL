Endometriosis and tissue factor. Tissue factor (TF), is a cellular receptor that binds the ligand factor VII/VIIa to initiate the blood coagulation cascade. In addition to its role as the initiator of the hemostatic cascade, TF is known to be involved in angiogenesis via an interaction with factor VIIa and protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2). In this article we review previous studies from our laboratory demonstrating that the pattern and level of TF expression is altered in multiple cell types derived from eutopic and ectopic endometrium from women with endometriosis compared with normal endometrium. We posit that the inflammatory environment that occurs in ectopic and eutopic endometrium from patients with disease results in high TF expression that in turn, signals via PAR-2 to further produce inflammatory cytokine or chemokine production and macrophage recruitment. Thus, our studies suggest that TF might be an ideal target for therapeutic intervention in endometriosis.
