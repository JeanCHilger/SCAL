Rectal obstruction due to endometriosis. Although endometriosis is a disorder commonly found in reproductive-age women, it does not involve the bowel very often. The circumferential involvement of the rectum is rare and the obstructive symptoms can be difficult to differentiate from those of inflammatory or malignant diseases. We report two patients with rectal endometriosis whose first prominent symptoms were those of intestinal obstruction. A 26-year-old woman was admitted with obstructive symptoms. In order to alleviate the obstruction and extend the preoperative evaluation, a decompressive colostomy was done. The diagnosis of endometriosis was made by laparoscopy and biopsies of the thickened cul-de-sac peritoneum. Another woman, 40 years of age, was referred to us with a colostomy. She had undergone a laparotomy due to an obstructive acute abdomen a year before, and a frozen pelvis was found. Biopsy specimens had been collected and the pathological report revealed endometrioma. A rectosigmoidectomy, encompassing the stenotic rectal segment, was done along with primary anastomosis. The pathological examination confirmed rectal endometriosis. The conclusion is that, although rare, rectal endometriosis can cause significant stenosis of the organ, leading to obstructive symptoms. Despite its low frequency, it should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of rectal stenosis involving women of childbearing age.
