Thoracic endometriosis. Thoracic endometriosis is defined by the presence of endometrial tissue in the lungs or pleura, and is characterised by cyclic hemoptysis or recurrent hemothorax or pneumothorax occurring with the menstruation. Being a rare clinical entity, it is not always considered in the differential diagnosis when these symptoms are evaluated. The exams performed during the diagnostic work-up frequently show nonspecific alterations, however a presumptive diagnosis can be made based on the typical clinical history. The key to the diagnosis are the catamenial symptoms, so a thorough clinical history is essential to promptly reach the correct diagnosis. Hormonal treatment and surgery are the two mainstays of therapy for this pathology. The authors present the case of a 27 year-old female patient presenting with cyclic hemoptysis during the menstruation. The diagnostic workup was inconclusive. Based on the clinical history, the diagnosis of pulmonary endometriosis was assumed and treatment was initiated with oral contraceptives with total resolution of symptoms. The authors make a brief review of the main symptoms, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of thoracic endometriosis.
