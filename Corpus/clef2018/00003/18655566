Preventive and therapeutic effect of E-leng capsule on post-operation recurrence of ovarian endometriotic cysts and its influence on expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 in eutopic and ectopic endometrium. To investigate the effect and mechanism of E-leng Capsule (ELC) in preventing and treating post-operation recurrence of ovarian endometriotic cysts (OEC).A total of 60 patients enrolled were the inpatients, who underwent cystectomy of OEC in the Gynecological Department of Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from 2002 to 2004. They were randomly assigned to two groups, the treatment group and the control group. Patients in the treatment group were administered with ELC before operation and after operation (starting from the 7th day post-operation), each for 3 months, while patients in the control group were untreated before operation and administered with Danazol from the 7th day post-operation for 3 months. Specimens of eutopic and ectopic endometrium in all patients of both groups were taken during the operation for detecting expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) mRNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the incidence of post-operation recurrence was observed 12 months later.The 12-month follow-up showed that recurrence presented in 1 patient in the treatment group (3.3%), and 6 in the control group (20.0%), showing significant difference between them (P<0.05). The expressions of TIMP-1 mRNA in eutopic and ectopic endometrium were 0.85 +/- 0.36 and 0.76 +/- 0.57 in the treatment group, and 0.71 +/- 0.33 and 0.56 +/- 0.39 in the control group, while the expressions of MMP-9 mRNA were 0.36 +/- 0.40 and 0.35 +/- 0.35 vs 0.36 +/- 0.33 and 0.72 +/- 0.59, respectively. The expression of endometrial TIMP-1 mRNA, either eutopic or ectopic, was significantly higher, and the expression of ectopic endometrial MMP-9 mRNA was lower in the treatment group than that in the control group (P<0.01).ELC can reduce the invasive ability of endometrium tissue probably by regulating the balance of MMP/TIMP, namely, increase the expression of eutopic and ectopic endometrial TIMP-1 and decrease the expression of ectopic endometrial MMP-9, and thus to achieve its preventive and therapeutic effect on recurrence of OEC.
