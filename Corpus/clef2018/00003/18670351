Primary ovarian mucinous tumors with signet ring cells: report of 3 cases with discussion of so-called primary Krukenberg tumor. The distinction between a primary ovarian mucinous carcinoma or even a borderline mucinous tumor and a metastatic mucinous carcinoma may be difficult. A constellation of clinical, gross pathologic and morphologic features is used in this distinction. One of the most important morphologic features suggesting a metastatic mucinous carcinoma in the ovary is the presence of signet ring cells these are considered rare in primary ovarian mucinous tumors. In this study, we report 3 primary ovarian mucinous tumors with a component of signet ring cells. The tumors arose in patients aged 27, 55, and 60, were unilateral, confined to the ovary and stage IA. They ranged from 9 to 27 cm
