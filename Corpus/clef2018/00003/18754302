Successful treatment of advanced endometriosis with extremely high CA 125 and moderately elevated CA 15-3 levels. We present the case of a patient with advanced endometriosis who presented with chronic pelvic pain, bilateral unruptured ovarian endometrioma, massive peritoneal implants and extremely elevated CA 125, and also elevated CA 15-3 levels. Laparoscopy revealed bilateral unruptured ovarian endometrioma and diffuse peritoneal endometriotic implants. Increased association of elevated levels of CA 125 and CA 15-3 is not so common in advanced endometriosis. The case was successfully treated with laparoscopy and combined low-dose oral contraceptive with one year of follow-up. To the best of our knowledge among the reported cases this is the highest CA 15-3 level ever reported with an extremely elevated CA 125 level.
