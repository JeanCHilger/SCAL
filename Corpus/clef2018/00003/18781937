Endometriosis management: workflow on genomics and proteomics and future biomolecular pharmacotherapy. Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent disease, associated with pelvic pain and infertility, with still limited knowledge of the pathogenesis, pathophysiology of related infertility and evolution.To investigate proteogenomic approaches and new trends of endometriosis treatment.A literature search was carried out for all articles on endometriosis related to immune system, and to non-hormonal, antiangiogenic and experimental therapies.Classic endometriosis pharmacotherapy is represented by GnRH agonists, oral contraceptives and Type II progesterone receptor ligands. New proteomic and genomic technologies could help to clarify the aetiology of endometriosis and promise the rapid identification of a new generation of drugs with a specific molecular target, with the aim to ameliorate the patients' quality of life.
