Endometrial stromal cells from women with endometriosis reveal peculiar migratory behavior in response to ovarian steroids. To evaluate differences in endometrial stromal cell (ESC) migration between patients with and without endometriosis.Differences in ESC migration, cellular morphology, and cytoskeletal-actin dynamics were evaluated in response to platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and steroid hormones (17beta-estradiol and progesterone).Medical school research laboratory.Endometrial biopsy samples obtained from 43 women: 23 as controls (endometriosis excluded by laparoscopy), 20 with severe or moderate endometriosis (diagnosed by laparoscopy).ESCs were treated with and without PDGF-BB, 17beta-estradiol, and progesterone.Cellular migration was evaluated by means of chemotaxis experiments in a Boyden chamber. Cellular morphology and cytoskeletal-actin dynamics were evaluated by immunofluorescence.Progesterone stimulated the migratory behavior of ESCs derived from women with endometriosis, while 17beta-estradiol could stimulate motility of ESCs derived from both controls and women with endometriosis, with a greater effect observed in the latter group. No difference in ESC migratory behavior after PDGF-BB treatment was observed between women with and without the disease. Also, PDGF-BB and steroid hormones could modify the organization of actin cytoskeletal structures.Ovarian steroids differently affect the migration of ESCs derived from women with and without endometriosis. This effect is likely to involve cytoskeletal reorganization. Nongenomic signaling pathways induced by steroid hormones might have a role in this phenomenon.
