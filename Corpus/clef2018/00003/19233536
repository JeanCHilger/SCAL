Successful treatment of refractory endometriosis-related chronic pelvic pain with aromatase inhibitors in premenopausal patients. Not every patient with endometriosis responds to currently recommended conventional medical treatment regimens. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and side effects of aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of premenopausal patients with endometriosis associated with chronic pelvic pain refractory to conventional treatment.Four premenopausal patients with documented refractory endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain were treated with aromatase inhibitors, either anastrazole (3) or letrozole (1), for 6 months. The treatment was combined with calcium 1.5 g per day and vitamin D 800 U per day. The main outcome measure was reduction in pelvic pain assessed by visual analogue scale. Side effects were documented and changes in serum LH, FSH and 17-beta estradiol and bone density (Dexa scan) were measured before, during and after treatment.There was marked improvement in pelvic pain in the four patients. Their mean pain score fell from 9 prior to treatment to 4.5 at the end of treatment. One patient with infertility conceived immediately after completing the treatment. There were no changes in the hormone levels and bone scan scores. The most common side effect was irregular bleeding with anastrazole and joint pains with letrozole.Aromatase inhibitors are beneficial in premenopausal women with chronic pelvic pain secondary to refractory endometriosis without compromising fertility and with minimal side effects. Further cohort and comparative studies are needed to confirm these observations.
