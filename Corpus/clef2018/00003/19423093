Interleukin-8 serum levels do not correlate with pelvic pain in patients with ovarian endometriomas. To determine whether interleukin-8 (IL-8) serum levels are correlated with pelvic pain in patients with ovarian endometriomas.Prospective study.Tertiary-care university hospital.Interleukin-8 serum levels were prospectively analyzed in 51 patients (group A, asymptomatic patients or patients with mild dysmenorrhea group B, severe dysmenorrhea and/or chronic pelvic pain and/or dyspareunia) who underwent surgery for cystic ovarian endometriosis to asses whether a correlation exists between IL-8 serum levels and pelvic pain.Interleukin-8 serum levels determination.Interleukin-8 serum levels and pelvic pain.From 56 patients, five cases were ultimately excluded because the histologic diagnosis was not cystic ovarian endometriosis (2 teratomas and 3 haemorragic cysts). The mean (+/-SD) IL-8 serum levels in group A were 6.41 +/- 12.17 pg/mL and in group B were 6.52 +/- 8.73 pg/mL.Pain symptoms in ovarian endometriosis is not correlated with IL-8 serum levels.
