Estradiol modulation of hepatocyte growth factor by stromal fibroblasts in the female reproductive tract. Primary human uterine, cervical, and ectocervical stromal fibroblasts constitutively secrete hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), yet only uterine stromal fibroblasts increase HGF secretion in response to estradiol. Estradiol-induced HGF secretion by uterine stromal fibroblasts may have a significant effect on uterine cancer and endometriosis.
