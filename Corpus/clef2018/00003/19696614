Ciliated adenocarcinoma of the ovary with evidence of serous differentiation: report of a case. A patient with bilateral ovarian adenocarcinomas composed predominantly of ciliated cells incidentally found at autopsy is reported. Although obviously malignant, a majority of the cells expressed well-differentiated cilia with terminal bar formation. In one of the masses, the neoplastic cells seemed to arise from a serous adenofibroma. The tumor was confined to the ovaries without evidence of metastatic spread. Although morphologically resembling an endometrioid-type neoplasm, immunohistochemical and molecular studies were more consistent with a serous phenotype, especially in light of its apparent origination from a serous adenofibroma. We agree with previous observations suggesting that although the neoplasm seems morphologically worrisome, it may actually portend a more benign clinical course.
