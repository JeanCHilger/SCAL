Aberrant expression of p27(Kip1)-interacting cell-cycle regulatory proteins in ovarian clear cell carcinomas and their precursors with special consideration of two distinct multistage clear cell carcinogenetic pathways. We have previously reported that alterations of p27(Kip1)-interacting cell-cycle proteins frequently occur during the development of endometriosis-associated ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCA Yamamoto et al., Histopathology in press, 20). However, CCA also occurs in association with clear cell adenofibroma (CCAF). In this study, the expressions of p27(Kip1)-interacting proteins, i.e., p27(Kip1), Skp2, Cks1, cyclin A, cyclin E, and the Ki-67 labeling index (LI), were analyzed in 25 CCAFs (11 benign and 14 borderline) and 15 CCAF-associated CCAs, and compared with the expression status of each protein in the 23 previously studied endometriosis-associated CCAs. Although aberrant expression of all p27(Kip1)-interacting proteins was more frequent in the CCAF-associated CCAs than in the benign CCAFs, statistical significance was found only for Cks1 overexpression. The frequencies of p27(Kip1) downregulation and overexpression of Skp2 and cyclin A were significantly lower in CCAF-associated than in endometriosis-associated CCAs (P < 0.05, respectively). The frequencies of p27(Kip1) downregulation and Skp2 overexpression in borderline CCAFs were significantly lower than those in atypical endometriosis components in endometriosis-associated CCAs (P < 0.05, respectively). Mean Ki-67 LI increased significantly through benign (4.9%) to borderline (11.1%) CCAF and to CCAF-associated CCA (30.6%), but the latter two values were significantly lower than those in atypical endometriosis (21.4%) and endometriosis-associated CCA (46.9%
