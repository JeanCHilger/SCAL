Endoscopic ultrasound and EUS-guided FNA in the diagnosis of rectal endometriosis. Endometriosis is characterised by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus. The GI tract is the most common site for extra-pelvic endometriosis, in particular the rectum and sigmoid colon. Using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), which combines endoscopy with real-time ultrasonography, the wall of the GI tract and adjacent structures can be examined. EUS-guided fine needle aspirates can be also obtained during the procedure. We report a case of rectosigmoid endometriosis which was diagnosed using EUS.
