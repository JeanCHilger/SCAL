Umbilical endometriosis: a radical excision with laparoscopic assistance. Umbilical endometriosis represents the most common site of cutaneous endometriosis. Although its treatment is typically surgical, in literature the approach used is variable and extends from diathermocoagulation to omphalectomy. Such superficial treatments for umbilical endometriosis can predispose the patient to a relapse of the disease. We here present seven cases of umbilical endometriosis treated with radical surgery with a laparoscopically-assisted approach, with a complete and long-term disease-free follow-up.Seven cases of umbilical endometriosis, four of which relapsing from a prior superficial treatment, were treated radically with a laparoscopically-assisted approach, with a long-term disease-free follow-up.Although a medical treatment can be considered, the treatment of choice in these patients should be that of excisional surgery so as to avoid lesion relapse and the risk of oncogenic transformation. Despite umbilical endometriosis is a rare finding, this relatively small case series treated by laparoscopically-assisted omphalectomy shows a complete resolution of the lesion and symptoms along with good aesthetic results at a long-term follow-up.
