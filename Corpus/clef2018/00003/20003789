Establishment of endometriosis diagnostic model using plasma protein profiling. To establish the diagnostic model for endometriosis by screening the plasma biomarkers of endometriosis using surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS)coupled with bioinformatics.Plasma samples from 36 patients with endometriosis (endometriosis group) matched with 35 patients with infertility or benign ovarian tumors (control group) before laparoscopy were collected at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January to October 2007. Plasma protein profiling were detected using SELDI-TOF-MS and protein chip and peak intensities were compared between the two groups. Biomarker Discovery Software was used for data analysis and model was build by classification and regression tree software (CART), sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic model were verified.There were 14 protein peaks abnormally expressed in endometriosis group compared with those of control group (P < 0.01). The diagnostic model composed of three protein peaks with the molecular weight of 3,956,000, 11,710,000 and 6,986,000 showed a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 83%. In the blind test the model showed a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 80%.SELDI-TOF-MS is a new approach for screening markers of endometriosis. Its clinical value deserves further investigation.
