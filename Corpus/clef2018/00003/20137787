Inhibition of cell proliferation, adhesion, and invasion with an anti-L1-cell adhesion molecule monoclonal antibody in an in vitro endometriosis model. The use of anti-L1-cell adhesion molecule monoclonal antibodies (anti-L1CAM-mAb) in an endometriosis epithelial cell line Z12 led to a statistically significant decrease in cell proliferation and cell invasion and to an inhibition of the adhesion compared with unspecific IgG-Ab treated and untreated cells. Because it increases the cell invasion and adhesion which consequently aggravates the disease, L1 could possibly promote endometriosis development thus, further studies should evaluate the possible use of anti-L1-mAb in an animal endometriosis model.
