Immunohistochemical profile of colorectal and ovarian carcinomas--examination with cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, beta catenin and cDX 2. Metastases from colorectal adenocarcinomas can be histologically similar to serous, mucinous and endometrioid ovarian adenocarcinomas. The differentiation between primary and metastatic ovarian tumours is of great importance for the patients because of the different treatment and prognosis.The aim of the study was to determine whether the differences in the expression of Cytokeratin 7, Cytokeratin 20, Beta catenin and CDX2 can be used to distinguish the different types of carcinomas and their metastases.The immunohistochemical expression of the listed above antibodies was examined retrospectively and prospectively in 38 colorectal adenocarcinomas (primary and metastatic) and 32 ovarian adenocarcinomas (primary and metastatic). The metastases in both types of adenocarcinomas are located in the peritoneum.The immunohistochemical expression was evaluated using a semi-quantitative method. The ovarian adenocarcinomas are mostly positive for Cytokeratin 7 (in 63%), while colorectal carcinomas are mostly positive for Cytokeratin 20 (in 73%). Regarding Beta catenin, in colorectal carcinomas the expression is mostly nuclear (in 65%) and in ovarian carcinomas mostly membrane (in 68%). In cases of uncertain expression of the markers mentioned above, CDX2 was used. Positive nuclear expression was observed only in intestinal tumours (in 86%).For differential diagnosis between ovarian and colorectal adenocarcinomas, the use of antibodies, determining the intestinal differentiation of the tumours like Cytokeratin 20, Beta catenin and CDX2 is recommended.
