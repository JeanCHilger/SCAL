Use of neutral argon plasma in the laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis. To report the feasibility and safety of the use of a novel energy source that uses an electrically neutral beam of pure argon plasma for the laparoscopic management of endometriosis.In this prospective pilot study, 20 patients undergoing laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis were included. Characteristic endometriotic lesions throughout the pelvis were vaporized or resected using neutral argon plasma. Specimens were evaluated for the presence of endometriosis and thermal effects on tissue. The bases of the treated lesions were biopsied to determine whether residual endometriosis was present.Neutral argon plasma was used in 18 of the 20 patients for laparoscopic treatment of pelvic endometriosis. All biopsies confirmed complete vaporization or resection with no residual endometriosis at the base. Endometriosis was identified on pathology in all lesions excised. Thermal effects did not interfere with histologic analysis in any of the lesions. No complications occurred.Neutral argon plasma can be utilized as a multi-functional device that has vaporization, coagulation, and superficial cutting capacities with minimal thermal spread and acceptable outcomes. The use of neutral argon plasma appears to be efficacious and safe for the complete treatment of endometriotic implants.
