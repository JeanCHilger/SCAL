Effect of GnRH II and GnRH I on secretion of VEGF by eutopic and ectopic endometrial stromal cells of endometriosis patients. To determine the effect of GnRH I and GnRH II on the secretion of VEGF by eutopic and ectopic endometrial stromal cells cultured in vitro, and to provide theoretical basis for exploring new treatments for endometriosis (EMs).Eutopic and ectopic endometrium stromal cells cultured in vitro were treated with different concentrations of GnRH II and a GnRH I (goserelin), and a control group was not treated by GnRH II and GnRH I. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the content of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein in the medium of the above 2 groups.(1) There was no difference in the VEGF protein secreted by eutopic and ectopic stromal cells in the medium after being cultured in vitro for 48 h (P>0.05). (2) 10(-10), 10(-8), and 10(-6) mol/L GnRH II dose-dependently reduced VEGF protein secreted by endometrial stromal cells (P<0.05),and the inhibition effect was stronger than that of GnRH I (P<0.05).(3)The inhibition effect of GnRH II on VEGF in ectopic stromal cells was stronger than that of eutopic stromal cells (P<0.05).(1) Ectopic stromal cells cultured in vitro can secrete VEGF,which has no difference from the eutopic stromal cells, and which may play an important role in the formation and development of EMs. (2) GnRH II can dose-dependently reduce VEGF protein secreted by ectopic and eutopic endometrial stromal cells cultured in vitro,and the inhibition effect is stronger than that of GnRH I, providing theoretical basis for exploring new treatments for EMs.
