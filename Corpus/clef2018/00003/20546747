On the basis of the symptoms, 108 women were referred to a gynecologist. After gynecological examination and transvaginal ultrasound, endometriosis was suspected in 51 women (47.2%). The diagnosis of endometriosis was confirmed by radiological investigations and/or surgery in 46 patients the diagnosis of endometriosis was presumed in 2 other women but it was not confirmed by radiological investigations and/or surgery. The prevalence of endometriosis diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging and/or surgery was 3.6% (46/1291).The prevalence of newly diagnosed symptomatic endometriosis in this study was at least 3.6%.
