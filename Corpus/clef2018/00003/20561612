Application of the nuclear factor-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate for the treatment of endometriosis: an in vitro study. This study demonstrated that pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a potent nuclear factor-κB inhibitor, showed stronger inhibitory effects on nuclear factor-κB activation in endometriotic stromal cells than in normal endometrial stromal cells as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Western blot analysis. Pretreatment of endometriotic stromal cells with PDTC attenuated tumor necrosis factor-α-induced expressions of CD44s, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and vascular endothelial growth factor whereas reversed tumor necrosis factor-α-reduced expressions of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 revealed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, suggesting that PDTC may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of endometriosis.
