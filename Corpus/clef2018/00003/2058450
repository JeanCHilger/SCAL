Bladder endometriosis. Diagnostic and therapeutic approximation. Endometriosis is defined by the presence of functionally active endometria in ectopic position so when its clinical behaviour adopts the characteristics of tumoration, endometrioma is accepted as an alternative name. Location of this pathology in the urinary apparatus is uncommon in terms of incidence, since the bladder is a selected site. This condition implies a high morbidity rate because it requires a high level of suspicion in order to be diagnosed. It is acknowledged that no image study (CAT, Echography, MNR, etc.) is pathognomonic for endometriosis and it is necessary to perform endoscopy and biopsy to achieve a correct diagnosis. The paper includes the strategy to follow, both with regard to diagnosis and the current therapeutic approaches.
