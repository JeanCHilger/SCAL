Serum anti-Müllerian hormone level is a useful marker for evaluating the impact of laparoscopic cystectomy on ovarian reserve. To assess the impact of laparoscopic surgery on ovarian reserve, we evaluated pre- and postoperative levels of serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in comparison with basal levels of FSH. The median AMH level was 2.98 ng/mL and 3.92 ng/mL before operation and was significantly reduced to a median level of 2.24 ng/mL and 3.29 ng/mL at 1 month after operation in the endometrioma group (n = 29) and the nonendometrioma group (n = 21), respectively, whereas postoperative basal FSH levels did not significantly change in comparison with preoperative levels.
