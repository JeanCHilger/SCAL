Abdominal rectus muscle endometriosis after Cesarean section. Extrapelvic localization of endometriosis. Endometriosis is defined by the presence of functional endometrial tissue outside the uterus, where it is normally located. Endometriosis could has intra and extra pelvic localization. Abdominal endometriosis is the most common localization of extrapelvic endometriosis and is usually developed in the connective tissue surrounding the operation. Very rarely this could be found in the muscle tissue. The mechanical transplantation theory is responsible for the development of scar endometriosis.The patient, 35 years old, three years after caesarian section had an operation because of the assumption for the presence of front abdominal hernia, located at the place of previous section. The egg-sized tumor was removed from the abdominal rectus muscle and sent for PH and immunohistochemical analyses. The results showed endometriosis of the muscle with positive estrogen and progesterone receptors. One year after the operation, due to the repeated pains in the scar area, the treatment continued by GNRH analogues and control was performed by serial ultrasound and biochemical markers CA 125.Clinical diagnoses of scar endometriosis could be provided by an accurate anamnesis and physical, ultrasound and biochemical examinations. Scar endometriosis should always be considered when the symptoms are present in cyclic manner, hormone depending, mostly after gynecological operations and worsening during menstruation. The problem was diagnosed by pathohistological analyses (Fig. 4, Ref. 20).
