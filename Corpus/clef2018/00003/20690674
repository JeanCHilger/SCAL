Differential proteome profiling of eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis to understand etiology of endometriosis. The identification of molecular differences in the endometrium of women with endometriosis is an important step toward understanding the pathogenesis of this condition and for developing novel strategies for the treatment of associated infertility and pain. In this study, we investigated protein expression analysis of eutopic endometrium from women with and without endometriosis. The proteomic analysis revealed molecular dysregulation of more than 70 proteins in the proliferative phase of eutopic endometrium in stage IV and secretory phase of stage II, III and IV endometriosis. Using mass spectrometry, 48 proteins spots which were consistently differentially expressed from stage II to IV endometriosis were identified. The differentially expressed proteins include structural proteins, proteins involved in stress response, protein-folding and protein-turnover, immunity, energy production, signal transduction, RNA biogenesis, protein biosynthesis, and nuclear proteins. Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the observed changes in eight representative proteins. The present study provides identification of new players that have a potential role in the initiation and progression of endometriosis and also sets a framework for further investigations on mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
