Scoring system for screening of patients with endometriosis in infertile clinic. An outpatient department screening method for endometriosis was prepared by designing a scoring system in a retrospective study. We compared the incidence of 21 characteristic symptoms and the finding of endometriosis in 39 infertile women with endometriosis diagnosed by laparoscopy or laparotomy and 21 women without it. A table for diagnostic scoring composed of 11 items was accomplished. The feasibility of this diagnostic scoring system was then examined in a prospective study of 72 women with endometriosis and 47 without it. The results were as follows. 1. In the retrospective study, all the women with 10 or more points had had endometriosis. Fifteen out of 20 women with -20 points or less had been without endometriosis and the remaining 5 with endometriosis (4 minimal and 1 mild stage according to AFS classification). 2. In the prospective study, a 94.5% (52/55) incidence of endometriosis was found in women with 10 or more points and 66.7% (10/15) of women with -20 points or less were without endometriosis. 3. This diagnostic scoring system, in which women with endometriosis score 10 or more points and women without it -20 points or less, has 91.2% sensitivity, 76.9% specificity, 94.5% positive predictive value and 66.7% of the negative predictive value. It is concluded that this scoring system has clinical diagnostic value in screening for endometriosis in infertile women at the outpatient department.
