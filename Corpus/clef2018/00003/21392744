T helper (Th)1, Th2, and Th17 interleukin pathways in infertile patients with minimal/mild endometriosis. In the present study, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12, IL-17, and IL-23 levels were measured in serum and peritoneal fluid of women with minimal or mild endometriosis and compared with levels in controls without endometriosis. Higher IL-23 levels were encountered in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis, suggesting a possible role of this cytokine in these women's infertility.
