The ratios of serum bioactive/immunoreactive luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone in various clinical conditions with increased and decreased gonadotropin secretion: reevaluation by a highly sensitive immunometric assay. Serum bioactive and immunoreactive LH and FSH were measured in clinical conditions with increased or decreased gonadotropin secretion. Gonadotropin immunoreactivity was measured using a conventional RIA (I) and an ultrasensitive immunofluorometric method (F). Bioactive (B) LH was assessed by the mouse interstitial cells in vitro bioassay, and B-FSH using the immature rat granulosa cell assay. Acute GnRH stimulation of adult men (n = 6) increased LH levels measured by the different methods 4.3- to 5.3-fold. The B/I ratio of LH increased from 2.34 +/- 0.21 to 3.71 +/- 0.36 (mean +/- SEM) at 120 min (P less than 0.05), but no change was found in the B/F ratio. After ovariectomy of premenopausal women (n = 6), the LH levels increased in 1 week 4- to 6-fold, the B/I ratio from 1.85 +/- 0.22 to 2.59 +/- 0.24, and the B/F ratio from 1.78 +/- 0.22 to 2.90 +/- 0.30 (P less than 0.05 for both). In addition, the LH levels were measured during GnRH agonist treatment of ovarian carcinoma (n = 8), endometriosis (n = 8), and prostatic carcinoma after orchiectomy (n = 8). In the two former groups, serum B-LH decreased in 1 month to undetectable levels (less than 0.5 IU/L), and in the prostate cancer patients to 1.2 (0.8-1.9) IU/L (log mean and range of +/- SEM). The concomitant decline of I-LH was to 1.5-1.9 IU/L in the agonist-treated female patients, and that of F-LH to 0.10-0.15 IU/L in the prostate cancer patients, respectively, these values were 7-8 and 0.3-0.7 IU/L. The B/I and B/F ratios during the agonist treatments could only be calculated in the prostate cancer patients (in the others, B-LH became undetectable). The B/I ratio decreased from 2.34 +/- 0.5 to 0.14 +/- 0.03 (P less than 0.01), but no suppression was found in the B/F ratio from a pretreatment value of 3.6 +/- 0.8. B-, I-, and F-FSH levels were measured in the GnRH agonist-treated orchiectomized prostate cancer patients. The pretreatment level of B-FSH was 154 (137-175), that of I-FSH was 38.0 (34.4-42.0), and that of F-FSH was 39.8 (35.3-44.9) IU/L. The B/I ratio of FSH was 3.76 +/- 0.49, and the B/F ratio was 3.53 +/- 0.59. The mean B-FSH level decreased during treatment by 87-93.5%, that of I-FSH by 98%, and that of F-FSH by 91.5% (P less than 0.01 for all).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
