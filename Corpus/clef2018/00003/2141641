Nd:YAG laser laparoscopy for ovarian endometriomas. Thirty patients with ovarian endometriomas were treated with Nd:YAG laser contact irradiation via laparoscopy. The indications for laparoscopy were infertility (16) and dysmenorrhea (14). The laparoscopic procedures undertaken so far at our clinic were aspiration of chocolate cysts, removal of ovarian endometriomas, adnexal adhesiolysis, uterine nerve ablation, coagulation of peritoneal endometriosis and irrigation. No complications occurred. After undergoing this procedure, 6 of 16 patients achieved pregnancy, and 13 of 14 obtained pain relief. The serum CA-125 levels were significantly decreased postoperatively. We confirmed that contact irradiation with a cone-shaped sapphire probe provides an adequate incision and lysis at low power levels and that this method is an effective treatment for ovarian endometriomas.
