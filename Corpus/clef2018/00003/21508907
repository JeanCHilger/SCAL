Proposal for a systematic preoperative assessment of pelvic endometriosis. Severe endometriosis represents one of the most challenging clinical and surgical cases in gynecology. Preoperative assessment of the extension of the disease is of key relevance to opt for medical or surgical therapy and, sometimes, to plan a multidisciplinary approach.A systematic diagnostic approach is proposed and evaluated in a tertiary referral centre. It is based on an initial clinical evaluation and a second level ultrasound of the pelvis. Further exams, whenever required, have to be aimed at demonstrating specific involvements of organs other than ovaries and peritoneum such as bowel, urinary tract and nerves.The application of the proposed protocol has led to a reduction of the number of non-radical surgical procedures due to incomplete consent associated with missed diagnosis over the years (P<0.001).Our findings support the efficacy of a systematic diagnostic approach to endometriosis. This allows a correct planning of therapy with a multidisciplinary approach when necessary.
