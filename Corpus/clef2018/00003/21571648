Histologic, molecular, and cytogenetic features of ovarian cancers: implications for diagnosis and treatment. Ovarian epithelial carcinoma (OEC), the most common ovarian malignancy, is a heterogeneous disease with several histologic subtypes that show characteristic cytogenetic features, molecular signatures, oncologic signaling pathways, and clinical-biologic behavior. Recent advances in histopathology and cytogenetics have provided insights into pathophysiologic features and natural history of OECs. Several studies have shown that high- or low-grade serous, endometrioid, and clear cell carcinomas are characterized by mutations involving the TP53, K-ras/BRAF, CTNNB1, and PIK3CA genes, respectively. High-grade serous carcinomas, the most common subtype, often manifest with early transcoelomic spread of disease beyond the ovaries, whereas low-grade serous and mucinous carcinomas commonly manifest with early-stage disease, with a resultant excellent prognosis. On the basis of pathogenetic mechanisms, recent findings suggest a dualistic model of ovarian carcinogenesis consisting of types I and II. Type I (low-grade serous, mucinous, and endometrioid) cancers commonly arise from well-described, genetically stable precursor lesions (usually borderline tumors) manifest as large adnexal masses with early-stage disease
