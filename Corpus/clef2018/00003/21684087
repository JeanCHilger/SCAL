Umbilical endometriosis in women free of abdominal surgical antecedents. Primary umbilical endometriosis represents a very rare localization of the disease and is represented by blue, papular, nodular or cystic lesions whose symptoms are related to ovarian cycle. We report the management of three women, free of surgical antecedents presenting with primary umbilical endometriosis. In each woman, abdominal laparoscopy revealed peritoneal pelvic endometriosis. The excision of umbilical lesions was performed with satisfactory esthetical outcomes. In our experience, umbilical endometriosis responsible for highly characteristic features appears playing the role of clinical marker for pelvic endometriosis.
