Fine-needle aspiration cytology was performed, and endometriosis was determined.Cyst removal and closure of the internal inguinal ring's defect by the laparoscopic approach.Disease free.The intervention was successfully performed by laparoscopic approach. The postoperative evolution was good, and the patient was discharged 2 days after surgery.Inguinal or Nuck's duct are both uncommon locations for endometriosis therefore, it is difficult to suspect in patients without a surgical history. Once identified, the treatment involves removal of the endometrioma and repair of the internal inguinal ring. A laparoscopic approach should be considered when possible.
