Culture and identification of fibroblast from human endometriosis. To establish the model of cultivating and identifying fibroblast from human endometriosis (HEFC) in vitro.The tissues of human endometriotic cysts of ovary were digested by collagenases I, II and IV The resulting cells were purified by centrifugation and differential adhesion. HEFC was identified by observing the morphologic changes under an inverted microscope and the expressions of vimentin, α-SMA (α-smooth muscle actin) and keratin were detected by immunocytochemistry.Immunohistochemical staining of vimentin was positive, α-SMA rarely positive and keratin completely negative in cultured fibroblasts. HEFC grew as a confluent monolayer of short fat fusiform, triangular, star-shaped and polygonal fiber-like cells. Furthermore HEFC could be well sub-cultured.Acquired fibroblast can be cultured in vitro stably. It is quite important to study the specificities of HEFC. Sufficient and reliable target cells may be obtained for studying the mechanisms of fibrosis and adhesion in endometriosis at the molecular level.
