Adenomyosis: from the sign to the diagnosis. Imaging, diagnostic pitfalls and differential diagnosis: a pictorial review. Adenomyosis is a pathological gynaecological condition characterised by benign invasion of the endometrium into the myometrium. It is often misdiagnosed, or is not easily recognised, although it is responsible for disabling symptoms such as menorrhagia, abnormal uterine bleeding, dysmenorrhoea and infertility in premenopausal women. The aim of this pictorial review is to analyse the features of adenomyosis by illustrating the most usual and typical imaging patterns, along with the unusual appearances, seen in a vast array of gynaecological imaging modalities. The different findings of focal and diffuse adenomyosis along with the diagnostic limitations of ultrasound, hysterosalpingography and magnetic resonance imaging are described, as are the pitfalls and differential diagnosis with other pathological conditions that are often misdiagnosed as adenomyosis. The role of the different imaging modalities in planning appropriate treatment and their usefulness in monitoring therapy are also discussed.
