Adhesive and invasive effects and mechanism of neiyi recipe on the endometriosis. To assess the inhibitory effects of Neiyi Recipe by comparing adhesive and invasive effects of eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues from endometriosis women and the endometrium from endometriosis-free women.The invasive capacity of endometrial stromal cells from endometriosis-free women, eutopic and ectopic endometrial stromal cells from women with endometriosis were compared using Boyden chamber, the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) ectopy transplant, and immunohistochemical EnVision method. The expressions of adhesion and invasion correlated cytokines in the transplanted tissue and effect of Neiyi Recipe on them were observed.The numbers of invasion stromal cells of eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues were obviously more than those in the endometriosis-free women (P<0.05). After treatment with Neiyi Recipe and danazol respectively, the number of invasion stromal cells was significantly less in the Neiyi Recipe group than in the danazol group (P<0.05). Compared with endometriosis-free women, the expression of ICAM-1 in the ectopic endometrium tissue, and MMP-9 expressions in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium were significantly higher (all P<0.05) and TIMP-1 expressions obviously lower (P<0.01). In the eutopic endometrium, Neiyi Recipe and danazol serum could significantly lower the expression of MMP-9, and up-regulate expressions of TIMP-1 and ICAM-1 (P<0.01). In the ectopic endometrium, Neiyi Recipe could significantly lower the expression of MMP-9 (P<0.01) and ICAM-1 (P<0.05), and danazol serum could lower the expression of ICAM-1 (P<0.05). Compared with danazol, Neiyi Recipe showed more obvious effect in down-regulating MMP-9 (P<0.05).High expression of MMP-9 and low expression of TIMP-1 existed in eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues of endometriosis, which could enhance the ectopic invasion and transplant of endometrial cells. Neiyi Recipe could inhibit the invasion of endometrial stromal cells and the expression of MMP-9.
