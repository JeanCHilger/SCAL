Expression of the tumor suppressor miR-206 is associated with cellular proliferative inhibition and impairs invasion in ERα-positive endometrioid adenocarcinoma. This study investigated the role of miR-206 in estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-positive endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EEC). We profiled miR-206 expression in 30 EEC clinical samples using qRT-PCR, and explored its relationship with ERα and clinical parameters. A luciferase reporter assay assessed the ERα targeting potential of miR-206. Functional analyses of miR-206 were performed in EEC cell lines. MiRNA-206 expression decreased in ERα-positive EECs, and its expression was negatively correlated with ERα. MiRNA-206 overexpression inhibited ERα-dependent proliferation, impaired invasiveness and induced cell cycle arrest of ERα-positive EEC cell lines. Therefore, aberrantly expressed miRNA-206 may be associated with the development of ERα-positive EEC.
