Association of the IL-6 gene 634C/G polymorphism with susceptibility to endometriosis. To investigate the association of interleukin 6 gene (IL-6) promoter region 634C/G (rs1800796) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with the genetic susceptibility to endometriosis (Ems) in south Han Chinese women.A case-control study was performed in 432 Ems patients and 499 control women to evaluate the SNP of IL-6 634C/G by using a fluorescent quantitative PCR-based high resolution melting (HRM) method.There were statistical significances in the IL-6 634C/G alleles, whether or not to carry allele G and genotype distributions between Ems patients and control women (P=0.032, 0.014 and 0.045, respectively). Allele C enhanced the risk of Ems 1.057 times while allele G reduced the risk of Ems 0.835 time. Carrying allele G reduced the risk of Ems 0.822 time, whereas not carrying allele G enhanced the risk of Ems 1.143 times. Compared with genotype CC, the risk of Ems with genotype CG reduced 0.704 time (95% CI: 0.533-0.931). There was no significant difference in whether or not carrying allele G distribution between Ems patients and control women (P=0.729).The present study demonstrated significant association between the SNP of IL-6 634C/G and genetic susceptibility to Ems in south Han Chinese women.
