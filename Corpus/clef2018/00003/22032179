Peritoneal keratin granuloma associated with endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus. We present a 69-year-old woman with a chief complaint of postmenopausal bleeding. She was diagnosed as having an endometrioid adenocarcinoma by biopsy, and underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy. At the time of surgery, granulation tissue-like nodules were found on the peritoneal serosa of the uterus. In the intraoperative cytology of peritoneal washing, atypical cells were noted. The intraoperative frozen section of the peritoneal nodule revealed granulation tissue with proliferating mesothelial cells. Microscopic examination of the permanent section showed keratin granulomas without viable adenocarcinoma cells on the serosal surface of the ovaries, fallopian tubes and broad ligaments. Postoperative chemotherapy was administered. She has been alive with no evidence of recurrence for 6 months postoperatively. It should be noted that the prognosis of cases in peritoneal keratin granuloma without viable cancer cells is favorable, and that the histological examination is essential for its diagnosis.
