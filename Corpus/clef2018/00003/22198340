Tumor budding and E-Cadherin expression in endometrial carcinoma: are they prognostic factors in endometrial cancer? To evaluate the prognostic value of tumor budding (TB) in endometrioid (EEC) and non-endometrioid endometrial cancers (NEEC) and to determine its correlation with expression of E-cadherin.Ninety-five patients with primary endometrial carcinoma were examined statistically. All patients were diagnosed, treated, and given follow-up care at Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine. Tumor budding detected by either H&E-stained sections and anticytokeratin-staining C11. The tissue block with the largest invasive front was chosen for budding counting and immunostaining. E-cadherin expression was examined by immunohistochemistry using the primary antibodies against to it.Tumor budding was low-grade in 73 and high-grade in 22 cases. E-cadherin expression loss was identified in 48 patients. The high-grade TB was significantly higher in patients with advanced stage and deep myometrial invasion (p=0.032 and 0.018, respectively). E-Cadherin expression was significantly lower in NEECs than EECs (p=0.032). The negative expression of E-cadherin was associated with advanced stage and poor differentiation (p=0.001 and p=0.024, respectively). We determined that tumor budding adversely correlated with the presence of E-cadherin expression but not statistically significant. Based on the results of multivariate analysis, TB has an independent impact on cumulative overall survival. We found no statistically significant difference between E-cadherin expression and survival.TB is associated with undifferentiated tumor, advanced stage and decreased postoperative survival in endometrial cancer. It might be a valuable prognostic clinicopathologic factor which can be applicable in routine examination.
