Thoracic endometriosis unmasked by ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilization. Thoracic endometriosis syndrome is a well-described, rare manifestation of endometriosis. We present a case of a 35-year old woman undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation prior to in vitro fertilization (IVF) who developed bilateral hemorrhagic pleural effusions. She was initially diagnosed with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, a complication of infertility therapy however, she was later found to have occult thoracic endometriosis. We describe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and review the manifestations of thoracic endometriosis syndrome. Although endometriosis is a hormone-dependent disease, the rate of IVF complications related to endometriosis is low.
