Leuprolide acetate: pharmaceutical use and delivery potentials. Thanks to recent advances in biotechnology, the use of peptides and proteins as drugs has become a concrete clinical reality, and consequently an interesting challenge has emerged for non-parenteral drug delivery. Leuprolide is a synthetic nonapeptide agonist to the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) receptor with principal clinical applications for prostate cancer. Although a large number of formulations available, they mainly consist in depot subcutaneous injections or implantable devices. Both of these routes of administration present multiple limitations considering the large clinical applications of this active substance.The objective of this review is to critically discuss the formulations currently available on the market for leuprolide optimization and to consider how drug delivery plays an important role in improving the bioavailability of this compound.Due to its physicochemical properties and its economical market, leuprolide is an interesting candidate for drug delivery to improve the efficacy of existing treatments, dose adjustments, and patient compliance and safety.
