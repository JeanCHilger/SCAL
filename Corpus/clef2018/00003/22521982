General practitioners and the challenge of endometriosis screening and care: results of a survey. To evaluate the knowledge of general practitioners concerning the endometriosis diagnostic and care.Survey enrolling 100 general practitioners of the 76th Seine Maritime French department (region of Upper Normandy) who usually perform gynaecological follow up, asked to answer an irreversible 36 item step-by-step questionnaire.Among them, 44% perform more than one gynaecological consultation each week. They were 63% to feel ill at ease in the diagnosis and follow up of women presenting with endometriosis. One half of physicians could not cite three main symptoms of the disease out of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain and infertility. Only 38% of general practitioners perform a clinical gynaecological examination when they suspect the endometriosis, and 28% of them recommended MRI to confirm the diagnosis. They are 24% to refer the patient without delay, but only 52% to the universitary hospital, which is the tertiary regional referral center, while 68% of them refer to a fellow practicing in a private facility. They were 64% to believe that therapeutic amenorrhea is on the bottom of the medical therapy. General practitioners were more likely to accurately answer the questionnaire when they attended gynaecological advanced courses during previous 5 years and when they followed up more than three patients previously managed for endometriosis.General practitioners' knowledge about endometriosis is limited, with possible direct consequences on the delay of the diagnosis. The attendance of gynaecological advanced courses and the exchange of information between gynaecologic surgeons and general practitioners who follow up the patients appear to be two-way to improve the accuracy of the answers to the questionnaire.
