Discovered on gastrointestinal stromal tumours 1 (DOG1) expression in non-gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) neoplasms. To further characterize discovered on GIST1 (DOG1) antibody clone K9 expression in a broad range of mesenchymal and epithelial tumours.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of various tumours were stained with the anti-DOG1 monoclonal antibody clone K9. The tumours (n = 187) included: gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) (n = 20) malignant melanoma (n = 19)Our study supports that DOG-1 is a highly sensitive and specific marker for GISTs and also highlights hitherto unrecognized and unusual patterns of expression in non-mesenchymal neoplasms.
