Simplified approach to the treatment of endometriosis--ECO system. The aim of the present study was to develop a system to facilitate the approach for patients with endometriosis, mainly for non-specialized gynecologists.This was a multicenter study (Canadian Task Force classification II-3). The study aimed to correlate three known parameters for endometriosis, qualifying and quantifying their importance in terms of disease severity and treatment complexity. Patients were divided into three groups.Each parameter was scored from 0 to 2 in order to determine medical or surgical management for endometriosis based on the clinical and imaging results, where the total score of 0 to 2 was for medical treatment, score 3 was possible medical treatment or surgical and score of 4 to 6 was for surgical intervention. A total score from the three parameters was obtained. Anatomical extent of infiltration and complaints and objective of the patient was helpful in deciding on management of patients with endometriosis.The ECO system can be a qualified and helpful tool in the approach to patients with suspected endometriosis, mainly for non-specialized gynecologists.
