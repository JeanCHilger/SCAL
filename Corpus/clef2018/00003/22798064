The relationship between pregnancy and oxidative stress markers on patients undergoing ovarian stimulations. We investigated the activities and relevance of a validated panel of antioxidant enzymes, cytokines, specific lipid peroxidation end products and six fatty acids by correlational analyses with peak E(2) levels and pregnancy outcome after ovarian stimulation for IVF or IUI.Blood samples obtained from 15 patients undergoing ovarian stimulation with rFSH or hMG were divided into two groups. Group-1 was baseline blood collected on day-2-3 of women cycle. Group-2 is blood collected at the end of FSH/hMG injection. Serum was collected and stored in liquid nitrogen at -196 Â°C until analysis. Standard IVF and IUI procedures were followed. The serum levels of Paraoxonase (PON1), Superoxide Dismutases (SOD), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), 8-Isoprostane, and fatty acids Arachidic, Palmitic, Stearic, Oleic, Linoleic & Linolenic were measured.With the exception of 8-Isoprostane, results showed a positive correlation between baseline and peak levels of E(2) and that of SOD, GPx, PON1, and IL-6. The PON1, IL-6 and SOD were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in pregnant than non-pregnant group. Fatty acid levels at baseline and peak E(2) were not different but pregnancy rates were found to be decreasing with higher palmitic, and stearic acid levels.Ovarian stimulation causes a significant increase in serum PON1, SOD, GPx and IL-6 activity in women undergoing IVF or IUI. The high levels of IL-6, SOD, and PON1 and lower levels of palmitic, and stearic acids in the pregnancy positive group indicate that these oxidative stress and nutritional factors may be used as a predictive marker in controlled ovarian stimulation success.
