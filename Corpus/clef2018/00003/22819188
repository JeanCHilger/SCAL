The pathophysiology of uterine adenomyosis: an update. The diagnosis of adenomyosis using noninvasive techniques such as vaginal ultrasounds and magnetic resonance has clear clinical applications and has renewed the interest in the pathogenesis of uterine adenomyosis. However, the research remains hampered by the lack of consensus on the classification of lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging and transvaginal ultrasound have comparable diagnostic accuracy. Minimal interventional biopsy techniques have recently been introduced. This article reviews human and animal studies and provides an update on the pathophysiology of adenomyosis. Recent views on the pathogenesis and links with endometriosis are discussed.
