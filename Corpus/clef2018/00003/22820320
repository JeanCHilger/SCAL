Comparative study on the pregnancy outcomes of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer between long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist combined with transvaginal ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration and long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist alone. To retrospectively analyze the effects of long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) combined with transvaginal ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration on the pregnancy outcomes of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) in the infertile patients with ovarian endometriosis.The 134 patients with ovarian endometriosis who underwent GnRH-a combined with transvaginal ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration and IVF-ET were served as experimental group. The 102 patients with ovarian endometriosis who underwent GnRH-a and IVF-ET were served as control group. After treatment, the cyst size, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), number of ovum pick-up, fertility rate, cleavage rate, high-quality embryo rate, implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate and abortion rate were compared between the two groups.In the 134 patients of experimental group, 138 cysts disappeared after GnRH-a combined with three times of transvaginal ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration. In the 102 patients of control group, of the 114 cysts, 34 disappeared after GnRH-a, 67 were decreased and 13 were unchanged. The abortion rate was significantly lower in experimental group than in control group. The level of serum E2 on HCG day, the number of ovarian follicles with 14 mm or more, the number of retrieved oocytes, high-quality embryo rate, implantation rate and clinical pregnancy rate were higher in experimental group than in control group (all P<0.05).GnRH-a combined with transvaginal ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration can obtain better therapeutic effects and pregnancy outcomes in infertile patients with ovarian endometriosis who underwent IVF-ET.
