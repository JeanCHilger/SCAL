Animal models in endometriosis experimental research. Sampson's menstrual reflux theory is commonly used to explain the origin of endometriotic lesions in women. However, their pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Validated research models need to be developed with the aim of studying mechanisms by which endometrial cells from menstrual reflux implant and grow, and investigating if potential new markers or molecules could be envisaged as diagnostic or therapeutic tools. The present review looks at the different existing murine and non-human primate models of endometriosis, and evaluates their principal uses.
