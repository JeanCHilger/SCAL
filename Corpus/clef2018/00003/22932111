Influence of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist on the expression of mRNA of nerve growth factor and its receptors in eutopic endometrial stromal cells. To investigate the influence of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) on the expression mRNA of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptors (TrkA and P75NTR) in normal and eutopic endometrial stromal cells (ESC).From January to April 2009, 3 patients with endometriosis undergoing surgery in Peking Union Medical College Hospital were obtained eutopic endometrium as study group matched with eutopic endometrium from 3 patients with teratoma as control group. ESC were incubated with different concentration of GnRH-a (0, 5×10⁻¹¹, 5×10⁻¹⁰, 5×10⁻⁹, 5×10⁻⁸, 5×10⁻⁷ g/ml). The expression of mRNA of NGF, TrkA and P75NTR were measured by real-time-PCR.At concentration of 0 g/ml, the levels of NGF, TrkA and P75NTR mRNA in ESC were 6.32, 8.55, 8.08 in study group, which were significantly higher than 0.94, 0.67, 1.08 in control group (P < 0.05). Treated by the following concentration of GnRH-a (5×10⁻¹¹, 5×10⁻¹⁰, 5×10⁻⁹, 5×10⁻⁸, 5×10⁻⁷ g/ml), the median expression of NGF, TrkA and P75NTR mRNA was 1.00, 0.96, 1.05 1.09, 0.82, 1.27The expression of NGF, TrkA and P75NTR mRNA were suppressed by GnRH-a.
