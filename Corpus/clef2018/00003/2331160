Bladder endometriosis. Although uncommon, vesical endometriosis is considered an important disease entity due to the diagnostic difficulties it presents and the different therapeutic options that are available. A case of long-standing vesical endometriosis that caused considerable suffering to the patient is reported. The foregoing condition was refractory to hormone therapy and late radical surgical treatment by partial cystectomy and hysterectomy failed to achieve good results. The clinical and therapeutic aspects of the present case are compared with those reported elsewhere. We underscore the importance of biopsy by transurethral resection in its diagnosis as well as the need for a more effective therapeutic approach.
