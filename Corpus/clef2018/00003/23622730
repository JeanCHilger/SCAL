Chemokines in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and infertility. Endometriosis is a chronic benign disease that affects women of reproductive age causing abdominal pain and infertility. Its pathogenesis remains obscure despite all the research conducted over the past 100 years. However, there is a consensus among the specialists that the basis of its pathophysiology would be multifactorial. Many publications have demonstrated that chemokines are somehow associated with the development of endometriosis and infertility. In this study, we reviewed all PubMed literature using MeSH terms "chemokines" and "endometriosis" as well as "chemokines" and "female infertility" to establish what we know and what we do not yet know about this relationship.
