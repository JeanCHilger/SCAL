Differential expression of IL-8 and IL-8 receptors in benign, borderline and malignant ovarian epithelial tumours. Ovarian Cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancy. The poor prognosis is mainly due to presentation at a late stage and poor response to therapy. Much research is needed to identify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer. Interleukin-8 is expressed by many tumour types and is known to have mitogenic, motogenic and angiogenic effects on tumour cells.The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of IL-8 and IL-8 receptors (IL-8RA and IL-8RB) in different histological subtypes of ovarian tumours, as potential prognostic biomarkers in ovarian tumours.Immunohitochemistry was used to study the expression of IL-8 and IL-8 receptors in 115 ovarian tumours including 21 benign tumours, 25 borderline tumours and 69 carcinomas of serous, clear cell, endometrioid and mucinous types. The correlation of expression profile, tumour type, stage, and progression free survival and overall survival was statistically analysed.IL-8 and IL-8 receptors were expressed in all types of tumours with variable intensity and subcellular distribution. There was a statistically significant correlation between levels of expression and tumour stage and tumour type, being mostly significant in serous tumours. No correlation with patient progression free survival or overall survival was found.This is the first study investigating the expression of IL-8 and IL-8 receptors using immunohistochemistry in different types of ovarian tumours, including benign and borderline tumours. IL-8 and IL-8RA are potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in ovarian cancer, particularly in ovarian serous carcinoma.
