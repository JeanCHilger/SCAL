Puerarin suppresses proliferation of endometriotic stromal cells in part via differential recruitment of nuclear receptor coregulators to estrogen receptor-α. Puerarin, a phytoestrogen with a weak estrogenic effect, binds to estrogen receptors, thereby competing with 17β-estradiol and producing an anti-estrogenic effect. In our early clinical practice to treat endometriosis, a better therapeutic effect was achieved if the formula of traditional Chinese medicine included Radix puerariae. This study was to investigate whether puerarin could suppress the proliferation of endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs) and to further elucidate the potential mechanism.The ESCs were successfully established. The effects of puerarin on the proliferation of ESCs, cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein levels of cyclin D1 and cdc25A were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation was applied to examine the recruitment of nuclear receptor coregulators to the estrogen receptor-α. We found that puerarin can suppress estrogen-stimulated proliferation partly through down-regulating the transcription of cyclin D1 and cdc25A by promoting the recruitment of corepressors to estrogen receptor-α as well as limiting that of coactivators in ESCs.Our data suggest that puerarin could suppress the proliferation of ESCs and could be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of endometriosis.
