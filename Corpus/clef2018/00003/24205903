Nowadays, unwanted pregnancy is a major globe tragedy for millions of women, associated with significant direct and indirect costs, no matter for individuals or society. The progesterone receptor antagonist steroid, mifepristone has been widely and effectively using throughout the world for medical abortion, but to a lesser extent for emergency contraception. In this review, we hope to explore the role of mifepristone as a contraceptive, particularly for emergency contraception. Studies of mifepristone have also been expanding to the fields of endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Furthermore, this initially considered reproductive medicine has been investigated in some psychotic diseases and various disorders of hypercortisolism, because of its glucocorticoid receptor antagonism. Mifepristone was approved suitable for patients with hyperglycemia secondary to Cushing's syndrome by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012. The aim of this article is to review published reports on the anti-progesterone and anti-glucocorticoid properties of mifepristone as a clinical agent. There is a new insight into systematically describing and evaluating the potential efficiency of mifepristone administrated in the field of endocrine and neuroendocrine, not only in obstetrics and gynecology.
