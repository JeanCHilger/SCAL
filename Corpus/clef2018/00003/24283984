Evaluation of elevated urinary enolase I levels in patients with endometriosis. The aim of this study is to validate and investigate the clinical value of urinary enolase I in patients with endometriosis.Urine samples of 39 patients with histologically confirmed endometriosis and 20 patients without endometriosis were collected. Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect the increase of enolase I in patients' urine.Urinary enolase I expression corrected for creatinine ratio (non neuronal enolase (NNE)-Cr) was significantly greater in patients with endometriosis (p = 0.026). When the diagnostic performance of NNE-Cr was evaluated with serum CA-125 combination, the area under the curve was 0.821 (95% confidence interval 0.713-0.928) with sensitivity and specificity of 76.9% and 85.0%, respectively.Elevated urinary enolase I, in conjunction with serum CA-125, may be used as a potential biomarker for endometriosis.
