Fatal case of luteinized thecoma with sclerosing peritonitis in a 40-year-old woman. We describe the pathologic and clinical presentation of a very rare, fatal case of luteinized thecoma with sclerosing peritonitis in a 40-year-old woman, who had a history of total abdominal hysterectomy and a left salpingo-oophorectomy in 2003. The patient presented with abdominal pain, and radiologic examinations revealed a 10-cm heterogenous right pelvic mass with partial necrosis. The patient eventually underwent an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed an ovarian tumor with multiple implants in the peritoneal cavity. The ovarian lesion was made up of spindle cells among clusters of luteinized stromal cells that expanded to the ovarian cortex. Tumor cells were positive for vimentin, estrogen and progesterone receptors, and CCD68 (focally) and negative for CD34, α-smooth muscle actin, β-catenin, and desmin by immunohistochemical studies. Luteinized cells were positive for α-inhibin and calretinin. Tumor cells exhibited low Ki-67 proliferation indices. The patient died because of the sclerosing peritonitis component of the disease.
