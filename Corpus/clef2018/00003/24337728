Polypoid endometriosis of the cervix: a case report and review of the literature. Giant and multilobular endocervical polyps are rare and need to be differentiated from cervical neoplastic lesions.The authors report a 29-year-old sexually inactive woman presenting with a prolapsed giant endocervical polyp, associated with malodorous discharge and menorrhagia. The wide-based polyp originated in part from the posterior lip of the exocervix and in part from the endocervix. This trilobular pedunculated mass (90 × 50 × 35 mm) had small cysts on the surface and focal areas of haemorrhage. Microscopic examination revealed areas with classic endocervical mucosal polyp histology intimately mixed with expanses of endometrial stroma and occasional endometrial glands. Immunohistochemically the endometrial stroma showed strong CD10 positivity, glands were oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive and Ki-67 proliferation index was low.Polypoid endometriosis of the cervix is a distinct form of endometriosis that may be mistaken for a neoplasm. Five earlier reports of this entity have not described a prolapsed polyp assuming gigantic proportions. We conclude that this condition be considered in the differential diagnosis of polypoid lesions of the cervix.
