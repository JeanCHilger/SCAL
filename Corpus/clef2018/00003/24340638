Oncogynecological aspects of adnexal masses. Adnexal masses are frequently found in both symptomatic and asymptomatic women. The frequency of them is 7,8% in reproductive aged women and 2,5-18% in postmenopausal patients.to investigate clinical significance of the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) and to compare it with histological findings in patients with adnexal masses.345 patients with adnexal masses were evaluated. Depending on the menopausal status, serum CA-125 level and ultrasonographic findings RMI scores were calculated for each of patients.according to RMI all the patients were divided in to two groups: first group - 283 (62%) of patients with RMI less then 200 and the second group -52 (38%) women with RMI more then 200. The patients of the second group were referred to the oncologist. Among the patients with RMI <200, 137(48,4%) endometriomas, 73(25,8%) serous cystadenoma, 45(15,9%) dermoid cysts, 22(7,8%) paraovarian cysts, 2 (0,7%) adenocarcinoma were detected after histological examination. In patients with RMI >200, 25% of benign ovarian tumors, 34,6% of borderline and 40, 4% of malignant tumors were verified.RMI when used in the presence of a pelvic mass is a useful triage tool to determine those women who should be referred to a gynaecological oncologist. During laparoscopy, in cases of intraoperative malignancy suspicion staging should be performed: videorecord of the surgery, biopsy of the adnexal mass and contralateral ovary, biopsy of the omentum and peritoneum, and aspiration of the peritoneal fluid for cytological examination.
