Bowel endometriosis. Bowel obstruction accounts for 20% of hospital admissions due to acute abdominal pain. We report a case of acute bowel obstruction in a 31-year-old woman with a history of endometriosis diagnosed on laparoscopy a year before this presentation. Her clinical and biochemical picture suggested peritonitis and CT revealed an irregular soft tissue mass compressing a dilated rectosigmoid. Pockets of intraperitoneal gas were also documented and presumed to be secondary to bowel perforation at the level of the mass. Exploratory laparotomy was performed and the affected bowel was resected. Histology revealed extensive stricturing and fibrosis secondary to intestinal endometriosis. General practitioners, gastroenterologists and general surgeons are likely to encounter endometriosis, need to be competent in its diagnosis and management and collaborate promptly with the gynaecologist. Endometriosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of every woman of childbearing age who presents with any gastrointestinal or abdominal symptom.
