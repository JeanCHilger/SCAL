Study on microRNA expression in endometrium of luteal phase and its relationship with infertility of endometriosis. To study the different expression of microRNA(miRNA) including mir-29c, mir-200a, mir-145 in the mid-secretary endometrium and its relationship with infertility of endometriosis.From August 2011 to February 2013, 36 infertile cases with endometriosis confirmed by laparoscopy and pathology and excluded the other infertile factors in Department of Reproductive Medicine in Peking University Shenzhen Hospital were enrolled in this study, which were divided into 17 cases with stage I-II, 19 cases with stage III-IV according to the revised classification American Fertility Society. Forty-four healthy women with male factor infertility were chosen as control group. The relative expression levels of mir-29c, mir-200a, mir-145 in the endometrium of women in two groups were detected by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Those women were followed up for pregnancy outcome of endometriosis group after assisted reproductive techniques (pregnancy and non-pregnancy group respectively).(1) The expression of miRNA between endometriosis and control groups:the average expression level of mir-29c, mir-200a, mir-145 in the endometrium of endometriosis group was 2.46 ± 1.98, 3.20 ± 2.45, 6.378 ± 3.275, which were significantly higher than 1.36 ± 1.05, 2.04 ± 1.16, 4.548 ± 1.885 in control group (P = 0.026, 0.027, 0.041, respectively). (2) The expression of miRNA between I-II stage and III-IV: the average expression level of mir-29c, mir-200a, mir-145 in the endometrium was 0.53 ± 0.51, 0.33 ± 0.26, 0.048 ± 0.021 in patients with of stage I-II, while 0.26 ± 0.18, 0.28 ± 0.12, 0.045 ± 0.016 in stage III-IV respectively, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups (P = 0.191,0.661,0.753, respectively) . (3) The expression of miRNA between pregnancy and non-pregnancy groups:the average expression level of mir-29c, mir-200a, mir-145 in the endometrium were 0.60 ± 0.30, 1.23 ± 0.48, 0.886 ± 0.238 in pregnancy group, while 2.64 ± 1.73, 4.39 ± 2.58, 7.199 ± 3.945 in non pregnancy group, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups (P = 0.030,0.039,0.028, respectively).Up-regulation of mir-29c, mir-200a, mir-145 in the endometrial tissue might play a role in endometriosis associated infertility.
