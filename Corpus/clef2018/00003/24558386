The association between endometriosis and chronic endometritis. To evaluate the association between endometriosis and chronic endometritis.Endometrial specimens were obtained from 71 patients, 34 with endometriosis (endometriosis group) and 37 without endometriosis (non-endometriosis group), who underwent hysterectomy, and the specimens were immunostained for the plasmacyte marker CD138. The rate of chronic endometritis was compared between the endometriosis group and the non-endometriosis group. Furthermore, the 71 patients were also divided into two groups, 28 with chronic endometritis (chronic endometritis group) and 43 without chronic endometritis (non-chronic endometritis group). Logistic regression analysis was performed with variables including age, body mass index (BMI), gravidity and parity, and diagnoses of leiomyoma, adenomyosis, and endometriosis on pathology to examine the independent effect of each variable on chronic endometritis. Patients suffering from cervical invasive carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, and endometrial polyps or treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, progestins, or oral contraceptives before surgery were excluded.Chronic endometritis was identified in 52.94% of the endometriosis group and 27.02% of the non-endometriosis group (p<0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that endometriosis was associated with chronic endometritis.This result suggests a strong association between endometriosis and chronic endometritis.
