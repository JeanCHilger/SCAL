Müllerianosis of the urinary bladder: a rare tumorlike lesion. Müllerianosis was first described as a rare entity consisting of an admixture of cervical, tubaric, or endometrial epithelium within the lamina propria and muscularis propria of the urinary bladder. This lesion occurs mainly in the dome or posterior wall of the urinary bladder in women of fertile age. Its clinical presentation is characterized by hematuria, pelvic pain, and dysuria, nonspecific symptoms that are related to the responsiveness of müllerian glands to hormonal stimuli. The major interest of müllerianosis resides in its similarity, from clinical, cytologic, and histologic viewpoints, to more threatening conditions, such as neoplasias. The clinical context and the identification of periglandular endometrial stroma at histologic examination with conventional hematoxylin-eosin stain, as well as the immunohistochemical demonstration of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the glands, are of diagnostic utility in the differential diagnosis. Müllerianosis may be responsive to gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. Surgical resection may be justified in the case of clinical symptoms refractory to hormone therapy.
