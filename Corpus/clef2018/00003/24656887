Concurrent estrogen action was essential for maximal progestin effect in oral contraceptives. To investigate the impact of estrogen contained in oral contraceptives (OCs) on the action of progestin on ovarian endometrioma epithelial cells.Experimental in vitro study and immunohistochemical analysis.University hospital.Patients who underwent surgery due to ovarian endometrioma.Not applicable.Telomerase-immortalized epithelial cells derived from ovarian endometrioma were treated with norethindorone (NET 80 nmol/L) or levonorgestrel (LNGNET or LNG effectively suppressed cell growth, and addition of EE significantly enhanced the growth suppression. This EE-mediated enhancement of cell growth suppression was observed only in cells that expressed ERα and therefore was ERα dependent. Western blot analysis revealed that expression of PRB was significantly induced by the addition of EE. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that ERα expression and PRB expression are significantly correlated, indicating that progestin-sensitive cells with PRB expression are predisposed to react with estrogen stimulation.These findings suggest that EE contained in OCs plays a supportive role in progestin-induced growth inhibition of ovarian endometrioma epithelial cells. In the absence of estrogen priming, concurrent estrogen action was essential for rapid induction of PR to achieve maximal progestin effect.
