Effect of interleukin-1β on expressions of activin A and its related factors in cultured endometrial stromal cells from patients with endometriosis. To study the effect of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) on the expressions activin A, follistatin, and cripto in cultured human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) form patients with endometriosis.Cultured HESCs were stimulated with 250, 500, and 750pg/ml IL-1β, and the mRNA and protein expressions of activin A, follistatin, and cripto were assayed using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.IL-1β treatment caused significant dose-dependent increments of the mRNA and protein expressions of activin A and follistatin and of the mRNA expression of cripto in cultured HESCs.IL-1β can affect the expressions of activin A, follistatin and cripto in HESCs from patients with endometriosis.
