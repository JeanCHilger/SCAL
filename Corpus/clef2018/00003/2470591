The cytokeratin profiles of ovarian common "epithelial" tumors. An improved immunohistochemical determination of the cytokeratin profiles of epithelia and their neoplasms is possible using monoclonal antibodies that will either identify all 19 cytokeratins (AE1/3) or delineate specific subsets (35 beta H11, 34 beta E12, 34 beta B4 and Cam 5.2). Ovarian common "epithelial" tumors (CET) contain cytokeratin filaments. To determine the nature and differences in the cytokeratin profiles of ovarian CET, eight benign Brenner tumors, four serous cystadenofibromas, 28 mucinous tumors, 27 serous tumors and six endometrioid, five clear cell and five undifferentiated carcinomas, as well as nine normal ovaries were immunostained with the above five antibodies. AE1/3 staining was predominant, while Cam 5.2 and 35 beta H11 displayed the most frequent staining thereafter. Statistically significant staining differences were found between a number of tumor groups using the antibodies 35 beta H11, 34 beta E12 and Cam 5.2. In this study, all ovarian CET, except the benign Brenner tumors, displayed a predominantly low molecular weight cytokeratin profile. The same profile in the normal surface epithelium lends credence to the belief that these tumors are derived from this epithelium. A significant staining difference between some of the tumor types using some of the antibodies suggests a possible ancillary, diagnostic role of cytokeratin profiling in situations where exact tumor typing is difficult.
