Biomarkers of peritoneal fluid in endometriosis identified by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. This work aims to detect the peritoneal fluid proteomic patterns in endometriosis patients, build diagnostic models, and evaluate its clinical significance.The authors used SELDI-TOF-MS protein chip array technology to detect biomarkers of peritoneal fluid in endometriosis patients. Fourteen endometriosis patients and 16 persons without endometriosis as control group were tested.Four potential biomarkers (4428m/z, 6891m/z, 13766m/z, and 6427m/z) were found.This method showed great potential in screening better biomarkers for endometriosis.
