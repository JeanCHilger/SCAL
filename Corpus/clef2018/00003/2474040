The production and characterization of monoclonal antibody, 1C5, reactive with cervical adenocarcinoma of the uterus. A new monoclonal antibody, 1C5, was produced by fusion of spleen cells obtained from mice immunized with CAC-1, a human cell line of cervical adenocarcinoma of the uterus, and NS-1 myeloma cell. The objectives of this study were to obtain moAb that can be used for routine histology and cytology, and to examine the histogenesis of cervical adenocarcinoma. 1. 1C5 reacted with 88% of cervical adenocarcinoma of the uterus, but did not react with cervical squamous cell carcinoma of the uterus and other squamous cell carcinoma. However, 1C5 reacted with some adenocarcinomas, such as endometrial carcinoma of the uterus and ovarial carcinoma. 2. The staining pattern by 1C5 was different, in cervical adenocarcinoma from that in endometrial carcinoma of the uterus, and also different in the endocervical type from that in the endometrioid type of cervical adenocarcinoma. Therefore, 1C5 is useful in distinguishing between two types of adenocarcinoma of the uterus. 3. 1C5 did not react with normal squamous cells or normal columnar cells of the uterine cervix, or with normal endometrial cells of the uterus. However, the columnar cells in a limited area of the squamocolumnar junction were strongly stained with 1C5. 4. 1C5 reacted with ethanol-fixed, and routine formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue. Thus, 1C5 may be used for clinical diagnosis. 5. 1C5 was found to be IgG1. 6. The molecular weight of the 1C5-defined antigen was 26,000 daltons, and the epitope of the 1C5-defined antigen was carbohydrate moiety. 7. We examined the histogenesis of cervical adenocarcinoma of the uterus by utilizing the reactivity of 1C5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
