Serum prolactin and CA-125 levels as biomarkers of peritoneal endometriosis. To evaluate serum prolactin and CA-125 levels as biomarkers for the diagnosis of peritoneal endometriosis.A prospective study was performed. Blood samples were drawn from a peripheral vein during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle (day 19-21 prior to the surgery) to analyze through relative operating characteristic curve the serum prolactin and CA-125 levels for diagnosis of peritoneal endometriosis. The study was performed with 97 participants, 63 women with peritoneal endometriosis and 34 healthy women.The sensitivity and specificity of peritoneal endometriosis diagnosis were equivalent for prolactin (21 and 99%) and for CA-125 (27 and 97% p = 0.58). These two markers were used in a parallel test utilizing the usual cutoff (prolactin 20.0 ng/ml and CA-125 35 U/I). The sensitivity and specificity were 44 and 99%. However, by utilizing the best cutoff (prolactin 14.8 ng/ml and for CA-125 19.8 U/I), sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value were 77, 88 and 97%, respectively.Serum CA-125 and prolactin levels assessed together, and considering the cutoff for CA-125 (19.9 U/I) and prolactin (14.8 ng/ml), allow the diagnosis of peritoneal endometriosis with acceptable sensitivity and specificity (77 and 88%) and a high negative predictive value (97%).
