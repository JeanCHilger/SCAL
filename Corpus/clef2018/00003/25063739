MicroRNA-370 suppresses proliferation and promotes endometrioid ovarian cancer chemosensitivity to cDDP by negatively regulating ENG. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally inhibit gene expression. In this study, we discovered that microRNA-370 (miR-370) was down-regulated in endometrioid ovarian cancer cells. In IGROV1 and TOV112D endometrioid ovarian cancer cells, miR-370 suppressed cellular viability and colony formation. miR-370 also enhanced endometrioid ovarian cancer cell chemosensitivity to cDDP. Endoglin (ENG) was directly and negatively regulated by miR-370. In addition, hypermethylation was a potential mechanism of miR-370 epigenetic silencing. We conclude that miR-370 acts as a tumor suppressor in endometrioid ovarian cancer via ENG regulation.
