Spontaneous cutaneous umbilical endometriosis: a rare variant of extragenital endometriosis. Umbilical endometriosis is a very uncommon condition which presents as a pigmented umbilical nodule, papular or cystic, with symptoms punctuated rhythmed by menses. The authors report the case of a 32-year-old with spontaneous umbilical endometriosis. Surgical resection was performed with a good cosmetic result and no recurrence at six months. A review of the literature allowed the authors to discuss the diagnosis difficulties and treatment in a underdeveloped country.
