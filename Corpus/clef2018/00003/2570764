Monthly administration of the LH-RH analogue decapeptyl for long-term treatment of ovarian dysfunctions and estrogen-dependent disorders. The ovarian function of 11 patients suffering from estrogen-dependent disorders and ovarian dysfunction was suppressed by monthly administrations of an analogue of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH). During the initial 11 to 18 days of treatment, the LH-RH analogue Decapeptyl was subcutaneously injected daily, followed by intramuscular administration of the peptide encapsulated in biodegradable microspheres at 30-day intervals over a 13- to 35-week period. After an initial increase on day 1 of treatment, serum levels of both LH and FSH declined, but did not reach hypogonadotropic values. The pituitary response in the release of both LH and FSH by a LH-RH bolus injection was almost completely suppressed during the treatment course. 17 beta-Estradiol serum levels decreased into the castration range within 9.1 +/- 4 days and remained low in 92% of the values estimated. In one patient, pretreatment mean testosterone levels on the order of 1.9 ng/mL were suppressed to normal within 14 days and remained low under therapy. Seven out of the 11 patients benefited from this therapy. In conclusion, the treatment with Decapeptyl in a slow-release formulation is an effective and suitable approach for the long-term suppression of ovarian function in estrogen-dependent disorders and ovarian dysfunctions.
