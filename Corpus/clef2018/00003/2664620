CA-125 in women with endometriosis. The serum CA-125 level is elevated in most women with endometriosis. Although tests are readily available to measure the marker, simple modifications of the present assays are required to improve and standardize the quality of the measurements. The serum test has low sensitivity and would not be appropriate for general screening purposes, but in clinical situations that have a relatively high prevalence of endometriosis, CA-125 determinations have acceptable sensitivities and very high specificities. The concentrations of CA-125 correlate with both the severity and the clinical course of the disease. In women with diagnosed endometriosis, use of serial CA-125 determinations to monitor the course of the disease shows much promise in early studies. The changes in the CA-125 levels can offer additional information to the clinician about the status of the endometriosis, but how much this information will assist in the management and improve the outcome of treatment must await the results of prospective studies.
