Endometriosis as a cause of infertility. Although association between moderate or severe endometriosis and infertility is fairly well established, the link between lesser disease stages and infertility is more tenuous. The proposed mechanisms underlying this association are reviewed. These include mechanical factors, changes in the peritoneal fluid environment, activation of local or systemic immune response, and abnormalities of ovulation, fertilization, and early pregnancy.
