Establishment and characterization of human ovarian endometrioid carcinoma cell line. A new cell line, designated as HOC-I, was established from a recurrent region of ovarian endometrioid carcinoma. HOC-I was subcultivated more than 55 times. 1) The monolayer culture cells showed a pavement like arrangement with polygonal cells and had a tendency to pile up. PAS positive substance could be seen in the cytoplasm. Desmosomes, microvilli and well developed cell organelles could be found by electron microscopy. 2) The population doubling time was about 75 hours. The chromosomal number showed pseudodiploidy of which the mode was 46. 3) By heterotransplantation to the nude athymic mouse, the tumor easily developed. 4) The effects of estradiol and progesterone on the cellular growth were assessed by the 3H-TdR uptake test. Estradiol increased 3H-TdR uptake of HOC-I but progesterone decreased it. These data suggested that HOC-I had sex-steroid hormone dependency. 5) Estrogen receptor was not detected in HOC-I by the ER-EIA method or the ER-ICA method. 6) The HOC-I cells produced CA125 and TPA in culture media.
