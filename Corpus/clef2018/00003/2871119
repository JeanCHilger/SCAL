Immunohistological demonstration of peptide hormones and serotonin in ovarian mucinous and endometrioid tumors with argyrophil cells. The localization of peptide hormones and serotonin in ovarian mucinous and endometrioid tumors with argyrophil cells was examined by immunohistochemistry. All of the 15 mucinous tumors had argyrophil cells which resemble the enterochromaffin cells seen in the gastrointestinal tract, and peptide hormones such as gastrin and somatostatin were found in 3 of 5 benign, in 3 of 5 borderline, and in all of 5 malignant tumors. Serotonin was found in 4 benign, 3 borderline and 2 malignant tumors. Of 19 endometrioid adenocarcinomas, type I argyrophil cells which resemble enterochromaffin cells were found in 4 tumors, type II argyrophil cells which contain argyrophil granules mainly in the apical portion or throughout the whole cytoplasm were found in 14, and mixed type cells were found in one. Somatostatin-positive cells were found only in type I cells of a tumor with mixed type argyrophil cells. Serotonin-positive cells were found in 3 tumors containing type I cells. The results obtained were discussed in the comparison with those of cervical and endometrial adenocarcinomas of the uterus. In conclusion, the present study suggests that type I or similar argyrophil cells in ovarian tumors may have endocrine activity.
