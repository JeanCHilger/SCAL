Prognostic value of subacute focal inflammation of the endometrium, with special reference to pelvic adhesions as observed on laparoscopic examination. An eight-year review. The significance of the endometrial lesion known as subacute focal inflammation (SFI) (or the more descriptive term lymphoid aggregates [LA]) as a factor in reproductive failure is controversial. We correlated the pelvic findings of 262 consecutive laparoscopic procedures performed for infertility with the histologic diagnosis from an endometrial biopsy that had been obtained previously as part of the infertility evaluations. Pelvic adhesions were observed in 87.3% of women in whom the diagnosis of SFI had been made. Pelvic adhesions were observed in only 10.9% of women whose biopsies did not contain SFI. Of women with SFI on biopsy but without pelvic adhesions, 70.6% demonstrated American Fertility Society stage I endometriosis at laparoscopy. These findings are statistically significant (P less than .0001).
