Clinical usefulness of determination of CA 125 levels in the serum and menstrual blood. We measured CA 125 levels in sera and menstrual blood of subjects with a normal ovulatory cycle and in those with endometriosis. Serum CA 125 levels were higher in the latter, in each phase of the menstrual cycle. The CA 125 levels in patients with endometriosis, particularly those with adenomyosis, tend to be higher than in those with a normal ovulatory cycle. We propose that measurement of CA 125 in the menstrual blood may be able to help distinguishing adenomyosis from myoma uteri and may also help in assessing clinical endometriosis.
