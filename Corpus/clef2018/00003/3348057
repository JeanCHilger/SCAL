Cervicovaginal and endometrial cytology in ovarian cancer. The clinical significance of cytologic examination was studied in 114 patients with ovarian cancer who had received preoperative cytologic examinations. The overall positive rate of the cytologic examinations was 26.3% (30 of 114): 22 (19.3%) of the 114 cases had positive cervicovaginal smears while 13 of 31 endometrial aspiration smears (41.9%) were positive. The positive rate was not related to the volume of ascites but rather to its presence or absence. Thus, if ascites was observed, the positive rate was about 2.1 times higher than if it was absent. In two of four cases of ovarian cancer with no endometrial invasion but a positive cytologic examination of ascitic fluid, fallopian tube specimens contained cancer cells this suggests that ovarian cancer cells may reach the cervix and/or vagina by passing through the fallopian tube, particularly if ascites is present. Since cytologic examination, especially of endometrial aspiration smears, shows a high positive rate if ovarian cancer cells are observed in the abdominal cavity, cytology should be used as an important ancillary method for the assessment of ovarian cancer.
