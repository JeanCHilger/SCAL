Endometriosis of a scar. We report on a case of cutaneous endometriosis having developed in the scar of a cesarean section. The slowly growing cutaneous nodule did not cause any cyclic pain or swelling. Histologic examination showed mainly histiocytic granulation tissue without multinuclear cells and extensive phagocytosis of hemosiderin. Only few tubular glands were seen.
