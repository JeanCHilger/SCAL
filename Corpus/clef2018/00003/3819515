Cytologic studies of cervical adenocarcinoma. Seventy three cases of cervical adenocarcinoma, classified histologically according to WHO classification, were cytodiagnostic examined for cellular arrangement, cellular shape, nuclear shape, chromatin pattern and appearance rate of nucleolus. In adenosquamous carcinoma, the observed cancer cells were classified further into five categories and the incidence of each type was clarified. The authors obtained the following conclusions. The cytological findings in cellular arrangement, cellular shape, chromatin pattern and nucleolus findings were closely related with the degree of differentiation of endocervical type adenocarcinoma. Since no substantial cytodiagnostic differences were seen between endometrioid adenocarcinoma and endocervical type adenocarcinoma, it appears to be difficult to differentiate between them. Clear cell adenocarcinoma is characterized by sheet-like cell arrangement, polycrystal cell shape, round nuclei, finely granular chromatin pattern and appearance of macronucleolus. Among them the occurrence of macronucleolus was clearly observed and appeared of high value in making a diagnosis. Adenosquamous carcinoma, showing no characteristic finding in cytology, is proved to have morphological diversity. Careful observation of the intermediate type cancer cells is necessary to presume the histology of adenosquamous carcinoma.
