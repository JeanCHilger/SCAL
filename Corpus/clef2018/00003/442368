Ureteral endometriosis. Ureteral endometriosis poses a problem to the clinician because of its nonspecific clinical presentation and its possible confusion with ureteral tumor. To facilitate early diagnosis and the application of appropriate treatment, the gynecologist should obtain an excretory urogram on all patients with pelvic endometriosis advanced enough to require surgery, and the urologist should suspect the disease when a premenopausal woman presents with distal ureteral obstruction of unknown cause.
