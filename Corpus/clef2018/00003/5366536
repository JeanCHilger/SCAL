Some steroid hormone excretion in the urine during gestagen therapy. The urinary excretion of certain steroid hormones, estrone, estradiol-17(EZ), estriol (E3), 17-ketosteroids and pregnanediol was studied from the vaginal smears of 23 women using gestagens (Anovular and Lyndiol 2.5) as treatment for menstrual  disorder, functional sterility, secondary amenorrhea, and endometriosis. The reactivity of women treated with gestagens for genital problems was different from that of women using gestagens as contraceptives. This difference is related to the  initial state of the endocrine secretion prior to the therapy. The KI was depressed during the course of the treatment and returned to its normal levels after discontinuation of the drug.  Increased urinary excretion of estrogens (especially E2 and E3) was accompanied by low KI values and vice versa. Evaluation of the endocrine activity should be based on both cytologic smears and urinary steroid tests in order to estimate the  doses and duration of the therapy.
