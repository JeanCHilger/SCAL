The ubiquitousness of premenstrual tension in gynecologic practice. One hundred thirty-seven premenopausal women with premenstrual tension underwent laparoscopy for bleeding, pain and/or infertility. Endometriosis was the associated gynecologic disease observed most frequently (66 patients). Other associated disorders were primary dysmenorrhea (31), poststerilization syndrome (24), chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (8) and leiomyoma uteri (8). Screening for prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone in patients with galactorrhea (74) revealed one patient with pituitary microadenoma and two with primary hypothyroidism. The midluteal progesterone levels were significantly decreased, whereas the midluteal estradiol 17 beta levels were significantly elevated. Because of the frequent association of premenstrual tension with other gynecologic diseases, screening for premenstrual tension in all premenopausal women is recommended.
