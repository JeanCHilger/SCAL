Cytoplasmic steroid receptors in ovarian tumours. Cytoplasmic oestrogen receptors were measured in 40 primary and four secondary ovarian tumors of these, 43 tumors were also analysed for cytoplasmic progesterone receptors and 34 tumours for cytoplasmic androgen receptors. Serous tumours were significantly more likely to be oestrogen-receptor positive than mucinous tumours, but the incidence of positive progesterone and androgen receptors was similar in serous, mucinous and endometrioid tumours. The mean oestrogen receptor content of serous tumours was significantly higher than that of endometrioid tumours. Well-differentiated epithelial tumours were significantly more likely to be oestrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor positive than less differentiated epithelial tumours. Two granulosa cell tumours were oestrogen-receptor positive and one of these was also progesterone-receptor and androgen-receptor positive. Four normal ovaries were also analysed for receptor content and two were found to be androgen-receptor positive. The presence of cytoplasmic receptors in ovarian tumours may explain their reported response to endocrine therapy.
