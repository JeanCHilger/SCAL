Pelvic pain and endometriosis. Endometriosis is defined by the presence outside the uterine cavity of tissue histologically and functionally similar to the endometrium. Endometriosis consists of glands and an underlying cytogenic stroma. This ectopic tissue can react to hormonal stimulation: estrogens and progesterone (growth, decidualisation, withdrawal bleeding). Pain is correlated with the depth of implantation of endometriosis lesions. Deeply infiltrating endometriosis exceeds 6 mm in depth, with an incidence of between 6 and 20% of women complaining of pelvic pain. The authors review the various types of treatment and mention the special role of celio-surgery and prolonged hormone therapy.
