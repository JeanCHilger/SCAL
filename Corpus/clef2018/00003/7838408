Ovarian neoplasms and tumor markers. This is an experience about the utility of CA125 in diagnosis, staging, prognosis, and therapeutic response of ovarian cancer. The patients were 21 (the ages range was 38-66). They had an epithelial cancer (10 serous, 3 mucinous, 2 endometrioid, 6 non specific). The quantitative test of CA125 was performed with purified monoclonal antibody OC125 pre and post antineoplastic treatment. The reduction of CA125 was in connection with the neoplastic regression. Perservering or increasing values were related to neoplastic stasis or to non-responsive neoplasia, respectively. Even if the method we used was specific its sensibility is lower in patients with smallest residue disease.
