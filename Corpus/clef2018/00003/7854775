Immunocytochemical determination of EGFR, OV 632 and OC 125 in primary ovarian cancer patients. An immunocytochemistry study was performed to compare the immunoreactivity of the monoclonal antibodies OC 125, EGFR and OV 632 with smear imprints from 60 ovarian tumours (21 serous cystadenocarcinomas, 12 mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, 9 endometrioid carcinomas, 5 clear cell carcinomas and 5 mixed tumours). Twenty-six patients were premenopausal and 34 postmenopausal. The results showed that 75% of mucinous cystadenocarcinomas were negative for all 3 antigens as were 2 of the 5 (40%) clear cell carcinomas. All other tumours were positive for at least one of the three antigens. OV 632 had an overall sensitivity of 73.3%, EGFR 55% and OC 125 46.6%. Four tumours were OC 125-positive and OV 632-negative. There was no significant difference in positivity of OV 632, OC 125 and EGFR, between pre- and post-menopausal patients (chi 2 = 0.03) or between tumours of stage I and stage III [chi 2 = 0.075 (EGFR) 0.95 (OV 632) and 10.49 (OC 125)]. OV 632 was conducted to be the most sensitive antibody in all types of tumours but OC 125, while less sensitive by itself, increased the overall sensitivity in combination with OV 632 from 73.3 to 80% (not statistically significant).
