p53 protein and c-erbB-2 protein (p185) expression in endometrial adenocarcinoma of endometrioid type. An immunohistochemical examination on paraffin sections. The expression of both the nuclear protein p53 tumor suppressor gene product and the transmembrane C-erbB-2 protein oncogene product (p185) correlates to risk factors and outcomes in different tumor types. Their value as prognosticators in endometrial adenocarcinoma of endometrioid type (EC) has not been determined. Paraffin sections were examined immunohistochemically to study the expression of p53 protein and p185 in 112 patients with EC. p53 protein was overaccumulated in 34% and p185 in 13% of the tumors. p53 protein correlated with mitotic count and nuclear grade. Both p53 protein and p185 correlated significantly with outcome. However, they did not correlate with each other or with architectural grade or stage (which defines a high risk group), indicating a role as adjuvant prognosticators in EC. Stage and outcome did correlate, however. Both p53 protein and p185 antibodies work well on routine, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and are easily used in routine diagnostic procedures.
