Expression of an estrogen-induced breast cancer-associated protein (pS2) in benign and malignant human ovarian cysts. In human mammary tumors, pS2 expression is directly controlled by estrogens and restricted to a subclass of breast carcinomas. In addition, recent studies have suggested that this gene is expressed in both the invasive and preinvasive forms of breast cancer.pS2 gene expression was investigated in benign and malignant ovary tumors and whenever possible, pS2 expression was also studied in cells collected from cystadenoma fluids. In several cases, particularly with cells from cystadenoma fluids, the limited amount of material available prevented the used of the traditional RNA detection methods such slot/dot blots or Northern blots. Therefore, a rapid and sensitive polymerase chain reaction assay of pS2 expression has been developed and used in this study.In human ovarian tumors, data obtained show that pS2 transcripts and proteins are present in all mucinous cystadenomas studied and at a lower frequency in endometrioid cystadenomas. Quantitation of the CA 19-9 mucin concentration in ovarian fluids indicate that pS2 expression is always associated with high mucin concentrations, but mucin-positive and pS2-negative samples are also frequently observed.These data suggest that pS2 expression is restricted to subclasses of human ovarian cystadenomas.
