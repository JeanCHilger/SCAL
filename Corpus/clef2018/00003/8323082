Pfannenstiel syndrome. The Pfannenstiel incision is commonly utilized for Cesarean section. Long-term complications of this incision are rare. This retrospective charts review from a community teaching hospital over a 3-year period describes seven cases of scar endometriosis in a Pfannenstiel incision after Cesarean section. In two other instances, hernias were found. Patients presented with pain and/or a mass at the incision site. Although extensive diagnostic workup including ultrasonography, computerized tomographic scan, and needle biopsy have been suggested by other authors, surgical exploration was both diagnostic and therapeutic in our experience.
