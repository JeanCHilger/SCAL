The effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists on adrenocorticotropin and cortisol secretion in adult premenopausal women. GnRH agonists are known to suppress LH, FSH, and subsequent ovarian estradiol production by down-regulation of pituitary gonadotropin receptors. Previous investigations have demonstrated that GnRH agonists also suppress GHRH-stimulated GH release in normal men and women and PRL levels in subjects with hyperprolactinemia. Little is known about the effects of GnRH agonists on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the secretion of ACTH and cortisol after an iv infusion of hCRH in control women (n = 11) and in women undergoing treatment with GnRH agonists (n = 10). The plasma and serum levels of ACTH and cortisol increased after infusion of CRH in all women. The basal and CRH-stimulated plasma levels of ACTH and cortisol at each time point were not statistically different between GnRH agonist-treated women and controls. Thus, the chronic use of GnRH agonists is known to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and is associated with GH and PRL suppression as well, but does not apparently alter the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
