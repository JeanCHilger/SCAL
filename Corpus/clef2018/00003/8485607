Comparative efficacy of gestrinone and danazol in infertile women with endometriosis. The relationship between endometriosis and infertility is observed frequently. Patients with both conditions require a conservative approach to their management. Since hormonal therapy is one of those approaches, we sought to compare the efficacy of Danazol and Gestrinone in 80 infertile patients (48 and 32, respectively). Therapy lasted 6 months in both treatment groups, and all patients studied had laboratory tests performed and were clinically evaluated and classified through laparoscopy before and after therapy. The improvement of symptoms and favorable follow-up were similar with both treatments. The reestablishment of menstrual patterns and fertility were also nearly alike in both groups. However, Gestrinone was associated with fewer secondary effects and is easier to administer than Danazol. We conclude that Gestrinone is a useful medication in the management of the infertile patient with endometriosis.
