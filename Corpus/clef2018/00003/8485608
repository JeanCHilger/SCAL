Treatment of infertility patients with hMG-IUI in a private practice. Between December 1988 and September 1990, 132 patients were treated with 432 cycles of superovulation with hMG and timed IUI for various infertility subgroups in a private office setting. All patients had a complete infertility evaluation, including semen analysis, postcoital testing, hysterosalpingogram, endometrial biopsy and laparoscopy, and immunological testing in most cases. Abnormal factors were treated by conventional surgical and/or medical means. Most patients had at least a 6-month trial at achieving normal conception prior to hMG-IUI therapy. Patients received up to six cycles of treatment. Forty-five patients (34%) are still under treatment thus far, the overall pregnancy rate is 58 of 132 or 44%. Of the 58 pregnancies, there were 13 abortions (22.5%) and two ectopic pregnancies (3.5%). The pregnancy rate per cycles has been 58/432, or 13.5%. The on-going pregnancy rate is 43/132, or 32.6%, or 32/432 (10%) per cycle. Treatment with hMG-IUI seems to approach that for IVF for most conventionally treated infertility subgroups. It can be done at a much lower cost per cycle, thus allowing a greater number of couples the availability of treatment. The authors suggest that most infertility patients be offered hMG-IUI therapy prior to IVF referral.
