An unusual coincidence of endometriosis and ovarian stimulation. This report describes a rare coincidence of ureteral endometriosis and ovarian stimulation. A patient presented with acute renal colic after ovarian stimulation. Although rare intrinsic ureteral endometriosis should be considered when establishing differential diagnosis. Laparoscopic treatment for extensive endometriosis has been described but should only be performed by very experienced operative laparoscopists. A new long-term post-operative treatment is proposed combining LH-RH analogues with the new molecule tibolone as add-back therapy.
