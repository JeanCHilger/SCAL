Synchronous endometrioid tumors of the ovary and endometrium. A clinicopathologic study of 22 cases. To analyze a group of 22 patients with synchronous endometrioid tumors of the ovary and endometrium.A retrospective chart review was undertaken and information collected on patient age, parity, tumor grade and stage, presence of coexisting endometriosis and survival. Flow cytometry was determined from archival samples of the endometrial and ovarian tumors.The mean age at diagnosis was 52.8 years (range 36-71) mean parity was 1.05. With regard to the endometrial component, 68.2% were grade 1, 63.6% were stage I and, by flow cytometry, 62.5% were aneuploid. With regard to the ovarian lesions, 68.2% were grade 1, 68.2% were stage I, and 71.4% were aneuploid by flow cytometry. Twelve (54.5%) of 22 patients had pathologic evidence of coexisting endometriosis. Overall, three-year survival was 75%. All 11 patients with stage I disease at both sites were alive, without disease, at a mean follow-up of 34.9 months.Patients with synchronous endometrioid tumors of the endometrium and ovary are generally younger than reported for either endometrial adenocarcinomas or ovarian epithelial adenocarcinomas. They tend to be low grade and early stage and are frequently associated with endometriosis. Our data suggest that the survival of patients with synchronous primaries correlates with the stage of the individual tumors and that a second, synchronous primary does not adversely affect prognosis.
