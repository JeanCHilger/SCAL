Endometriosis in 1,000 consecutive celiotomies: incidence and management. A prospective study of the incidence of endometriosis encountered in consecutive pelvic explorations was carried out. When study cards were filled out immediately after operation, it was found that one half of the patients had endometriosis. The symptoms, indications for operation, and pelvic findings in patients with endometriosis were compared with those in patients not having endometriosis but with similar operative procedures. The location of the condition and the results of the operation were evaluated. Further comparisons were made as to subsequent symptoms, pregnancy, operations, and hormone requirements, and conclusions were drawn as to risks and benefits referable to the type of operation performed.
