Ciliated cell adenocarcinoma of the endometrium diagnosed by endometrial brush cytology and confirmed by hysterectomy: a case report detailing a highly efficient cytology collection and processing technique. A case of ciliated endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, diagnosed by endometrial brush cytology and confirmed by histology, is reported. Features are those of outspoken endometrial adenocarcinoma presenting in a postmenopausal woman with abnormal uterine bleeding. Distinctive characteristics include ciliated neoplastic cells, intracytoplasmic ciliary cysts, complex epithelial stratification, and muscular invasion by malignant ciliated cells in the matched hysterectomy specimen. This report illustrates the merit of linking an easy-to-use liquid fixative with brush-sampling of the endometrium.
