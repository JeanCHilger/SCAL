The relevance of asymptomatic endometriosis. Asymptomatic endometriosis is likely to be a physiological phenomenon of very limited relevance to both the physician and the patient. The evolution of our understanding of this phenomenon is a parable for modern medicine. It is likely that access to a new diagnostic technique, a powerful armoury of medical and surgical treatments and the necessity for doctors to feel they are doing something positive for the patient, have created an incorrect disease model for asymptomatic endometriosis. As responsible clinicians and medical scientists it behoves us to honestly re-examine our approach to this phenomenon.
