Pathogenesis of endometriosis. This article reviews the pathogenesis of endometriosis, which involves retrograde dissemination of endometrium and/or development in situ by metaplasia, and there is evidence suggesting that genetic and hormonal factors may play a role. There is also substantial evidence that immunologic factors, namely peritoneal macrophages, T cells, natural killer cells, and soluble products secreted by these cells, are involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
