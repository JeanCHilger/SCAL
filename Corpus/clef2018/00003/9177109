Epidemiologic determinants of endometriosis: a hospital-based case-control study. Risk factors for endometriosis were identified through data obtained from a case-control study at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.Cases were 50 women with infertility-associated endometriosis. The primary control group consisted of 89 fertile women without endometriosis, and an alternate control group consisted of 47 infertile women without endometriosis.The risk of endometriosis was positively associated with height (OR), 2.8 per 10 cam increase 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.4-5.6) and inversely associated with weight (OR, 0.7 per 10 kg increaseOur findings suggest that the fertility status of controls can strongly influence associations seen with menstrual characteristics. This study is one of few to address the issue of control selection for a case-control study of endometriosis. Specifically, potential problems encountered using fertile and infertile control women are examined and discussed.
