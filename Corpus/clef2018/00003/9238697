Detection of apoptosis in human endometriotic tissues. To clarify whether apoptosis is involved in endometriosis, we obtained eutopic endometrial tissues along with endometriotic tissues from the uterus (adenomyosis) (n = 12) and from the ovary (n = 12) from patients undergoing gynaecological surgery. Apoptosis-induced DNA fragmentation was detected by the TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labelling method, and immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody against the Fas, Le(y) or B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) was also performed using the same tissue section. Analysis showed that apoptosis was occurring in all the samples of ovarian endometriotic tissue but in only two of the 12 adenomyotic and in five of the 24 eutopic endometrial tissue samples. In none of these cases was apoptosis correlated with phases of the menstrual cycle. The expression of bcl-2 in the eutopic endometrial and adenomyotic tissues was limited to the proliferative phase, and was observed in only one of the 12 cases of ovarian endometriosis. Fas and Ley were expressed randomly across a wide range in both the eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues. These results suggest that the features of ovarian endometriosis are different from those of adenomyosis and eutopic endometrium in terms of the involvement of apoptosis. In addition, the regulatory mechanism involved in ovarian endometriosis may differ from that in other endometrial cells.
