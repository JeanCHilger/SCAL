Ovarian dysfunction in endometriosis-associated and unexplained infertility. The impact of endometriosis and unexplained infertility on follicular function and fertilization of oocytes in cycles totally unperturbed by exogenous gonadotrophins, when compared with controls with tubal damage, were examined.In natural cycles, without any exogenous gonadotropins, endocrine and ultrasonographic studies of follicular maturation in 18 women with minor endometriosis (41 cycles), 15 women with unexplained infertility (31 cycles), and 34 women with tubal damage (88 cycles) were performed.The endometriosis group had a significantly longer follicular phase (median: 15, 13, and 13 days). Both endometriosis and unexplained infertility had significantly reduced LH concentrations in follicular fluid compared with tubal damage (median: 12.1, 11.5, and 15.9 IU/L, respectively). Endometriosis was associated with a significantly reduced fertilization rate compared with unexplained infertility or tubal damage (46, 65, and 69%, respectively).These data show continuing evidence of ovulatory dysfunction leading to reduced fertilization rates in women with minor endometriosis.
