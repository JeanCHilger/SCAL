Correlation between salpingoscopic score and subsequent pregnancy outcome in patients with tubal infertility. This study evaluated the efficacy of the salpingoscopic scoring system of tubal function.Twenty-seven infertile patients, including 10 patients with proximal tubal occlusion, 12 with endometriosis and 5 with inflammatory hydrosalpinx, were studied. All 54 tubes were examined using a 0.5-mm-diameter salpingoscope and scored.The mean scores for patients with proximal tubal occlusion, endometriosis, and inflammation were 18.6 +/- 2.0, 15.6 +/- 0.7, and 20.8 +/- 3.4, respectively. Eight patients (29.6%) conceived their mean tubal score was 12.6 +/- 0.5 (12-16). Nineteen patients did not conceive, and their mean score was 18.8 +/- 1.4 (12-31). There was a significant difference between these two scores (P < 0.001).Scoring of the tubes by salpingoscopic examination is useful for evaluating tubal function with regard to prediction of pregnancy and also for selecting IVF or tubal reconstructive surgery as the preliminary treatment.
