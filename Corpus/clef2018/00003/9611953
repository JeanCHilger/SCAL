Transvaginal ultrasonographically controlled aspiration of ovarian endometriomas. Evaluation of the results of the fine needle ultrasonographically directed aspiration of ovarian endometriomas in relation to the efficacy of aspiration of the content, invasiveness, recurrences and complications. The investigation included 30 patients--28 with unilateral and 2 with bilateral ovarian endometriosis in whom 36 aspirations have been performed. Total evacuation of the content was achieved during the first effort in 26 patients versus 4 patients in whom a repeated procedure had to be done. All the patients were controlled during the 1 year post-aspiration period, on average. The recurrence rate was 56.66%. Complications have not been recorded. The transvaginal ultrasonographic fine needle aspiration of the ovarian endometriomas is associated with a high incidence of recurrences but it proved to be a simple, safe, cheap and minimally invasive technique which can be repeated for several times if necessary, in selected patients.
