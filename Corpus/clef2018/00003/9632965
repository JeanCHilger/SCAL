Intramural tubal polyps--a villain in the shadows? Intramural tubal polyps are commonly described in association with subfertility. However, there is unfamiliarity among clinicians about the investigations available for making a diagnosis of this condition. The objective of this paper was to highlight the suitable investigations for diagnosis and thus increase awareness of this condition and its relationship with subfertility.A retrospective review of 14 patients with intramural tubal polyps was done for the period from January to December 1996. An attempt was made to correlate the radiographic findings on hysterosalpingography with transvaginal ultrasound examinations and hydrochromotubation performed under laparoscopic observation. The fertility history of these patients was also examined.The review demonstrated a prevalence of 3.8% of intramural tubal polyps in a selected population of predominantly subfertile women. Only hysterosalpingography was useful in making the diagnosis in-vivo. Fifty percent of the patients did not have any other obvious pathology to explain their subfertility.We conclude that meticulous hysterosalpingography is useful as a diagnostic investigation and that consistent reporting is needed for good follow-up.
