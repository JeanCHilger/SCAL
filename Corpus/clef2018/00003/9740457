Peritoneal fluid concentrations of interleukin-8 in women with endometriosis: relationship to stage of disease. There is increasing evidence that immunological mechanisms play a role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of endometriosis. It was therefore of interest to study interleukin-8 (IL-8), a chemokine, in the peritoneal fluid and peripheral blood of women undergoing laparoscopic procedures. The presence and concentrations of IL-8 in relation to endometriosis, infertility and abdominal pain were evaluated. Samples of peritoneal fluid (n = 49) and peripheral blood (n = 50) were obtained from 50 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for various gynaecological indications (abdominal pain, infertility, sterilization). IL-8 was present in the peritoneal fluid of most women (87%). The concentration of IL-8 in the peritoneal fluid was higher in women with endometriosis compared to women without (P = 0.02). This difference was more pronounced in early (stage 1) endometriosis (P = 0.001). IL-8 concentrations in the peritoneal fluid were also higher in women with early endometriosis compared to women with later stages of the disease (P = 0.003). Peripheral blood concentrations did not correlate with peritoneal fluid concentrations of IL-8 and/or the presence of endometriosis. We conclude that IL-8 is an important factor that may contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis possibly by promoting neovascularization. This information can be a guide in the development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of endometriosis.
