Massive hemoperitoneum from endometriosis of the fallopian tube. A case report. Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disease that usually presents with pelvic pain and infertility in the reproductive years. It can be complicated by bleeding, such as hematuria or hemoptysis however, acute massive hemoperitoneum caused by tubal endometriosis without any concomitant disorder has not been reported previously.An unusual case of massive hemoperitoneum led to preshock as a result of bleeding from a tubal endometriosis implant in a previously healthy 29-year-old woman without previous history suggesting endometriosis.Although the most common gynecologic cause of hemoperitoneum in a reproductive-age woman is ruptured ectopic pregnancy, endometriosis should also be considered, especially after exclusion of pregnancy.
