Adenomyosis: diagnosis by hysteroscopic endomyometrial biopsy, correlation of incidence and severity with menorrhagia. To assess the possibility of diagnosing adenomyosis by hysteroscopic endomyometrial biopsy in patients with menorrhagia and to compare the incidence and depth of penetration in patients who did not have menorrhagia.The study group included 53 patients who had menorrhagia and the control group included patients who were to have hysterectomy for conditions like prolapse uterus. Hysteroscopic endomyometrial biopsy was done in the menorrhagia group. The incidence and depth of penetration of adenomyosis were compared in both the groups using Kruskal Wallis H test. For correlation of severity of menorrhagia with depth of adenomyosis: Student's t-test and ANOVA were used.The incidence of adenomyosis was 60% (18 patients) by endomyometrial biopsy in the menorrhagia group as compared to 33.3% in the control group. The mean depth of invasion of myometrium was 4.103 mm in the menorrhagia group and 2.03 mm in the control group.There is a definite correlation between menorrhagia and adenomyosis both in incidence and depth of penetration.
