Effects of chocolate cyst fluid on endometrioma cell growth in culture. To evaluate the effect of chocolate cyst fluid on the proliferation of cultured human endometrioma cells and to assay the concentration of transforming growth factor-B1 in this fluid.Controlled in vitro study.Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, State University of New York Health Science Center.Five women with ovarian endometriomas.Endometrioma tissue and chocolate fluid from five different patients were entered in this study.Endometrioma cell proliferation in culture with and without chocolate cyst fluid.Chocolate cyst fluid increased the proliferation of endometrioma cells compared with controls. Also, high concentrations of transforming growth factor-B1 were found in cysts' fluid.Chocolate cyst fluid has a growth-enhancing effect on endometrioma cells. One promoting growth factor is transforming growth factor-B1.
