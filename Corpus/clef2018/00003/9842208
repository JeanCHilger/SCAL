Endometriosis of the appendix. A case report. The authors report a case of endometriosis of the appendix found by chance during the course of left adnexectomy owing to endometriotic cysts. Endometriosis of the appendix is usually associated with right ovarian endometriosis, which is sometimes only present at a microscopic level. A situation of acute endometriotic appendix is the result not only of the disintegration of the appendix muscles, as was thought in the past, but also recent catamenial hemorrhage within the endometriotic tissue.
