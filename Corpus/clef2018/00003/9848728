Cystic adenomyosis of the uterus: MRI. Adenomyosis of the uterus is most often seen as focal or diffuse thickening of the myometrial junctional zone on MRI. We describe the morphologic features and signal characteristics of the rarer cystic form of the disease, as revealed by MRI. We conclude that cystic adenomyosis of the uterus is characterized by a well-circumscribed cystic lesion within the myometrium that demonstrates hemorrhage in differential stages of organization on MR images.
