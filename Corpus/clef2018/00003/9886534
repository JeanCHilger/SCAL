Integrin expression in normal and out-of-phase endometria. Integrins have recently been proposed as having a major role in endometrial receptivity. Different patterns of integrin expression have been described during the normal endometrial cycle, and the co-expression of several integrins, mainly alpha1, alpha4 and beta3 has been considered as specific to the 'window of implantation'. In the present study 55 infertile patients underwent two endometrial biopsies during a single menstrual cycle. An early biopsy was done on postovulatory days 6-8, and a late biopsy was performed on postovulatory days 10 to 12. Histological dating as well as immunohistochemical evaluation of alpha1, alpha4, beta1, beta3, beta5, alpha(v)beta3 integrin expression and oestrogen and progesterone receptors were determined in all endometrial biopsies. Oestradiol and progesterone serum concentrations in serum were evaluated on the same days of the endometrial samplings. Nine out of the 55 midluteal biopsies (16.4%) showed out-of-phase endometria, but all biopsies were in phase in the late luteal phase. Differences in integrin expression between in- and out-of-phase biopsies were observed only for alpha(v)beta3 integrin glandular expression during the midluteal phase. Alpha(v)beta3 integrin glandular expression was found in all late luteal phase biopsies. Alpha(v)beta3 expression was closely correlated with histological maturation of the endometrium appearing suddenly at postovulatory day 6-7 and being expressed by all endometria dated as postovulatory day > or = 8, irrespective of midluteal endometrial biopsies being in phase or out of phase. No differences in integrin expression were detected between patients with or without endometriosis or between patients who became spontaneously pregnant and those who did not. In conclusion, further studies are necessary before patterns of integrin expression may offer an alternative to predict uterine receptivity and implantation potential.
