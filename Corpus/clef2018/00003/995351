Endometriosis of the ileum. The following is an account of a case of Endometriosis of the Ileum in an 11 year old girl. The patient's first menstruation was accompanied by pain localized in the lower right abdominal quadrant. Her second menstruation was again accompanied by pain. During an explorative laparotomy, a tumorous mass was found in the wall of the ileum 50--60 cm proximal to Valvula Ileocecalis. The tumor was seven mm in diameter, having a fibrous thickening in the surrounding wall. A resection of this segment of intensine was performed. Histological findings confirmed an endometriosis of the Ileum of a polypoidal infiltrative type. The patient encountered no difficulties postoperatively. Proceeding menstruations were painless, which is indicative of an isolated endometriosis of the ileum.
