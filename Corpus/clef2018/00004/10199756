Increases in bone mineral density after discontinuation of daily human parathyroid hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog administration in women with endometriosis. Intermittent PTH administration increases spinal bone mineral density (BMD) and prevents bone loss from the hip and total body in young women treated with a long acting GnRH analog for endometriosis. To establish whether these beneficial effects on BMD persist after PTH administration is discontinued, we remeasured BMD and biochemical markers of bone turnover in 38 women with endometriosis who had been treated with a GnRH analog alone (nafarelin acetate 200 microg, intranasally, twice daily
