For the young patient who presents with chronic pelvic pain, a multidisciplinary approach is essential to facilitate diagnosis and management. Whenever possible, organic disease such as endometriosis, adhesions, and obstructive malformations should be identified and treated as indicated. Developing a treatment team, recognizing psychosocial and environmental factors, and encouraging long-term relationships are critical components in the care of these patients and in the prevention of recurrent symptom formation and future disability.
