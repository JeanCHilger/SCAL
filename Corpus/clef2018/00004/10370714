Ovarian masses. All types of ovarian tumors seen in the adult population can also be seen in children and adolescents. However, the relative incidence of each entity varies considerably with age. Functional non-neoplastic cysts and masses are much more frequent in the adolescent. Furthermore, in the adolescent age group, neoplasms are more likely to be germ cell rather than epithelial in origin. Fortunately, in children and adolescents only 10% of ovarian tumors are malignant. In diagnostic evaluation of ovarian masses, a complete history and physical examination are of utmost importance. Whenever an ovarian mass, be it physiologic or neoplastic, benign or malignant, is diagnosed in an adolescent female or prepubertal child, every effort must be made to preserve the reproductive function in that female in order to ensure future childbearing.
