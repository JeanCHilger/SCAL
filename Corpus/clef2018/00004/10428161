Immunohistochemical assessment of superoxide dismutase expression in the endometrium in endometriosis and adenomyosis. To determine the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle in endometriosis and adenomyosis.Immunohistochemical identification of SOD in endometrial tissues using the monoclonal antibody.Department of obstetrics and gynecology in a university hospital.The subjects were divided into three groups: 36 patients with endometriosis, 38 patients with histologically proven adenomyosis, and 47 fertile control subjects.Endometrium was biopsied throughout the menstrual cycle.Semiquantitative immunostaining (evaluation nomogram) score for endometrial cells.The analyses revealed phase-dependent changes in the expression of SODs in the glandular and surface epithelia during the menstrual cycle in fertile controls. Specifically, the expression of copper, zinc SOD was weakest in the early and midproliferative phases, then gradually increased, and was most marked in the early and midsecretory phases. The expression of manganese SOD reached a peak in the late secretory phase. The expression of both SODs in endometriosis and adenomyosis was persistently higher than the control levels throughout the menstrual cycle.The exaggerated expression of both SODs in the endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle suggests that superoxide plays a key role in infertility in endometriosis and adenomyosis.
