The role of adhesive molecules in pathogenesis of endometriosis. Laboratory findings and clinical aspects. Adhesive molecules have played an important and well-established role in cell-to-cell communication for a long time. They reveal specific functions in an ongoing disturbed immunological reactions, including endometriosis. This review is to describe the role of topical factors involved in the pathogenesis of arising and course of endometriosis, taking adhesive molecules into special consideration. It does not only include the mechanisms and the effects of their action but also some advantages that can be gained from the knowledge of their function. The attention is also drawn to the putative role of certain proteolitical enzymes and their inhibitors which when more active can intensify or reduce the symptoms of the disease.
