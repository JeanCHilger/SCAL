Angiogenesis in ovarian clear cell carcinoma and its relation to endometriosis. Twenty-five patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (CC-Ca) were enrolled in this study, and tumor cell expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) was investigated, and correlated with the microvessel count (MVC) and the impact of complication endometriosis. Expression of VEGF was strongly positive in 16 cases, weakly positive in 6 cases, and negative in 3 cases. Expression of PD-ECGF was strongly positive in 11 cases, weakly positive in 6 cases, and negative in 8 cases. VEGF expression and the MVC were significantly correlated (p<0.01), and there were no correlations among complication by endometriosis, expression of VEGF, expression of PD-ECGF, and MVC.
