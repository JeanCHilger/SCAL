Endometriosis in the surgical scar from cesarean section. The frequency of endometriosis in and around the surgical scar from cesarean section is from 0.03%-0.04% to 0.8% in some reports. It is difficult to be diagnosed, in spite of the typical symptoms: aching swelling in the area of the surgical scar, which is influenced by the phases of menstruation. Sonography and fine-needle biopsy can be used, but it is usually diagnosed through the surgical treatment. Hystological diagnosis can also be a matter of some difficulty, as sometimes it is necessary to differentiate from adenocarcinoma, pseudomyxoma peritonei and metastatic carcinoma. The treatment is surgical. It is examined a case of endometriosis, which occurred in the surgical scar from a cesarean section about a year after the operation. The treatment is surgical by means of wide cutting-out of damaged musculus rectus abdominis and the surrounding tissues. After the operation a seroma is formed, which is healed with aspiration drainage and compressive bandage. Three years after operation a recurrence is not established.
