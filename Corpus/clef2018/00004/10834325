The endometrium in breast cancer patients on tamoxifen. We restudied histologically and immunohistochemically 17 endometrial carcinomas, 2 malignant mixed tumors and 180 endometria with benign changes during or after tamoxifen therapy. The carcinomas were subtyped according to the 1994 WHO-classification. Endometrial biopsies were taken only if the endometrial thickness was > 8 mm sonographically, when a polyp was seen, or for postmenopausal bleeding. About half of the endometrial specimens showed simple or cystic atrophy, 55-76% had cystic-atrophic polyps or regressive hyperplasia. Depending upon the dose of tamoxifen, 7-19% (30 mg) to 27-36% (20 mg) showed moderate glandular proliferation. 20-33% had foci of mucinous, clear cell or serous-papillary metaplasia. 68-70% revealed diffuse extensive fibrosis of the endometrial stroma. None of 11 patients biopsied before starting tamoxifen therapy had advanced endometrial glandular proliferation in the second endometrial biopsy after tamoxifen treatment. None of the 19 endometrial neoplasms after tamoxifen therapy was of the endometrioid type: 11 were mucinous adenocarcinomas, 4 clear cell carcinomas, 2 serous-papillary carcinomas, one carcinosarcoma and one malignant Mullerian mixed tumor. The reasons for discrepancies between suspicious sonograms and endometrial atrophy are discussed.
