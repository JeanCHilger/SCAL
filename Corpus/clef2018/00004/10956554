Genetic abnormalities detected by comparative genomic hybridization in a human endometriosis-derived cell line. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used in parallel with fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and conventional karyotyping to perform a genome-wide survey of DNA gains and losses in the endometriosis-derived permanent cell line, FbEM-1. The cytogenetic analysis showed a complex karyotype with numerical changes and multiple chromosome aberrations, including the der(1) complement marker exhibiting a large homogenous staining region (HSR). The chromosomal rearrangement interpreted as der(5) t(56)(q34
