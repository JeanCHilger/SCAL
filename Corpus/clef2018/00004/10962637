The role of laparoscopy as a diagnostic tool in chronic pelvic pain. More than 40% of laparoscopies are performed for the diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain (CPP). Although laparoscopic evaluation is sometimes considered a routine part of the evaluation, ideally the decision to perform a laparoscopy should be based on the patient's history, physical examination and findings of non-invasive tests. About 65% of women with CPP have at least one diagnosis detectable by laparoscopy and it is common to attribute causality to this diagnosis. Endometriosis is diagnosed in one-third of laparoscopies for CPP. Endometriosis requires histological confirmation to assure an accurate diagnosis. Adhesions are diagnosed in about one-quarter of laparoscopies. Ovarian cysts, hernias, pelvic congestion syndrome, ovarian remnant syndrome, ovarian retention syndrome, post-operative peritoneal cysts and endosalpingiosis are other diagnoses that can be made laparoscopically in some cases. Laparoscopic conscious pain mapping has the potential to improve the accuracy of laparoscopy as a diagnostic tool in CPP.
