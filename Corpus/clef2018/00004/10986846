Splenosis and the gynecologic patient: a case report and review of literature. A 23-year-old woman with pelvic pain and a preoperative assessment of endometriosis eventually diagnosed as splenosis is presented. Hysterectomy, removal of the ovaries and of the splenic pelvic mass resolved her complaint. The pelvic mass in this patient was clinically mistaken for endometriosis. Use of more specific diagnostic techniques can more clearly guide therapy.
