CD34 immunohistochemistry in female genital tract carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed m√ºllerian tumors) supports a dominant role of the carcinomatous component. Female genital carcinosarcomas (FGTCSs) are aggressive biphasic malignant neoplasms with histologic features of both carcinomas and sarcomas. However, their behavior is dominated by the carcinomatous component. CD34 is useful in distinguishing carcinomas with sarcomatoid features from epithelioid sarcomas, as it is never expressed in carcinomas although often expressed in epithelioid sarcomas. This investigation hypothesizes that CD34 expression in FGTCSs will contribute useful histogenetic and clinical information. Paraffin sections from a surgical series of 43 FGTCSs were stained using anti-CD34 with an automated immunohistochemical stainer, antigen retrieval, and appropriate external/internal controls. Reactions were graded as follows: negative (N) or S1-3, strong reactivity in <10% = S1, 10-50% = S2, or >50% = S3 of cells, respectively. The series included 31 endometrial, 6 ovarian, 5 cervical, and 1 fallopian tubal FGTCSs, 70% exhibiting heterologous elements (22 rhabdomyosarcomas, 11 chondrosarcomas, 1 osteosarcoma, and 1 liposarcoma). The carcinomatous component included 19 endometrioid, 12 serous, 6 adenosquamous, 4 clear cell, and 2 poorly differentiated carcinomas: modified International Federation of Gynecologic Oncology grade I, 9% II, 21%
