Oophorectomy at the time of surgery for moderate endometriosis: a survey of Australian gynaecologists. The decision to perform bilateral oophorectomy at the time of surgery for endometriosis is dependent upon many factors, one of which is the opinion of the surgeon concerned. At present there is no consensus on this subject, and in an attempt to document current opinion, we performed a postal survey of all Fellows of RANZCOG living within Australia. The questionnaire presented the Fellow with a clinical scenario describing moderate endometriosis, and then asked him/her to select their preferred option for each of a number of anatomical areas. Out of 1,050 questionnaires, 688 (65.5%) were returned. Analysis of these replies suggests that current opinion supports a conservative approach to surgery, with only 27.5% of Fellows electing to perform a hysterectomy in conjunction with bilateral oophorectomy.
