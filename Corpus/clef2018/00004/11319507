Vesicouterine fistula and bladder endometriosis. A case report. Vesicouterine fistula is rare, accounting nearly 4% of all urogenital fistulas. Cesarean delivery through uterine lower segment is the main predisposing event but in the last years other possible predisposing factors have been pointed out. Clinically, it can occur in different forms and the diagnosis is often delayed although it is not difficult. In this study personal experience in a case of postcesarean vesicouterine fistula arisen on a focus of bladder endometriosis is reported and an eventual hypothetical pathogenetic correlation between bladder endometriosis and vesicouterine fistula is discussed.
