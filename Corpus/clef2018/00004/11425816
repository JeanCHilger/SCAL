Vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in the follicular fluid of patients undergoing IVF. The aim of our study was to measure concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) CD31 and vascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAM-1) in the follicular fluid of women treated with assisted reproduction technology to determine whether these proteins might be outcome markers.Follicular fluid was collected from 75 patients < or =40 years undergoing oocyte retrieval procedures at our tertiary hospital during 1997 and 1998: 50 with tubal disease, 12 with endometriosis, and 13 whose partners had been diagnosed with severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. This retrospective analysis considered age and information about treatment and outcome for all these women who had undergone fewer than three assisted reproduction attempts.Nineteen women became pregnant (defined by human chorionic gonadotrophin concentrations and embryonic cardiac activity 1 month after follicular aspiration) 56 did not. Women did not differ significantly in their follicular fluid concentrations of VEGF, sCD31 and VCAM-1 according to cause of infertility, or assisted reproduction outcome, or age. Follicular fluid concentrations of VEGF were significantly correlated with the number of gonadotrophin ampoules administered (P < 0.012), and follicular fluid concentrations of sVCAM-1 with the fertilization rate (P < 0.01). Follicular fluid concentrations of VEGF and sVCAM-1 were also correlated (P < 0.007).Our results do not suggest that VEGF, CD31, or sVCAM-1 in follicular fluid predict assisted reproduction outcome, especially among patients < or =40 years old. The correlation of a high fertilization rate and sVCAM-1 in follicular fluid suggests that sVCAM-1 might be a marker of fertilization.
