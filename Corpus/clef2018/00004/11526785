The evaluation of IL-12 levels in peritoneal fluid and serum of women with endometriosis. We studied levels of IL-12 in peritoneal fluid and serum in patients with minimal, advanced and recurrent endometriosis compared to women without endometriotic lesions in pelvis minor. The aim of the study was to determine whether level of IL-12 detected in peritoneal fluid or serum changes with grading of severity of endometriosis. To assess IL-12 levels immunosorbent ELISA was used. There were no statistically significant differences in IL-12 levels in peritoneal fluid nor in serum in any of studied groups. There was higher concentration (without statistical significance) of IL-12 in peritoneal fluid of healthy women compared to women with endometriosis.
