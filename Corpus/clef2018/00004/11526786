E-cadherin in the serum and the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. Endometriosis, a disease of unclear etiopathogenesis, is a quite common problem in gynecology. It is thought that the retrograde flow of the menstrual debris to the peritoneal cavity plays an important role in the origin of endometriosis but the mechanism of endometrial cells implantation remains unknown. Recently many centers have reported the importance of adhesion molecules in this process. We studied the concentrations of E-cadherin in the serum and the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. Our results show a significant decrease of E-cadherin concentrations in sera and peritoneal fluids in women with endometriosis. We suggest that screening the level of E-caherin may be useful in the monitoring the therapy of endometriosis.
