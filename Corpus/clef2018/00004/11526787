Lipid peroxides, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in peritoneal fluid from infertile women with minimal and mild endometriosis. To assess the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and lipid peroxides (the marker of free radicals activity) in peritoneal fluid (PF) of infertile women with minimal and mild endometriosis.19 women were studied, including 9 infertile women with minimal or mild endometriosis and 10 patients with tubal occlusion (the reference group). Lipid peroxides (malonyldialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal), TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma concentrations were measured in the PF using commercially available kits.Concentration of IFN-gamma was detectable in PF of 7 (77.8%) women with endometriosis and in PF from 3 (30%) patients with tubal occlusion. Neither TNF-alpha or lipid peroxides PF concentration differed significantly (p < 0.05) between the groups. In the group with endometriosis we have found a positive correlation (R = 0.77, p = 0.04) between the concentrations of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma.Our results suggest that oxidative stress in the PF doesn't appear to play a role in endometriosis-associated infertility.
