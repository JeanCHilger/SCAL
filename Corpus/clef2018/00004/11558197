Endometriosis. Will identifying risk factors enable an early diagnosis? Endometriosis is a common condition seen in general practice, affecting 10% of women of reproductive age. Recognition of risk factors on history and examination can lead to an earlier diagnosis and appropriate referral. This may ultimately lead to improved quality of care for women with symptoms of endometriosis.This article aims to identify risk factors in the clinical history and examination that may indicate a more likely diagnosis of endometriosis in women presenting to their general practitioner.Some risk factors stand out in the literature as increasing the likelihood of a diagnosis of endometriosis. The GP can utilise these factors to help identify women at risk and those who would benefit from referral for diagnostic laparoscopy. The early diagnosis of endometriosis means that effective medical and surgical treatments can be used to control symptoms and improve the long term outcome for patients.
