The role of integrins in human embryo implantation. Integrins are adhesion molecules present in endometrial, decidual, and extravillous cytotrophoblast (EVCT) cells. They participate in cell-cell adhesion as well as in adhesion between cells and components of the extracellular matrix, and they play an important role in the endometrial phenotype change that occurs during the secretory phase, the first stage of implantation. At the beginning of pregnancy, the change in integrin expression is synchronized with the trophoblast attachment (embryo-endometrium interactions with integrins alpha(v)beta3, alpha4beta1, alpha6beta1, and alpha7beta1) and the embryo's invasion of the decidua (integrins alpha6beta4-->alpha5beta1-->alpha1beta1-->alpha4beta1 switch from proliferative to endovascular EVCT). Several diseases, including preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation caused by vascular problems and defective luteal phases, may be explained by anomalies in integrin patterns.
