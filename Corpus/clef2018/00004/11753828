Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67 in epithelial ovarian tumours: correlation with DNA flow cytometric analysis. The aim of the present retrospective study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of Ki-67 and Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining and DNA content measured by flow cytometry (FCM) in epithelial ovarian tumours. Further, we compared these variables with histopathologic features and each other.We used immunohistochemical methods on paraffin embedded tissue sections of 67 surgically resected epithelial ovarian neoplasms, diagnosed between 1987-1998, (benign serous n=12, benign mucinous n= 15, borderline mucinous n=3, malignant serous n= 15, malignant mucinous n=8, malignant endometrioid n=10, clear cell n=3 and malignant Brenner n= 1) for the presence of PCNA and Ki-67 reactivity. Samples from malignant and borderline tumours were also examined for DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF) by flow cytometry. Five malignant tumours were excluded because there was not sufficient tissue for flow cytometric analysis.There was no significant correlation between DNA ploidy, SPFs derived from FCM analysis, and proliferative activity, determined by PCNA and Ki-67 and the known histopathologic parameters of prognostic significance in ovarian epithelial malignancies.
