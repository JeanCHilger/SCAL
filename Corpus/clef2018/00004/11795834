Two cases of supernumerary ovary: one with large fibroma with Meig's syndrome and the other with endometriosis and cystic change. Reports of supernumerary ovaries are rare. We describe two such cases, one with fibroma and the other with endometriosis and cystic change. A large fibroma measuring 17.4 x 12.0 x 7.5 cm in size was found in the supernumerary ovary of the omentum in the first case of a 47-year-old married woman with Meig's syndrome. The second case was associated with endometriosis and cystic change, measuring 11 x 5 x 3 cm in size and located in the upper abdominal cavity. It was attached to the uterus of a 28-year-old pregnant woman who had neither fibroma nor Meig's syndrome. Histologically, corpus albicans and a few primordial germ cells were demonstrated, respectively. A fibroma showing a storiform pattern was found in the first case. The second case had endometriosis and a thin-walled cyst with bleeding and necrosis caused by torsion. Immunohistochemically, desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, c-kit, CA125, Na+/K+ATPase, overexpression of p53, myc and ras were all negative in the fibroma cells of the first case, and in the endometriosis and cyst wall of the second case. The fibroma cells were positive for vimentin and estrogen receptor, and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen was sporadically demonstrated in their nuclei. The mutation of the p53 gene at exons 5-8 was not detected by sequence analysis. Using RT-PCR, bax, bcl-2 and p16 were not detected either. Clinically, the two cases presented here did not show abnormal hormonal symptoms. They were diagnosed as abdominal tumors or masses. Based on these considerations, one might assume that supernumerary ovaries are probably more frequent than reported at present.
