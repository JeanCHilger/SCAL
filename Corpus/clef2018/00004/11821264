Matrix metalloproteinase-9 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1: a possible role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of endopeptidases which play a role in the degradation and turnover of extracellular matrix proteins. Their action is regulated by specific tissue inhibitors called tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs).We measured the concentrations of total and active MMP-9 in peritoneal fluid of infertile women with mild or moderate endometriosis (n = 22) and compared them with those in a control group of infertile patients (n = 21).We found that the mean (+/-SD) total concentrations of MMP-9 in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis was 6.2 +/- 1.8 ng/ml, in comparison with 2.9 +/- 2.6 ng/ml in the control group (P = 0.001). Concentrations of active MMP-9 did not differ significantly between the groups. The concentrations of TIMP-1, after logarithmic transformation, were significantly lower (P = 0.017) in endometriotic peritoneal fluids than in peritoneal fluid of control women, 1.02 +/- 0.21 ng/ml and 1.16 +/- 0.18 ng/ml respectively. No correlation between stage of disease, steroid hormone concentration, MMP-9 (total and active) and TIMP-1 was found.These results suggest that a disturbed equilibrium exists between MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. This may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease.
