Use of CA-125 and ultrasound in high-risk women. Our objective was a retrospective study reporting on ovarian cancer screening in a high-risk female population using both CA-125 and ultrasound over a 7-year period. We used risk estimates of carrying a BRCA mutation that were based on family history. Subjects were screened with CA-125 and ultrasound every 6 months. Each of 311 high-risk subjects had between 1 and 17 screening visits. Overall, 33 of 1209 (2.7%) CA-125 results were abnormal (>35 U/ml) 226 of 1342 (17%) ultrasounds were abnormal, with abnormalities ranging from benign appearing cystic changes to more ominous patterns. Since entry into the program, 29 subjects (9%) have undergone surgery. In 20 of these, the preoperative screening was normal
