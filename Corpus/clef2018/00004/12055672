Relationship between p53 pathway and estrogen receptor status in endometrioid-type endometrial cancer. We analyzed the mechanism of estrogen receptor (ER) loss and status of the p53 pathway in 64 cases of endometrial cancer. 26.6% (17 of 64) of endometrial cancers lost ER. Methylation of the ER CpG island was significantly related to ER status (P = 0.0074). However, the methylation site of the ER CpG island differed between breast and endometrial cancers. The abnormal expression rate of p14ARF, MDM2, p53, and the p53 pathway were 7.8% (5 of 64), 32.8% (21 of 64), 25.0% (16 of 64) and 53.1% (34 of 64), respectively. There was no significant difference in the overexpression of MDM2 between p53-positive cases (43.8%: 7 of 16) and p53-negative cases (29.2% 14 of 48) (P = 0.3595). Abnormal p53 was higher in grade 3 tumors (55.6%
