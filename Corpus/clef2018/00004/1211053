The contribution of pathological anatomy to the diagnosis and prognosis of different forms of tubal sterility. The histological examination made by means of tubal section allows us to predict in a large number of cases, the functional future of the tubes after plastic surgery. The results obtained through surgical treatment of the various internal tubal occlusions can be summarised thus: a persistance of permeability is very marked in the internal tubal occlusions and more especially, in the colonisations. But on the whole, uterine pregnancies, including those with abortion, and gestations whose development is unknown, are less frequent than those obtained after surgical treatment ofr external tubal occlusions. In fact, the percentage of pregnancies after external tubal occlusions is 22%, with 18% of the pregnancies going the full term
