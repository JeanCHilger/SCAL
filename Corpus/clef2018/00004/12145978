Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists--a new provocation in gynecology. Within the last years, there have been reports on the use of GnRH antagonists, as opposed to agonists, in the treatment of the patients with infertility, uterine fibroids, endometriosis and precocious puberty. The advantage of the antagonists is that they will directly inhibit the action of GnRH on the pituitary, inducing an immediate fall in secretion of luteinizing hormone(LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone(FSH). GnRH antagonists has been shown to be useful also for other clinical indication, such as ovarian, endometrial, prostate and breast cancers.
