Matrix metalloproteinase-2, membranous type 1 matrix metalloproteinase, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 expression in ectopic and eutopic endometrium. To investigate expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), membranous type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) in ectopic and eutopic endometrium from women with and without endometriosis throughout the menstrual cycle.Molecular studies in human tissue.Reproductive immunology laboratory of a university medical center.Fifty-three premenopausal woman (23 with endometriosis and 30 without endometriosis) undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Endometrium and ectopic endometriosis tissue were obtained at the time of surgery.Messenger RNA and protein expression from eutopic and ectopic endometrium was analyzed by using quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction, zymography, and Western blot assay.Uterine endometrium from women with endometriosis expressed higher levels of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP and lower levels of TIMP-2 than did endometrium from normal women.Eutopic endometrium from patients with endometriosis may be more invasive and prone to peritoneal implantation because of greater expression of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP and lower expression of TIMP-2 messenger RNA, compared with endometrium from women without endometriosis. Thus, increased proteolytic activity may help to explain the invasive factors that result in endometriosis.
