Endometriosis is sustained by tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Endometriosis is a common gynaecological disorder causing pain, infertility, and emotional distress. Evidence presented here suggests that abnormal production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is required for the establishment and maintenance of endometriosis and also is responsible for the associated infertility through its effect on sperm motility and function and oocyte development. Infliximab, which blocks TNF-alpha function, could be used in the treatment of endometriosis to reverse the above effects.
