Midgut carcinoid tumor identified from a metastasis in the uterosacral ligament. Chronic pelvic pain is common in women of reproductive age and accounts for more than 40% of all laparoscopic procedures. In up to 40% of these patients laparoscopic findings are negative. As a result, many gynecologists frequently excise portions of the uterosacral ligaments and biopsy inconspicuous pelvic lesions in an effort to perform uterosacral nerve ablation and also to identify subclinical endometriosis. During diagnostic laparoscopy for chronic intermittent pelvic and abdominal pain, a 37-year-old woman was noted to have an incidental, 5-mm, pink-white nodule in the right uterosacral ligament. Pathologic examination reported features typical of a carcinoid tumor. Further evaluation by computerized tomographic scan and indium-III octreotide scan identified a 1.6-cm lesion in the mesentery. At laparotomy a 2-cm primary mucosal tumor in the terminal ileum and a 2-cm nodule in the adjacent mesentery were present. Carcinoid tumor was confirmed in 2 nodules and in 7 of 17 mesenteric lymph nodes. Liver and lung metastases were not seen.
