Associations between tumor diameter and prognostic variables of epithelial ovarian cancer. Associations of tumor diameter in epithelial ovarian cancer with clinical and pathological prognostic variables were investigated.The clinical and pathological records of 233 patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer and treated at Aichi Cancer Center were studied.Tumor diameters of 44 patients (18.9%) were < 5 cm, 90 (38.6%) were 5-10 cm, and 99 (42.5%) were > 10 cm. While 90.9% (40/44) of < 5 cm tumors presented with FIGO stage III-IV, 40.4% (40/99) of > 10 cm tumors were advanced. Intra-abdominal disease was also significantly associated with tumor diameter, although differences among lymph-node status were not significant. The incidence of serous and endometrioid adenocarcinoma in < 5 cm tumors were 75.0% (33/44) and 11.4% (5/44), respectively, while those of > 10 cm tumor were 32.3% (32/99) and 17.2% (17/99). Multivariate analysis revealed that tumor diameter was not an independent prognostic variable.Tumor diameter of ovarian cancer is associated closely with histological subtypes and stage of disease, especially intra-abdominal disease.
