Vascular tumors of the female genital tract: a clinicopathological study of nine cases. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological features of nine unusual vascular tumors of the female genital tract and to investigate the problems in the differential diagnosis from other genital lesions.In a review of 15,000 specimens of the female genital system examined in our Laboratory during the last decade, nine cases of vascular tumors were found.A capillary hemangioma of the endometrium, one capillary and one cavernous hemangioma of the cervix, six vulva lesions (one capillary, and one cavernous hemangioma and four angiokeratomas) and one hemangiosarcoma of the mons pubis in a 76-year-old patient were diagnosed.The differential diagnosis of the vascular tumors must be made mainly from endometriotic lesions and melanomas. Immunohistochemistry (S-100, CD31, CD34, CKS, EMA) aid in the diagnosis. Local excision is adequate for the benign vascular lesions.
