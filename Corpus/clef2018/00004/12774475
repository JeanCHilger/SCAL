Diagnosis and classification of thoracal endometriosis. Endometriosis is a grave pathological process that comes to be encountered in young women of the reproductive age, and it is not infrequently that it terminates in disability. Apart from genital organs, other organs may be affected by the disease, including those of the thorax. But in proportion of instances the process escapes early diagnosis. In the author's opinion, the reason for the above-said is absence of classification, in view of which fact a classification is suggested that is supposed to advance diagnosis.
