Ureteral endometriosis. This review discusses the pathophysiology, presentation, and different minimally invasive medical and surgical treatment options for ureteral endometriosis.A comprehensive literature review of reports on the diagnosis and management of ureteral endometriosis was performed using MEDLINE.Ureteral endometriosis is a rare disease. Most cases present with silent obstruction, as opposed to cyclical hematuria. The diagnosis of ureteral endometriosis requires a high index of suspicion. A variety of diagnostic tests can help identify the extent of disease and the degree of renal function on the side of ureteral involvement.Ureteral endometriosis can be treated with hormones or surgical intervention. While surgery is reserved for hormone refractory cases and obstruction associated with extensive scarring, the majority of cases can be managed with hormones only. A combination of hormones and surgery is also effective. Surveillance for obstructive uropathy with periodic noninvasive monitoring of kidney function is currently recommended for all patients with endometriosis.
