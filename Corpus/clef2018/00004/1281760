IL6 and acute phase plasma proteins in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. Several authors have documented signs of chronic inflammation in the pelvis of women with endometriosis. We investigated the possible involvement of interleukin 6 (IL6), an important regulator of inflammation and immunity, in minimal and mild endometriosis by measuring levels of IL6 and proteins (alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 2-HS glycoprotein and albumin) the synthesis of which is regulated by IL6, in peritoneal fluid (PF) from infertile women with histologically confirmed endometriosis (stage I and II n = 28) and from endometriosis-free fertile (n = 14) and infertile women (n = 13). Spontaneous and LPS-induced IL6 secretion by cultured PF macrophages from women with endometriosis (n = 12) and without endometriosis (n = 9) were also studied. No significant differences were observed in the concentrations of the four proteins studied. Immunoreactive IL6 was detected in all three groups, with no significant differences. In contrast, significantly higher levels of IL6 were released by both unstimulated (P = 0.01) and LPS-stimulated (P = 0.006) peritoneal macrophages from the women with endometriosis. We conclude that local IL6 synthesis by activated macrophages may play a role in the endometriosis process.
