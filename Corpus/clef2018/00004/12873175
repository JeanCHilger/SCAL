CD10 is helpful in detecting occult or inconspicuous endometrial stromal cells in cases of presumptive endometriosis. Previous studies have shown that CD10 is a marker for normal, ectopic, and neoplastic endometrial stromal cells. However, its value in confirming a diagnosis of presumptive endometriosis has not been extensively studied.To assess the reactivity of CD10 in a series of cases of presumptive endometriosis and to establish the potential usefulness of this antibody in confirming the diagnosis.We studied hematoxylin-eosin sections and immunoreactivity of CD10 in 20 cases diagnosed as "suspicious for," "suggestive of," or "compatible with" endometriosis as well as in 12 cases of lesions that may be confused with endometriosis (3 endosalpingioses, 3 mesothelial hyperplasias, 3 ovarian follicular cysts, and 3 hemorrhagic corpora lutea).Routine sections from cases of presumptive endometriosis showed glands lacking a distinct cuff of endometrial stromal cells because of atrophy or because of changes secondary to hemorrhage, inflammation, fibrosis, and/or cystic dilatation. In a few cases, the distinction between endometrial and ovarian stroma could not be assessed with certainty. CD10 immunostaining confirmed the diagnosis in 17 (85%) of the cases, as it strongly stained endometrial stromal cells that were not apparent on hematoxylin-eosin sections. All sections from lesions that may simulate endometriosis were CD10-.CD10 is helpful in detecting occult or inconspicuous ectopic endometrial stromal cells and in distinguishing endometriosis from its potential mimickers. We recommend its use to confirm or exclude the presence of endometrial stromal cells in cases of presumptive endometriosis and in lesions that may be mistaken for this entity.
