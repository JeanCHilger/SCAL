Expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and IL-1 receptor antagonist mRNA in peritoneal macrophages from patients with endometriosis. To investigate the expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) mRNA in peritoneal macrophages.Peritoneal fluid (PF) samples were collected from patients who underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy. Northern blot analysis was performed at the reproductive research laboratory.Twenty-six patients with endometriosis, 10 patients with postinflammatory pelvic adhesion, and 12 control women with normal pelvis.Polyadenylated RNA isolated from peritoneal macrophages was analyzed on Northern blots by using synthetic oligonucleotide probes.The level of IL-1 beta mRNA expression was elevated in the group with stage I endometriosis, whereas the increased expression of IL-1ra mRNA was observed in the group with stages III and IV endometriosis. The level of IL-1 beta mRNA showed a positive correlation with that of IL-1 beta in PF and a negative correlation with the level of IL-1ra mRNA.Our results suggest that peritoneal macrophages express IL-1ra mRNA rather than IL-1 beta mRNA with the progress of endometriosis and that peritoneal macrophages may secrete IL-1ra protein that modulates the effects of IL-1.
