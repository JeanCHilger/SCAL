Transvaginal US-guided aspiration of ovarian cysts and solid pelvic masses. Sixty-eight transvaginal ultrasound (US)-guided aspirations or biopsies were performed in 61 patients, of whom 48 had ovarian cysts and 13 had solid pelvic masses. In one patient with an ovarian cyst, aspiration revealed malignancy. Thirty-six of the 48 cysts were drained transvaginally in 23 premenopausal and 13 postmenopausal women, with recurrence rates of 48% and 80%, respectively. In seven cases a cyst was aspirated twice. In the 13 patients with solid pelvic lesions, 11 lesions proved to be malignant, with positive biopsy results in nine (sensitivity, 82%). Two benign lesions were correctly identified. No major complication was observed. The authors conclude that the transvaginal route offers simple access to pelvic lesions in pre- and postmenopausal patients. For women with a solid pelvic lesion, transvaginal aspiration biopsy with endovaginal US guidance is a safe and effective alternative to surgery, especially for patients with previously diagnosed malignant disease.
