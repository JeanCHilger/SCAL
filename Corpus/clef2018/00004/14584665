A case of adenocarcinoma of the endometrial type mixed with a clear cell component that metastasized to the vagina. We present a patient with adenocarcinoma of the endometrial type mixed with a clear cell component (AMC) that metastasized to the vagina and one of the pelvic lymph nodes. She underwent a radical hysterectomy and pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy, and then received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Histologic features of the endometrial tumor included clear cell adenocarcinoma with an approximate 10% extent to endometrioid adenocarcinoma. On the other hand, histologic examination on the vaginal tumor predominatly showed clear cell adenocarcinoma and also revealed endometrioid adenocarcinoma to a very small extent, suggesting metastasis to the vagina from AMC. On immunohistochemical examination, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C and VEGF-D was apparently stronger in the component of clear cell adenocarcinoma than in that of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. She has been a disease-free survivor for 26 months. Interestingly, locations of endometrial and vaginal lesions were consistent with the sites of an intrauterine device and ring pessary insertion, respectively.
