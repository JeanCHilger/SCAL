A ruptured ovarian endometrioma mimicking ovarian malignancy: case report. A 24-year-old single woman was referred to our department due to intermittent abdominal pain. Because her serum CA 125 concentration was extremely elevated an ovarian malignancy was suspected. At the laparoscopic examination, it was determined to be a ruptured endometrioma and serum CA 125 concentrations rapidly decreased after surgery.
