Effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist and medroxyprogesterone acetate on calcium metabolism: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the effectiveness of administering medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA 20 mg/d) in either the first (protocol A) or last (protocol B) 12-week period as well as a 6-month course of the GnRH agonist (GnRH-aProspective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial.Clinical research center, university hospital.Twenty women were randomized into protocol A or B, received either MPA or placebo along with GnRH-a, and were then crossed over at 12 weeks to placebo or MPA, for the final 12-week interval of GnRH-a therapy.Collection of serum and urine samples and measurement of bone density. Sex hormone, calcitropic hormone, and bone density studies were performed at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks.In both protocol A and B, LH and E(2) levels declined by 79%-81% and 83%-90% of the baseline, respectively, at 12 and 24 weeks.
