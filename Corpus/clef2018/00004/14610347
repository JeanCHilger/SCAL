Aneuploidy in carcinomas may be initiated by the acquisition of a single trisomy. Karyotypic studies of eight endometrioid carcinomas of the endometrium in this laboratory, four colorectal polyps (from this laboratory or reported in the literature), and four early carcinomas of the ovary (from the literature), provide evidence that clonal evolution leading to malignant neoplasms at these sites originates when a cell acquires a single additional chromosome. In different tumors, different chromosomes may be involved in this change from euploidy to aneuploidy. Since the resultant clones of trisomic cells occur at an early stage of tumor development, their presence is only likely to be determined when they are at a location that is accessible for study. As aneuploidy is a virtually constant feature of malignancy, the possibility that the concept of a single trisomy as the initial event in the development of all malignant solid neoplasias should be addressed.
