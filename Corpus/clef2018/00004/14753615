Endometriosis of the rectovaginal septum: endovaginal US and MRI findings in two cases. We report two patients with endometriosis of the rectovaginal septum in whom endovaginal ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) played crucial roles in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of the disease. The specific features of endometriosis of the rectovaginal septum on MRI and transvaginal US enable a noninvasive diagnosis, thereby reducing diagnostic delay and avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures.
