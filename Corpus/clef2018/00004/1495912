Thoracic endometriosis--2 case reports and review of the literature. Thoracic endometriosis is characterised by recurring pulmonary symptoms in association with the menstrual period. Pleural endometriosis manifests itself as recurring pneumothorax or hematothorax while pulmonary endometriosis is characterized by hemoptysis. The pathogenetic mechanism is not completely understood but it appears that hematogenous and lymphangitic embolization of endometrial tissue may play a significant part in parenchymal and pleural endometriosis respectively. Clinical symptoms begin with ovulation. Hemoptysis is explained by sloughing off of decidual tissue and an increased capillary fragility during menstruation. Rupture of pleurally based alveoli in the vicinity of endometrial tissue or necrosis of the diaphragm at the side of diaphragmatic endometrial implants might be causative for the development of a pneumothorax. Therapy of both forms of thoracic endometriosis consists in hormonal suppression but in some cases surgical intervention might become necessary.
