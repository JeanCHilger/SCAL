The relationship between expression of p53/bcl-2 and clinicopathological criteria in endometrioid adenocarcinomas of the endometrium. Thirty patients with endometrioid adenocarcinomas of the endometrium who had undergone total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were reviewed histopathologically.Tissues were stained immunohistochemically with p53 and bcl-2, respectively. Ten cases were selected as grade 1, ten cases grade 2 and ten cases grade 3.We observed 14 cases (46.6%) of bcl-2 and four cases (13.3%) of p53 positivity p53 expression showed an opposite correlation to bcl-2 staining, estrogen and progesterone.We observed a decrease in bcl-2 reactivity and an increase in p53 positive staining as the histological differentiation worsened.
