Endometriosis in the Bartholin gland. A case of endometriosis infiltrating the Bartholin gland is presented. The initial diagnosis was a Bartholin gland cyst. The clinical diagnosis was made during the operation when chocolate-colored fluid poured into operation field. Laparoscopy was done during the same operation and minimal endometriosis was found. The presence of endometriosis may be considered as a diagnosis in cases with cystic mass in the Bartholin gland and laparoscopy might be performed to rule out the presence of intraperitoneal endometriosis if a woman is infertile.
