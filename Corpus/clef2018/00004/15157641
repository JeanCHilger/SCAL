Immunology of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a benign gynecologic disorder characterized by the ectopic growth of misplaced endometrial cells. A unifying hypothesis to explain endometriosis has not been elucidated as yet but numerous investigations have implicated disturbances in the immune response as fundamental to its etiology and pathogenesis. Clearly, the immune system is involved in endometriosis. It is not clear, however, whether and to what extent this involvement is a primary response leading to the initiation, promotion, and progression of the disease or a secondary response to the ectopic endometrial growth in an attempt to restore homeostasis. Thus, although numerous studies have shown alterations in cell-mediated and humoral immunity in subjects with endometriosis, the importance of these changes remains obscure. This review considers the past two decades of investigation of immune function changes in women with endometriosis with the expectation that this information will ultimately provide the basis for developing new approaches to patient management.
