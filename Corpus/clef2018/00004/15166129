A combination of interleukin-6 and its soluble receptor impairs sperm motility: implications in infertility associated with endometriosis. We previously reported that the level of interleukin (IL)-6 is increased in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. This study was undertaken to assess the effects of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) on in vitro sperm motility.Sperm (n = 20) were cultured with IL-6 or sIL-6R, or with a combination of both. After 24 h cultures, sperm motility was evaluated using a computer-assisted semen analysis system. Gene and protein expressions of IL-6, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and glycoprotein 130 (gp130) were examined in sperm by RT-PCR analysis and western blot analysis.Addition of IL-6 or sIL-6R individually to the culture media had no affect on sperm motion. However, adding a combination of IL-6 and sIL-6R dose-dependently reduced the percentage of motile and rapidly moving sperm. Adding anti-IL-6R antibody abolished these adverse effects. Sperm expressed the gp130 gene and protein, but not IL-6 or IL-6R.A combination of IL-6 and sIL-6R may be associated with gp130 expressed in the sperm and reduce sperm motility. IL-6 and sIL-6R may contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis-associated infertility.
