Correlation of endoscopic interpretation of endometriosis with histological verification. In this study we correlate the laparoscopic findings of endometriosis with the histological confirmation of the disease over a period of two years.One hundred and sixty-four laparoscopies performed at the Department of Gynecology & Obstetrics, University of Kiel, over a two-year period were reviewed for laparoscopic findings and histological confirmation of endometriosis.The majority of patients suspected of endometriosis at laparoscopy were confirmed by histological examination, i.e. 138 out of 164 patients (84.1%).Laparoscopy is the easiest diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of endometriosis which can be confirmed by histological examination.
