Proteome analysis of human mesothelial cells during epithelial to mesenchymal transitions induced by shed menstrual effluent. Peritoneal endometriosis is the result of ectopic implantation and growth of endometrium tissue that has been regurgitated into the abdominal cavity during menstruation. We have previously shown that menstrual effluent induces epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT) in mesothelial cells, which results in cell retraction and exposure of submesothelial extracellular matrix. Since endometrial tissue preferentially adheres to the extracellular matrix, adhesion of endometrial tissue to the peritoneum is facilitated. The EMT were shown to be associated with differential expression and phosphorylation of mesothelial proteins. Using radiolabeling and proteomics we detected changes in protein expression and phosphorylation that occur in mesothelial cells during the EMT process. The identity of 73 proteins, which were obtained from 324 analyzed spots, was confirmed. The expression of 35 proteins involved in organization of the cytoskeleton, signal transduction, regulation of the redox state, and production of ATP, was altered during the EMT process. Four of the identified proteins were differentially phosphorylated: annexin-1, an actin-binding protein and a substrate for receptor tyrosine kinases tropomyosin-alpha, a regulator of actin filament stability and cell shape
