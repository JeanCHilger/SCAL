New aspects in diagnosis and therapy of endometriosis. Endometriosis and adenomyosis show a high prevalence and can be regarded as different symptoms of a unique disease - the dislocation of basal endometrium. Diagnostic methods for detecting adenomyosis are transvaginal sonography (TVS) or T-2-weighed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients with endometriosis show a significant impairment of utero-tubal sperm transport capacity, which is even increased the stronger the adenomyotic component of the disease is. Adenomyosis can be regarded as a cause for infertility especially in minor and mild forms of endometriosis and is therefore often followed by IVF/ICSI-treatment. Infertility patients with endometriosis should be counselled for intensive infertility treatment. Without a current wish for conception, fertility potential should be preserved by hormonal suppression of uterine peristalsis in order to avoid progression of the disease.
