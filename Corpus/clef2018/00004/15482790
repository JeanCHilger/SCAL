Expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 in red and black endometriotic lesions. This immunohistochemical study shows that platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), known to play a role in neoangiogenesis and vascular development, is strongly and homogeneously expressed in endothelial cells lining blood vessels from red and black pelvic endometriotic lesions. The distribution of PECAM-1 within the stroma of the lesions was similar to that found in the corresponding eutopic endometrium, regardless of the phase of the cycle.
