Thoracic endometriosis: a report of two cases. We describe two patients with recurrent hemopneumothorax associated with pelvic endometriosis. The first patient a 37-year-old nulliparous lady with recurrent bilateral hemopneumothorax. She had a past history endometriosis years earlier. Laparoscopy and biopsy confirmed widespread endometriosis including in the omentum. Recurrence of the hemopneumothorax stopped after danazol therapy suggesting thoracic endometriosis as the cause of hemopneumothorax. The second lady is 47-years old with 2 children. She first presented with hemopneumothorax associated with menstrual period but ultrasound of pelvis did not reveal evidence of endometriosis. However, when she presented with a second episode of hemopneumothorax one year later, she was confirmed to have endometriosis and no further recurrence after treatment with Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue.
