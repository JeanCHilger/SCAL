Could be ureteral endometriosis considered a symptomatic and severe urological disease? Ureteral endometriosis is a rare localization of gynecological disease. We presented a case of left ureteral endometriosis in a 30-year-old woman with left abdominal pain and a radiological nonfunctioning kidney. Surgical treatment with ureteral resection and uretero-uretero anastomosys was conducted. Pathological examination of surgical specimen revealed endometriosis. The diagnosis of ureteral endometriosis should be considered in women with renal symptoms of noncalculous obstruction, particularly in premenopausal women with an anamnesys of polycistic ovary disease (POD) or severe menstrual related symptoms, although the disease is often strictly associated with silent renal obstruction. Only a high index of suspicion and the radiological support may help the urologist to obtain a early diagnosis. Early detection and prompt treatment strategy, surgical too, are extremely important to relieve symptoms and preserve renal function. The literature was reviewed.
