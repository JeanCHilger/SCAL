Study of the profile of gene expression in the endometrium. Implantation in humans is a complex process that is temporally and spatially restricted. Over the past decade, using a one-by-one approach, several genes and gene products that may participate in this process have been identified in secretory phase endometrium. In order to understand this critical aspect of endometrial physiology, Smith group undertook a genome-wide analysis of transcript abundance and changes in transcript level between normal endometrium in the proliferative and secretory phases of the menstrual cycle, between normal and ectopic endometrium (endometriosis) and between normal and RU486-exposed endometrium. A high-density, oligonucleotide gene array was used to define the gene expression profiles of endometrium. Results from the arrays were verified using real-time PCR. Several gene products, known to be differentially expressed in the implantation window or in secretory endometrium, were identified. High density oligonucleotide microarray technology is a valid technique to investigate global changes in gene expression in human endometrium.
