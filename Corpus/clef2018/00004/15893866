Evaluation of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 levels in peripheral blood of infertile women with endometriosis. To test whether serum monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) chemokine levels correlate with endometriosis in infertile women.A group of women with endometriosis (n = 18, infertile) was compared with patients with uterine leiomyoma (n = 16, fertile), unexplained infertility (n = 5, infertile), and healthy women (n = 16, fertile). MCP-1 expression levels were evaluated by ELISA assay. The data obtained were statistically analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. P-Values <0.05 were considered as significant.MCP-1 concentrations (median range of values) in serum were as follows: women with endometriosis (221These data show that an increased level of MCP-1 can characterize infertile women with endometriosis. However, further studies are needed to be able to determine whether increased MCP-1 chemokine expression can be related to infertility or is a result of endometriosis progress.
