Differential expression of laminin isoforms in ovarian epithelial carcinomas suggesting different origin and providing tools for differential diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry was used to study the distribution of laminin (Ln) chains, collagen types IV (alpha 1/2), VII, and XVIII and Lutheran antigen (Lu) in 36 frozen ovarian carcinoma samples. Surface epithelial basement membrane (BM) of the normal ovary showed immunoreactivity for Ln alpha1, alpha3-alpha5, beta1-3, gamma1, and gamma2 chains and type IV and XVIII collagens. Chains of Ln-5 (alpha3beta3gamma2) and Ln-10 (alpha5beta1gamma1) as well as type IV and XVIII collagens were found in most tumor BMs, but Ln alpha2 chain and type VII collagen were detected only in few tumors. Contrary to serous tumors, BMs of mucinous carcinomas showed Ln alpha4 chain, but not Ln alpha1 and beta2 chains. Ln alpha1 chain was found in most endometrioid carcinomas, whereas chains of Ln-5 were only moderately detectable in comparison with serous and mucinous carcinomas. In the normal ovary, Lu immunoreactivity was confined to basal aspect in the ovarian epithelial cells, but in tumor specimens Lu immunostainings showed variable polarized and nonpolarized patterns. The results suggest that the three types of ovarian carcinoma have distinct differences in their Ln distribution and can be grouped based on their expression pattern. This suggests that they may have histogenetically different precursors and may help to distinguish these tumors from each other.
