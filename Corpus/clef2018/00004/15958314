Expressions of nuclear factor-kappaB and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in endometriosis. To investigate the association of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) with endometriosis.Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the NF-kappaB and VEGF protein expression in 35 specimens of normal endometrium, 48 eutopic endometrium of endometriosis and 76 ectopic endometrium, and the results were analyzed statistically.The expressions of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 were found mainly in the glandular epithelial cells of the three endometrium specimens, with the ectopic endometriotic tissues showing the highest and normal endometrium the lowest expressions (P<0.001). NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 expressions were positively correlated to normal, eutopic and ectopic endometrium (r=0.688, 0.773 and 0.777, respectively, P<0.01).NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 may participate in the process of the pathogenesis in endometriosis.
