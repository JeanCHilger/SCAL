Endometriosis association research center. Endometriosis, the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, is a progressive, estrogen-dependent disease and occurs nearly exclusively in menstruating women of reproductive age. Pain syndrome, however, represents the major clinical problem of this disease, manifested as dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, lower abdominal pain, and dyspareunia. About 32 literatures are reviewed in recent advancement for diagnosis of endometriosis. The magnifications of its managements are understood. In outdoor, the management is only depending on clinical findings and on some non invasive procedures without any definitive diagnosis. So, research activities should be done on the basis of recent advancement of endometriosis.
