Immunohistochemical study of collagen type III in adenomyosis. To clarify the mechanism of the origin of adenomyosis, we investigated the immunohistochemical distribution of collagen type III in the human endometrium and the adenomyosis throughout the menstrual cycle. 1) Collagen type III was localized in the stroma of normal endometrium and ectopic endometrium, and in the myometrium. No staining of collagen type III was observed in the endometrial gland. 2) The intensity of staining for collagen type III in the basal layer of normal endometrium was stronger than those in the functional layer. The staining in the proliferative phase was stronger than that in the secretory phase. 3) The intensity of staining of collagen type III in ectopic endometrium paralleled that in the basal layer of normal endometrium. 4) The intensity of staining of collagen type III in the myometrium did not change throughout the menstrual cycle. These results suggest that close similarities exist between stromal cells in normal endometrium and in ectopic endometrium from the viewpoint of the extracellular matrix.
