Interleukin-2 receptor beta (IL-2R beta)-627*C homozygote but not IL-12R beta 1 codon 378 or IL-18 105 polymorphism is associated with higher susceptibility to endometriosis. Interleukin (IL)-2 R-627*C homozygote and C allele are related to higher susceptibility to endometriosis. Interleukin-12Rbeta1 codon 378 and IL-18 105 gene polymorphisms are not correlated with endometriosis development.
