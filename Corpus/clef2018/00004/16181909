Spontaneous hemothorax after caesarian section: an unusual manifestation of diaphragmatic fenestrations. Spontaneous hemothorax is an uncommon condition usually associated with trauma, iatrogenic interventions, or rupture of pleural adhesions, and pneumothorax. We report the unique case of spontaneous hemothorax in a 35-year-old woman resulting from uterine hemorrhage in whom fenestrations in the diaphragm allowed blood to pass from the abdomen to the chest.
