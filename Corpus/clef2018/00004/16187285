Alleles with short CAG and GGN repeats in the androgen receptor gene are associated with benign endometrial cancer. The human androgen receptor (AR) gene possesses 2 trinucleotide repeats of CAG and GGN in exon 1. The CAG repeat corresponds to a polyglutamine tract in the N-terminal region of the receptor, that affects its transcriptional efficiency. The GGN repeat codifies for a polyglycine tract, and affects the amount of the AR protein transcribed. The endometrium contains ARs and the androgens have antiproliferative properties in cultured endometrial cancer (EC) cells. Larger CAG repeats of the AR gene give rise to a weaker transcriptional activity and have been found to be associated with endometrial carcinogenesis. The possible involvement of CAG and GGN tracts in the progression of EC is unknown. To study that possibility, we have genotyped both CAG and GGN polymorphisms of the AR gene in tumor tissue genomic DNA from a series of 204 consecutive patients with EC, and analyzed the results with regard to the pathological features and clinical outcome of patients. We classified the alleles as S (short <or= median S-CAG <or=21 repeats
