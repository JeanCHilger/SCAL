IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies against FSH: serological markers of pathogenic autoimmunity or of normal immunoregulation? Autoimmune mechanisms are often involved in causing infertility. Among the possible targets of autoantibodies, the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which regulates the follicular maturation in human ovary is a promising candidate. We aimed to study whether anti-FSH-antibodies might be involved in different clinical types of infertility.The study group consisted of 178 patients (75 with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), 103 with endometriosis) and 75 pregnant women. Female blood donors formed the control group (n = 85). Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests were performed using purified FSH as antigens and a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 78-93 region (V14D) of the human FSH beta-chain.We showed that anti-FSH-antibodies were present in controls and their production decreased during pregnancy. Endometriosis and PCOS were associated with higher values of anti-FSH-immunoglobulin (Ig)A, anti-V14D-IgA, and endometriosis with anti-V14D-IgG. Our data suggest that anti-FSH-IgA could be a marker of ovarian disorders that cause infertility.
