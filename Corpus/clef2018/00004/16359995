Effect of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and estradiol on the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor in endometrial stromal cells in vitro. To explore the initial activity of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) and the participation of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the histogenesis of endometriosis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion of ESCs and the effect of MCP-1 on VEGF secretion of ESCs were observed in vitro. The VEGF level was detected in ESC culture media and was increased significantly when E2 or MCP-1 was added to the media, especially in the presence of E2 plus MCP-1. The VEGF secretion was higher in the ESCs of women with endometriosis than in those women without endometriosis.
