Metalloproteinase-2, -7 and -9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and -2 expression in normal, hyperplastic and neoplastic endometrium: a clinical-pathological correlation study. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors are key-players in extracellular matrix and basement membrane degradation, and are involved in both physiological and malignant processes. The aim of this study was to examine MMP-2, -7 and -9 and TIMP-1 and -2 expression in normal, hyperplastic and malignant endometrium, and their relation to clinical and histological prognostic factors.We performed qualitative and semi-quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of 20 samples of normal endometrium (10 in the proliferative phase, 10 in the secretory phase), 39 samples of hyperplastic endometrium (17 without atypia and 22 with atypia) and 38 samples of endometrioid carcinoma, by using specific monoclonal antibodies.In normal endometrium, epithelial expression of MMP-2 (P = 0.0007), MMP-7 (P = 0.0002) and TIMP-2 (P = 0.0004) was increased during the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. MMP-2 expression correlated negatively with TIMP-2 expression (P = 0.001, rho = 0.702). Endometrial stromal cells in the secretory phase showed strong MMP-2 expression (P = 0.004) and weak MMP-7 (P = 0.001) and TIMP-1 expression (P = 0.01). In hyperplastic endometrium, the presence of atypia was associated with lower TIMP-2 expression (P = 0.005) and was also associated with a trend towards higher MMP-2 expression. Endometrial stromal cell expression of MMP-2, -7 and -9 and TIMP-1 and -2 did not differ between hyperplastic endometrium with and without atypia. A gradient of MMP-2 and -9 expression was observed from hyperplastic endometrium to endometrial carcinomas. In endometrial carcinomas, MMP-2 expression increased (P = 0.0004) and TIMP-2 expression decreased (P = 0.0005) with the histological grade. TIMP-2 expression correlated with myometrial invasion (P = 0.005), lymphovascular space involvement (P = 0.008) and lymph node involvement (P = 0.007).These results support the involvement of MMPs and TIMPs in endometrial carcinogenesis. Strong MMP-2 and weak TIMP-2 expression were the most potent markers of endometrial malignancies with a high risk of local and distant spread.
