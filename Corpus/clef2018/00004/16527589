Ureteral endometriosis in patients after total abdominal hysterectomy: presentation and diagnosis: a case series. Although ureteral endometriosis is uncommon, it is a significant disease process that can cause irreversible renal damage because of delays in diagnosis. It is even more uncommon and therefore more likely to be left out of the differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women. This case series reviewed the clinical presentation and treatment of ureteral endometriosis, as well as the history and treatment of 3 postmenopausal women who presented with ureteral obstruction secondary to ureteral endometriomas.
