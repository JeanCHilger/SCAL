Increasing expression of extracellular matrix metalloprotease inducer in ovary tumors: tissue microarray analysis of immunostaining score with clinicopathological parameters. Ovary cancer invasion is responsible for both local tissue destruction and distant metastasis. Invasion is largely mediated by matrix metalloproteases that are thought to be induced by tumor cell-derived extracellular matrix metalloprotease inducer (EMMPRIN) in surrounding fibroblasts. We hypothesized that EMMPRIN isoverexpressed in ovary tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis of EMMPRIN was performed in tissue microarrays of ovary neoplasms including 84 cases of serous adenocarcinoma, 23 cases of mucinous adenocarcinoma, 10 cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma, 12 cases of yolk sac tumor, 12 cases of clear cell carcinoma, 8 cases of dysgerminoma, 8 cases of granulosa cell tumor, 6 cases of transitional cell carcinoma, and 6 cases of Brenner tumor. All malignant ovary tumors showed significant immunohistochemical expression of EMMPRIN. The EMMPRIN scores in malignant ovary tumors were significantly higher than their nontumor counterparts (313+/-28 for serous adenocarcinoma 308+/-25 for mucinous adenocarcinoma
