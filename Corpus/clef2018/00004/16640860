Visual and histologic analysis of laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis. To determine the characteristics of anatomical distribution of pelvic endometriosis and the correlation between visual and histologic findings of endometriosis at laparoscopy.A prospective study of 62 patients undergoing laparoscopy for the pelvic pain, infertility and/or pelvic masses was carried out. All lesions with the diagnosis of endometriosis laparoscopically were excised and examined pathologically. Normal-appearing peritoneal biopsies were obtained randomly. All lesions were identified by anatomical site and color of the foci. The positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), and specificity were determined for visually identified endometriosis versus the histologic findings.Totally, 219 peritoneal endometriotic lesions, 54 normal peritoneal biopsies, and 71 ovarian endometriotic cysts were obtained. Peritoneal lesions tended to locate in posterior part of the pelvis (80.8%, 177/219) and in left (58.0%, 127/219) with most in black (39.2%). The PPV was 67.6% sensitivity, 93.7%Our study showed asymmetrical distribution of pelvic endometriosis. Peritoneal lesions in black or from sacral ligament are more likely to be histologically confirmed, and microscopic lesions are not a rare phenomenon of endometriosis.
