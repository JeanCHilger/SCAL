Diagnostic value of the detection of aromatase cytochrome P450 and CA125 for endometriosis. To evaluate the diagnostic value of examining endometrial biopsy specimens for aromatase cytochrome P450 and CA125 for endometriosis.The expression of aromatase cytochrome P450 in endometrium was detected by immunohistochemical analysis for 36 endometriosis women and 22 non-endometriosis but subfertility or pelvic pain women served as controls the serum CA125 levels were measured by chemical radiation method.By measuring serum CA125, the sensitivity of the serum CA125 assay was 44%, the specificity was 82%, the positive predictive value was 80%, and the negative predictive value was 47% the sensitivity of aromatase cytochrome P450 in biopsy endometrium of endometriosis was 82%, the specificity was 59%, the positive predictive value was 76%, and the negative predictive value was 67%.The combination assay of aromatase cytochrome P450 in eutopic endometrium and CA125 can be used as a diagnostic test for endometriosis, especially for the early stage of endometriosis, which is superior to the assay of CA125.
