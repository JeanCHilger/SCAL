Leukaemia inhibitory factor and interleukin 11 levels in uterine flushings of infertile patients with endometriosis. Exact aetiology of infertility in stage I/II endometriosis patients is not known. Interleukin 11 (IL-11) and leukaemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) are factors associated with implantation window in human eutopic endometrium. We decided to test whether there is an altered secretion of these factors, which could explain receptivity defect in patients with minimal endometriosis.Uterine flushing and endometrial samples were collected 7-9 days after ovulation (implantation window) from infertile patients with stage I/II endometriosis (n = 14) and fertile, endometriosis-free controls (n = 21). IL-11 and LIF were assessed in uterine flushings in eutopic endometria in all patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In eutopic endometrium, semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed for LIF and IL-11 mRNA expressions.No statistically significant differences were found in uterine flushing in women with and without endometriosis with regard to IL-11 levels (0.0 pg/ml versus 0.0 pg/ml) and LIF (25.53 pg/ml versus 36.26 pg/ml). These results were confirmed by the results of RT-PCR, where there were also no differences between studied groups.There is no receptivity defect with regard to LIF and IL-11 secretions by eutopic endometrium in infertile women with endometriosis.
