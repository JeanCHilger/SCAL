Removal of pelvic leiomyomata and endometriosis five years after supracervical hysterectomy. The number of laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomies performed has increased, yet the benefits and consequences are not well understood.The patient presented 5 years after a laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy with pelvic pain, an elevated CA 125 level, and a pelvic mass. Surgical exploration revealed multiple leiomyomata with adenomyosis and endometriosis.After a laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy, pelvic seeding of morcellated uterine tissue may lead to symptomatic pelvic leiomyomata and endometriosis requiring further surgery. Surgeons performing laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomies should take measures to prevent pelvic seeding at the time of morcellation and recognize the complication when it occurs.
