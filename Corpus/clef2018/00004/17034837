Synchronous ovarian granulosa cell tumor and uterine serous carcinoma: a rare association of a high-risk endometrial cancer with anestrogenic ovarian tumor. Ovarian granulosa cell tumors are often associated with endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma. The endometrial carcinoma is thought to occur under the influence of the estrogen receptor pathway and is typically a low-grade, low-stage endometrioid adenocarcinoma.We present a case of a woman with a granulosa cell tumor of the ovary and a synchronous serous carcinoma of the endometrium. Immunohistochemical stains for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and p53 protein were performed on both tumors.Not all uterine tumors associated with ovarian granulosa cell tumors have low-risk histology. Preoperative evaluation of the uterus with attention to tumor subtyping is important for optimum staging and therapy.
