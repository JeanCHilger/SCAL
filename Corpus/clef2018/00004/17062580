Serum interleukin-6 levels are elevated in women with minimal-mild endometriosis. There is a need for a reliable marker of endometriosis, especially in early stages of peritoneal disease during which imaging is not effective. The use of serum interleukin (IL)-6 as a marker is controversial. To readdress the matter, patients undergoing laparoscopy were prospectively evaluated for serum IL-6 levels.A total of 119 women 31 years old who underwent laparoscopy were divided into groups: control patients (n = 38) with no pathologic findings endometriosis sufferers (n = 47) with minimal-mild (MM, n = 11) or moderate-severe (MS, n = 36) endometriosisSerum IL-6 levels were significantly (P = 0.002) higher in women with MM endometriosis (29.4 9.0 pg/ml) than in controls (15.7 9.3 pg/ml). When all the non-endometriosis patients were grouped together (n = 72) and serum IL-6 (17.8 12.1 pg/ml) compared with MS (n = 36 17.6 10.3 pg/ml) and MM (n = 11IL-6 is a reliable non-invasive marker of MM endometriosis, whereas Ca-125 is of use as a marker of severe cases.
