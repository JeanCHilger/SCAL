Mullerian Inhibiting Substance enhances subclinical doses of chemotherapeutic agents to inhibit human and mouse ovarian cancer. Mullerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS), a biological modifier that causes regression of Mullerian ducts in male embryos, is effective as a single agent in vitro and in vivo against human and mouse ovarian cancer cell lines expressing MIS type II receptor however, little is known about how recombinant human MIS (rhMIS), now being scaled for preclinical trials, could be used in combination with cytotoxic or targeted chemotherapeutic agents. Mouse serous and endometrioid ovarian carcinoma cell lines were tested in vitro against rhMIS alone and with doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or cisplatin as agents in clinical use. Because MIS releases FK506 binding protein (FKBP12), which activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream of Akt, rhMIS and rapamycin combinations were tested. MIS increases p16 protein levels, and 5'-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (AzadC) induces p16 mRNA
