Endometriomas of the abdominal wall: Imaging findings. Endometrioma of the abdominal wall is a not well-recognized disease and usually develops after pelvic surgery. The most common presentation is a mass of the abdominal wall associated with pain during menstruation. We report six cases of parietal endometriomas studied with ultrasonography, CT, and in one case with MRI. Our results are compared with recent findings in the literature. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and imaging findings in abdominal wall endometriomas that can help reach a presurgical diagnosis.
