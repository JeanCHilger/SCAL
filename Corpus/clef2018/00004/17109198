Image analysis measurements of the microvascularisation in endometrium, superficial and deep endometriotic tissues. The aim of this study was to evaluate precisely the microvascularisation of endometrium, superficial and deep endometriotic lesions, in progestin-treated and non-treated patients suffering from endometriosis.A population of 66 women was constituted. Immunohistochemistry was carried out with a specific marker of the endothelial cells (CD31). The number of vessels and the vessel area were assessed by a computer image analysis system.The number of vessels per mm2 were 211, 216, 225 and the vessel area was 270, 141 and 194 microm2, respectively in endometria, superficial and deep endometriotic lesions of untreated women. In endometria, superficial and deep endometriotic lesions of progestin-treated women the number of vessels were respectively 129, 149, and 181 per mm2 and the vessel area was 369, 474 and 254 microm2.Statistically significant data indicate that endometriotic lesions are heterogeneous and suggest that progestin treatment induces a reduction in number and a concomitant dilation of microvessels with more microvascular changes in endometrium and superficial endometriotic lesions than in deep endometriotic lesions.
