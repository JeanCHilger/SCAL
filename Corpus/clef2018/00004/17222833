Concomitant treatment of severe uterine adenomyosis in a premenopausal woman with an aromatase inhibitor and a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. To assess the effect of aromatase inhibitors with GnRH agonist for a severe symptomatic adenomyosis that is refractory to GnRH agonist and danazol with GnRH agonist.Case report.Clinical practice in university hospital.A 34-year-old woman with a complaint of severe dysmenorrheal, symptomatic anemia, and a desire to retain fertility.Aromatase inhibitor anastrozole given orally (1.0 mg or 2.0 mg daily) for 16 weeks and GnRH agonist given monthly (injected SC, 1.8 mg) for 4 months.Measurements of uterine volume and levels of serum E(2), estrone, A, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, LH, FSH, and CA125.Uterine volume was reduced. The reduction rate of uterine volume estimated by magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography was 60% after 8 weeks of treatment.Aromatase inhibitor with GnRH agonist therapy was useful for the management of a severely adenomyotic woman whose desire was for conservative treatment.
