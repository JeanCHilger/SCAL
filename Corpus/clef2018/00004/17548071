Peritoneal fluid macrophages in endometriosis: correlation between the expression of estrogen receptors and inflammation. To investigate the expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) and inflammatory cytokines in macrophages obtained from peritoneal fluid (PF) of women with endometriosis.Comparative immunocytochemical study.University hospital.Thirty women with endometriosis and 22 controls.The PF samples were collected at laparoscopy.The expression of ERalpha, ERbeta, differentiation markers (CD68, NCL-MACRO, HAM56), and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha], IL-6) in PF macrophages was determined.The expression of CD68, NCL-MACRO, HAM56, TNFalpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta was significantly higher in PF macrophages obtained from women with endometriosis than in controls. The ERalpha and ERbeta had significantly higher expression in macrophages of women with endometriosis than in controls. A positive correlation was observed between the expression of ERalpha and ERbeta both in women with and without endometriosis. The ERalpha expression was positively correlated with the expression of inflammatory cytokines in women with endometriosis but not in controls ERbeta expression was correlated to the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the both groups.There is a correlation between the expression of ERbeta and proinflammatory cytokines both in women with and without endometriosis. The expression of ERalpha correlates with cytokine production selectively in women with endometriosis but not in controls.
