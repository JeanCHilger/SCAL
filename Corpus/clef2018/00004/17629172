Endometriosis: rare localizations in two cases. Endometriosis is a disease in continuous evolution due to its various aspects and atypical localizations. Every year many women all over the world are affected by it. In typical localizations the diagnosis is simple the symptoms include pelvic pain and in most of cases sterility. In rare localizations the symptoms are non-specific and the diagnosis is difficult. In particular an intestinal isolated localization is often asymptomatic or can cause non-specific pelvic pain, irregular intestinal activity and in such case, a subocclusive condition often with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. Two cases of rare localizations of endometriosis are described in the intestinal wall and a cesarean section scar. An analysis of the etiopathogenesis and diagnostic approach in these rare localizations is presented.
