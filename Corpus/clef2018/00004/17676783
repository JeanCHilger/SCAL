Proteomic analysis of peritoneal fluid in women with endometriosis. This study aims to evaluate differences in the expression of proteins present in the peritoneal fluid (PF) of women with and without endometriosis. PF samples were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis protein spots of interest were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Several molecules had aberrant expression in PF of women with endometriosis
