Interleukin (IL)-17A stimulates IL-8 secretion, cyclooxygensase-2 expression, and cell proliferation of endometriotic stromal cells. IL-17A is secreted from Th17 cells, a discovery leading to revision of the mechanism underlying the role of Th1/Th2 in the immune response. Strong evidence suggests that immune responses associated with inflammation are involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. In the present study, we first demonstrated that the presence of Th17 cells in peritoneal fluid of endometriotic women by flow cytometric analysis and IL-17A-positive cells in endometriotic tissues by immunohistochemistry. To investigate the role of IL-17A in the development of endometriosis, we then studied the effect of IL-17A on IL-8 production, cyclooxygensase-2 expression, and cell proliferation of cultured endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs). IL-17A enhanced IL-8 secretion from ESCs in a dose-dependent manner. The IL-17A-induced secretion of IL-8 from ESCs was suppressed by anti-IL-17 receptor A antibodies or inhibitors of p38 MAPK, p42/44 MAPK, and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Addition of TNFalpha synergistically increased IL-17A-induced IL-8 secretion from ESCs. IL-17A also enhanced the expression of cyclooxygensase-2 mRNA and proliferation of ESCs. IL-17A may play a role in the development of endometriosis by stimulating inflammatory responses and proliferation of ESCs.
