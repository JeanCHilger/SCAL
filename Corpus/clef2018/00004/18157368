Current practice in the management of symptoms of endometriosis: a survey of Brazilian gynecologists. The purpose is to assess current medical practice in the diagnosis of endometriosis by Brazilian gynecologists.A Cross-sectional study using questionnaires was sent to all gynecologists of the SÃ£o Paulo State Ob/Gyn Association.A total of 1,660 (31.8%) replies was received. Multiple logistic regression showed that physicians who stated that endometriosis can affect women of all ages was the variable significantly associated with suspicion of endometriosis. Diagnosis was delayed less than 12 months after the first consultation when patients complained of: infertility (OR=1.81, 95% CI 1.01-3.22), dysmenorrhea (OR=2.16, 95% CI 1.18-3.93) or chronic pelvic pain (CPP) (OR=2.17, 95% CI 1.17-4.00). Time until diagnosis was shorter when the complaint was dysmenorrhea (OR=1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.69) or CPP (OR=1.51, 95% CI 1.19-1.91) and when physicians had participated in congresses and lectures on gynecological endoscopy and endometriosis.Gynaecologists who are better informed suspect and diagnose endometriosis at an early stage.
