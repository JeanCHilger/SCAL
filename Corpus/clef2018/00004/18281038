Progesterone receptor +331G/A polymorphism in endometriosis and deep-infiltrating endometriosis. In this study, we sought to examine the association between P receptor +331G/A polymorphism and endometriosis. We excluded any relationship between endometriosis in general and the P receptor +331G/A polymorphism but found a significant association with deep-infiltrating endometriosis, supporting a potential role of this variant in the P receptor-dependent invasive behavior of endometrial cells.
