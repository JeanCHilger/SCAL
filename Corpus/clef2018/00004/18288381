Genome-wide microarray gene expression, array-CGH analysis, and telomerase activity in advanced ovarian endometriosis: a high degree of differentiation rather than malignant potential. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether endometriosis and cancer share common molecular characteristics. Tissue samples were collected prospectively during diagnostic laparoscopy of patients with primary infertility. Using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays, (Affymetrix Gene Chip HG-U133 Set) the genome-wide gene expression profile of advanced ovarian endometriosis was analyzed compared with matched normal endometrium. Expression of TERT, the gene encoding the telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit, and telomerase activity were analyzed in eutopic and ectopic endometrium. Genome-wide, high-resolution array-CGH was used to screen for genomic aberrations in endometriosis. Expression microarray data were validated quantitatively with RT-PCR. The genes RARRES1 and RARRES2 (retinoic acid receptor responder 1 and 2) were found to be up-regulated in endometriosis, suggesting a high degree of differentiation. Consistently, down-regulated genes included those involved in the cell cycle, cell metabolism and homeostasis. Expression of TERT and telomerase activity were present in eutopic but absent in ectopic endometrium. Array-CGH revealed a normal genomic pattern without gross amplifications and deletions. In conclusion, these data suggest that advanced ovarian endometriosis represents a highly differentiated tissue with minimal or no malignant potential.
