Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin expression in endometriosis, low-grade endometrial carcinoma and non-neoplastic eutopic endometrium. Endometriosis and endometrial endometrioid carcinoma are both capable of invasion and metastasis, but their biological behavior is strikingly different. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and changes in adhesion molecules have a role in the pathogenesis of various physiological and pathological processes, as well as in the development of endometriosis and endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. We hypothesized that endometriosis, being a benign process, will show different MMPs and adhesion molecules expressions, compared to endometrioid endometrial carcinoma, a disease with potential of malignant behavior.We performed an immunohistochemical study to investigate expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), E-cadherin and beta-catenin in endometriosis, low-grade endometrial endometrioid carcinoma, and eutopic proliferative endometrium. Endometriotic tissues (n=15), low-grade endometrial endometrioid carcinomas (n=15), and unremarkable proliferative endometrium from women without endometriosis or carcinoma (n=10) were examined.Endometriotic tissues showed statistically significantly stronger staining for MMP-9 and reduced beta-catenin expression when compared with proliferative endometrium. Endometrial endometrioid carcinoma showed decreased E-cadherin expression in comparison with proliferative endometrium. MMP-2 and MMP-9, and E-cadherin expressions were significantly higher and beta-catenin expression was significantly lower in endometriosis as compared to endometrioid carcinoma.We suggest that increased MMPs and altered beta-catenin may play a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Decreased E-cadherin may be important in the development of endometrial endometrioid carcinoma. The changes in MMPs, E-cadherin and beta-catenin differ in endometriosis from those in endometrioid carcinoma, an interesting finding in view of the fact that both these diseases are capable of invasion and metastasis, but have different biological behavior.
