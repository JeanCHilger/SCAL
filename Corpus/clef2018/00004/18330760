Catamenial hemoptysis. Catamenial hemoptysis is a rare condition that is associated with the presence of intrapulmonary or endobronchial endometrial tissue. We describe a case of endobronchial endometriosis with catamenial hemoptysis. The patient was a 22 years-old girl presented with recurrent hemoptysis episodes for the last two years. Bronchoscopic examination was performed within first days of menses, and indicated multiple purplish-red submucosal patches in distal one third of trachea and bilateral bronchial trees that bled easily when touched. The cytological evaluation of the bronchial brushing specimens demonstrated clusters of small cuboidal cells consistent with an endometrial origin. Follow-up bronchoscopic examination at the end of the menstrual cycle revealed that the previous tracheobronchial lesions disappeared. The patient was treated with Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) analogues and hormones including estrogen and progesterone therapy. Recurrent hemoptysis stopped following the medical treatment.
