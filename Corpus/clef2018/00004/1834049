A comparative treatment trial of endometriosis using the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist, nafarelin, and the synthetic steroid, danazol. A randomized and double-blind trial was carried out comparing intranasal nafarelin acetate (400 micrograms daily) and oral danazol (600 mg daily), given over 6 months, in the treatment of 49 patients with laparoscopically proven endometriosis. Both drugs produced a highly significant and similar reduction (of 60 to 70%) in objective American Fertility Society scoring, even in severe disease. No effect was seen on adhesions. Both drugs suppressed oestradiol levels to a similar extent, although nafarelin caused a substantial rise in the first 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy. Nafarelin suppressed LH substantially and FSH, testosterone and prolactin to a small degree, whereas FSH and LH increased slightly during danazol. Pregnancies occurred in 12 of 22 infertile women in the 12 months following nafarelin, and in 6 of 14 in the danazol group. Side-effects were reported at a similar rate with both drugs, but the pattern was different. Hot flushes were the predominant side effect with nafarelin, although oestradiol levels were not suppressed to the extent expected. Small amounts of spotting or light bleeding were experienced with both drugs, but these tended to decrease with time with nafarelin and increase with danazol.
