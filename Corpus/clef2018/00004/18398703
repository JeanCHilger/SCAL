P53 and BCL-2 as prognostic markers in endometrial carcinoma. The objective of this study was to verify the frequency of p53 and BCL-2 immunohistochemical expression in patients with endometrial carcinoma and to correlate it with histological factors (histological type, tumor grade, depth of myometrial invasion, lymph node involvement and surgical staging) and survival. Forty-eight patients with endometrial carcinoma who were submitted to primary surgical treatment were assessed. p53 and BCL-2 immunohistochemical expression was determined using paraffin blocks containing the tumor area. p53 and BCL-2 expression was detected in 39.6% and 58.3% of the tumors, respectively. No significant difference was found regarding the frequency of p53 expression when analyzing histological type (33.3% in endometrioid tumors, 58.3% in non-endometrioid tumors p = 0.176), depth of myometrial invasion (p = 0.632) and surgical staging (I-11.1%, II-66.7%, III-57.1%
