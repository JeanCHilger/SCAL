Ileocecal intussusception secondary to a cecal endometriosis. We report the case of a 43-year-old woman, who presented a complete and non-reductible ileo-cecal intussusception with pre-occlusion. An ileocecal resection with ileocolic anastomosis was performed. The pathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of colic endometriosis with transmural lesions, causing the intussusception. Altough the digestive endometriosis is quite classical and well-known, particulary with vermiform appendix and rectosigmo√Ød involvement, ileo-cecal intussusception secondary to endometriosis is rare.
