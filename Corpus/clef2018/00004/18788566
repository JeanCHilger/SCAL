Associations of metabolism of lipid, calcium and phosphate in endometriosis. To investigate the metabolism of lipid, calcium and phosphorus in women with endometriosis.Clinical data of 223 patients with endometriosis and 200 patients without endometriosis were retrospectively analyzed. Electrochemiluminoimmunoassay was used to detect the levels of serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone (T), estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P), and photoelectric colorimetry was used to determine the concentrations of serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), calcium and phosphorus in the patients with and without endometriosis.The levels of serum P were 2.0 nmol/L and 1.8 nmol/L in endometriosis patients with age < or = 35 years old (case group A) and > 35 years old (case group B), and 1.6 nmol/L and 1.2 nmol/L in patients without endometriosis at age < or = 35 years old (control group A) and > 35 years old (control group B), respectively. A significant difference was found between case group A and control group A, and between case group B and control group B. The levels of serum LH was significantly higher in case group B (7.2 U/L) than that in control group B (6.1 U/L), however, there was no significant difference between case group A (7.0 U/L) and control group A (6.5 U/L). Also no significant difference in serum FSH, T and E2 levels was found between case group A (respectively, 6.2 U/L, 1.1 nmol/L and 269 pmol/L) and control group A (respectively, 6.3 U/L, 1.1 nmol/L and 264 pmol/L), also between case group B (respectively, 6.6 U/L, 1.0 nmol/L and 345 pmol/L) and control group B (6.6 IU/L, 0.9 nmol/L and 279 pmol/L). The concentrations of serum TG in case group A and B (0.71 mmol/L and 0.72 mmol/L) were significantly lower than in control group A and B (0.92 mmol/L and 1.08 mmol/L), respectively. The concentrations of serum LDL in case group A and B [(2.2 +/- 0.5) mmol/L and (2.4 +/- 0.6) mmol/L]were also significantly lower than in control group A and B [(2.4 +/- 0.7) mmol/L and (2.62 +/- 0.63) mmol/L], respectively. However, the concentrations of serum HDL in case group A and B [(1.62 +/- 0.31) mmol/L and (1.53 +/- 0.32) mmol/L] were significantly higher than in control group A and B [(1.48 +/- 0.21) mmol/L and (1.37 +/- 0.22) mmol/L] , respectively. In addition, the concentrations of serum TC were not significantly different between case group A and control group A [(4.2 +/- 0.7) mmol/L and (4.29 +/- 0.71) mmol/L], and between case group B and control group B [(4.4 +/- 0.8) mmol/L and (4.5 +/- 0.7) mmol/L]. The levels of serum phosphorus in case group A and B [(1.01 +/- 0.22) mmol/L and (0.89 +/- 0.18 mmol/L] were significantly lower than in control group A and B [1.23 +/- 0.24 mmol/L and (1.10 +/- 0.13) mmol/L], respectively. But the levels of serum calcium had no significant difference between case group A and control group A [(2.33 +/- 0.23) mmol/L and (2.41 +/- 0.12) mmol/L], and between case group B and control group B [(2.40 +/- 0.28) mmol/L and (2.42 +/- 0.20) mmol/L].The abnormal metabolism of lipid and phosphorus, and the higher levels of serum P may playing a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
