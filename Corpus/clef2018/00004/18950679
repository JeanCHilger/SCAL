Structure-activity study in the class of 6-(3'-hydroxyphenyl)naphthalenes leading to an optimization of a pharmacophore model for 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17beta-HSD1) inhibitors. 17beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17beta-HSD1) catalyzes the transformation of estrone (E1) into the most potent estrogen, estradiol (E2), which stimulates cell proliferation and decreases apoptosis. 17beta-HSD1 is often strongly overexpressed in estrogen-dependent diseases (like breast cancer and endometriosis). Thus, this over expressed enzyme is a promising novel target for the development of selective inhibitors, which could be used as drugs for the treatment of these diseases. Using a structure- and ligand-based approach, a pharmacophore model was proposed and a new class of non-steroidal inhibitors of 17beta-HSD1 was designed. Enzyme inhibition was evaluated in vitro using the human enzyme. After identification of the 6-(3'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-naphthol scaffold 1, the potency of this class of inhibitors was further improved by substitution of the 1-position of the naphthalene ring by a phenyl group (compound 18, IC(50)=20nM). Compound 18 also showed a good selectivity toward 17beta-HSD2 and the estrogen receptors alpha and beta.
