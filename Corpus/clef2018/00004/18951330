MicroRNA signature and regulatory functions in the endometrium during normal and disease states. During the menstrual cycle, human endometrium undergoes extensive cyclic morphologic and biochemical modifications in preparation for embryo implantation. These processes are highly regulated by ovarian steroids and various locally expressed gene products and involve inflammatory reaction, apoptosis, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, differentiation (tissue formation), and tissue remodeling. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of gene expression, and their altered and/or aberrant expression has been associated with establishment and progression of various disorders, including tumorigenesis. This review highlights the endometrial expression of miRNAs and their potential regulatory functions under normal and pathologic conditions such as endometriosis, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and endometrial cancer. Given the key regulatory function of miRNAs on gene expression stability, understanding the underlying mechanisms of how endometrial miRNAs are regulated and identifying their specific target genes and their functions might lead to the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies by regulating specific target genes associated with such reproductive disorders.
