Inguinal endometriosis. Inguinal endometriosis is a rare manifestation of endometriosis. Four cases are presented. In three of these cases proper diagnosis was delayed due to differential diagnostic difficulties as the symptoms in these cases were interpreted as hernia. In two cases the patient underwent hernia surgery. In inguinal lump cases in fertile women, endometriosis should be considered if accompanied by dysmenorrhoea or deep dyspareunia. In such cases MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans often yield further diagnostic information. If surgery is needed, it should be performed in a gynaecological setting to facilitate full surgical intervention including abdominal laparoscopy and excision.
