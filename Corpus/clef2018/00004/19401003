IVF outcome in women with endometriosis in relation to tumour necrosis factor and anti-Müllerian hormone. This study reports on anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in serum and follicular fluid (FF) in relation to inflammatory parameters in women with and without endometriosis undergoing IVF. Serum and FF samples were obtained from 72 women, with (n = 34) and without (n = 38) endometriosis, undergoing IVF. The concentrations of AMH, FSH, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and several interleukins were analysed. Women with endometriosis had significantly lower AMH in serum and FF (serum: 6.38 versus 12.8 pM P < 0.01, FF: 14.0 versus 19.6 pM
