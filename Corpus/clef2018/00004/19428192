Anatomical and histological study of the uterosacral ligament: practical surgical consequences. To define the vascular and nervous relationships of the uterosacral ligament and to analyze histologically its content for a better description of this structure.Three fresh fetal cadavers, three embalmed and one fresh adult cadavers were used. The anatomical relationships of the uterosacral ligament were studied by dissecting one fresh fetal pelvis and two embalmed adult pelves. By histological and immunohistological examinations, eight biopsies of the cervical origin of the complexe ligamentaire ut√©rosacral (USLC) were analyzed: four from fresh fetuses, two from a fresh adult cadaver and two from an embalmed adult cadaver. The specimens were stained with haematoxylin eosin safran (HES) coloration, with antinervous cell specific antibodies (PS100) and with antismooth muscle actine antibodies (to visualize vessel walls) before examination under optical microscope.On anatomic examination, the uterosacral ligament was covered by the visceral pelvic fascia. By removing this fascia, the uterosacral ligament appeared to be a condensation of nervous fibers made up of hypogastric and pelvic nerves forming the hypogastric plexus. Histologically, the uterosacral ligament contained connective tissue, nervous fibers, sympathetic nodes, vessels and fatty tissue. No structured ligamentous organization was identified.The uterosacral "ligament" is in fact a "ligament complex" integrating connective tissue as well as nervous and vascular elements. Radical wide excisions of the USLC during cancer or endometriosis surgery and uterosacral suspension during pelvic floor reconstructive surgery should be performed with caution in order to preserve pelvic innervation.
