Steroid receptors, HER2/neu and Ki-67, in endometrioid type of endometrial carcinoma: Correlation with conventional histomorphological features of prognosis. Endometrial proliferation is regulated by steroid receptors such as estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) and progesterone receptor (PR). HER2/neu is an important growth factor receptor which affects cell proliferation and Ki67 is a marker of cellular proliferation. Their interaction in endometrioid type of endometrial carcinoma is still not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed the immunolocalisation of ERalpha and ERbeta with particular attention to the ERbetacx isoform, PR, HER2/neu and Ki67 in endometrioid carcinoma. Their correlations with each other and with the conventional morphological prognostic parameters of myoinvasion and tumor grade were analyzed with respect to overall survival. Out of a total 54 cases, 14 showed evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease within 5 years with poor outcome, whereas the rest had no evidence of disease. ERalpha, ERbeta, ERbetacx, PR, HER2/neu and Ki67 were detected using immunohistochemistry. The histological grade of the tumor correlated inversely with the intensity of immunolabelling of ERalpha and PR, and this was highly significant. The depth of myoinvasion showed an inverse correlation only with the ERbeta2/betacx immunopositivity and was not significantly associated with any other receptor evaluated. Analysis of the inter-relationship between receptor immunopositivity revealed a significant association of ERalpha immunolocalisation with ERbeta and with PR. Immunodetection of HER2/neu receptor correlated positively with both ERalpha and PR immunolabelling. The Ki-67 proliferation index correlated only with ERalpha immunopositivity. Preliminary observations suggested that with the exception of ERalpha, there was no correlation of any of the receptors evaluated with survival.
