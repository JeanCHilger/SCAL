Cytokine array analysis of peritoneal fluid between women with endometriosis of different stages and those without endometriosis. Cytokines are key mediators of intercellular communication and are likely to promote the development and progression of endometriosis. Previous studies provided evidence that endometriosis develops as a result of the pathogenetic factors in the peritoneal environment, especially the peritoneal fluid (PF). We determined different cytokine expression in peritoneal fluid between women with minimal/mild and moderate/severe endometriosis and those without endometriosis using the cytokine array. As a result, 78 cytokines were found to have a threefold change, including 74 increases and four decreases in endometriosis compared with the control group 96 cytokines had a threefold change including 91 increases and five decreases in minimal and mild endometriosis compared with the control group
