Immunohistochemical detection of steroid receptor cofactors in ovarian endometriosis: involvement of down-regulated SRC-1 expression in the limited growth activity of the endometriotic epithelium. To study the steroid hormone-induced growth mechanisms of endometriosis, the immunohistochemical expression of steroid hormone receptor cofactors was investigated in 37 cases of endometriotic epithelia and was compared with that of eutopic endometria of identical patients. The expression of steroid receptor coactivators (p300/CBP and SRC-1) and corepressors (NCoR and SMRT) was examined in relation to the estrogen receptor (ER), the progesterone receptor (PR), and Ki-67. Results of immunostaining were indicated as a "positivity index" (PI, full score 100). The expression of ER and PR in endometriotic epithelia largely resembled that in eutopic endometria, however, the expression of Ki-67 in the proliferative phase (PI 13.8 +/- 2.4, mean +/- SD) was significantly lower than that in eutopic endometria (32.6 +/- 10.6). The expression of SRC-1 in eutopic endometria was increased in the proliferative phase (56.5 +/- 16.8) and decreased in the secretory phase (14.8 +/- 6.9). In endometriosis, however, the PI for SRC-1 did not show apparent cyclic changes during the menstrual cycle. Moreover, the expression of SRC-1 in endometriotic epithelia in the proliferative phase was significantly lower than that in eutopic endometria. These findings suggested the reduced proliferative activity in endometriotic epithelia to be related to the reduced expression of SRC-1.
