Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and interleukin-6 gene polymorphisms in patients with advanced-stage endometriosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that the K469E and G241R polymorphisms in the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) gene and the C-634G polymorphism in the interleukin (IL)-6 gene are associated with endometriosis in the Korean population.The ICAM-1 gene K469E and G241R polymorphisms and the IL-6 gene C-634G polymorphism were evaluated in 390 patients with endometriosis and 351 controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.The ICAM-1 gene G241R polymorphism was not observed in all subjects. No differences were observed in the ICAM-1 K469E and IL-6 C-634G genotype distributions and allele frequencies between patients with endometriosis and controls. In subgroup analyses according to the stage of endometriosis or bilaterality of ovarian endometriomas, no significant differences were observed in the ICAM-1 gene K469E or the IL-6 gene C-634G polymorphism frequencies between the subgroups and the controls. The combined analysis of the ICAM-1 gene K469E polymorphism and the IL-6 gene C-634G polymorphism did not show any additional significant findings.The K469E and G241R polymorphisms in the ICAM-1 gene and the C-634G polymorphism in the IL-6 gene may not be genetic factors related to susceptibility to advanced-stage endometriosis in the Korean population.
