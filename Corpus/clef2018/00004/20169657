Ileal intubation with a transnasal endoscope. Transnasal upper endoscopy has been implemented in the last decade as it is perceived as less fastidious than peroral endoscopy, and small-caliber gastroscopes are widely available in the endoscopic centres. We report the feasibility of performing a full colonic study with ileal intubation, using a small-caliber endoscope commonly used for transanal endoscopy, after failing with a standard gastroscope.
