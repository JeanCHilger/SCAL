Expression of CA-125 in ovarian cancer. Ovarian carcinoma is a heterogeneus disease. Pathologists classify it in serous, clear cell, endometrioid and mucinos subtypes. Each of these subtypes is associated with different genetic risk factors and molecular events during oncogenesis and it is characterised by distinct mRNA expression profiles.We have studied 55 pacients with ovarian tumours who underwent surgery in Clinic "Elena Doamna", Ia≈üi between 2005-2008. CA-125 value was determined pre or postoperator.We have investigated the relationship between tumoral type and CA125 value in all studied cases.By demonstrating the correlations between biomarker expression with stage or prognosis and by demonstrating the variation in expression rates between subtypes we offer persuasive evidence supporting the view that ovarian carcinoma subtypes are different diseases and the value of the biomarker is not always correlated with malignancy.
