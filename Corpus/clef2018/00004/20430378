P450Arom induction in isolated control endometrial cells by peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis. To study the effect of peritoneal fluid from women with (PF-E) and without (PF-C) endometriosis on P(450)Arom expression in endometrial cells.Experimental study.University research unit.Forty women of reproductive age with (n = 22) or without (control n = 18) endometriosis.Peritoneal fluid and eutopic endometrial samples were obtained during surgery from women with (n = 13 and 9, respectively) and without (n = 4 and 14, respectively) endometriosis.Expression study for P(450)Arom, steroid factor 1 (SF-1), chicken ovalbumin upstream transcription factor I (COUP-TFI), and COUP-TFII messenger RNA (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reacion) and/or protein (immunoblot) in isolated endometrial epithelial cells transfected or not with expression vector containing SF-1, COUP-TFI, or COUP-TFII complementary DNAs.Basal messenger RNA and/or protein expression of P(450)Arom and SF-1 were augmented in endometriosis, and that of COUP-TF was diminished. In control cells, (Bu)(2)cAMP and PF-E increased P(450)Arom and SF-1 expression (but not COUP-TF expression) in a dose-dependent way, an effect not observed with PF-C, adsorbed PF-E, or 10(-5) M indomethacin. Transfected cells confirmed these results. Any treatments modified the studied molecules in endometriosis cells.These data indicate that molecules contained in PF-E favor an estrogenic microenvironment, suggesting a role in the etiopathogenesis of endometriosis enabling the survival, maintenance, and growth of endometrial implants in the ectopic locations.
