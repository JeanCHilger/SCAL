Luteinizing hormone beta-subunit gene (LHbeta) polymorphism in infertility and endometriosis-associated infertility. To establish the frequency of LHbeta G1502A polymorphism in infertile women with endometriosis, infertile women without endometriosis and a control group.Case-control study including 110 infertile women with endometriosis, 84 infertile women without endometriosis and a control group consisting 209 healthy fertile women recruited from the ABC School of Medicine. The LHbeta G1502A polymorphism was studied by RPLP-PCR (restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction).Genotypes GG, GA and AA of the LHbeta G1502A polymorphism presented frequencies of 54.6%, 31.8% and 13.6%, respectively, in the women with endometriosis (p=0.0398) of 52.4%, 38.1% and 9.5% (p=0.0123), respectively, in the infertile women without endometriosisThe data suggest that LHbeta G1502A polymorphism may be involved in the predisposition to infertility and minimal/mild endometriosis-associated infertility, although endometriosis might be only a coincidental finding along with infertility.
