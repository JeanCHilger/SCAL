Association between genetic polymorphisms in fibroblast growth factor (FGF)1 and FGF2 and risk of endometriosis and adenomyosis in Chinese women. Angiogenesis appears to be an important event in the pathophysiology of endometriosis (EM) and adenomyosis. Two angiogenic factors, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1 and 2, play a central role in the initiation of angiogenesis. We investigated whether FGF1 -1385A/G and FGF2 754C/G polymorphisms are associated with a risk of developing EM and adenomyosis.Genotypes were analyzed by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in two groups of women, of Han ethnicity in north China, aged 16-55 years: (1) 421 EM patients and 421 controls (2) 269 adenomyosis patients and 269 controls.There was no difference in genotype distribution of the FGF1 -1385A/G polymorphism between adenomyosis cases and controls (P > 0.05), but the frequency of the A allele in EM patients was lower than that in controls (P = 0.013). Genotype and allele frequencies of the FGF2 754C/C polymorphism were significantly different in both EM and adenomyosis cases versus control groups. Compared with C/C homozygotes, the G allele (C/G + G/G) was associated with a decreased susceptibility to developing EM [odds ratio (OR) = 0.575, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.387-0.854] and adenomyosis (OR = 0.577, 95% CI = 0.367-0.906). Combined genotype analysis of both polymorphisms also showed differences between cases versus controls (all P < 0.001).Our study shows for the first time that the FGF2 754C/G polymorphism may be associated with a risk of developing EM and adenomyosis in north Chinese women. Carriers of the G allele in the FGF2 gene appear to be protected from these gynecological diseases. Further studies in other populations, and of other candidate genes, are now warranted.
