Genetic variants of vascular endothelial growth factor and risk for the development of endometriosis. Endometriosis is regarded as a complex disese, in which genetic and environmental factors contribute to the disease phenotype. Whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -460 C/T and +405 G/C polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to endometriosis was investigated.Diagnosis of endometriosis was made on the basis of laparoscopic findings. Stage of endometriosis was determined according to the Revised American Fertility Society classification. Sixty out of the 112 women enrolled had no endometriosis, 11 had mild or early-stage endometriosis and 41 had severe endometriosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism and agarose gel electrophoresis techniques were used to determine the -460 C/T and +405 G/C genotypes.The VEGF +405 G/C genotype frequencies among the cases and controls were CC 55.8% and 35% GC 30.8% and 50.0%Our data suggest that the CC genotype of VEGF +405 and 460T/405C haplotypes of VEGF may be associated with the risk of endometriosis, but the G allele of VEGF +405 appears to be protective against endometriosis.
