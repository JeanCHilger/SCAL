Loss of sympathetic nerve fibers in intestinal endometriosis. This study analyzed by immunofluorescence staining the sympathetic innervation in the bowel adjacent to the endometriotic lesion and in the healthy tissue at the border of the resected specimen. Sympathetic nerve fibers are significantly reduced in the mucosal and muscular layer near the endometriotic lesions in contrast, sensory nerve fiber density is not altered in the area near the endometriotic lesions.
