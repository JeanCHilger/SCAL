Meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans for genetic susceptibility to endometriosis in Japanese population. To identify susceptibility genes for endometriosis in Japanese women, genome-wide association (GWA) analysis was performed using two case-control cohorts genotyped with the Affymetrix Mapping 500K Array or Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0. In each of the two array cohorts, stringent quality control (QC) filters were applied to newly obtained genotype data, together with previously analyzed data from the Japanese Integrated Database Project. After QC-based filtering of samples and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each cohort, 282 838 SNPs in both genotyping platforms were tested for association with endometriosis using a meta-analysis of the two GWA studies with 696 patients with endometriosis and 825 controls. The meta-analysis revealed that a common susceptibility locus conferring a large effect on the disease risk was unlikely. On the other hand, an excess of SNPs with P-values <10(-4) (36 vs 28 SNPs expected by chance) was observed in the meta-analysis. Of note, four of the top five SNPs with P-values <10(-5) were located in and around IL1A (interleukin 1α), which might be a functional candidate gene for endometriosis. Further studies with larger case-control cohorts will be necessary to elucidate the genetic risk factors.
