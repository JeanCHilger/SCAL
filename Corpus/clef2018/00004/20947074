Ovarian leiomyoma as a potential cause of compromised fertility. To analyze cases of ovarian leiomyomas and to discuss the proper surgical management.A case series and discussion.General university hospital and healthcare center.Nine patients who were diagnosed with ovarian leiomyomas after surgery between 1993 and 2009.None.A preoperative diagnosis that was matched to the postoperative diagnosis and the type of surgery.In all cases, ovarian leiomyoma was misdiagnosed preoperatively as pedunculated uterine myoma, ovarian fibroma, or even ovarian endometrioma. Seven (77.8%) of the nine patients underwent a salpingo-oophorectomy or an oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy, and only two (22.2%) patients were submitted to an ovary-preserving surgery (i.e., a cystectomy or ovarian wedge resection).Because of their extreme rarity, ovarian leiomyomas are seldom suspected intraoperatively or preoperatively. However, most of these tumors appear at reproductive age and have a benign nature, similar to uterine myomas. Therefore, surgeons should perform ovary-preserving management, especially in young patients.
