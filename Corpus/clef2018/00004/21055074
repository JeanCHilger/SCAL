Study on the relationship between polymorphism sites of IL-10 and the susceptibility of endometriosis. To explore the relationship of the endometriosis susceptibility and polymorphism of up stream of IL-10 promoter at the site of 1082(G→A), 819(C→T) and 592(C→A).A total of 214 patients with endometriosis and 160 healthy individuals were enrolled and divided into patient group and control group in this study. The polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was applied to detect the base transition in the up stream of IL-10 promoter at the site of 1082(G→A), 819(C→T) and 592(C→A). SPSS11.0 software was applied to analysis frequencies of all genotypes.There was no difference in polymorphism of IL-10-1082 between the endometriosis (AA: 87.90%, GA: 12.10%) and control group (AA: 87.50%, GA: 12.50%). The rate of TT, CT and CC genotype IL-10-819 was the same as the AA, CA and CC individually. There was no difference in the polymorphism of IL-10-819 or IL-10-592 between the endometriosis group (TT or AA: 41.12%, CT or CA: 47.66%, CC: 11.21%) and control group (χ(2) = 5.87, P = 0.053). However, there were significant difference in the genotype of CT of IL-10-819 or CA of IL-10-592 between the endometriosis group and control group (after adjust OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.10 - 3.21, χ(2) = 5.24, P = 0.021), and the allele C of IL-10-819 or IL-10-592 were close related with occurrence of endometriosis (OR = 1.42, 95%CI = 1.04 - 1.95, χ(2) = 4.81, P = 0.028). The IL-10 level in the plasma of endometriosis group with genotype of CC (CC), CT (CA) of IL-10-819(-592) were significant higher than those with TT (AA) (CA/CT: (50.12 ± 82.40) pg/ml, CC: (91.00 ± 118.23) pg/ml, TT/AA: (21.45 ± 22.10) pg/ml) (F = 2.492, P = 0.048 F = 1.852, P = 0.008).The allele C of IL-10-819 or IL-10-592 was close related to the high level expression of IL-10, and it is the risk of the occurrence of endometriosis.
