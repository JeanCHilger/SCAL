Inguinal endometriosis. Case report and review of the literature. Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition which affects women during their reproductive years. It is characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue responding to hormonal changes associated with menstrual cycle. Aetiology is unknown and symptoms are quite aspecific (dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain, infertility or pelvic mass). Ultrasonography (US) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are accurate diagnostic exams but laparoscopy represents the gold standard in diagnosis and therapy (excision or ablation). Medical treatment pre or postoperatively may be useful prolonging the symptom free interval. In this paper we report the case of a young woman affected by an inguinal mass: diagnostic examinations and histological specimen revealed to be an endometrial focus. We review the literature focusing the diagnostic techniques and relationships between endometriosis and ovarian cancer (endometrioid and clear cell subtypes).
