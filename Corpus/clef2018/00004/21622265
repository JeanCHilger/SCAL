Role of chemokines in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Chemokines, proteins that operate within the body's immune system, play numerous roles in menstruation, bacterial infection, implantation of embryos, and the maintenance of early pregnancy. They are also strongly related to the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Several chemokines including interleukin (IL)-8, growth-related oncogene (GRO) alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 are reported to be elevated in the peritoneal fluid (PF) of women with endometriosis. Chemokines IL-8 and GRO alpha as well as epithelial cell-derived neutrophil-activating protein (ENA)-78, eotaxin, and interferon-inducible protein (IP)-10 might be involved in macrophage activation, inflammatory reaction, and adhesion of endometriotic tissues in the peritoneal cavity, and enhanced angiogenesis in the progression of endometriosis. The chemokines closely related with the pathogenesis of endometriosis form a complex network locally and systemically in women with the disease. Understanding this network is a key to improving our understanding of endometriosis as well as developing new, more effective therapies.
