Infertility and endometriosis: a need for global management that optimizes the indications for surgery and ART. Endometriosis causes pelvic pain and infertility. Infertility results from effects of endometriosis exerted in the pelvic cavity, in the ovaries and/or on the uterus. Medical treatment effective on pain and at preventing disease recurrence following surgery is of no use for improving the chances of conceiving naturally. Surgery however improves the chances of conceiving in the 12-18 months afterward. Endometriosis through extension of the disease to the ovaries may harm ovarian response to COS needed in ART. Surgery for endometrioma(s) may further reduce ovarian responses to COS in case of endometriosis. Remarkably however, reduced ovarian responses due to endometriosis are not necessarily associated with reduced oocyte quality and ART outcome. Pre-ART treatment with oral contraceptives (OC) improves ART outcome in case of ovarian endometriosis particularly, if endometriomas are present at the time of oocyte retrieval. This measure requires however that a proper OC-FSH/hMG interval is respected and that "LH" effects are provided during the ovarian stimulation, using either hMG or small doses of hCG. These latter precautions prevent the adverse outcome reported in case of pre-ART use of OC when ovarian stimulation is conducted using r-FSH exclusively.
