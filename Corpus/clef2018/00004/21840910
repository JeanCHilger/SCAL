Expression patterns of Aurora A and B kinases, Ki-67 and the estrogen and progesterone receptors determined using an endometriosis tissue microarray model. The roles of cell proliferation and genomic instability in endometriosis are highly debated aspects of the pathogenesis of this disease. Aurora A and B kinases play different important roles in cell cycle control and genomic instability and have never been studied in endometriosis. The aim of this study was to compare the expression levels of Aurora kinases, Ki-67 and hormone receptor in endometriotic tissue (ET) and normal endometrium.We retrospectively analysed 438 samples obtained from 194 patients affected by endometriosis and 28 samples from 28 patients with normal endometrium, which were all collected by the Pathology Department and Gynecologic Clinic of the University Hospital of Udine. A tissue microarray model was constructed to use immunohistochemistry to analyse the expression of Aurora A and B kinases, Ki-67 and the estrogen and progesterone receptors in ET and normal endometrium.Aurora A and B kinases were expressed at a very low level in the majority of endometriosis core biopsies. Aurora A and B kinases, Ki-67 and the estrogen and progesterone receptors were expressed at a higher level in the proliferative endometrium than in the secretory endometrium and in ovarian and non-ovarian ET (P < 0.05). Additionally, Aurora B kinase, Ki-67 and the estrogen and progesterone receptors were more highly expressed in non-ovarian than ovarian ET (P < 0.05).Considering the low expression levels of Aurora A and B kinases in the majority of endometriosis core biopsies, the growth and survival of endometrial tissue outside the uterus cannot be explained by deregulation of this pathway. The analysed ectopic endometrium protein expression pattern resembled that of the secretory endometrium, and markers of proliferation and hormone receptors were expressed at lower levels in ovarian than in non-ovarian ET. The low level of hormone receptors and the consequent low levels of proliferation markers in ovarian ETs may be due to down-regulation by the ovary's hormone milieu.
