Anterior vaginal wall tenderness (AVWT) as a physical symptom in chronic pelvic pain. Chronic pelvic pain is often difficult to diagnose and treat properly. Physicians called on to treat this problem may not be able to give a specific diagnosis. The aim of this study was to see whether the physical presence of anterior vaginal wall tenderness could help narrow down and elucidate diagnoses in a practice focusing on diagnosis and treatment of chronic pelvic pain.The study cohort comprised 284 patients with chronic pelvic pain limited to gynecologic and lower urinary problems. Histories, physical examinations, and endoscopic procedures were performed on each patient. An analysis of this information was conducted.Of the chronic pelvic pain patients, 78% had endometriosis, 81% had interstitial cystitis, and 61% had both concurrently. The sensitivity of anterior vaginal wall tenderness (AVWT) in patients with interstitial cystitis was 95%, and in those with only endometriosis and no interstitial cystitis, the sensitivity was 17%. The positive predictive value for interstitial cystitis was 85%, and for endometriosis it was 67%.Examination of the anterior vaginal wall with an empty bladder at the initial examination can lead one to suspect interstitial cystitis and possibly either concomitant or singular endometriosis and allow the physician to approach the workup accordingly.
