PI3K-Akt-mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways in polycystic ovarian syndrome, uterine leiomyomas and endometriosis: an update. PI3K-Akt-mTOR and MAP kinase are two important cell signaling pathways that are activated by steroid hormones and growth factors leading to cellular events including gene expression, cell proliferation and survival. These pathways are considered as an attractive target for the development of novel anticancer molecules, and selective inhibitors specifically targeting different components of these cascades have been developed. This review summarizes the current available knowledge on the PI3K-Akt-mTOR and MAPK pathways and their targeting in estrogen-dependent benign gynecological disorders viz. polycystic ovarian syndrome, uterine leiomyomas and endometriosis, which are a significant cause of high morbidity in women of reproductive age group. Increasing knowledge about the role of the two growth regulatory pathways in the pathogenesis of these disorders may give the opportunity to use specific signal transduction inhibitors for management of these patients in future.
