Apoptosis and expression of Fas/FasL in tumor infiltrating dendritic cells in human endometrioid adenocarcinoma. To investigate apoptosis of tumor infiltrating dendritic cells (TIDC) and their expression of Fas/FasL (CD95/CD95L) in human endometrioid adenocarcinoma.The apoptotic rate of TIDC was measured in 45 cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma and 20 cases of normal endometrium tissues (control) by double-label immunohistochemistry using the monoclonal antibody S-100 protein and TUNEL technique. The expressions of Fas and FasL in TIDCs were detected using double-label immunohistochemistry and imaging analysis.The apoptotic rate of TIDCs in endometrioid adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than that in normal endormetrium [(13.02∓0.64)% vs (6.82∓0.53)%, P<0.05]. The expression levels of Fas in the TIDCs were significantly lower, whereas FasL expression significantly higher in endometrioid adenocarcinoma than in normal endormetrium (7.88∓1.05 vs 19.25∓3.03, P<0.05 12.95∓2.25 vs 7.51∓1.14, P<0.05).Increased apoptosis of the TIDCs and abnormal expression of Fas/FasL in TIDCs in endometrioid adenocarcinoma may lead to tumor immune escape.
