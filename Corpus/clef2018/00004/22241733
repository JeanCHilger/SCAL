Nuclear features in endometrial cytology: comparison of endometrial glandular and stromal breakdown and endometrioid adenocarcinoma grade 1. This study was to clarify the nuclear features of "condensed clusters of stromal cells (EGBD-stromal cells)" and "metaplastic clumps with irregular protrusions (EGBD-metaplastic cells)" which may be recognized in endometrial glandular and stromal breakdown (EGBD) cases in liquid-based cytologic (LBC) preparations of endometrial brushings. The material consists of cytologic smears of 20 cases of proliferative endometrium (PE), 20 cases of EGBD, and 20 cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma grade 1 (G1) for which histopathological diagnosis was obtained by endometrial curettage. Nuclear findings were examined in PE cells, EGBD-stromal cells, EGBD-metaplastic cells, and G1 cells, respectively. It was examined about the following items: (1) Nuclear shape (2) A long/minor axis ratio in cell nuclei
