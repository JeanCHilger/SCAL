Long-term regression of experimental endometriosis in a rat model treated with local application of levonorgestrel-loaded biodegradable microspheres. A previous study demonstrated that local application of levonorgestrel-loaded polylactic acid microspheres (LNG microspheres) resulted in significant regression of endometriotic cysts in a rabbit model for 6 months without disturbing the metabolic parameters or ovarian function. In order to investigate the feasibility of local application of LNG microspheres as a long-term maintenance treatment for endometriosis, the suppressive effect of a single intra-cystic injection of LNG microspheres was studied for 1 year in a rat model.Twenty four rats with experimental endometriotic cysts were randomized to be treated with a single intra-cystic injection of LNG microspheres (n = 8) 6-month GnRH agonist (GnRHa, n = 8) or control (n = 8). Intra-cystic injection of LNG microspheres and GnRHa treatment caused comparable regression and atrophy in endometriotic cysts in the first 6 months. Compared with the control, the wet weight of the endometriotic cysts was significantly lower in both groups at Month 6 but by Month 12 only remained low in the LNG microspheres group (P < 0.01). The immunostaining of estrogen receptors (ERs) in both the epithelium and stroma and progesterone receptors (PRs) in the stroma was significantly weakened in the LNG microspheres group at Month 6 and was not fully restored at Month 12 (P < 0.01). Metabolic parameters and estrous cycle were not disturbed by local application of LNG microspheres.In a rat endometriosis model, the suppressive effect of a single intra-cystic injection of LNG microspheres was comparable to that of GnRHa, and was maintained for 1 year. The down-regulation of ERs and PRs might serve as possible mechanism of long-term effectiveness.
