Thrombospondin-1 mimetic peptide ABT-898 affects neovascularization and survival of human endometriotic lesions in a mouse model. Endometriosis is a common cause of pelvic pain and infertility in women, and a common indication for hysterectomy, yet the disease remains poorly diagnosed and ineffectively treated. Because endometriotic lesions require new blood supply for survival, inhibiting angiogenesis could provide a novel therapeutic strategy. ABT-898 mimics the antiangiogenic properties of thrombospondin-1, so we hypothesized that ABT-898 will prevent neovascularization of human endometriotic lesions and that ABT-898 treatment will not affect reproductive outcomes in a mouse model. Endometriosis was induced in BALB/c-Rag2(-/-)Il2rg(-/-) mice by surgical implantation of human endometrial fragments in the peritoneal cavity. Mice received daily injections of ABT-898 for 21 days. Flow cytometry was performed to measure circulating endothelial progenitor cells in peripheral blood. Cytokines were measured in plasma samples. Half of the ABT-898-treated and control mice were euthanized to assess neovascularization of endometriotic lesions, using CD31(+) immunofluorescence. The remaining mice were mated and euthanized at gestation day 12. Endometriotic lesions increased circulating endothelial progenitor cells 13 days after engraftment, relative to baseline. Endometriotic lesions from ABT-898-treated mice exhibited reduced neovascularization, compared with controls, and lesions had fewer CD31(+) microvessels. Chronic treatment with ABT-898 did not lead to any fetal anomalies or affect litter size at gestation day 12, compared with controls. Our results suggest that ABT-898 inhibits neovascularization of human endometriotic lesions without affecting mouse fecundity.
