Endometriosis of the pancreas. Endometrial cyst of the pancreas was first described in 1984. The condition is extremely rare, and only a few case reports have been described. Herein we present a case report of a peripancreatic endometriosis cyst in a perimenopausal woman. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and regression of the cyst during an observation period of a few months made the diagnosis most likely before laparoscopic surgery. Awareness of the condition, optimal preoperative imaging, and clinical features are discussed.
