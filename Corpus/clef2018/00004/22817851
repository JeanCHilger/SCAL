CD4(+) CD25(high) Foxp3(+) cells increased in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis. To evaluate CD4(+) CD25(high) Foxp3(+)  cells and IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, and TGF-β in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis.A total of ninety-eight patients were studied: endometriosis (n = 70) and control (n = 28). First, peritoneal fluid lymphocytes were isolated, and CD4(+) CD25(high)  cells were identified using flow cytometry. Then, RT-PCR was performed to verify Foxp3 expression in these cells. Also, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, and TGF-β concentration was determined.Of all the lymphocytes in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis, 36.5% (median) were CD4(+) CD25(high)  compared to only 1.15% (median) in the control group (P < 0.001). Foxp3 expression was similarly elevated in patients with the disease compared to those without (median, 50 versus 5 P < 0.001). IL-6 and TGF-β were higher in endometriosis group (IL-6: 327.5 pg/mL versus 195.5 pg/mLThe peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis had a higher percentage of CD4(+) CD25(high) Foxp3(+)  cells and also higher levels of IL-6 and TGF-β compared to women without the disease. These findings suggest that CD4(+) CD25(high) Foxp3(+)  cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
