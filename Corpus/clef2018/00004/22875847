Slit2 overexpression results in increased microvessel density and lesion size in mice with induced endometriosis. We recently reported that Slit/Roundabout (ROBO) 1 pathway may be a constituent biomarker for recurrence of endometriosis, likely through promoting angiogenesis. In this study, we sought to determine as whether Slit2 overexpression can facilitate angiogenesis, increase lesion size, and induce hyperalgesia in mice with induced endometriosis. We used 30 Slit2 transgenic (S) and 29 wild-type (W) mice and cross-transplanted endometrial fragments from S to W (group SW) and vice versa (group WS), and also within the S and W (groups SS and WW, respectively), into the peritoneal cavity, inducing endometriosis. We also performed a sham surgery within both S and W mice (groups Sm and Wm, respectively). The size of the ectopic implants, microvessel density (MVD) and immunoreactivity to ROBO1, and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) in ectopic and eutopic endometrium, along with hotplate and tail-flick tests in all mice, were then evaluated. We found that the induction of endometriosis resulted in generalized hyperalgesia, which was unaffected by Slit2 overexpression. Slit2 overexpression did increase the lesion size significantly and correlated positively with the MVD in ectopic and eutopic endometrium. Slit2 expression levels appear to correlate with the MVD, but not with VEGF immunoreactivity, in ectopic endometrium. Consequently, we conclude that Slit2 may play an important role in angiogenesis in endometriosis. The increased angiogenesis, as measured by MVD, but not VEGF immunoreactivity, likely resulted in increased lesion size in induced endometriosis. Thus, SLIT2/ROBO1 pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for treating endometriosis.
