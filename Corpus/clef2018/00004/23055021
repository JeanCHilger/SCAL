Selected immuno-histochemical markers in curettage specimens and their correlation with final pathologic findings in endometrial cancer patients. To assess the immuno-histochemical expression of various markers in, endometrial biopsies of patients with endometrial cancer, and to correlate their expression with the final pathologic findings. Sixty-two patients with primary endometrial cancer who underwent surgical treatment were included in this study. Immuno-histochemical expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), p53, bcl-2, Her-2/neu and Ki-67 were assessed in curettage specimens, and review of the final pathology report from hysterectomy specimens was carried out. The expression of these markers in curettage was correlated with the final tumor characteristics obtained on hysterectomy specimens. Both ER and PR were significantly more expressed in endometrioid type (EC) than non- endometrioid type (NEC) (P value of 0.004 and 0.012). On the contrary, P53, Her-2 and Ki-67 showed higher positivity in NEC than EC (P value of 0.005, 0.025 and 0.002). Positive expression of ER and PR was significantly associated with low grade tumors and superficial myometrial invasion, whereas positive expression of Her-2 and Ki-67 was significantly associated with higher grade lesions, and deep myometrial invasion. Moreover, a statistically significant inverse relationship was observed between the positivity of P53, Her-2 and Ki-67 and the positivity of ER, PR. We found that determination of immuno-histochemical markers in curettage specimens might be helpful in predicting the final pathologic findings in patients with endometrial cancer. This might be helpful in planning the extensivity of the surgery.
