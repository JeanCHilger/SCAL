Prognostic value of tgfb1 protein in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Angiogenesis is a prerequisite for tumour development, progression and metastasis however, its underlying molecular mechanisms in endometrial carcinoma are poorly understood.In this study, the mRNA and protein expression profiles of two key regulators of angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1), were evaluated by real-time PCR and western blot analysis in 23 endometrial cancer tissue-paired specimens (malignant vs. adjacent normal tissues). We aimed to investigate whether VEGF and TGFB1 serve as markers of the malignant transformation of the endometrium and whether VEGF or TGFB1 expression can constitute a useful prognostic marker of survival in patients with endometrial carcinoma.Tissue-pair analysis revealed VEGF transcriptional up-regulation and TGFB1 mRNA down-regulation as the most frequent transcriptional features. VEGF and TGFB1 mRNA were positively correlated (P < 0路001). VEGF protein levels were higher in endometrioid-type tissue pairs (P = 0路047). TGFB1 protein and mRNA levels were negatively correlated (P = 0路042). TGFB1 protein expression was related to survival only in patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma (P = 0路045).Tissue-pair mRNA and protein analysis reveals VEGF transcriptional up-regulation and TGFB1 down-regulation that are correlated with the malignant transformation of the endometrium, while post-transcriptional mechanisms control VEGF and TGFB1 protein. TGFB1 protein demonstrated a prognostic value only in endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
