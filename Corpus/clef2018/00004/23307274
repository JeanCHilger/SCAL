Successful treatment of catamenial hemoptysis by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. We report a case of a 23-year-old woman with a 5-year history of recurrent hemoptysis during menstrual period. Catamenial hemoptysis was diagnosed using chest computed tomography and bronchoscopic examination during menstruation. The patient was managed successfully with wedge resection and has been free of recurrence for 5 years. We suggest that surgery is an effective treatment, and complete resection with accurate localization is important for the prevention of recurrence.
