Mesothelial cell: a multifaceted model of aging. Human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) dominate within the peritoneal cavity and thus play a central role in a variety of intraperitoneal processes, including the transport of water and solutes, inflammation, host response, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. In addition, they contribute to the development of abdominal adhesions, peritonitis, endometriosis, cancer cell metastases, and peritoneal dialysis complications. For less than a decade the primary cultures of omental HPMCs have also been used as an experimental tool in studies on cellular aging. This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of the current state of art on molecular mechanisms underlying HPMC senescence in vitro. Special attention is paid to the causes of the very fast dynamics of HPMC senescence, and in particular to the role of non-telomeric DNA damage, the autocrine activity of TGF-Î²1, and the causative effects of oxidative stress. In addition, some clinical manifestations of HPMC senescence will be discussed, including its interplay with organismal aging, peritoneal dialysis, and cancer progression.
