Silencing Cofilin-1 blocks PDGF-induced proliferation in eutopic endometrium of endometriosis patients. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is well known to induce proliferation in variety of cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a correlation between the expression of Cofilin-1 (CFL1) and the proliferation of eutopic endometrium stromal cells (ESC) in response to PDGF stimulation. Results show that PDGF induced the expression of CFL1 in ESC and promoted proliferation of ESC significantly in a time- or dose-dependent manner. After silencing CFL1, the effect of PDGF on promoting ESC proliferation was significantly decreased. These data demonstrate that PDGF can induce CFL1 expression in ESC. Silencing CFL1 blocks PDGF-induced proliferation in ESC.
