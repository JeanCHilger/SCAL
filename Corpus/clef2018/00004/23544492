Clinicopathological features of 151 cases with abdominal wall endometriosis. To investigate clinicopathological features of abdominal wall endometriosis (AWE).A retrospective study was conducted on 151 consecutive AWE patients undergoing treatment in Affiliated Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Fudan University from January 2003 to December 2010. The period of following up was at range of 16 to 97 months.(1) The incidence of AWE was 1.96% (166/8469). All 151 AWE cases followed up had previous cesarean sections. The period between the previous cesarean section (CS) and the onset of symptoms of AWE was 24 months (3 - 192 months). However, the latency was not associated with the age at CS, incision site, gestational week at CS, duration of lactation, postpartum menstruation recovery, the choice of contraceptives and size of AWE (P > 0.05). The duration of disease, defined to be the time interval between the onset of symptoms and surgery, was 26 months (2 - 168 months), which was negatively correlated with the latent period (r = -0.267, P < 0.05) and was positively with size of AWE (patients with large-scar endometrioma with diameter of lesions ≥ 3 cm had longer disease duration than those with small-scar endometriomas < 3 cm, r = 0.326, P < 0.05). (2) The rate of pre-operational ultrasonography detection was 97.4% (147/151). The lesion size detected by pre-operative ultrasonography was significantly smaller than that measured intraoperatively by palpation (20 mm versus 35 mm, P < 0.05). Moreover, only 26.5% (40/151) of AWE patients were found to have deep infiltration by pre-operative ultrasonography. (3) All patients were managed by surgical treatment to completely excise lesions on the abdominal wall. Of all 34 patients (22.5%, 34/151) took medicine pre-operatively while 57 patients (37.7%, 57/151) taking medicine post-operatively. The rate of recurrence was 3.1% (3/96) of cases with lesions ≥ 3 cm, which was significantly lower than 17.8% (8/45) in cases with lesion < 3 cm (P < 0.05). (4) After surgery, the symptoms were found to be relieved in 93.4% (141/151) of patients. The recurrence rate was 7.8% (11/141) while the average recurrent time was (20 ± 16) months.Surgery is the main management on AWE. The risk factors associated with recurrence were size of lesion and postoperative medication.
