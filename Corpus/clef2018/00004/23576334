Proteomic analysis of follicular fluid from women with and without endometriosis: new therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Endometriosis is a gynecological disease that affects women of reproductive age. The protein profiles of women with endometriosis who were able or unable to achieve pregnancy and women without endometriosis who did achieve pregnancy were compared in this study. The follicular fluid was collected from 21 patients undergoing in vitro-fertilization treatment, according to the following groups: nine women in the control group (Group C), four women with endometriosis who achieved pregnancy (Group E.P), and eight women with endometriosis who did not achieve pregnancy (Group E.NP). Follicular fluid proteins were separated using 2D-electrophoresis, and their spots were compared, excised, and submitted to LC-ESI-MS/MS for proteins identification. The analysis showed 29 differentially expressed spots among the groups, and from these, 21 proteins were identified. Analysis showed some functional enrichment in the E.P group, including response to oxidative stress and apoptosis, while the E.NP group showed functions related to response to reactive oxygen species and positive regulation of apoptosis. These data suggest that endometriosis leads to differential protein expression in the follicular fluid, which can influences the outcome of pregnancy. These proteins may be potential targets for better diagnostics and new therapeutic intervention in affected women, as well as assisting in comprehending the physiopathologic mechanisms underlying endometriosis.
