Biochemical evaluation of endometrial biopsies by magnetic resonance spectroscopy--preliminary data. Biochemical study of tissue biopsy samples by magnetic resonance spectroscopy involves relatively small capital and running costs and could become a routine diagnostic or screening procedure if its utility were to be adequately demonstrated. We have demonstrated feasibility of evaluation of endometrial biopsy samples by magnetic resonance previous to histopathologic examination. Preliminary comparisons of magnetic resonance spectra with histopathologic evaluation indicates that in at least some instances, magnetic resonance may be the more sensitive indicator of disease.
