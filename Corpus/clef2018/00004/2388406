MR imaging of adenomyosis. MR imaging characteristics of adenomyosis were studied in nine women (five diffuse type, four focal type) who underwent hysterectomy. In all cases, MR images were correlated with surgical/pathologic findings. On T2-weighted images, diffuse type appeared as a thickening of the junctional zone, because it was often isointense with this zone. Focal type appeared as a low signal intensity, round or oval shaped mass poorly marginated from the adjacent myometrium.
