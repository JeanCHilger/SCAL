Endometrioid adenocarcinoma with simultaneous endocervical and intestinal-type mucinous differentiation: report of a rare phenomenon and the immunohistochemical profile. Intestinal differentiation in the endometrium is rare with only case reports in the international literature. We describe a case of simultaneous endocervical and intestinal-type mucinous differentiation with goblet cells arising in a FIGO grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The patient had no involvement of the myometrium, cervix, or extra-uterine sites. There were no intestinal metaplastic changes of the endocervical canal. The etiology of this change is unknown, although recent reports suggest an association with hyperestrogenism.The virtual slides for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1209512176931698.
