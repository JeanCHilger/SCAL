Pathologic features associated with resolution of complex atypical hyperplasia and grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma after progestin therapy. To determine the response of complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH) and well differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus (WDC) to progestin therapy and whether pre-treatment estrogen and progesterone receptor status predicts outcome.We performed a retrospective review encompassing women treated with progestin therapy for CAH or WDC at two institutions. Clinicopathologic, treatment, and recurrence data were recorded. Pre/post-treatment pathologic evaluation was performed. SAS 9.2 was used for statistical analyses.Forty-six patients were included. The median age was 35, and median BMI was 36.9. Thirty-seven percent were diagnosed with CAH and 63% had WDC. Megestrol acetate was the most commonly used agent (89%) 24% received multiple progestin therapies. Median treatment length was 6 months (range, 1-84)In women with CAH or WDC, the overall response rate to progestin therapy was 65% pre-treatment estrogen/progesterone receptor status did not predict response to treatment.
