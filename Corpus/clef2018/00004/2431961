Lewis and related tumor-associated determinants on ovarian carcinoma. Monoclonal antibodies that defined blood group and related determinants bind to sections of fixed tissues from epithelial ovarian carcinoma in immunoperoxidase assays. Seventy-eight carcinomas and 27 normal tube and ovarian tissues were examined. Lewis (Le)a and Leb determinants were expressed on 58% of the serous carcinomas, on 60% of the endometrioid tumors, and on 78% of the mucinous carcinomas. Sialylated Lea, gastrointestinal cancer-associated antigen (GICA), and lacto-N-fucopentaose (LNF) III, another Le-related determinant, have a similar distribution pattern. Of 10 normal ovaries and fallopian tubes tested from patients without cancer, one reacted with anti-Lea, anti-Leb, or anti-LNF III monoclonal antibodies. Anti-GICA antibodies reacted with tissue from one patient. Le and Le-related antigenic determinants could be useful markers for ovarian cancer.
