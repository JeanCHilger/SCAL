Antiangiogenic agents in natural products for the treatment of gynecologic disorders. Angiogenesis is the formation of new capillaries from existing vessels. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes this growth by stimulating endothelial cells, which form vessel walls and transport nutrients and oxygen to tissues. VEGF has been implicated in several diseases, such as cancer and gynecologic disorders. Antiangiogenic agents prevent VEGF from binding to its receptors on the endothelial cell surface, which inhibits vessel development. Antiangiogenic agents have been found to be effective in treating several gynecologic diseases, such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Natural products with respect to finding new compounds with antiangiogenic effects are interested. In this review, we have focused on the importance of natural products with antiangiogenic activity in treating some malignant and benign angiogenesis-related gynecological disorders, including endometriosis and uterine fibroids.
