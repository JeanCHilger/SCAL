Long-term follow-up and recurrence rate after mesorectum-sparing bowel resection among women with rectovaginal endometriosis. To demonstrate the quality of a combined vaginal-abdominal surgical approach to rectovaginal endometriosis by analyzing long-term outcome and recurrence rates.In a prospective cohort study in Berlin, Germany, women with endometriosis of the rectovaginal septum were enrolled between September 2004 and December 2012. Bowel infiltration was verified intraoperatively and treated by a nerve-sparing, mesentery-preserving vaginal-abdominal operative approach. Operative results were evaluated by assessing short- and long-term complications and recurrence rates.During the study period, 110 women underwent surgery. For 71 (64.5%) patients, bowel infiltration was confirmed intraoperatively. Overall, 15% of the patients had peri- or postoperative complications. No long-term complications occurred. After a median follow-up of 64 months, no recurrence in the rectovaginal septum was observed among the study patients. The recurrence of pelvic endometriosis was 15%.The surgical nerve-sparing approach to rectovaginal endometriosis was confirmed to facilitate precise diagnosis and treatment with minimal morbidity and a long-term complication rate of 0%.
