Atypical polypoid adenomyoma of the uterus. An immunohistochemical study of a case. We studied one case of atypical polypoid adenomyoma of the uerus immunohistochemically using antisera against keratins, vinentin, S-100 protein, desmin and actin. The stromal cells were reactive with anti-actin and antidesmin antibodies suggesting a muscular phenotype and confirming previous ultrastructural data. Immunohistochemical investigations have proved to be useful in differential diagnosis of APA with invasive adenocarcinoma, adenosarcoma and adenofibroma of the endometrium.
