Transforming growth factor-β induced Warburg-like metabolic reprogramming may underpin the development of peritoneal endometriosis. TGF-β is believed to play a major role in the etiology of peritoneal endometriosis. In tumors, TGF-β induces the metabolic conversion of glucose to lactate via glycolysis, a process referred to as the "Warburg effect." Lactate increases cell invasion, angiogenesis, and immune suppression, all crucial steps in the development of endometriosis.The aim of this study was to determine whether TGF-β induces a "Warburg-like" effect in peritoneal endometriosis.The study was informed by human tissue analysis and cel culture.The study was conducted at the university research institute.We studied women undergoing surgical investigation for endometriosis.Concentrations of lactate and TGF-β1 in peritoneal fluid (n = 16) were measured by commercial assay. Expression of genes implicated in glycolysis was measured in endometrial and peritoneal biopsies (n = 31) by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The effect of TGF-β1 on primary human peritoneal mesothelial cells (n = 6) and immortalized mesothelial (MeT-5A) cells (n = 3) was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, and commercial assays.Lactate, TGF-β1, and markers of glycolysis were measured.Concentrations of lactate in peritoneal fluid paralleled those of TGF-β1, being significantly higher in women with endometriosis compared to women without (P < .05). Endometriosis lesions expressed higher levels of glycolysis-associated genes HIF1A, PDK1, and LDHA than eutopic endometrium, and adjacent peritoneum had higher levels of HIF1A and SLC2A1 than peritoneum from women without disease (P < .05 to P < .001). Exposure of mesothelial cells to TGF-β1 increased production of lactate (P < .05), increased HIF1A mRNA (P < .05), and protein, and increased concentrations of mRNAs encoded by glycolysis-associated genes (LDHA, PDK1, SLC2A1 P < .05).A change in the metabolic phenotype of endometriosis lesions and peritoneal mesothelium in women with endometriosis may favor development of endometriosis.
