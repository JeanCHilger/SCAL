Endometriosis. Endometriosis is a benign disorder affecting 10 to 15% of women of reproductive age. It is defined by the presence of endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus. There are three different entities of endometriosis: superficial endometriosis, ovarian endometriotic cyst and deep infiltrating endometriosis. The main clinical features are dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain and dyspareunia. Endometriosis is also responsible for infertility. Transvaginal sonography and magnetic resonance imaging are required to assess mapping of endometriotic lesions. Medical therapies based on progestins or combined oral contraceptives allow to relief symptoms. Despite a relative efficacy of medical treatment or in case of infertility, surgery is necessary preferentially in specialized centers.
