Continuous subcutaneous infusion of GnRH agonist: effective dosage in the treatment of endometriosis and its influence on the ovarian response to human menopausal gonadotropin. This study was designed to compare the clinical and hormonal efficacy of the treatment for endometriosis using continuous infusion of three different doses of GnRH agonist (A). In addition, we examined the ovarian responsiveness to human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) administration during GnRH-A treatment. Thirteen endometriosis patients were divided into 3 groups and given different doses. GnRH-A (Buserelin) was infused continuously through the subcutaneous route at rates of 200 micrograms (Group I n = 5), 100 micrograms (Group II, n = 4) and 10 micrograms (Group III
