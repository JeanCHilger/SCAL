Foxp3 expression in deep rectosigmoid endometriosis lesions and its association with chronic pelvic pain. Endometriosis is a benign gynecological disease that is related to immune response alterations. T regulatory cells modulate immune response, and Foxp3 seems to be the best marker of these cells. This study evaluated Foxp3 mRNA expression in eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis and healthy controls, and its expression in deep rectosigmoid endometriosis lesions, one of the more aggressive types of the disease. Foxp3 expression was higher in lesions than in eutopic endometrium in the two groups. Moreover, eutopic endometrium Foxp3 expression of women with endometriosis was associated with chronic pelvic pain and cyclic urinary pain.
