Influence of AKT on progesterone action in endometrial diseases. Progesterone plays an essential role in the maintenance of the endometrium it prepares the endometrium for pregnancy, promotes decidualization, and inhibits estrogen-dependent proliferation. Progesterone function is often dysregulated in endometrial disease states. In addition, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is often overactive in endometrial pathologies and promotes the survival and proliferation of the diseased cells. Understanding how AKT influences progesterone action is critical in improving hormone-based therapies in endometrial pathologies. Here, we summarize recent studies investigating the crosstalk between the AKT pathway and progesterone receptor function in endometriosis and endometrial cancer.
