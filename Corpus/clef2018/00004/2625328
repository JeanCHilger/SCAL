Estrogen and progesterone receptors in human ovary and ovarian tumors. Ovarian specimens from 159 different patients were analyzed for estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PR) content with the Dextran-coated Charcoal method. The results indicated that the contents of ER and PR in malignant ovarian tumors were not correlated with the menstrual cycle of the patient, clinical stage and differentiation of the tumor. Among malignant ovarian tumors, the mean ER and PR concentrations in sex-cord stromal tumors and endometrioid carcinomas were higher than those in other malignant ovarian tumors (P less than 0.05, P less than 0.025). This suggests the possibility of endocrine therapy for these patients with the hope for a better prognosis.
