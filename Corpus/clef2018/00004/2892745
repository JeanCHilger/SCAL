Recurrent endometriosis following hysterectomy and oophorectomy: the role of residual ovarian fragments. Seven women with recurrent endometriosis after definitive surgery were evaluated. Plasma estradiol, FSH and LH indicated that recurrence was stimulated by residual ovarian fragments in six and pseudopregnancy regimen in one. Surgical treatment in two women was followed in one by hypertrophy of another ovarian fragment and reactivation of endometriosis as demonstrated by serial endocrine and ultrasonographic studies. Three patients responded well to hormonal treatment one required pelvic irradiation. We conclude that: (1) small ovarian fragments may hypertrophy under increased gonadrotropin stimulation, become functional and stimulate recurrence of endometriosis
