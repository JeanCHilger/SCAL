Endometriosis detection by US with laparoscopic correlation. Endometriosis is a common cause of female infertility. It may affect as many as 40% of infertile women and may be the sole contributing factor to infertility in 15%. A study was undertaken to determine the usefulness of the routine pelvic ultrasound (US) examination in the detection of endometriosis by correlating pelvic US findings with laparoscopic findings in 85 patients who underwent both examinations. Forty-eight patients (56.5%) had no laparoscopic evidence of endometriosis, and 37 patients (43.6%) had endometriosis. Eight of the patients had abnormal sonograms of these patients, only four had sonographic abnormalities that corresponded to laparoscopically identified endometriosis. Thus, US was successful in detecting endometriosis in only four (10.8%) of 37 patients. US is neither sensitive nor specific in diagnosing endometriosis. Furthermore, we believe that US does not have a significant role in the diagnosis or management of endometriosis in patients in whom a pelvic mass or other obvious pelvic abnormality is not suspected.
