In vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF/ET): an established and successful therapy for endometriosis. The purpose of this report is to present a 6-year experience in the management of endometriosis with in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF/ET). We divided 136 patients who underwent 280 cycles into three groups: (1) previous history of endometriosis but normal pelvis at the time of oocyte retrieval, (2) stages I-II endometriosis (revised AFS classification), and (3) stages III-IV endometriosis. The stimulation protocols, estradiol (E2) responses, and distribution of terminal E2 patterns were similar in all groups. Group 3 had significantly fewer preovulatory and immature oocytes retrieved and fewer embryos transferred. The fertilization rate and the per cycle/per transfer pregnancy rates were similar in all groups. The miscarriage rate was higher in group 3, and the ongoing pregnancy rate per cycle was lower. Luteal phase E2 and progesterone levels were comparable in all groups. No differences were found when groups 2 and 3 were analyzed for the presence of one or two ovaries or the presence/absence of ovarian endometriosis. The overall fertilization rate, the per cycle/per transfer pregnancy rates, and the miscarriage rate were similar to those of tubal factor patients. We underscore the excellent outcome of patients with minimal or mild endometriosis in IVF/ET. We conclude that patients with moderate or severe endometriosis have a compromised reproductive potential, probably because of a reduced oocyte recovery rate and poor embryo quality.
