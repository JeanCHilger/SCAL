Serum CA125 in malignant ovarian tumor--periodical monitoring and correlation with other tumor markers. CA125 is a new unique tumor marker for epithelial ovarian cancer, and its clinical use has recently increased considerably. We have periodically monitored 14 cases of ovarian cancer (7 cases of serous cystadenocarcinoma, 4 cases of clear cell carcinoma, 1 case of endometrioid carcinoma and 1 case of metastatic ovarian cancer) using CA125, before and after surgery, during chemotherapy, and in follow-up. The serum CA125 was measured with a radioimmunoassay kit. As a result of this monitoring, we have discovered the following facts: The ten cases in which the titer of CA125 dropped to 35U/ml, which is cut off, by 60 days after surgery, when we had finished 2 courses of chemotherapy, showed good progress. In contrast to this, in the other cases, the degree of CA125 was still high 60 days after the surgery and did not drop after that. In these 4 cases, the tumor growth was found. It was therefore concluded that with this method a prognosis could be made much earlier than with the current system, and that relapse could be detected far earlier. We have also examined the mutual relations between CA125 and other tumor markers, IAP, TPA, HBDH, CEA, Ferritin, alpha 1AT, ESR, and LDH. Although we could see some usefulness in periodic monitoring with IAP, unlike CA125 it did not reflect the condition of a disease. The coefficients of correlations between CA125 and other tumor markers are as follows: IAP 0.5268, TPA 0.4541, HBDH 0.4551, CEA 0.2942, Ferritin -0.1005, alpha 1AT 0.5321, ESR -0.0619, LDH 0.5994.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
