Serum levels of CA-125 in patients with endometriosis: a preliminary report. Seven out of 8 patients with endometriosis demonstrated levels of CA-125 antigen above 35 U/ml. None of 15 patients with other benign gynecologic diagnoses demonstrated elevated levels. This antigen has been proposed as a tumor marker for epithelial carcinoma and other gynecologic neoplasms. However, it cannot be used to differentiate clinically between cancer and endometriosis.
