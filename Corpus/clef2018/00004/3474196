Clinical use of CA 125 and its combination assay with other tumor marker in patients with ovarian carcinoma. The serum levels of CA 125 and CA 19-9 were determined by an immunoradiometric assay employing the monoclonal antibody OC 125 and anti-CA 19-9 antibody in 88 patients with ovarian carcinoma. When a cut-off value of CA 125 was set below 35 U/ml in the control group, serum elevated levels of CA 125 were found in 86.7% of the patients with surgically demonstrable ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, in 100% (4/4 cases) of clear-cell carcinoma, in 50% (2/4 cases) of endometrioid carcinoma, in 100% (5/5 cases) of undifferentiated carcinoma, and in 80% of the recurrent cases. Using a cut-off value of 37 U/ml, serum elevated levels of CA 19-9 were detected in 68.2% of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, in 28.9% of serous cystadenocarcinoma, in 75% (3/4 cases) of metastatic ovarian carcinoma, and in 37.5% of the recurrent cases. A statistical analysis of the combination assay using CA 125, CA 19-9, tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA), immunosuppressive acidic protein (IAP), ferritin and CEA was carried out by multivariate method (discriminatory analysis) in 45 patients with ovarian carcinoma and 50 healthy subjects. As a result before treatment, positive rates of a single tumor marker were 79.7% with CA 125, 42.7% with CA-19-9, 73.1% with IAP, 61.7% with TPA, 64.3% with ferritin and 25.4% with CEA, respectively. A combination assay of these markers was useful for detecting identification of ovarian carcinoma, by which it gave a higher accuracy of ovarian cancer detection.
