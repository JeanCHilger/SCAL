Ultrasonography for the diagnosis of adenomyosis. An accurate preoperative diagnosis of uterine adenomyosis is often difficult. We reviewed our experience with ultrasound evaluation of this pathological entity. Patients with histologically proven adenomyosis were studied to determine the usefulness of ultrasound for the preoperative diagnosis of this entity. In patients with adenomyosis, variable ultrasound patterns are seen, namely, enlargement of the uterus, irregular vesicular spaces within the myometrium, and an acoustically enhanced posterior wall of the uterus. However, leiomyoma had a similar echopattern. Based on five cases of histologically extensive adenomyoasis, an accurate diagnosis of adenomyosis proved feasible when ultrasonography showed all three ultrasonic patterns mentioned above, associated with a retroverted uterus or possible adhesions between the uterus and structures in close proximity, nodule or outgrowth in the region of the uterosacral ligaments or in combination, as frequently found in conjunction with external endometriosis. The ultrasonographical demonstration of endometrial cyst of the ovary may contribute to an accurate diagnosis of adenomyosis.
