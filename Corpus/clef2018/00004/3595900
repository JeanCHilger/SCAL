Luteal phase dysfunction in endometriosis: elevated progesterone levels in peripheral and ovarian veins during the follicular phase. Endometriosis has been associated with corpus luteum inadequacy and abnormalities of luteal phase progesterone (P) secretion. In this study, abnormal luteolysis, as a second factor of luteal dysfunction, was assessed in 13 women with endometriosis and 25 control patients by measurement of ovarian vein estradiol (E2) and P during the follicular phase. The results reveal that women with endometriosis have (1) significantly lower ovarian vein E2, (2) significantly higher both peripheral and ovarian vein P, and (3) threefold higher P/E2 ratios than controls during the follicular phase. These data support the concept of continued P production from an active corpus luteum well into the follicular phase of the following cycle in women with endometriosis. Failure of adequate luteolysis is a second aspect of luteal dysfunction in endometriosis and strongly supports the growing body of data confirming ovulatory asynchrony in the minimal endometriosis infertility syndrome.
