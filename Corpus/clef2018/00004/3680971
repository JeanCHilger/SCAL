Intrinsic endometriosis of the ureter. Two cases of ureteral endometriosis are reported and the literature is reviewed with special emphasis on symptoms and therapy. New diagnostic methods such as computer assisted tomography, ultra-sonography and urinary cytology are discussed and evaluated. Intrinsic ureteral endometriosis should be treated with local resection, and reimplantation with the psoas-hitch technique. The need for post-operative hormonal management must be adapted to each case.
