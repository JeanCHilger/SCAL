Estrogen and progestin receptors in human uterus: reference ranges of clinical conditions. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progestin receptor (PR) levels and their respective dissociation constants (Kd) were determined by titration assay and Scatchard analyses in 319 human uteri. Levels of receptors were neither age nor uterine weight dependent. ER was higher in postmenopausal patients while PR levels were lower in women under 25 years of age. ER ranged from undetectable to 560 fmol/mg cytosol protein (mcp) while PR levels were generally 10-fold greater with a mean of 791 fmol/mcp. The mean of the Kd of ER was 4.0 X 10(-10) M while that for the PR was 9.2 X 10(-10) M. Receptor levels were not correlated with their respective Kd values nor with the Kd of the other receptor therefore ligand affinities were not receptor concentration dependent. A population of patients was identified (12.5% of the total) in which the ER levels were undetectable while their corresponding PR ranged from 38 to 2,100 fmol/mcp. This suggests the existence of a type of PR which may not require ER for its expression and is independent of the phase of the cycle. Both ER and PR content were significantly elevated in the proliferative phase of the cycle. Evaluation of results as a function of histopathological features showed no relationship between the ER and PR of patients with anovulatory bleeding versus pathology. Uteri with leiomyomas contained ER and PR at levels comparable to those of histologically normal uteri. Adenomyosis patients tended to have lower ER and higher PR levels than the normal uteri. Reference ranges have been established for these receptors in uteri as a corollary to studies of these proteins in endometrial cancer.
