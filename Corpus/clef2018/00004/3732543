Peritoneal recovery of motile and nonmotile sperm in the presence of endometriosis. It has been postulated that pelvic endometriosis may cause infertility by interfering with sperm motility and transport and even by increased intraperitoneal phagocytosis. The rate of sperm recovery at the time of laparoscopy performed in the immediate preovulatory period was determined in 29 patients (27.4%) with endometriosis (AFS stage I) and in 77 patients (72.6%) without endometriosis. The number of patients with motile sperm in both groups was similar (difference P greater than 0.30). It is concluded that mild endometriosis does not affect sperm transport and survival and that increased sperm phagocytosis in vivo is unlikely.
