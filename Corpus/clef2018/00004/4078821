Role of cul-de-sac aspiration cytology in the management and follow-up of patients with ovarian carcinoma. A preliminary report. In a pilot study involving 44 patients on combined chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian carcinoma, cul-de-sac aspiration cytology was compared with second-look surgery in the evaluation of disease status. There was a 92% correlation. Our preliminary conclusion was that an aspirate from the cul-de-sac or peritoneal cavity can be obtained with ease and that if this finding is confirmed in a larger series now in progress, the procedure may in part replace second-look operations in the management of these patients.
