Preoperative hormonal therapy of cystic adnexal masses. 286 patients between ages 16-48 with cystic adnexal masses were treated with estrogen and progesterone for 6 weeks.  Persistence of the adnexal mass occurred in 81 patients and surgical exploration was done.  All patients explored with an ovarian enlargement had an ovarian neoplasm causing the enlargement.  There were 7 patients with normal sized ovaries but an associated paraovarian cyst or unilateral hydrosalpinx was found.  No patient was subjected to surgical exploration with the finding of a physiologic cyst causing the adnexal mass.  In this series, suppression of the pituitary gonadotropins for 6 weeks was long enough to cause all significant physiologic cysts to regress.  It would seem that menstruating women with a cystic adnexal mass and a differential diagnosis that included a physiologic cyst should not be subjected to operations without a trial of pituitary suppressions.  Also, the use of pituitary suppression with estrogen and progesterone removes indecision as to how long a physiologic cyst will remain before undergoing regression.
