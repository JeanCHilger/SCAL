Mesonephroid tumours of the ovary. Thirty cases of mesonephroid tumour of the ovary were studied. The differential diagnosis is discussed and it is concluded that mesonephroid tumours form a distinct entity. An attempt is made to correlate the histological appearance of the tumours with the clinical course and criteria are suggested which might be a guide to prognosis. Views on histogenesis are discussed but at present there seems insufficient evidence to justify any particular hypothesis.
