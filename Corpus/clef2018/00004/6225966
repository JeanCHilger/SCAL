Laparoscopic examination of the normal infertile woman. It is generally accepted that laparoscopy should be performed if a woman's basic infertility evaluation reveals no abnormalities. Although it has been shown that a significant number of these patients have unsuspected pelvic pathology that can be detected by laparoscopy, there is concern about the real benefit of this procedure, ie, does the laparoscopic examination truly lead to more pregnancies than otherwise expected? Presented is a review of a series of 50 female patients whose basic infertility evaluation had failed to reveal any abnormalities. Laparoscopy revealed significant pelvic pathology in 28 cases of the 16 who had appropriate therapy, eight became pregnant.
