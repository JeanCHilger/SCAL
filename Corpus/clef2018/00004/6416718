Sustained gonadal suppression in fertile women with the LHRH agonist buserelin. Nine fertile women were treated with the luteinizing- hormone-releasing hormone agonist buserelin (seven women received 800 micrograms, two women 1200 micrograms intranasally for up to 24 weeks). Both doses produced sustained suppression of ovarian function, accompanied by hot flushes. In five women chemical castration was established within 1 to 5 weeks, whereas in the other four volunteers transient peaks of serum oestradiol occurred between the 6th and 19th weeks. Thereafter low postmenopausal oestradiol levels persisted. Chemical castration was confirmed by hormonal parameters and endometrial biopsies (inactive endometrium). After cessation of treatment normal cyclical function occurred immediately. This reversible chemical castration may be useful for new therapeutical approaches in sexual hormone dependent diseases (endometriosis, precocious puberty, metastatic breast cancer).9 fertile women were treated with the luteinizing hormone--releasing hormone agonist buserelin (7 women received 800 mcg, 2 received 1200 mcg, instranasally for up to 24 weeks).  Both doses produced sustained suppression of ovarian function, accompanied by hot flushes.  In 5 women, chemical castration was accomplished within 1-5 weeks, whereas in the other 4 volunteers, transient peaks of serum estradiol occured between weeks 6-19.  Thereafter, low postmenopausal estradiol levels persisted.  Chemical castration was confirmed by hormonal parameters and endometrial biopsies (inactive endometrium).  After cessation of treatment, normal cyclical function occurred immediately.  This reversible chemical castration may be useful for new therapeutic approaches in sexual hormone dependent diseases (endometriosis, precocious puberty, metastic breast cancer).
