External genital endometriosis. Endemiologic, diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic aspects. 189 cases were selected, representing 26 admissions per 1 000. From their analysis of the case files, the authors conclude that the development of endometriosis does not need any specific anatomical or hormonal condition and that it is difficult to determine the role of endometriosis and associated lesions in the production of symptoms. The responsibility of endometriosis in sterility has not been always, even in cases with frank lesions. The treatment is aimed at eradicating the lesions which should be followed up with laparoscopy.
