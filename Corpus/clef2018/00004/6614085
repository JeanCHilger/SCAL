Peritoneal fluid prostanoids in unexplained infertility. Elevated peritoneal fluid thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha have been reported in patients with biopsy-proved endometriosis. In this paper these peritoneal fluid prostanoids were measured in patients with unexplained infertility and a fertile control group matched for age and day of the menstrual cycle. A subgroup of the women with unexplained infertility demonstrated a marked elevation of both prostanoids (p less than 0.01). These elevations may serve to identify women in whom undetected endometriosis or some other peritoneal irritant is associated with infertility.
