Actinomycotic infection of endometriosis caused by intrauterine contraception. Based on the course of disease, the clinical and pathohistological findings of two patients reflections are presented about the mode of infection of the upper female genital tract of IUD users with actinomycetes, and conclusions about treatment, too. For avoidance of inflammatory complications of intrauterine contraception it is recommended, to consider evidence of endometriosis, to give up identifying threads in favour of ultrasonic examination and to examine vaginal smears of IUD users with regard to actinomycetes. Laparoscopy is the surest method diagnosing a salpingoophoritis early. Treatment of choice is primarily a conservative therapy with antibiotics and secondly, surgical intervention of persisting findings. The vaginal route is suggested.Based on the course of the disease, the clinical and pathohistological findings of 2 patients are presented.  Also presented are the mode of infection in the upper genital female tract of IUD users with actinomycetes, and the conclusions about treatment.  In order to avoid inflammatory complications from the IUD, it is recommended to use ultrasonic examination and examination of vaginal smears of IUD users with regard to actinomycetes.  Laparoscopy is the surest method of diagnosing salpingoophoritis early.  Treatment of choice is primarily a conservative therapy with antibiotics and secondly, surgical intervention when infection persists.  The vaginal route is suggested.  (author's modified)
