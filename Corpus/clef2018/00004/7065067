Pelvic macrophages in normal and infertile women: the role of patent tubes. The volume of peritoneal fluid and its macrophage content were examined in 80 women undergoing laparoscopy. The amount of pelvic fluid was not dependent on the patency of the fallopian tubes, and no statistical difference in the fluid volume was observed between the infertile groups, including those with endometriosis, as compared to the fertile group. The number of pelvic macrophages in fertile women was extremely high during the menstrual period, and during the rest of the cycle, it remained at a basal level. The number of pelvic macrophages in women with occluded tubes was low. Four of 21 infertile patients with mild endometriosis had very high numbers of pelvic macrophages, even in the luteal phase. These results suggest that the passage of endometrial irritants through the tubes elicits a macrophage response in the peritoneal cavities of both normal women and patients with endometriosis. Although most patients with endometriosis had normal numbers of peritoneal macrophages, it is possible that these macrophages differ qualitatively from normal, and this could explain the associated infertility.
