Splenosis mimicking endometriosis. Splenosis, the autotransplantation of splenic tissue following traumatic rupture of the spleen, can mimic endometriosis when discovered at laparotomy. The splenic implants are usually widespread throughout the peritoneal cavity. The differential diagnosis includes metastatic cancer, hemangiomas, and accessory spleens as well as endometriosis. The authors present a case of splenosis mistaken at laparotomy for endometriosis, and review the literature on splenosis encountered at gynecologic surgery. As splenosis is usually asymptomatic and may partially compensate for the asplenic state, it is recommended that asymptomatic splenosis not be resected when encountered at surgery.
