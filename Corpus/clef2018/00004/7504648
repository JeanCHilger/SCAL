Proliferating cell nuclear antigen in endometrial adenocarcinomas of endometrioid type correlated with histologic grade, stage, previous hormonal treatment, and survival. Only a small number of endometrial carcinomas have been examined for proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The results indicate that a high proliferating cell nuclear antigen content correlates with a poor prognosis. One hundred eight endometrial carcinomas of endometrioid type were examined with the monoclonal antibody PC10 (48 tumors from postmenopausal estrogen users and 60 tumors from nonusers). The PC10 content was weakly but significantly correlated with mitotic count and architectural grade, but not with nuclear grade, stage, or survival. PC10 values in estrogen users were much lower (median, 14%) than in nonusers (median, 26%) the difference was independent of histologic grade and stage. After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 12 to 66 months) 17 patients had died. The cause of death was established as cancer in only nine cases. No overall difference in PC10 values existed between survivors and nonsurvivors. However, if only the estrogen nonusers were examined the survivors showed a mean PC10 value of 27%, while the nonsurvivors showed a mean PC10 value of 45%. The present study indicates that carcinomas from patients with and without previous hormonal treatment are different with regard to their PC10 content. The quantitative and qualitative estimates of PC10 correlated well.
