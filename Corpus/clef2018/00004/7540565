Coexpression of cytokeratin and vimentin in eutopic endometrium and endometriosis throughout the menstrual cycle: evaluation by a computerized method. To evaluate quantitatively cytokeratin and vimentin staining in glandular and stromal cells of eutopic and ectopic endometrium.The investigation of cytokeratin and vimentin was carried out using the new computerized technology of image analysis.University Hospital, Department of Gynecology.Biopsies were taken from patients undergoing a laparoscopy for infertility (29 endometrial biopsies and 31 biopsies of peritoneal endometriosis). None of them were treated.Cyclic variations of cytokeratin and vimentin staining were noted in eutopic endometrium. The cytokeratin and vimentin staining pattern consistently was lower in ectopic endometrium than in eutopic endometrium.Endometriotic epithelial and stromal cells undergo a complex program of differentiation giving them histochemical characteristics similar to those observed in endometrium. Such a concomitant expression of antigenicity indicates their close relationship with their mesodermal m√ºllerian origin.
