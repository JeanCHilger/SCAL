Endometriosis. Analysis of laparoscopic findings at the A.B.C. (American-British Cowdray) Hospital. Endometriosis approximately affects 10 to 15% of premenopausic women. Diagnosis mainly is made by laparoscopy. We revised all the laparoscopies which were made in labor service at the American British Cowdray Hospital from July 1st 1989 to June 30th 1994 in order to evaluate the incidence of endometriosis in the institution. They were made from 882 laparoscopies done, in 447 cases (50.68%) endometriosis was the main finding, this was similar to the reports published by other authors. The group of age mainly affected was from 20 to 29 years-old. Sterility was found in 53% of these patients, slightly above the results in other series. The 85% of the cases were in hospital for less than 24 hours. Complications were in 7% of them, none required a laparotomy, however.
