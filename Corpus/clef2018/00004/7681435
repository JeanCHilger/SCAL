Immunohistochemical localization of acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors in normal human endometrium and endometriosis and the detection of their mRNA by polymerase chain reaction. Growth factors play a role in the cyclical growth and vascularization of normal endometrium. Abnormal endometrial proliferation and neovascularization may result in endometriosis. This study determines the presence and localization of acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF and bFGF respectively) in endometrium of normal women, and in normal and ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. Endometrium was obtained at curettage or hysterectomy for benign disease, or laparoscopy for endometriosis. aFGF- and bFGF-immunoreactivity was detected at different phases of the menstrual cycle by immunohistochemistry using primary polyclonal rabbit antibodies. Expression of mRNA for aFGF and bFGF was determined in normal endometrium by nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). aFGF- and bFGF-immunoreactivity were both detected in endometrium from normal women, and in normal and ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. The pattern of staining with the two different FGFs was the same: immunoreactivity was predominantly confined to glandular epithelial cells and did not change throughout the menstrual cycle. Little or only light staining was seen in stromal cells and myometrium, and the pattern of staining did not differ between endometriotic and normal tissue. The presence of mRNA for aFGF and bFGF was demonstrated in normal endometrium. The detection of aFGF and bFGF mRNA in normal endometrium and aFGF- and bFGF-immunoreactivity in normal and endometriotic tissues suggests that these peptides may play a role in the proliferation and angiogenesis of normal and ectopic human endometrium.
