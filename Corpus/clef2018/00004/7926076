A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of luteal phase dydrogesterone (Duphaston) in women with minimal to mild endometriosis. To compare dydrogesterone with placebos in the treatment of minimal to mild endometriosis.Prospective, double-blind, randomized study.Three Obstetrics and Gynaecology Departments in the United Kingdom.Sixty-two premenopausal women with complaints of pain (n = 12) and infertility with or without pain (n = 50) with minimal to mild endometriosis diagnosed at laparoscopy. Thirty-nine women had a laparoscopy after treatment and 56 women were followed up 12 months after treatment.Two high doses of dydrogesterone (either 40 or 60 mg) or a placebo, which was given for 12 days, beginning 2 days after the LH surge for a treatment period of 6 months.Change between before and after treatment endometriosis scores, pregnancy rates (PRs), and pain.Treatment with dydrogesterone did not alter the natural history of endometriosis or PRs when compared with placebo.
