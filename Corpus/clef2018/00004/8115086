Endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain. Although epidemiology can suggest populations at risk for endometriosis, a single form of therapy with consistent results for all patients is lacking. It is without question that the advancement of conservative therapy for endometriosis-associated pain will depend on the results of well-controlled and randomized studies. Laparoscopic treatment with standardized procedures and instruments should be evaluated in recognition of the requirement of surgery for diagnosis. New approaches may be developed as our understanding of the disease itself expands and its relationship to pain is better defined.
