Adenomyosis and pathological delivery. Apropos of a case. The author uses a case to review the link between adenomyosis and pathological delivery. Such a link has been suspected in the past, and was confirmed in the present case by hysteroscopy after spontaneous abortion. Coagulation-diathermy of adenomyosis via hysteroscopy enabled a subsequent pregnancy culminating in normal delivery.
