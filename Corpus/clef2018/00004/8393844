Adenocarcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix: clinicopathological study of nine cases with detection of human papillomavirus DNA by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. The clinicopathological features of nine patients with adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) of the uterine cervix, one of them with microinvasion, were studied. In situ hybridization (ISH) with biotinylated probes to human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6/11, 16/18, and 31/35/51 was performed in eight tumors. The presence of HPV types 16 and 18 was also investigated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in seven. Four tumors were of the endocervical type, two were endometrioid, and three were mixed (endocervical-intestinal). Coexisting cervical intraepithelial squamous neoplasia (CIN) was found in eight tumors. Only one of the eight tumors studied by ISH was positive for HPV 16/18 in the dysplastic squamous epithelium, but none of them showed positivity in the adenocarcinomatous areas. In contrast, four of seven AIS studied by PCR were positive: three for HPV 16 and one (the microinvasive adenocarcinoma) for HPV 18. The results confirm the frequent association of AIS with CIN and HPV.
