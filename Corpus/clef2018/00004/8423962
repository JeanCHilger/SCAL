Total and regional bone mass values and biochemical markers of bone remodeling in endometriosis. TO measure peripheral, axial, and total bone mass and to assess markers of bone remodeling in women with endometriosis, with the aim of addressing previous reports of diminished peripheral bone mass in these patients.Whole body bone densitometry, estradiol (E2) levels, and biochemical bone markers (calcium, phosphorus, total alkaline phosphatase, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and total proteins) were determined in 28 patients with endometriosis and compared with findings in 33 controls.There were no significant differences between the groups in bone mass at different sites or in biochemical bone markers. We observed a significant negative correlation between tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and E2 levels (P < .001) and with total (P < .001), head (P < .01), and axial (trunk) (P < .001) bone mass. Total alkaline phosphatase did not correlate with any of the indices studied.Bone mass was not lower in any of the areas studied in women with endometriosis. There was a significant negative correlation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase with E2 and with total, head, and trunk bone mass.
