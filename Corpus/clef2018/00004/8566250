Magnetic resonance imaging and serum CA-125 in evaluating patients with endometriomas prior to medical therapy. To determine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and serum levels of CA-125 can be used to evaluate patients with endometriomas before initiating medical treatment.Comparative study before and after medical treatment.Shimane Medical University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.Eleven consecutive patients with at least one endometrioma > 10 mm in maximal diameter that was diagnosed by laparoscopy and treated with 900 micrograms/d buserelin acetate for 6 months.Magnetic resonance imaging and blood sampling was performed < 2 weeks before laparoscopy.Signal intensity of edometrioma/signal intensity of gluteus maximum muscle on T2-weighted image (T2SI:MSI) volume of endometrioma and serum CA-125.There was a positive linear correlation (r = 0.787) between T2SI:MSI before treatment and the extent of decrease in the volume of endometrioma. There was a negative linear relationship between serum CA-125 before treatment and the mean extent of decrease in the cyst volume (r = 0.678). The reduction in volume of endometrioma and T2SI:MSI before treatment related to the outcome of patients.The T2SI:MSI on MRI and serum CA-125 may be useful for estimating the outcome of patients with endometriomas before initiating medical treatment.
