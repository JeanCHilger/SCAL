Preliminary experience with a new tumor marker in obstetrics and gynecology: UGP (Urinary Gonadotropin Protein). To evaluate the use of UGP (urinary gonadotropin protein) as a tumor marker in gynaecologic and obstetric malignant diseases.The study was carried out in the division of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of the Ospedali Riuniti in Bergamo. 63 patients, with obstetric or gynaecologic benign or malignant diseases, entered the study. 66 healthy volunteers were examined as a group-control. In both the groups UGP levels were determined in morning urine, using an immunoenzymatic commercial kit.Results, expressed in fmol UGP/ml of urin, show that UGP is produced by several neoplasms, but the false-positive percentage is still high a higher precision can be obtained with an accurate choice of the cut-off value and with a standardization of the analytical technics. Besides, the contemporary determination of UGP and CA 125 levels reduces the possibility of false-positive and false-negative results.More studies must be carried out to confirm the value of UGP as a tumor marker in obstetrics and gynaecology. Anyway, this recently purified protein can already be useful, in combination with the usual tumor markers, in the prompt diagnosis and management of primary neoplasms or recurrences, with a higher sensibility in comparison with traditional clinical and radiological examinations.
