Elevated concentration and biologic activity of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis. To estimate the concentration and the biologic activity of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in the peritoneal fluid (PF) of women with and without endometriosis.A case control study was conducted.Gynecology clinic and Laboratories of endocrinology of reproduction and immunology.Women presenting for infertility, pelvic pain, or tubal ligation in which endometriosis was diagnosed at laparoscopy (n = 36) and normal fertile controls presenting for tubal ligation (n = 21).Collection of PF via laparoscopy.Determination of PF concentrations of MCP-1 by an ELISA and evaluation of its monocyte chemotactic activity using a human hystiocytic cell line (U937). RESULTS. The concentration of MCP-1 (median, range of values) was increased in the PF of endometriosis patients (283, 0 to 1,930 pg/mL conversion factor to SI unit, 0.155) compared with the control group (140, 0 to 435 pg/mL). The most significant elevation of MCP-1 levels was found in the stage II of the disease (371, 200 to 1,930 pg/mL). An increased chemotactic activity for monocytes (mean number of migrating cells/mm2 +/- SD) also was found in stages I (1,460 +/- 312) and II (1,541 +/- 336) of the disease when compared with fertile controls (393 +/- 56). Forty percent to 53% of this activity was inhibited in the presence of an antibody specific to MCP-1.These observations are consistent with previous data indicating increased leukocyte chemotaxis in the PF of patients with endometriosis and suggest that MCP-1 may play a relevant role in the peritoneal inflammatory reaction associated with the disease.
