Bowel endometriosis. Eight cases of colorectal resection. Colo-rectal endometriosis requiring colon resection are reported in 8 patients to illustrated the diagnostic and therapeutic problems encountered in the management of this uncommon localisation. Pericatamenial or catamenial bowel symptoms associated with pelvic genital involvement were encountered in all cases. Clinical examination, barium enema and colonoscopy are essential to guide surgical management looking for multiple localisations. However their diagnostic value is low as endometriosis rarely involves the mucosa. Endosonography appears to be very promising in evaluating the depth of infiltration of the bowel. The treatment of bowel endometriosis is controversial and varies greatly according to the patient's complaints and clinical data. The indications and limits of all treatment modalities including abstention, medical, and surgical treatment are discussed. From the cases reported we conclude that symptomatic bowel endometriosis should be fully excised whenever possible, and the surgical procedure should be adapted to the depth of infiltration. A full thickness excision or bowel resection is mandatory in patients with deep muscularis involvement. These procedures, which are often difficult due to extensive fibrosis and adhesions, may be achieved by laparoscopy in selected patients.
