Changing trends in the diagnosis of endometriosis: a comparative study of women with pelvic endometriosis presenting with chronic pelvic pain or infertility. To compare demographic, epidemiologic, and medical data and to evaluate diagnostic trends in women with endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain symptoms or endometriosis and infertility.Retrospective analysis.Institute for the Study and Treatment of Endometriosis.Six hundred ninety-three consecutive patients with endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain (n = 357) or endometriosis and infertility (n = 336).None.Demographic and epidemiologic parameters, diagnostic trends.Women with pelvic symptoms were younger, had less formal education, more frequent family history, and higher frequency and intensity of pelvic complaints. Mean ages at first symptom and diagnosis were lower in the pain group, but stage of endometriosis at first diagnosis was more advanced. The mean "diagnostic delay" was longer in the pelvic pain than in the infertile group (6.35 versus 3.13 years), but it decreased during three consecutive 5-year intervals in both groups, and there was also a gradual decrease in the frequency of advanced endometriosis at the time of first diagnosis.Demographic and epidemiologic parameters in women with endometriosis differ, depending whether chronic pelvic pain or infertility are the presenting symptoms. In the pain group, diagnostic delay is longer and endometriosis at diagnostic laparoscopy more advanced, indicating progressiveness of the disease. During the last 15 years, diagnostic delay steadily decreased and the frequency of advanced endometriosis at first diagnosis declined.
