Ovarian tumefactions: the advantages and limits of echo-guided needle aspiration. Our experience. One-hundred-seventy-five patients with a probably benign ovarian cyst were submitted to transvaginal ultrasound-guided needle aspiration (TVUSGA) for diagnostic and therapeutic purpose. Recovery was obtained in 68% of serous cysts (130 patients). In 34 endometriotic cysts transvaginal ultrasound guided needle aspiration has been an important diagnostic tool and it made possible a better therapeutic approach. The cytologic examination of aspirated benign and malignant cyst fluid didn't give a satisfactory result every time. In conclusion, the transvaginal ultrasound guided needle aspiration has been a good tool in the treatment of serous cysts and a diagnostic aid for endometriotic pathology.
