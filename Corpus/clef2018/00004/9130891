Chemotaxis of macrophages by a peritoneal fluid protein in women with endometriosis. To expand on a preliminary study comparing the chemotactic potential of peritoneal fluid (PF) from women with and without endometriosis and to characterize this activity via immunosuppressants and a protease.Case control study.University center.Fifty-nine women with endometriosis and 44 without, undergoing laparoscopy.Collection of PF, endometriotic, ovarian, and endometrial biopsies at laparoscopy.Chemotactic activity of PF was tested via an in vitro assay alone and in the presence of immunosuppressants cyclosporin A (CSA), FK506, rapamycin, and type XVII-b(S-V8) protease and in media incubated with endometriotic, ovarian, or endometrial biopsy specimens.The PF from women with endometriosis had significantly greater chemotactic activity (cells per well, mean +/- SD) than without endometriosis (142 +/- 39 versus 48 +/- 17). Cyclosporin A significantly inhibited the chemotactic activity of the endometriotic PF FK506 and rapamycin did not. Incubation of media with endometriotic tissue, but not ovarian or endometrial, for > or = 7 hours displayed chemotactic activity. Protease type XVII-b(S-V8) added to endometriotic PF inhibited this chemotactic activity.Peritoneal fluid from patients with endometriosis contains a protein chemotactic factor attracting inflammatory cells into the peritoneal cavity, possibly secreted by endometriotic implants. This chemotactic factor may be a member of the immunophilin family because of its inhibition profile.
