Infertility and endometriosis. The goal of this study was to set the relation between infertility and endometriosis. It included 500 infertile female patients who underwent laparoscopy in order to find out the cause of infertility. The prevalence of endometriosis in these patients was 26%, that is significantly higher than in the control group which consisted of 200 randomly chosen fertile women in whom prevalence of endometriosis was 5%. Patients with endometriosis mainly belong to the group of 25-29 years of age with a median duration of infertility of 2-4 years. Endometriosis occurs three times more often in the group of patients with primary sterility than in patients with secondary sterility. Majority of patients (71.5%) are with minimal or mild endometriosis.
