Polycystic ovaries in association with pelvic endometriosis in infertile women diagnosed by laparoscopy. The author studied the combination of the polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis in 274 infertile women by laparoscopy. 106 patients were diagnosed on clinical criteria as having the polycystic ovary disease which was confirmed in 93 of them (87.74%) at the time of the procedure. Coexisting endometrial focuses were found in 11 patients (11.83%). The results show that laparoscopy should be the modality of choice in the diagnostic work-up in women with infertility and clinical symptoms of the polycystic ovary syndrome. Extensive scrutiny for endometriosis should be performed in all of these cases since the combination of the two conditions is not infrequent.
