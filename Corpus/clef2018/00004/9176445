Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 concentration in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis and its modulation of expression in mesothelial cells. To investigate monocyte chemotactic protein-1 concentrations in the peritoneal fluid (PF) of women with or without endometriosis, then assess peritoneal mesothelial cells as a potential source of monocyte chemotactic protein-1.Prospective study.University medical center.Women with (n = 60) or without (n = 18) endometriosis.First monocyte chemotactic protein-1 levels in PF were measured, then mesothelial cells in culture were treated with cytokines.In PF and culture supernatants, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 was measured by ELISA. In vitro monocyte chemotactic protein-1 messenger RNA expression was evaluated by Northern analysis.The median concentration of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in PF of control women was 137 pg/mL (conversion factor to SI unit, 0.115 range, 12 to 418 pg/mL)Levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in PF were higher during the proliferative phase than secretory phase of control women and increased in moderate to severe endometriosis. The regulated expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 may recruit macrophages into PF and contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
