A case-case analysis of factors related to overexpression of p53 in endometrial cancer following breast cancer. We studied 54 patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer between 1981 and 1994 following a diagnosis of breast cancer. We used a case-case analysis, comparing tumors with and without overexpression of the p53 gene product to evaluate the association of putative p53 mutations with tamoxifen use and other risk factors for endometrial cancer. Twenty-four % of the tumors showed strong positive staining for the p53 gene product. Tumors in a more advanced stage (stage 2, 3, or 4, compared to stage 1) were more likely to overexpress p53 [odds ratio (OR) = 4.2 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-16.2], as were tumors with serous or clear cell, compared to endometrioid, histology (OR = 5.8
