Importance of reactive oxygen species in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis or idiopathic infertility. To determine whether reactive oxygen species in peritoneal fluid might be a factor in infertility.Prospective study.Andrology laboratory and gynecology clinic at a tertiary care facility.Women with endometriosis (n = 15) or idiopathic infertility (n = 11) who underwent laparoscopy for infertility. Patients undergoing tubal ligation served as controls (n = 13).Aspiration of peritoneal fluid.Reactive oxygen species levels, presence of polymorphonuclear granulocytes, and leukocyte distribution in peritoneal fluid.Reactive oxygen species were present in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis, idiopathic infertility, and tubal ligation. Levels of reactive oxygen species did not show a statistically significant difference between patients with endometriosis and the control group in either unprocessed or processed (cell-free) peritoneal fluid, but did differ significantly between patients with idiopathic infertility and controls in processed peritoneal fluid. Polymorphonuclear granulocytes (> 1 x 10(6)/mL) were not present in the peritoneal fluid of any patient. Macrophage concentrations of peritoneal fluid did not differ significantly between controls and patients with endometriosis or idiopathic infertility.Reactive oxygen species in the peritoneal fluid may not affect fertility directly in women with endometriosis however, they may have a role in patients with idiopathic infertility.
