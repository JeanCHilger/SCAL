Vesical endometriosis after cesarean section: diagnostico-therapeutic aspects. Endometriosis is a benign condition with an aggressive behaviour defined by the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue, outside the uterus. It occurs in 15-20% women with child bearing potential. Most commonly it affects organs such as the ovaries, uterine ligaments, fallopian tubes, rectum and the cervico-vaginal region. Involvement of the urinary tract, however, is rare. It can be seen in just about 1% cases, vesical location being the most frequent of these presentations (84% cases). We describe one case of vesical endometriosis that developed after a cesarean section. The intra-operative findings confirmed the existence of infiltration of the detrusor muscle and the vesical mucosa by endometrial tissue from the area of the uterine incision. A discussion of the different diagnostic and therapeutic options is also included.
