Effects of antibodies to transferrin and alpha 2-HS glycoprotein on in vitro sperm motion: implications in infertility associated with endometriosis. Women with endometriosis have antibodies to endometrial transferrin and alpha 2-HS glycoprotein in their serum and peritoneal fluid. The objective of this study was to determine whether antibodies to transferrin and alpha 2-HS glycoprotein adversely affect sperm motility and survival.Spermatozoa obtained from normal fertile donors and washed free of seminal plasma were incubated with the medium (control), 1:2 and 1:100 dilutions of antitransferrin, 1:4, 1:8 and 1:100 dilutions of anti-alpha 2-HS glycoprotein, and a 1:2 dilution of antialbumin antiserum (negative control). Sperm motion characteristics in 10 microliters aliquots were evaluated at 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, and 24 hr using computerized sperm motion analysis. A paired t-test was done to analyze the effects of the various antibodies on sperm motion characteristics.Antibodies to albumin failed to adversely affect sperm motility in general or the several sperm motion characteristics in particular. In contrast, antibodies to transferrin at the dilution of 1:2 adversely affected the percentage of motile and rapid spermatozoa, progressive and path velocities, straightness, linearity, track speed, and anterior-lateral head displacement (P < 0.001) at all the time intervals, whereas a 1:100 dilution of this antiserum adversely affected these parameters only at 24 hr. Elongation and beat cross-frequency were significantly affected at 4 and 24 hr by a 1:2 dilution of antitransferrin antiserum. The effects of anti-alpha 2-HS glycoprotein were more pronounced than those of antitransferrin, but they were similar. Dilutions of 1:4 and 1:8 were effective at all time intervals, whereas a 1:100 dilution was effective in reducing the track speed and the percentage of rapid cells at 24 hr (P < 0.001).Antibodies to endometrial transferrin and alpha 2-HS glycoprotein present in the peritoneal fluid, and possibly in the oviductal fluid, of patients with endometriosis may adversely affect postcoital sperm motility and sperm survival.
