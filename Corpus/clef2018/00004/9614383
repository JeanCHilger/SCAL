CD44 expression in normal, hyperplastic, and malignant endometrium. A total of 140 endometrial carcinomas (endometrioid type), as well as 72 hyperplasias (41 of simple or complex and 31 of atypical type) and 141 normal endometria (35 in the proliferative and 106 in the secretory phase), were immunohistochemically investigated for expression of the standard and variant-3 and -6 isoforms of CD44, and the results compared with several known prognostic factors. A combination of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Southern blot hybridization (SBH) for CD44 mRNA levels was also carried out on 27 endometrial carcinomas. In normal endometrium, the expression of standard and variant CD44 forms was remarkably higher in the secretory than in the proliferative phase, with immunoreactivity scores being inversely correlated with numbers of oestrogen and progesterone receptors. Significantly elevated levels of CD44 expression in endometrial carcinomas compared with the proliferative phase and hyperplasia were also revealed by both the immunohistochemical and the RT-PCR/SBH assays, while no association was noted with any prognostic factors. The results indicate that CD44 expression in the normal menstrual cycle is closely related to the secretory differentiation of the glandular epithelium. Moreover, detection of aberrant expression may be useful for the early diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma, but not as an indicator of tumour progression.
