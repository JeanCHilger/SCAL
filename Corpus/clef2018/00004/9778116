Oxyphilic cell variant of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. A case of oxyphilic cell variant of endometrioid adenocarcinoma is presented. To the best of our knowledge, there have been only three such cases reported in the English literature. The patient was a 35-year-old Japanese female (gravida 0, para 0). She was slightly obese with profuse vaginal bleeding. Histological examination of the resected uterus revealed endometrioid adenocarcinoma with an exclusive oxyphilic cell component. There was no evidence of myometrial invasion nor lymph node metastases. Reported cases of oxyphilic cell variant of endometrioid adenocarcinoma, including the present case, were stages 0-1 and grades 1-2. Although further study is necessary to evaluate this variant, oxyphilic cell variant seems to be an early stage of adenocarcinoma and should be differentiated from eosinophilic metaplasia and other types of adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.
