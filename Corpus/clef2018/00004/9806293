Healthy women and patients with endometriosis show high concentrations of inhibin A, inhibin B, and activin A in peritoneal fluid throughout the menstrual cycle. Inhibin A, inhibin B, and activin A are growth factors which play local autocrine/paracrine roles in reproductive tissues. Since peritoneal fluid hormone content may reflect in part ovarian and endometrial secretory activities, the present study aimed to evaluate: (i) whether inhibin alpha-, activin betaA- and betaB-subunits, and activin receptor type II and type IIB mRNA are expressed in peritoneal tissues (ii) expression and secretion of inhibin A and B, and activin A in cultured endometriotic cells
