Intestinal obstruction secondary to endometriosis of the colon. Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. Although in most cases it is a benign disorder, it may be aggressive producing local invasion and even metastasis. Endometrial implantation has been reported in many organs including the small and large intestine leading to acute or chronic symptomatology. The clinical picture of intestinal obstruction is due to stenosis produced by the adherences or fibrosis caused by endometrial sloughing. We present a case of intestinal endometriosis with clinical manifestation of obstruction of the colon. This disorder should be included in the differential diagnosis of fertile females presenting intestinal obstruction with no other predisposing factors.
