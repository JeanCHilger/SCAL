Direct sequencing of the p53 gene shows absence of mutations in endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinomas expressing p53 protein. To investigate the mutational status of the p53 gene (Tp53) in endometrial carcinomas expressing p53 protein by direct gene sequencing.Eighteen cases of endometrial carcinoma, selected on the basis of p53 protein expression as detected immunohistochemically by the monoclonal antibody DO7, were microdissected in the p53 positive areas. DNA was extracted and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for exons 5-8 which code for conserved areas containing mutational hot-spots. The PCR amplified material was then sequenced using an ABI automated sequencer and analysed using BLAST software at the NCBI web site. All sequences analysed were wild-type.The results confirm that expression of p53 protein may occur in endometrial adenocarcinoma without mutation and may be due to stabilization of the protein during its normal function, possibly by an mdm2 mediated process.
