Effect of peritoneal fluid from endometriosis patients on sperm motion characteristics and acrosome reaction. To determine whether peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis contributes to infertility by impairing sperm motion and functional characteristics.Women with endometriosis (n = 20) underwent laparoscopy for infertility or pelvic pain. Patients undergoing tubal ligation served as controls (n = 14). Peritoneal fluid was aspirated from women with endometriosis, or from women undergoing laparoscopic tubal ligation. Sperm motility, motion characteristics and acrosome reaction were assessed following incubation with peritoneal fluid.Sperm motility, motion characteristics, and acrosome reaction did not differ significantly between the two groups after 3, 5, or 24 hours of incubation with peritoneal fluid.Sperm motion or functional characteristics showed no significant impairment when sperm from normal donors were incubated with peritoneal fluid from patients with endometriosis. It is unlikely that peritoneal fluid in these patients contributes to infertility.
