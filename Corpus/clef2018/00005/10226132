Excision of endometriosis with laparosonic coagulating shears. Excision of endometriotic lesions allows the diagnosis to be confirmed and may provide long-term relief of symptoms. Laparoscopic excision is generally accepted for treatment of all stages of disease and can be accomplished safely with laser, electrosurgery, or ultrasonic energy. Ultrasonic energy uses the 5-mm hook blade for excision and 5-mm harmonic scalpel ball electrode for coagulation. Disease was excised by laparosonic coagulating shears (LCS) in 14 women. All patients had an uneventful postoperative course, with 13 (93%) remaining pain free 7 to 18 months postoperatively. The LCS is easy to use and allows endometriosis to be excised with an adequate margin of safety. (J Am Assoc Gynecol Laparosc 6(2):195-199, 1999)
