Laparoscopic management of bladder endometriosis. To assess the methods, indications and results of operative laparoscopy for patients presenting with bladder endometriosis.Descriptive retrospective study. All the patients presenting with bladder endometriosis infiltrating the bladder muscularis between January 1, 1993 and June 30, 1998 were included in this series.It was possible to treat bladder endometriosis in all the patients by performing a laparoscopic partial cystectomy. With an average follow-up of 31.6 months (range 6-61) the results are satisfactory. Neither per- nor postoperative complications were observed. The patients experienced an improvement in their condition, with complete disappearance of the urinary symptoms in every case. No recurrence of the functional urological symptoms occurred.Provided the surgeons are skilled and the lesions require no ureteral reimplantation, operative laparoscopy is a valid alternative to laparotomy for partial cystectomy.
