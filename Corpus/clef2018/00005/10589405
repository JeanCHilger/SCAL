Evaluating chronic pelvic pain. A consensus recommendation. Pelvic Pain Expert Working Group. To identify a comprehensive approach to evaluating women with chronic pelvic pain based on findings in the literature.A working group of gynecologist pelvic pain specialists was convened to consider principles on which consensus could be reached and to identify areas in which consensus is not yet possible.Chronic pelvic pain affects 15% of American women. The diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the complaint may be influenced inordinately by the specialty of the practitioner to whom the woman presents. A comprehensive approach to the complaint requires recognition of the multiple organ systems that may be involved. Evaluation of the woman with chronic pelvic pain begins with a comprehensive history and physical examination, followed by selected laboratory and imaging studies. For those women in whom the evaluation does not yield a likely cause of the complaint, the empiric use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, oral contraceptives, and perhaps antibiotics or antispasmodics is indicated. Women who fail to respond to empiric therapy should be considered highly likely to have endometriosis or adenomyosis. Further diagnostic (laparoscopy) or therapeutic (gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist) interventions should be directed toward the high likelihood of endometriosis or adenomyosis.A comprehensive approach to chronic pelvic pain includes consideration of multiple organ systems, with empiric therapy appropriate after a thorough history and physical examination, to further delineate the pain problem.
