Significance of some tumor markers in differential diagnosis of ovarian tumor. The levels of CA-125, CA 72-4 and CEA were evaluated in serum of patients with various histological types and clinical stages of ovarian carcinoma and of benign ovarian tumor. An increased CA-125 was found in 8% patients with benign ovarian tumor. The antigens CA 72-4 and CEA exhibit values below the cut-off limit. CA-125 value was significantly elevated in patients with serous and CA 72-4 with ovarian mucinous carcinoma. An increase of CA-125 was found in 81% of patients with serous, 60% with endometrioid and 30% with ovarian mucinous carcinoma. An increase of CA 72-4 was found in 76% of patients with mucinous, 54% with serous and 45% with ovarian endometrioid carcinoma. Insignificant rise of CEA value was found in 8% of patients with serous, 10% with endometrioid and 15% with ovarian mucinous carcinoma. The frequency of increased concentration of antigens level showed a trend to significant increase and a correlation with the clinical stage of disease. The observations allow to conclude that the determination of CA 72-4 in the serum may be useful in differentiation diagnostics of benign and malignant ovarian tumors. The combined determination of CA-125 and CA 72-4 is useful in differentiation of histological types of ovarian tumors and their clinical stage.
