Ileal endometriosis. A clinical case and a review of the literature. Ileal localization of intestinal endometriosis is not extremely rare, but there are always problems related to the preoperative diagnosis. Symptoms of intestinal endometriosis offer often problems to the surgeon in the differential diagnosis with many more pregnant illnesses like appendicitis, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel diseases and abdominal neoplasms. The authors report a case of endometriosis of the ileum clinically mimicking Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease of the ileum is the most frequently reported illness that is considered in the differential diagnosis. The review of the literature shows that a correct preoperative diagnosis of endometriosis of the ileum is very seldom done. All common diagnostic tools are not able to resolve diagnostic doubts. Also during explorative surgery the diagnosis of endometriosis is not easy. The authors conclude that endometriosis of the ileum has to be more often considered as possible cause of common intestinal symptoms mimicking inflammatory bowel disease and that this illness induces to reevaluate the importance for a correct diagnosis of an accurate clinical history.
