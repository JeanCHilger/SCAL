Vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor expression are implicated in the angiogenesis of endometrial cancer. Although many angiogenic factors have been described, it is not well defined which factors are expressed in endometrial cancer. The object of this study was to examine mRNA levels of the two angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) in endometrial cancer tissues and their association with clinicopathological features including microvessel density. The level of VEGF and PD-ECGF mRNAs was assessed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using beta-actin as an internal standard in 38 patients with endometrial cancer. Microvessel counts were also assessed by immunostaining for factor VIII-related antigen in the most vascularised area of the specimen. VEGF/beta-actin ratios of non-endometrioid tumours were significantly higher than those of endometrioid tumours (P = 0.013). VEGF/beta-actin ratios of cases with lymph-vascular space involvement were significantly higher than those of cases without lymph-vascular space involvement (P = 0.021). Although it was not statistically significant, PD-ECGF/beta-actin ratios in grade 3 tumours were higher than those in grade 1 and 2 tumours (P = 0.066). The microvessel density was significantly correlated with the level of VEGF and PD-ECGF mRNA expression (P = 0.041 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Our findings provide evidence that the expression of both VEGF and PD-ECGF is involved in the promotion of angiogenesis in endometrial cancer. In addition, VEGF and PD-ECGF might contribute to the aggressive potential of high grade tumours or certain histological subtypes with unfavourable prognosis through the induction of angiogenesis.
