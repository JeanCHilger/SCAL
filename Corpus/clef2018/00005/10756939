p53 and steroid receptors support double endometrial carcinogenesis. This study investigated the p53 positivity correlated with the receptor status, in different grades and stages of endometrial carcinoma.The study included 88 endometrioid-type carcinomas and 5 non-endometrioid-type carcinomas. Paraffin sections were used for the ordinary histological diagnosis and for immunohistochemical diagnosis by avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique.p53 positivity was identified in 10 endometrioid-type carcinomas (11.4%) and 3 non-endometrioid type carcinomas (60%). Most of the p53 positive cases were receptor negative and observed in advanced stages and histological grades. No associated endometrial hyperplasia was p53 positive, while a positive intraepithelial non-endometrioid carcinoma was identified.p53 positivity is most frequently identified in non-endometrioid type, receptor negative adenocarcinomas, even in a precursor lesion as it is intraepithelial carcinoma, while in endometrioid, receptor positive carcinomas it appear in late stages of development, never being identified in precursor lesions.
