Leukotrienes in gynaecology: the hypothetical value of anti-leukotriene therapy in dysmenorrhoea and endometriosis. The lipoxygenase products (leukotrienes) have been demonstrated in many mammalian tissues including humans. They are widely distributed in the lungs, gut, uterus, kidneys, skin, heart and the liver. Their roles as mediators of inflammation have made them therapeutic targets. Significant amounts of leukotrienes have been demonstrated in the endometrium of women with primary dysmenorrhoea who do not respond to treatment with anti-prostaglandins. Also, in endometriosis, cytokines, which can initiate the cascade for the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, have been shown to be elevated. It is estimated that 10-30% of patients with painful periods fail to respond to prostaglandin (PG) synthetase inhibitors. Of adult females approximately 40% have painful menstruation and 10% of these are incapacitated for 1-3 days per month, and approximately 10% of women aged between 15-45 years suffer from endometriosis, which is a significant cause of infertility. Leukotriene receptor antagonists have recently been licensed for the treatment of asthma in the UK. In this review, we present the case for the potential use of these products in the management of primary dysmenorrhoea (especially in patients who are not responding to the traditional treatment using PG synthetase inhibitors) and possibly also in cases of endometriosis.
