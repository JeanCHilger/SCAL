Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), and IGFBP-3 protease activity in the peritoneal fluid of patients with and without endometriosis. To compare levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) components in the peritoneal fluid of patients with and without endometriosis.Patients with endometriosis were compared with control patients.Seoul National University Hospital, Korea.Forty-three patients with endometriosis and 20 patients without endometriosis.Peritoneal fluid specimens were collected.Insulin-like growth factors, IGF binding protein (IGFBP) profiles and IGFBP-3 protease activity.The IGF-I levels in peritoneal fluid were significantly higher in patients with endometriosis than in control patients, while the IGFBP-3 levels and the relative proportion of IGFBP-2 in peritoneal fluid were significantly lower in patients with endometriosis than in control patients. However, IGF-II levels, IGFBP-4 profiles, and IGFBP-3 protease activity did not differ significantly between the two groups. No correlation between these IGF components in peritoneal fluid and the stage of endometriosis was noted.The profiles of IGF components in peritoneal fluid of patients with pelvic endometriosis may play an important role in the growth of ectopic endometrium and endometriosis-induced infertility.
