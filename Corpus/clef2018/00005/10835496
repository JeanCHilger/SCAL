Changes in expression of estrogen receptors alpha and beta in relation to progesterone receptor and pS2 status in normal and malignant endometrium. To clarify changes in estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and ERbeta during endometrial tumorigenesis, 48 endometrial carcinomas (endometrioid type), as well as 40 samples of normal endometrial tissue, were investigated using a combination of reverse-transcription and polymerase chain reaction with Southern blot hybridization and western blot assays, and the results were compared with findings for progesterone receptor (PR) and pS2 mRNA status. In addition, 166 carcinomas were also examined for immunohistochemistry, along with 171 normal specimens. Relative amounts of ERalpha at both mRNA and protein levels were significantly greater than those for ERbeta in normal and malignant endometrial lesions. ERalpha mRNA showed a stepwise decrease from normal or grade (G) 1 through to G3 tumor lesions, in line with changes in the protein levels, in contrast to ERbeta mRNA or protein expression, which did not alter, suggesting a shift in the ratio of the two ER subtypes during endometrial tumorigenesis. PR mRNA expression was significantly correlated with ERalpha, but not ERbeta mRNA status. Although significantly higher expression of pS2 mRNA or protein was observed in carcinomas than in the normal cases, there was no apparent association with the ER status. The findings suggest that alteration in estrogen signaling pathways may occur during endometrial tumorigenesis, and provide evidence that ERalpha expression may play an important role in the regulation of PR, but not pS2 expression in normal and malignant endometrium.
