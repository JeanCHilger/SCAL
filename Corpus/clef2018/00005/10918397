Genetic aberrations detected by comparative genomic hybridization predict outcome in patients with endometrioid carcinoma. Endometrial cancer progression is determined by a complex pattern of multiple genetic aberrations, but how these aberrations affect prognosis is unknown. In this study, we undertook a genome-wide screening to detect genetic changes by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) in 51 tumors from patients with primary endometrioid carcinoma of the uterine corpus. The observed genetic changes were subsequently correlated with the progression of the disease and the clinical outcome in each case. The average number of genetic aberrations (copy number gains and losses) was significantly greater in non-surviving patients than in disease-free patients (12. 6 vs. 2.7, P < 0.0001). According to multivariate analysis, lymph node metastasis (P = 0.015), cervical involvement (P = 0.007) and one or more copy number losses at 9q32-q34, 11q23, or Xq12-q24 (P = 0.023) were significantly predictive of death from the disease. Interestingly, lymph node metastasis was significantly associated with copy number gains at 8q22-q23 and 8q24-qter (P = 0.003 and P = 0.025, respectively). Moreover, cervical involvement was also correlated significantly not only with gains of 8q22-q23 and 8q24-qter but also with loss of 11q23 (P = 0.04, 0.0003, and P = 0. 009, respectively). These results suggest that analysis of genetic changes may help predict clinical outcome and the presence of metastatic disease as well as assist in therapeutic decision making for patients with endometrioid carcinoma.
