The correlation between intrauterine filling defects during hysterosalpingography and endometriosis at laparoscopy. The association of intrauterine filling defects on hysterosalpingogram with endometriosis was evaluated. One hundred twenty patients were prospectively investigated with both methods, hysterosalpingography (HSG) and laparoscopy (LSC), for period of two years. HSG was performed on days 7-10 with water-soluble contrast medium. The presence of endometriosis was proved laparoscopically and scored according to the American Fertility Society classification. Forty-one women had endometriosis at LSC. In 25 of all 30 women with filling defects on hysterosalpingogram endometriosis was found. The presence of intrauterine filling defects on HSG is significantly associated with the presence of pelvic or peritoneal endometriosis.
