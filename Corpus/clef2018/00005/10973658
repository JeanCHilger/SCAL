Expression of the alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1 integrins at the surface of mesothelial cells: a potential attachment site of endometrial cells. To localize alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1 integrins in the cell membrane of peritoneal mesothelium in vivo and in vitro.Descriptive study using confocal and two-photon laser-scanning microscopy.University-based laboratory.Women without endometriosis undergoing surgery for benign conditions.None.Peritoneal biopsies (n = 9) and mesothelial monolayer cultures (n = 4) were incubated with antibodies to the alpha2 and alpha3 subunits and to the intact alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1 integrins. Specimens were examined with laser-scanning microscopy.The alpha2 and alpha3 subunits and the intact alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1 integrins were identified at the base of the mesothelial cells (i.e., toward the basement membrane). There was also expression of the alpha2 and alpha3 subunits and the intact alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1 integrins at the cell surface (i.e., toward the peritoneal cavity).The resolution of the confocal and two-photon laser-scanning microscope enabled localization of integrins in mesothelial cells. The presence of alpha2beta1 (collagen-laminin receptor) and alpha3beta1 integrins (collagen-laminin-fibronectin receptor) at the base of mesothelial cells suggests a role for these molecules in adhesion to the basement membrane. The presence of these molecules at the cell surface suggests a potential locus for cell adhesion in such processes as endometriosis and cancer metastasis.
