Endometrial brush biopsy (Tao brush). Histologic diagnosis of 200 cases with complementary cytology: an accurate sampling technique for the detection of endometrial abnormalities. We examined 200 cases of endometrial brush biopsy (EBB) using the Tao brush and correlated findings with histologic findings from subsequent dilatation and curettage (D&C) or hysterectomy specimens.

EBB correctly detected the following cases: endometrioid adenocarcinoma, 3 complex hyperplasia with atypia, 1
