Endometrial stromal sarcoma of the vagina. Endometrial stromal sarcoma is a rare tumor and has unique histopathologic features. Most tumors of this kind occur in the uterus thus, the vagina is an extremely rare site. A 34-year-old woman presented with endometrial stromal sarcoma arising in the vagina. No correlative endometriosis was found. Because of the uncommon location, this tumor was differentiated from other more common neoplasms of the vagina, particularly embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and other smooth muscle tumors. Although the pathogenesis of endometrial stromal tumors remains controversial, the most common theory of its origin is heterotopic MÃ¼llerian tissue such as endometriosis tissue. Primitive cells of the pelvis and retroperitoneum are an alternative possible origin for the tumor if endometriosis is not present. According to the literature, the tumor has a fairly good prognosis compared with other vaginal sarcomas. Surgery combined with adjuvant radiotherapy appears to be an adequate treatment.
