The role of angiogenesis in the accumulation of peritoneal fluid in benign conditions and the development of malignant ascites in the female. Our objective was to present current data pertaining to the role of angiogenesis in the accumulation of peritoneal fluid in both benign conditions and in the development of malignant ascites in the female. To this goal, we conducted a computerized search to identify all relevant studies published in the English literature. MEDLINE, Current Contents and Index Medicus were searched utilizing the terms: angiogenesis, peritoneal fluid, ascites, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), therapy and carcinoma through May 2000. Review of the literature supports that angiogenesis promoted by VEGF is associated with fluid accumulation in animal and human tumor effusions. Benign conditions involving accumulation of peritoneal fluid and associated angiogenesis in the female include ovulation, endometriosis and severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Malignant intra-abdominal conditions associated with increased VEGF activity include primary epithelial ovarian, gastric and colon carcinomas, omental and hepatic metastatic disease. Initial trials with antiangiogenic (angioinhibitor) therapy such as anti-VEGF antibodies, anti-VEGF receptor antibodies, tumor necrosis factor, and metalloproteinase inhibitors have been reported and antitumor activity observed in a limited number of patients with advanced (inoperable or metastatic) disease.
