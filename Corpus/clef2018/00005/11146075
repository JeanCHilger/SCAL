Efficacy of ethanol sclerotherapy for ovarian endometriomas. To evaluate the efficacy and limitations of ethanol sclerotherapy for ovarian endometriomas.Retrospective investigation was made on 83 women with ovarian endometriomas who underwent transvaginal aspiration and ethanol sclerotherapy at Hiroshima City Hospital between 1993 and 1998. Furthermore, 30 who underwent laparoscopic cystectomy for ovarian endometriomas during the same period were investigated.Of the 74 women who were followed for more than 6 months, 11 (14.9%) had recurrent cysts. The recurrence rate of laparoscopic cystectomy was 3.8% (NS). The recurrence rate of cases instilled for less than 10 min was 62.5% (5/8), and that for 10 or more than 10 min was 9.1% (6/66) (P<0.001). The recurrence rate of cases having one cyst was 7.5% (4/53) and that of cases having two or more cysts was 33.3% (7/21) (P<0.05).Ethanol sclerotherapy is an effective and safe procedure and can be indicated for almost all ovarian endometriomas. Conduct of ethanol instillation for more than 10 min particularly for a case with a single endometrial cyst is considered most effective from the standpoint of recurrence.
