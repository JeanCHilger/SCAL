Tumor necrosis factor-alpha but not interleukin-1 beta or interleukin-8 concentrations correlate with angiogenic activity of peritoneal fluid from patients with minimal to mild endometriosis. To assess the angiogenic activity of peritoneal fluid in women with minimal to mild endometriosis and to investigate the relationship between this activity and the concentration of macrophage-derived angiogenic factors and clinical variables, such as phase of menstrual cycle, type of lesion, and revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine classification.In vivo bioassay.Tertiary-care university medical center.Fifty-two female volunteers with laparoscopic findings indicating minimal to mild endometriosis.Peritoneal fluid was collected at the start of laparoscopy. A standard amount of peritoneal fluid was applied to a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay.Angiogenic response was assessed by determining the vascular density index.85% of the peritoneal fluid samples induced angiogenesis in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane bioassay. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and total protein were significantly related to the vascular density index, whereas interleukin-1beta, interleukin-8, and clinical variables appeared to not affect the angiogenic response.The results confirms previous findings of peritoneal fluid angiogenic activity in women with minimal to mild endometriosis and indicate involvement of tumor necrosis factor-alpha.
