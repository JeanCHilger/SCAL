Use of knockout transgenic mice in the study of endometriosis: insights from mice lacking beta(2)-microglobulin and interleukin-12p40. To test the possibility of using transgenic knockout mice in the study of endometriosis and to investigate specific immunologic aspects of the disease.Experimental blinded study.Academic research center.Thirty-two mice with experimentally induced endometriosis.Endometriosis was induced in 8 beta(2)-microglobulin-deficient BALB/c mice and 7 wild-type BALB/c controls. Similarly, endometriosis was induced in 8 interleukin-12-deficient C57BL/6 mice and in 9 wild-type C57BL/6 controls.Weight and surface area of endometriotic lesions.Total weight and surface area of endometriotic lesions was markedly lower in beta(2)-microglobulin-deficient BALB/c mice than in wild-type BALB/c controls. A slight but statistically insignificant increase in total weight and surface area of lesions was observed in interleukin-12-deficient C57BL/6 mice compared to wild-type C57BL/6 controls.Knockout transgenic mice can be used successfully for the study of endometriosis however, in these animals, the redundancy of the immunologic cytokine-mediated regulatory mechanisms may lead to compensation from the remaining genome. Results from beta(2)-microglobulin-deficient mice support the critical role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of the disease.
