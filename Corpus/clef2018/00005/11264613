Peritoneal fluid concentrations of interleukin-4 in relation to the presence of endometriosis, its stage and the phase of the menstrual cycle. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a cytokine with both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the inflammatory system such as macrophage inhibition and T-cell activation. It is known to regulate several monocyte functions, including inhibition of the synthesis of cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha as well as potentiating IL-8.In an attempt to clarify the association between IL-4 and endometriosis, we measured the concentration of IL-4 in the peritoneal fluid of 52 women 24 with endometriosis and 28 with no endometriosis, controlling for the phase of the cycle and the stage of disease.There was no difference in the concentrations of IL-4 between women with (n=28) and without endometriosis (n=24). No difference was found between the IL-4 concentrations in women with different stages of endometriosis. Levels of IL-4 did not show a difference according to the phase of the cycle in either group.Our results indicate no association between peritoneal fluid levels of IL-4 and endometriosis and hence suggest that IL-4 is not involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
