Polymorphisms for interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta)-511 promoter, IL-1 beta exon 5, and IL-1 receptor antagonist: nonassociation with endometriosis. We aimed to investigate if interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) gene polymorphism could be used as markers of susceptibility in endometriosis.Women were divided into two groups: 1) endometriosis (n = 120) 2) nonendometriosis groups (n = 103). Polymorphisms for IL-1 beta-511 promoter, IL-1 beta exon 5, and IL-1Ra were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Genotypes and allelic frequencies for these polymorphisms in both groups were compared.Proportions of different IL-1 and IL-1Ra polymorphisms in both groups were nonsignificantly different. Proportions of C homozygote/heterozygote/T homozygote for IL-1 beta-511 promoter in both groups were 1) 21.6/59.1/19.1% and 2) 26.2/50.5/23.3%. Proportions of E1 homozygote/heterozygote/E2 homozygote for IL-1 beta exon 5 in both groups were 1) 91.6/5/3.3% and 2) 95.15/4.85/0%. Allele I/II/IV/V for IL-1Ra in both groups were 1) 92.5/5.4/1.6/0.4% and 2) 95.1/3.9/1/0%.Association of endometriosis with IL-1 beta-511 promoter, IL-1 beta exon 5, and IL-1 receptor antagonist gene polymorphisms doesn't exist. These polymorphisms are not useful markers for prediction of endometriosis susceptibility.
