Abnormal interleukin-1 receptor type II gene expression in the endometrium of women with endometriosis. Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a major proinflammatory cytokine that is believed to play a central role in the pathophysiology of endometriosis. The IL-1 receptor type II (IL-1RII) is known to bind to IL-1 and to inhibit its biological effects. In our previous studies, we showed that human endometrium expresses IL-1RII, and we observed reduced expression of the protein in women with endometriosis. The aim of this study was to investigate IL-1RII mRNA in the endometrial tissue of normal women (n = 26) and of patients with various degrees of endometriosis (n = 53). In situ hybridization showed that IL-1RII mRNA expression was significantly decreased in endometriosis, particularly during the early stages of the disease (stages I and II). This was quite obvious in both glandular and stromal cells, and it was corroborated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of IL-1RII mRNA in the endometrial tissue of women with (n = 10) and without (n = 8) endometriosis. The reduced levels of IL-1RII mRNA in the endometrium of women suffering from endometriosis reveals a profound defect in IL-1RII gene expression and, consequently, a reduced capability of endometrial tissue to down-regulate IL-1 activity. Defective IL-1RII gene expression during the early stages of endometriosis (stages I and II) may contribute to the etiology of the disease.
