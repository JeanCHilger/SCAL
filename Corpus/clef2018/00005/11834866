Role of laparoscopy in the treatment of endometriosis-associated infertility. Endometriosis is assumed to be one of the causative factors of infertility, although the mechanism remains to be elucidated. Mechanical factors distorting the pelvic anatomy and/or changes in the biochemical and cellular environment in the peritoneal cavity are possible contributing factors impairing fertility. Laparoscopy is a widely used diagnostic and therapeutic means of treating endometriosis-associated infertility. However, pregnancy outcome after laparoscopy varies depending on preexisting tubal adhesions and endometriosis. Without tubal adhesions, the pregnancy rate is essentially the same irrespective of the presence or stages of endoemetriosis. Minimal/mild endometriosis benefited the most from laparoscopic manipulation when tubal adhesions were present. On the other hand, IVF-ET outcome of patients who previously underwent laparoscopy was not influenced by preexisiting tubal adhesions and endometriosis.
