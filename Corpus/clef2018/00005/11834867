Influence of pelvic endometriosis and ovarian endometrioma on fertility. We investigated the influence of pelvic endometriosis and ovarian endometrioma on pregnancy outcome in women associated with infertility. A total of 237 women with endometriosis were reviewed, and their fertility rate was assessed by both r-AFS staging and TOP classification as previously proposed by our group. There was no significant difference in pregnancy rate among r-AFS stages. However, the pregnancy rate was mostly affected by the tubal condition according to the TOP classification as follows: no adhesive lesion (T0), 53% (69/129) unilateral lesion (T1), 46% (18/39)
