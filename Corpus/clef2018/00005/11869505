Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of primary carcinoma of female peritoneum. Histogenesis and morphological features of 6 primary carcinomas of female peritoneum were studied.H&E staining, histochemical stainings and immunohistochemical stainings were used.Among 6 primary carcinomas there were 4 cases of serous papillary carcinomas, 1 case of endometrioid carcinoma and 1 case of transitional cell carcinoma.Primary carcinomas of the female peritoneum were histologically identical to that of the similar epithelial carcinomas arising from the ovaries. The diagnosis was made only when the ovaries are not involved and without no any evidence of similar epithelial carcinoma obtained in the ovaries, uterus or urinary organs. These tumors are considered arising from the secondary Mullerian system. D-PAS and CEA staining are helpful as the accessory criteria for the differential diagnosis between primary carcinoma of the peritoneum and malignant mesothelioma.
