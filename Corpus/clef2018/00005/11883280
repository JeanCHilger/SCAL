Serum and peritoneal fluid CA-125 concentration in women with endometriosis. To evaluate the clinical utility of CA-125 measurements in peritoneal fluid (PF) as an indicator of endometriosis.CA-125 levels in paired serum and peritoneal fluid were assessed by IMx CA-125 Assay (ABBOTT).107 women with and without endometriosis, undergoing laparoscopy during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle were selected for the study.CA-125 levels in peritoneal fluid were higher than those found in serum and were significantly elevated (P < 0.05) in comparison to the control group. In women with endometriosis stage I-II and stage III-IV. CA-125 levels in serum were increased only in stage III-IV.The sensitivity of the peritoneal fluid CA-125 test for endometriosis is higher than the respective serum test. The measurement of CA-125 levels in PF could be useful in the detection of the early stage endometriosis, which seems to be missed by the CA-125 serum test.
