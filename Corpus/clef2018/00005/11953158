Serum levels of soluble intercellular molecule 1 (sICAM-1) in endometriosis. To investigate the serum levels of ICAM-1 and its relationship to the extent of the disease.Serum sICAM-1 levels of 21 women with endometriosis were measured with a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and 21 women without endometriosis were selected as control. Serum sICAM-1 levels were compared between endometriotic and non-endometriotic women, and among patients at different stages of endometriosis.Significantly higher serum sICAM-1 levels were observed in women with endometriosis [(0.30 +/- 0.07) microgram/ml] than in those without endometriosis [(0.18 +/- 0.05) microgram/ml] (P < 0.01) in women with stage I approximately II of endometriosis, the serum sICAM-1 levels were (0.24 +/- 0.06) microgram/ml, while in those with stage III approximately IV of endometriosis, the serum sICAM-1 level was (0.32 +/- 0.06) microgram/ml, the difference is of statistically significant.No differences of serum sICAM-1 level was found between proliferative and secretary phase in women with and without endometriosis.Significantly elevated serum sICAM-1 levels in women with endometriosis, especially in those with advanced stages of the disease suggests the molecule might be of value in pathogenesis of endometriosis.
