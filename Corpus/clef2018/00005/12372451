Cycle-specific and cumulative fecundity in patients with endometriosis who are undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation-intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer. To compare controlled ovarian hyperstimulation-intrauterine insemination (COH-IUI) or IVF-ET pregnancy rates per cycle (PR) and cycle and cumulative fecundity (f and cf) with COH-IUI or IVF-ET in endometriosis.Retrospective analysis.Endometriosis research institute.Women with endometriosis and infertility (n = 313) who underwent consecutive COH-IUI (202 patients, 648 cycles), IVF-ET (111 patients, 139 cycles), or IVF-ET after failed COH-IUI (56 patients, 68 cycles).None.Crude PR and life table-estimated f and cf.With COH-IUI, 69 patients conceived 65 conceived with IVF-ETIn endometriosis, PR, f, and cf are significantly higher with IVF-ET than COH-IUI, especially in stage IV and in women >38 years of age. Considering adverse effects of prolonged ovarian stimulation on endometriosis, IVF-ET should be the first-line approach in the management of infertility in this disease. If COH-IUI is attempted, it should not exceed three to four cycles.
