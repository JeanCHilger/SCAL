Peritoneal defects and the development of endometriosis in relation to the timing of endoscopic surgery during the menstrual cycle. In vitro studies demonstrated that implantation on membranes (peritoneum, amniotic membranes) can take place if there are defects on the surface of the membranes. If these mechanisms play a role for the development of endometriosis in vivo, then patients with surgical treatment of peritoneal endometriosis in the luteal phase must have a high recurrence rate.Retrospective analysis of operation charts and follow-up data.Department of gynecology, in a hospital-based endometriosis treatment center.Two hundred twenty premenopausal women.Laparoscopic treatment for peritoneal endometriosis, stage I and II by revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines.During the follow-up period of 2 years, symptoms and gynecological and sonographic findings were documented. In case of suspected recurrence a repeat laparoscopy with biopsy was performed to prove the recurrent endometriosis macroscopically and histologically.The total recurrence rate after 2 years was 9.6%. The recurrence rate of group III (15%) was twice as high as those of group I (7%) and group II (8%), as indicated by subjective complaints, clinical findings, macroscopy, and histology no differences were found between groups I and II.Endoscopic surgery for the treatment of peritoneal endometriosis should not be performed in the luteal phase.
