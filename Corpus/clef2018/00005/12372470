Influence of severe endometriosis on gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-6 in granulosa cells from patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer. To evaluate how endometriosis affects expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in granulosa cells.Prospective study.IVF-ET program at Osaka Medical College.Seventeen patients with revised American Fertility Society stage IV endometriosis and 17 patients with tubal infertility and no endometriosis.Granulosa cells obtained at oocyte retrieval were examined for VEGF and IL-6 gene expression.Serum E(2) and P levels at hCG administration, number of oocytes, fertilization rate, high-quality embryo rate, and pregnancy rate, and expression of VEGF and IL-6 genes.Total hMG and FSH levels were statistically significantly higher in patients with endometriosis however, the number of retrieved oocytes and the fertilization rate were lower compared with patients with tubal infertility. Serum E(2) levels and expression of VEGF in patients with tubal infertility were statistically significantly higher than those in patients with endometriosis. Interleukin-6 gene expression did not differ between the groups.In severe endometriosis, lower VEGF gene expression in granulosa cells may adversely affect oocyte development and maturation.
