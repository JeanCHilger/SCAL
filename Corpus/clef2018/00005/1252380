Dydrogesterone and endometriosis. The results are reported of the administration of dydrogesterone, 5 mg twice daily, to 49 patients with endometriosis. All but five patients were symptom-free after nine months of therapy. Most subjective symptoms had disappeared within four to eight weeks dyspareunia usually took longer. In 30 out of 32 patients who had a culdoscopy after one or two treatment courses, a 'cure' of endometriosis was confirmed. Ten out of nineteen infertile patients became pregnant following treatment. The only side-effects were transient mastalgia and dizziness in two patients. No amenorrhoea or other disturbances of the menstrual cycle were reported.
