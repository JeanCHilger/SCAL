Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IGF binding protein-1 and -3 in the follicular fluid of infertile patients with endometriosis. Endometriosis is associated with pituitary-ovarian axis dysfunction. The study of the follicular fluid in patients with endometriosis is important to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanism of this disease. The objective of this present paper was to analyse the dosages of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGF binding protein-1 and 3 (IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3) in the follicular fluid environment of infertile patients with endometriosis.A total of 41 infertile patients undergoing IVF between January 1999 and January 2000 participated in the cross-sectional prospective study. Patients were divided into three groups: group I, minimal/mild endometriosis (n = 12) group II, moderate/severe endometriosis (n = 10)Follicular fluid IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels were not significantly different among the groups however, follicular fluid IGFBP-1 levels were lower in those patients with moderate/severe endometriosis (P < 0.05). Comparison of ovulation induction time, number of recombinant FSH units, number of follicles, oocytes and embryos, and fertilization and gestation/cycle rates showed non-significant differences.Infertile patients with moderate/severe endometriosis, which is associated with ovulatory dysfunction, presented lower levels of IGFBP-1 in the follicular fluid when undergoing IVF.
