Sonovaginography is a new technique for assessing rectovaginal endometriosis. To evaluate the efficacy of a new technique, the sonovaginography, for the assessment of rectovaginal endometriosis.Prospective study.University hospital.Forty-six women were scheduled for laparotomic or laparoscopic surgery because of rectovaginal endometriosis suspected on the basis of patient history and/or clinical examination.Before surgery, all the women underwent transvaginal ultrasonography and then sonovaginography. The latter is based on transvaginal ultrasonography combined with the introduction of saline solution to the vagina that creates an acoustic window between the transvaginal probe and the surrounding structures of the vagina. Ultrasound findings were compared with the results of surgical exploration and histological examination.We assessed the accuracy of transvaginal ultrasonography and of sonovaginography for the detection and the location and extension assessment of rectovaginal endometriotic lesions, as well as compared patient compliance between the procedures.Sonovaginography diagnosed rectovaginal endometriosis more accurately than did transvaginal ultrasonography, with a sensitivity and specificity of 90.6% and 85.7%, respectively, whereas the transvaginal ultrasonography has shown a sensitivity and specificity of 43.7% and 50%, respectively. Patient discomfort did not differ significantly between the procedures.Sonovaginography is a reliable and simple method for the assessment of rectovaginal endometriosis and provides information on location, extension, and infiltration of the lesions, which are important factors in selecting the kind of surgery.
