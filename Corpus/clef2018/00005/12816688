Benign ovarian tumor with ascites and high serum levels of CA125: report of 3 cases. To describe the clinical characteristics of benign ovarian tumor/mass which manifest as pelvic mass, ascites and high serum levels of CA(125).Clinical data of 3 cases of such disease in Peking Union Medical College Hospital were analyzed and relevant literatures were reviewed.The patients all were misdiagnosed as ovarian carcinoma, and operations designed for malignant ovarian tumor were performed on all of them. There was no definite proof of malignant tumor, such as positive findings of pathology and/or cytology, in any patients before operation. Among these diseases, pelvic tuberculosis, ovarian endometrioid cyst and ovarian fibroma are the three most common ones, others are: fibrothecoma, thecoma, struma ovarii, adenofibroma, benign Brenner tumor, mature theratoma, ovarian edema and fibromatosis.Pelvic mass, ascites and high serum level of CA(125) can't always result of a diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma. Positive findings of pathology and/or cytology is the only definite proof of a diagnosis of ovarian malignant tumor. On the susceptible case, laparoscopy is a useful and reliable method.
