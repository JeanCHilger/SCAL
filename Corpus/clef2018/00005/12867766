The Keeper, a menstrual collection device, as a potential cause of endometriosis and adenomyosis. Barrier contraceptive devices like the cervical cap and diaphragm and menstrual collecting devices may block menstrual flow, increase retrograde menstruation, and thus theoretically increase the likelihood of developing endometriosis or adenomyosis. We describe the case of a woman with a prior tubal ligation who after four years of regular use of the Keeper, a menstrual collecting device, developed endometriosis and adenomyosis.
