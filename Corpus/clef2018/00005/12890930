Peritoneal fluid concentrations of ciliary neurotrophic factor, a gp130 cytokine, in women with endometriosis. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a gp130 neuroregulatory cytokine belonging to the interleukin-6-type cytokine superfamily. Several lines of evidence suggest that the concentrations of interleukin-6 are elevated in the peritoneal fluid of endometriosis patients. To our knowledge, no study on whether this might also be the case for CNTF levels has been published previously. The CNTF concentrations in the peritoneal fluid were measured by ELISA in 51 women with (n = 31) and without (n = 20) endometriosis. Surgery was scheduled during the proliferative or the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. CNTF was detectable in the peritoneal fluid of 43% of the women tested. The concentrations of CNTF showed no correlation with the presence of endometriosis or the phase of the menstrual cycle. We found no evidence to suggest that CNTF is involved in the pathogenesis of pelvic endometriosis.
