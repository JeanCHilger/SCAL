Expression of glucose transporter-1 in endometrial hyperplasia and well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma. To investigate the expression of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) in endometrial hyperplasia and well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinomas.Sixty formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of various endometrial hyperplasia and well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinomas were immunostained with rabbit anti-GLUT1 antibody using streptavidin-biotin method.Two of 12 simple hyperplasia and one of seven complex hyperplasia without atypia were focally positive in metaplastic epithelia. All complex atypical hyperplasia showed positive in varied degree, and 26 among 28 cases of adenocarcinoma were stained positively.Overexpression of GLUT1 is a consistent feature of atypical hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma. GLUT1 immunostaining is found to be helpful in distinguishing hyperplasia with atypia from those without atypia.
