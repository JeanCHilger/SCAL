Inhibition of aromatase: insights from recent studies. Aromatase is the rate limiting enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Blockade of this step allows treatment of diseases that are dependent upon estrogen. Over the past two decades, highly potent and specific aromatase inhibitors have been developed which block total body aromatization by over 99%. An important recent question is whether aromatase inhibitors are superior to the antiestrogens for treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer. The third generation aromatase inhibitors have been compared to tamoxifen for the treatment of breast cancer in the advanced, adjuvant, and neoadjuvant settings. All of these studies suggest the superiority of aromatase inhibitors over tamoxifen. The mechanism responsible for the superiority of the aromatase inhibitors relates to the estrogen agonistic effects of tamoxifen. During exposure to estrogen deprived conditions and to tamoxifen, breast cancer cells adapt and upregulate the MAP kinase and PI-3 kinase pathways. These growth factor signaling pathways potentiate the estrogen agonistic properties of tamoxifen. Data from a large adjuvant therapy trial (ATAC trial) provide evidence that the aromatase inhibitors may also be superior for breast cancer prevention. The mechanism for superiority in this setting probably relates to the genotoxic effects of estradiol metabolites. The aromatase inhibitors may be also useful for the treatment of endometriosis and for ovulation induction as evidenced by preliminary data. The recent advances in development of the aromatase inhibitors clearly demonstrate the utility of these agents for treatment of breast cancer and potentially for other indications.
