Immunohistochemical localization of c-erbB-2 protein and epidermal growth factor receptor in normal surface epithelium, surface inclusion cysts, and common epithelial tumours of the ovary. The c-erbB-2 (HER-2/neu) protein is a membrane glycoprotein growth factor receptor showing molecular homology with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We examined the immunohistochemical reactivity of monoclonal antibodies against both of these proteins in normal surface epithelium, surface inclusion cysts, and common epithelial tumours of the ovary. The ovarian tumours were classified as benign (16), borderline malignant (2), and malignant (19). Normal surface ovarian epithelium was weakly positive for both c-erbB-2 protein and EGFR. In surface inclusion cysts, however, the epithelial cells lining the lumen exhibited stronger staining for c-erbB-2 protein, but no staining for EGFR. All 16 benign ovarian tumours and the 2 borderline malignant ovarian tumours were positive for c-erbB-2 protein and negative for EGFR. Of the ovarian carcinomas, 13 of the 19 (68.4%) were positive for c-erbB-2 protein and negative for EGFR, while 4 showed positivity for both c-erbB-2 protein and EGFR. Two cases were negative for both proteins. Expression of both c-erbB-2 protein and EGFR was found in endometrioid carcinoma with squamous differentiation and in clinically advanced poorly differentiated serous carcinomas. Expression of c-erbB-2 protein appears to be increased and that of EGFR is reduced in the early stage of epithelial ovarian oncogenesis. The expression of EGFR with c-erbB-2 protein in ovarian carcinoma is related both to histological differentiation and/or advanced clinical stage.
