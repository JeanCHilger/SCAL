Veralipride for hot flushes during gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment. Hot flushes are the commonest symptom induced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa). We performed an open observational trial to evaluate the efficacy of veralipride, an antidopaminergic drug, in reducing hot flushes in 25 premenopausal women treated with a GnRHa for endometriosis (8 subjects) or menorrhagia (17 subjects). The patients received goserelin depot for 6 months and veralipride was added for the third month. Hot flushes, severe in all women at 2 months, improved in both frequency and intensity in 92% of the subjects during veralipride administration. The benefit obtained persisted until the end of the GnRHa treatment.
