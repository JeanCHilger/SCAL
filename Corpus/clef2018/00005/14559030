The chemokine connection: hormonal and embryonic regulation at the human maternal-embryonic interface--a review. Chemokines are small polypeptides that attract specific leukocyte subsets by binding to cell-surface receptors. In reproductive biology, they have been implicated in ovulation, menstruation, and embryo implantation, and pathological processes such as preterm delivery, HIV infection, and endometriosis. It is known that successful implantation requires a functionally normal embryo at the blastocyst stage and a receptive endometrium that is adequately communicated through the implantation process. This crosstalk is highly regulated, with numerous molecules taking part. Accumulated evidence suggests that chemokines produced and received by the endometrial epithelium and the human blastocyst are implicated in this molecular network. Here, we present updated information on the presence and hormonal and embryonic regulation of chemokines and their receptors during human implantation.
