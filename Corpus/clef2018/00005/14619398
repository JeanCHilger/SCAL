Magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of different forms of endometriosis. The present paper examines the capacities of non-invasive MRI in the diagnosis of endometriosis. A standardized study algorithm is proposed, indications and methodology for MRI in different forms of endometriosis (EM) are specified. It is shown that in the diagnosis of different types of EM there are specific changes in the MR pattern of small pelvic organs, which allow one to make a differential diagnosis of this disease with a higher sensitivity (96%) and specificity (87%) as compared with ultrasound study. MRI makes it possible to assess the degree of invasion of endometrioid heterotopies into the wall of the intestine and cervix uteri with a high degree of accuracy and to judge the degree and extent of intestinal luminal narrowing. Diagnostic errors in solving these problems (as well as those associated with the detection of extragenital foci of EM in the small pelvis) are due first of all to movement artefacts a (respiration and intestinal motility) particularly in the presence of a significant adhesive process and/or after surgical intervention. MRI does not virtually yield false-negative conclusions in the diagnosis of different forms of genital endometriosis (less than 3%), which, in the authors' opinion, rather justifies some hyperdiagnosis (about 11%) made by this method in the diagnosis of endometriosis of the rectovaginal septum. MRI is a closing, specifying stage of instrumental diagnosis of not only EM, but also other small pelvic diseases.
