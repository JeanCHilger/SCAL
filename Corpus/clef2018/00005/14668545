Molecular analysis of endometrial hyperplasia in HNPCC-suspicious patients may predict progression to endometrial carcinoma. Women predisposed to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer are at high risk of developing endometrial carcinoma at a young age. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer-associated endometrial carcinomas are of the endometrioid type, usually arise from complex atypical hyperplasia, and often show microsatellite instability. To identify occult hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer individuals among endometrial carcinoma patients, we examined complex atypical hyperplasias and endometrial carcinomas of 60 women < or =50 years of age (mean age: 35.7 years) using microsatellite instability, immunohistochemistry, and DNA sequence analysis. Three patient groups were recruited: group 1, patients with complex atypical hyperplasia exclusively (n = 27) group 2, patients with complex atypical hyperplasia and synchronous or metachronous endometrial carcinoma (n = 15)
