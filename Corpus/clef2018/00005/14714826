Endometrial pinopode and alphavbeta3 integrin expression is not impaired in infertile patients with endometriosis. To investigate endometrial receptivity in terms of pinopode formation and alphavbeta3 integrin expression in infertile women with endometriosis during natural cycles.We investigated the expression of alphavbeta3 integrin and pinopode formation in the endometrium of 12 infertile patients with stage I or II endometriosis as the only cause of infertility, 12 infertile patients having unexplained infertility, and 12 fertile women who were undergoing tubal sterilization. Two endometrial biopsies (postovulatory day +7 to +8 and 4 days later) were performed during a single menstrual cycle in each subject.No statistically significant difference regarding alphavbeta3 integrin expression and pinopode formation was found between infertile patients with endometriosis and the two control groups.alphavbeta3 integrin expression and pinopode formation are not reduced during the window of implantation in patients with stage I-II endometriosis. Whether these results imply normal endometrial receptivity in such patients or add to the increasing uncertainty about the clinical value of assessing the endometrium with those markers of implantation, warrants further studies.
