Temporal and spatial expression of estrogen activity-related molecules in eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the temporal and spatial expression of estrogen receptor (ER), 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD) in uterine endometria and the endometrial-myometrial interface (EMI) of adenomyosis and the effects of estrogen activity-related molecules on the occurrence of adenomyosis.Thirty-three cases of normal endometria (and myometrial) and eighteen cases of endometria (and myometrial) with adenomyosis were collected. Immunohistochemical assay was performed to locate the ERalpha, ERbeta, 17beta-HSDI and 17beta-HSDII in endometria and EMI.The ERalpha positive cell number in glandular epithelial cells at the early proliferative phase increased evidently in adenomyosis (90%), while it was 60% in normal endometria. We found ERalpha signal in cytoplasm in glandular epithelial cells of adenomyosis endometria as well as in nucleus. Compared with normal endometrium (early proliferative phase: + late proliferative phase: ++The elevation of ERalpha positive cell number, 17beta-HSDI level as well as the insufficient compensation of 17beta-HSDII in eutopic endometrium with adenomyosis and the change in expression pattern of ERalpha, ERbeta, 17beta-HSDI and 17beta-HSDII in EMI lead to the local enhancement of estrogen effect, which would promote cell proliferation.
