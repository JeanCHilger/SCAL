Impact of endometriosis on women's health: comparative historical data show that the earlier the onset, the more severe the disease. Looking at endometriosis from the bigger picture -- as a systemic endocrine, immunological, and gastrointestinal disease -- opens the door to broader treatments. The bigger-picture understanding of the disease also makes clear a variety of patterns of presenting symptoms, again clarifying the diagnosis. Data from over 7000 confirmed cases clearly show that delay in diagnosis (the average time to diagnosis is >9 years) is a major problem and that current treatments are far from satisfactory. In conclusion, the impact of endometriosis, a disease that already produces intense symptoms, is worsened by a current lack of understanding of the disease beyond its pelvic definition.
