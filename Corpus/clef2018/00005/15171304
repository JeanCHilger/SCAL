Establishment and characterization of two different types of new human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell lines (HEC-251 and HEC-265). Endometrial carcinomas are grouped into two types of carcinogenic entities. These two different types of cell lines designated as HEC-251 and HEC-265 were established from human endometrial adenocarcinoma. We report their characteristics.HEC-251 was derived from moderately differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma and HEC-265 from well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.These cell lines grow well and serial passages can be successively carried out more than 100 times. The monolayer cultured cells reveal neoplastic and pleomorphic features, and grow in multilayers. HEC-251 cells are immuno-cytochemically positive for p53 and HEC-265 cells for PgR. Both cell lines are transplantable to nude mice and reflect the original histopathologic characteristics.The cell lines HEC-251 and HEC-265 will contribute to clarifying the characteristics of two different types of human endometrial carcinomas.
