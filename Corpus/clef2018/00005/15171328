Microscopic endometrioid carcinoma arising in endosalpingeal endometriosis. We present a case of microscopic adenocarcinoma arising in the right fallopian tube, which was incidentally found in 74-year-old woman undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy for uterine myoma, hematometra and bilateral hydrosalpinx. A small focus of endometrioid adenocarcinoma confined within the endosalpingeal mucosa of the right fallopian tube associated with endometriosis was fortuitously found during histological examination. Our case seems to be unique since it shows an evident filiation between the lesions of tubal endometriosis and an adjoining focus of microscopic carcinoma. This is the second case report of a microscopic endometrioid carcinoma associated with endosalpingeal endometriosis.
