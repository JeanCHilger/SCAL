Expression of E26 transformation specific (ETS-1) related to angiogenesis in ovarian endometriosis. ETS-1 in ovarian endometriomas was significantly positively correlated with microvessel counts (MVCs), but ETS-1 and MVC were not significantly altered during the menstrual cycle. Because ETS-1 persistently expresses in the subepithelial area of endometriotic endometrium, this might contribute to the growth of ovarian endometriomas via subepithelial angiogenesis independently of the menstrual cycle.
