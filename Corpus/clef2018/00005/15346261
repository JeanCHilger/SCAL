Value of pelvic MRI in the preoperative diagnosis of endometriosis. To determine the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis in the preoperative diagnosis of endometriosis.Over a period of 8 months, preoperative MRI of the pelvis were obtained in 13 patients with suspected endometriosis (mean patient age 34.6 years range 25 - 47 years).In 9 of 13 patients (69 %), the diagnosis of endometriosis was made by MRI and confirmed by laparoscopy in 8 cases. In 2 of 13 patients, endometriotic lesions were detectable by laparoscopy only. In the remaining 2 patients, no endometriosis was visible on MRI or by laparoscopy. MRI was able to visualize a total of 19 endometriotic lesions, with 14 (74 %) confirmed by histopathologic examination following laparoscopy. Five of these 19 lesions (26 %) visible on MRI were not seen by laparoscopy. Using laparoscopy and subsequent histopathologic examination, 27 endometriotic lesions were diagnosed, with 13 (48 %) not seen on the preoperative MRI.MRI and laparoscopy are complementary diagnostic tools that will best document the full extent of endometriosis when combined. MRI can visualize additional lesions inaccessible to laparoscopy. Thus, MRI of the pelvis should used preoperatively for surgical treatment planning.
