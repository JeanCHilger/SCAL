Tissue evaluation of immune markers in endometrial and cervical carcinomas. Major histocompatibility complex (HLA system) class II molecules including HLA-DR antigens, associate with peptides, which are derived from antigens, for presentation to T4 lymphocytes. Functional and adhesion assays have shown that CD4 molecule interacts with HLA class II molecules, leading to enhanced responses of T4 cells. In the present study, we examined the tissue expression of HLA-DR antigens and the quantitative variance of T4 lymphocytes in a series of 50 "endometrioid" adenocarcinomas of the endometrium and 35 cervical squamous-cell carcinomas. A three-step avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase staining method was applied. As primary antibodies, we used the TAL.1BS monoclonal antihuman HLA-DR alpha (alpha) chain antibody and the OPD4 mouse antihuman antibody the latter mainly identifies benign T4 lymphocytes. Twenty-four percent (24%) of women with endometrial cancer were high immune responders, while the relative percentage in women with cervical cancer was 40%
