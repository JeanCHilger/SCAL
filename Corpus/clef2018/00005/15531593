Polymorphisms of the genes encoding the GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 in Korean women: no association with endometriosis. Endometriosis, one of the most common gynaecologic disorders, shows significantly elevated prevalence in industrial areas and there is also a possible genetic predisposition. Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) are enzymes involved in the metabolism of many disease-causing carcinogens and mutagens that are present in human environments. An association between the incidence of endometriosis and the GST genotypes of patients has been suggested. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the polymorphisms of GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 are related to endometriosis. Blood samples were available from 259 controls and 194 patients with advanced endometriosis diagnosed by both pathology and laparoscopic findings. The proportion of the GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 genotypes of the control group were comparable to other populations. There was no significant evidence that the distribution of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotype differed between the patients and the controls, with an allelic odds ratio (OR)=1.074 [95% confidence interval (CI)=0.737-1.564] and 1.239 (95% CI = 0.853-1.799), respectively. Also, there was no significant difference in the proportion of GSTP1 genotypes between the women with endometriosis and the control group with the OR = 0.823 (95% CI = 0.536-1.264). The higher risk alleles were contended as GSTM1, GSTT1 null mutation and GSTP1 Ile105Ile polymorphism. There was no significant increase in the risk of endometriosis as the number of higher risk alleles of the GST family increased. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 genetic polymorphisms are not associated with the development of endometriosis in Korean women.
