Prediction of response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation: a comparison of basal and clomiphene citrate-stimulated follicle-stimulating hormone levels. To test the ovarian reserve in a high-risk population before controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF).A prospective study comparing the outcome of a clomiphene citrate (CC) challenge test to the outcome of subsequent IVF cycles.Unit for assisted reproductive technology in a university hospital.Ninety-one infertile women with an age of 35 years or more, who had previous ovarian surgery or who had been diagnosed with ovarian endometriosis.Relate follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels before and after CC to frequency of cancellation of an IVF cycle because of a poor follicular response.Twenty-one patients had elevated basal levels of FSH. Thirty-seven patients, including 20 with high basal levels, showed an excessive FSH response to CC with an FSH level after CC above the 95% confidence limit. Clomiphene citrate-stimulated FSH levels correlated better than basal levels with response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. An excessive FSH response to CC predicted a poor response outcome of subsequent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF with 85% accuracy.Follicle-stimulating hormone response to CC predicts subsequent follicular response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation.
