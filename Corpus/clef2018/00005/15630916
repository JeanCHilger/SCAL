Chronic pelvic pain in women: assessment and management. Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common condition that poses diagnostic and management challenges for doctors and their patients.This article outlines an approach to the diagnosis and management of CPP in women, lists a range of possible aetiologies, and provides additional information on three conditions commonly associated with CPP: endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and irritable bowel syndrome.Chronic pelvic pain may be due to one or several aetiologies, while in some women no specific cause is identified. All women should be advised that even though limited medical knowledge sometimes precludes the assignation of a definite cause and cure, the pain can be managed, and psychological support can be provided. A multidisciplinary approach can be beneficial.
