Mononuclear cell beta-endorphin concentration in women with and without endometriosis. Seventy-five consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopy for chronic pelvic pain and/or infertility were studied to test whether beta-endorphin concentrations in peripheral mononuclear cells differed according to the presence or absence of endometriosis. Endometriosis was diagnosed in 45 subjects (minimal in 24, mild in 11, moderate in four, and severe in six). Twenty-eight women (62%) with endometriosis and ten (33%) without the disease reported moderate or severe pelvic pain. beta-Endorphin levels were lower in the endometriosis group than in the controls (16.6 +/- 11.2 versus 21.9 +/- 10.5 pg/10(6) cells P less than .01). This decrease was attributable to reduced beta-endorphin concentrations in the endometriosis patients with moderate or severe pain compared with symptomatic controls (15.5 +/- 10.0 versus 26.3 +/- 7.0 pg/10(6) cells
