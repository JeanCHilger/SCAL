Vesical endometriosis: report of two cases. Endometriosis affecting the urinary tract is very rare and the most common site of involvement is urinary bladder. The clinical features are urgency and frequency, hipogastric pain and hematuria. Cistoscopic examination is the most valuable diagnostic test but definitive diagnosis requires histologic confirmation. We report 2 cases of endometriosis in 2 young women, one with previously cesarean section, in which surgical treatment was effective. After 1 and 3 years of follow-up respectively the patients remain assymptomatic.
