Endometriosis during postmenopausal period--probable causes for its origin and development. A very rare--casuistic--case of endometriosis is presented, which appeared ten years after surgical menopause (hysterectomy and ovariectomy) without concomitant use of hormone replacement therapy or phytoestrogens. The possibilities of endogenous production and exogenous supply of estrogens in the female organism are discussed as well as the possible causes of proliferation of endometrial lesions during postmenopausal period. When menopause is induced by surgery (a stress for the organism) without exogenous supply of estrogens (HRT, phytoestrogens, xenoestrogens) the production of suprarenal hormones, including androgens, increases. The peripheral conversion of androgens into estrogens in fat tissue is increased and implanted during hysterectomy endometrial lesions in vagina walls are stimulated.
