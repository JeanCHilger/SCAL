Case report. Rectus abdominis endometriosis: a report of two cases. Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of histological normal endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. Most frequently endometriosis occurs within the pelvis. Extrapelvic endometriosis is less common, but can involve nearly every organ. We present two patients in whom endometriosis was found in the rectus abdominis muscle and discuss the imaging findings and pathological correlation.
