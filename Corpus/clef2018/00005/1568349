Pituitary-ovarian function in women with minimal or mild endometriosis and otherwise unexplained infertility. To determine whether abnormalities of pituitary-ovarian function are associated with minor degrees of endometriosis in women with otherwise unexplained infertility.Comparison of pituitary-ovarian function in a group of 22 patients with that in a control group of 10 healthy fertile women.Twenty-two women with minimal or mild endometriosis and otherwise unexplained infertility.Ovarian ultrasound and radioimmunoassay of pituitary and ovarian hormones.Abnormalities, including luteinization of unruptured follicles, broad LH surges and low concentrations of progesterone during the luteal phase, were demonstrated in 82% of study cycles.Pituitary-ovarian dysfunction appears to be associated with minimal or mild endometriosis in women with otherwise unexplained infertility but the diversity of endocrine abnormalities demonstrated suggests that endometriosis is unlikely to be an aetiological factor in their development.
