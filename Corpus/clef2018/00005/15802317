Human ovarian tissue from cortex surrounding benign cysts: a model to study ovarian tissue cryopreservation. The scarcity of human ovarian tissue is a major problem in developing research on ovarian cryopreservation. We were interested in ovarian cortex surrounding benign ovarian cysts harvested during their requisite operations.Ovarian tissue was collected from 25 women (mean age = 27.7 +/- 1.0 SEM) and frozen in serum-free cryoprotective medium. Histological and viability analysis were performed on fresh and frozen-thawed slices of tissue.Dermoid (n = 7), endometriosis (n = 13) and serous (n = 5) cysts were observed. Follicular densities (expressed per mm3) in ovarian cortex surrounding dermoid cysts were higher than in endometriosis and serous cysts for both histological (median of follicular densities: 13.04, 0.31 and 0.89 respectively) and viability analysis (2.93, 0.05 and 0.71 respectively). Freezing-thawing did not result in gross abnormality of follicle population either in number or morphology (80% of follicles preserved a normal pattern). However, a slight decrease of the density of living follicles (expressed per mm2) was reported.Ovarian cortex surrounding ovarian cysts, especially dermoid cysts, could be considered a source of ovarian tissue for future research. In our study, the cryopreservation procedure resulted in high follicular survival assessed by both histological and viability analysis. Nevertheless, further studies of in vivo and in vitro follicular maturation are needed to strengthen this model.
