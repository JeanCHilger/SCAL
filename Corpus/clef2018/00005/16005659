Endometriosis with ascites and pleural effusion: a case report. Massive ascites associated with pelvic endometriosis is an uncommon combination. Pleural effusion may rarely occur. Fourteen cases are reported in the literature. We report the case of a black nulligravida woman followed for a primary infertility. Endometriosis was suspected in presence of increasing dysmenorrhea, cystic adnexal masse, umbilical nodes and ascites. The diagnosis was confirmed at exploratory laparoscopy. The patient had been followed for assisted procreation for six years and had undergone a conservative laparoscopic surgery never described. After several ascites recurrences, the pathology was resolved by Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy. But a right pleural effusion with ascites occurred following a bad therapeutic observance. This complication reveals an early pregnancy never reported for this exceptional pathology. A conservative management allowed this unique case of well outcoming pregnancy. The possible pathogenesis of ascites and pleural effusion are explored and recommendations for diagnosis and treatment options are discussed.
