Concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1 soluble receptor type II (IL-1 sRII) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 Ra) in the peritoneal fluid and serum of infertile women with endometriosis. Endometriosis is an immune system-related gynaecological disease, characterised by an increase in number and activation of peritoneal macrophages. One of macrophage-derived factors is interleukin (IL)-1. The effects of IL-1 are inhibited by IL-1 receptor type II (IL-1 RII), soluble forms of IL-1 RII (IL-1 sRII) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 Ra). The aim of our work was to study the IL-1alpha, IL-1 sRII and IL-1 Ra levels in the peritoneal fluid (PF) and serum of women with endometriosis in relation to stage of disease.Concentrations of IL-1alpha, IL-1 sRII and IL-1 Ra were measured by ELISA assay in the PF and serum of 58 women 43 with and 15 without endometriosis (control group).Elevated PF and serum IL-1alpha and IL-1 Ra levels in the women with endometriosis in comparison with the control group were observed. IL-1 sRII levels in PF and serum were higher in the controls than in the women with endometriosis. Concentrations of IL-1alpha and IL-1 sRII were higher in advanced endometriosis, but higher IL-1 Ra was observed in the early stage of the disease.Impairment of regulation IL-1 activity in the peritoneal fluid and serum of women with endometriosis may play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of the disease.
