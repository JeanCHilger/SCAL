Pseudoinfiltrative tubal metaplasia of the endocervix: a potential form of in utero diethylstilbestrol exposure-related adenosis simulating minimal deviation adenocarcinoma. We report three cases of unusual tubal-type endocervical glandular proliferations simulating minimal deviation adenocarcinoma in women with a history of in utero diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure. The lesions were characterized by haphazard glandular proliferations extending from 3.4 to 6.1 mm into the endocervical stroma and to the margins of excision in all cases. Most of the glands were small to medium-sized and round some exhibited a moderate degree of cystic dilatation, and occasional glands had curvilinear profiles. The glandular epithelium displayed extensive tubal-type differentiation in all cases. In two cases, the glands lacked cytologic atypia and mitotic activity, and in one case, there was mild to moderate nuclear atypia with occasional mitotic activity. Immunohistochemical studies showed diffuse expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and essentially no expression of p16 in two cases tested
