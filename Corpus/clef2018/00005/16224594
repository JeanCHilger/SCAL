Proliferative activity of microvessels and angiogenesis in eutopic endometrium in patients with peritoneal endometriosis. Comparative analysis of the density of microvessels and angiogenic activity in eutopic endometrium during different phases of the menstrual cycle in patients with peritoneal endometriosis showed that peritoneal form of endometriosis is a paracrine disease with dysregulation of angiogenesis processes in the eutopic endometrium. Excessive angiogenesis in this condition promotes implantation of eutopic endometrium on the peritoneum. Angiogenesis in eutopic endometrium can be maintained due to high concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor A in the peritoneal fluid.
