Prognostic value of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression in endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), a member of the zinc-dependent metalloproteinase gene family, plays an important role in cancer invasion and metastasis. The current study aimed to evaluate whether the expression of MMP-2 is associated with survival in patients with endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The MMP-2 immunoreactive protein was evaluated from endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium in 112 patients treated at Oulu University Hospital, Finland. The median follow-up time was 88 months. The expression of MMP-2 was studied immunohistochemically in paraffin-embedded tissue samples from the primary tumours by using a specific monoclonal antibody to MMP-2. The MMP-2 protein was found in 80% of the primary tumours, including all histological grades. All grade 3 tumors were MMP-2-positive. At the end of the study period, 21 of the 22 (95%) patients presenting MMP-2-negative immunostaining were alive, whereas the corresponding figure for those with MMP-2-positive tumours was 78 out of 90 (87%). These data suggest that MMP-2 immunostaining negativity might be linked with a favourable prognosis in endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
