The effect of preoperative ketorolac on WBC response and pain in laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis. Surgical stress causes changes in the composition of white blood cells (WBCs). Ketorolac is believed to have analgesic effects and to reduce the stress response and may therefore improve postoperative outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of preoperative ketorolac on the WBC subsets in patients who had laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis. Fifty patients who had laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the ketorolac group (n = 25) received ketorolac 0.5 mg/kg before the induction of anesthesia, and the control group (n = 25) received saline. White cell count, differential, and pathology studies were done immediately after surgery, on postoperative day 1, and on postoperative day 3. We compared the baseline values within and between the two groups. We also assessed postoperative pain and side effects. The time that elapsed before the first patient request for analgesia, total meperidine dose and VAS (Visual Analog Scale) for postoperative pain were significantly lower in the ketorolac group than in the control group. Compared to the pre- surgical values, there was an increase in total WBC count and percentage of neutrophils, but a decrease in percentages of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and leucocytes. Total WBC count, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and leucocytes showed significant differences between the two groups. The incidences of postoperative side effects, such as nausea, dizziness, headache, and shoulder pain were not different between the groups. Preoperative ketorolac reduced postoperative pain and influenced the WBC response in laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis.
