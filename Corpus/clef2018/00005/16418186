Parathyroid hormone-related protein-secreting uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)-secreting metastatic uterine endometrioid cancer was made in a 32-year-old Japanese woman with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The primary endometrial cancer had been removed, and the tumor was diagnosed as Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma with shallow myometrial invasion. Salvage chemotherapy (paclitaxel and calboplatin) was started from 5 months after surgery when recurrent tumors were detected in the peritoneum and liver. Despite the salvage chemotherapy, the tumor progressed and hypercalcemia became evident with elevated PTHrP whereas no bone metastasis was identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of hypercalcemia due to PTHrP secretion in uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
