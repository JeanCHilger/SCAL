Estrogen receptor gene polymorphisms are associated with recurrence of endometriosis. The presence of gene polymorphisms of the estrogen receptors ERalpha (PvuII and XbaI) and ERbeta (AluI) in 61 women with endometriosis was investigated. A statistically significant correlation between PvuII ERalpha gene polymorphism (PvuII), both in homozygosity (PP) and in heterozygosity (Pp), and a recurrence of endometriosis was found. In conclusion, women affected by endometriosis with the ERalpha polymorphic allele, even if heterozygous, have a worse prognosis, and these results suggest that the ERalpha gene polymorphisms may be included among the genetic risk factors for endometriosis.
