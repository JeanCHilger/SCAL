Abdominal wall endometrioma found during abdominoplasty. Extrauterine manifestations of endometriosis are well-recognized and frequently encountered by gynecologists, but are not necessarily familiar to the plastic surgery community. With the current increase in gastric bypass procedures performed and the subsequent increase in abdominal wall reconstructions secondary to massive weight loss, the plastic surgeon should have some familiarity with the diverse presentations of this common disease. To help with this, the authors present the case of an abdominal wall endometrioma diagnosed during abdominoplasty.
