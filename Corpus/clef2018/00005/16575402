Cellular retinol binding protein-1 expression in endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma: diagnostic and possible therapeutic implications. Cellular retinol binding protein-1 (CRBP-1) contributes to the maintenance of the differentiative state of endometrial glandular cells through the regulation of bioavailability of retinol and derivatives, but its role in endometrial oncogenetic process remains unclear. Antibodies to CRBP-1, estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR) were applied to paraffin sections of proliferative (n = 10) and secretory endometrium (n = 9), and to endometrial polyps (n = 6), simple (n = 7), complex (n = 3) and atypical endometrial hyperplasias (n = 9) as well as to 47 endometrioid carcinomas of different histological grade (G) (G1, n = 18 G2, n = 19
