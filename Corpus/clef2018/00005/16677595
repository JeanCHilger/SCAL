Detection of peritoneal endometriotic lesions by autofluorescence laparoscopy. This study was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of autofluorescence laparoscopy in the diagnosis of endometriotic lesions.Prospective analysis of 83 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopy for suspected endometriosis under white light illumination and autofluorescence diagnosis. The study measured total number of endometriotic lesions diagnosed under white light illumination and with autofluorescence diagnosis.The biopsy-based sensitivity of white light diagnosis alone and white light illumination and autofluorescence for detecting nonpigmented peritoneal endometriotic lesions was 65% compared with 92% (1.42-fold increase). The corresponding specificity was 68% as opposed to 84%. Occult areas of endometriosis were discovered using autofluorescence diagnosis. Statistical analysis was performed with chi2 test and McNemar test.Combination of white light illumination and autofluorescence is significantly superior to white light illumination alone in detecting nonpigmented endometriotic lesions. Autofluorescence diagnosis of nonpigmented endometriotic lesions may become an alternative to fluorescence diagnosis after application of 5-aminolevulinic acid, especially because of no side effects.
