Differential expression of genes in eutopic and ectopic endometrium from patients with ovarian endometriosis. To investigate whether genes that had been found to be differentially expressed in deep-infiltrating endometriosis and matched eutopic endometrium in our previous complementary DNA microarray study also are differentially expressed in ovarian endometriosis and matched eutopic endometrium.Prospective study.University hospital in France.Patients with ovarian endometriosis.During surgery, paired samples of tissue representing ovarian endometriosis and eutopic endometrium were obtained from 12 patients.Expression levels of messenger RNA for heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90A), chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 2 (COUP-TF2), prostaglandin E(2) receptor subtype EP3 (PGE(2)EP3), tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrKB), and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (17betaHSD2 epithelial cells) and of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), protein kinase C beta 1 (PKCbeta1), Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK7), Sprouty2, mu-opioid receptor (MOR), and 5HTT (stromal cells) from ovarian endometriosis and matched eutopic endometrium were determined by using laser capture microdissection and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques.Expression of PDGFRA, PKCbeta1, JAK1, HSP90A, COUP-TF2, MOR, and 17betaHSD2 was significantly higher in ovarian endometriosis than in eutopic endometrium, whereas that of Sprouty2 and PGE(2)EP3 was significantly lower. There was no significant difference in mitochondrial RNA expression of MKK 7, TrKB, and 5HTT.Ovarian endometriosis might share several common molecules with deep-infiltrating endometriosis that act to sustain endometriotic lesions, whereas molecules involved in local endocrine control might be different between these two types of endometriosis.
