Observation on effect of combined therapy of neiyi pill and neiyi enema on endometriosis. To observe the effect of combined therapy of Neiyi pill (NP) and Neiyi enema (NE) on endometriosis and its effect on serum levels of endometrial antibody (EMAB) and carcinoembryonic antigen 125 (CA125).Fifty-eight cases with endometriosis were divided into 3 groups randomly, group A (n = 16) treated by NP, group B (n = 24) treated by NP and NE, and group C (n = 18) treated by danazol, all for 3 menstrual cycle with single blind method. The effect was observed and the serum levels of EMAB and CA125 were detected before and after treatment.Comparison of the efficacy between the 3 groups showed: there was no remarkable difference between group A and B (P >0.05), both of group A and group B were superior to that of group C (P<0.05). The levels of EMAB and CA125 had no significant changes in all the three groups after treatment.Combined therapy of NP and NE could improve the curative effect on endometriosis, and without obvious effects on serum levels of EMAB and CA125.
