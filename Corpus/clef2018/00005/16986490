Ovarian endometriosis: characteristics of the blood circulatory bed. Glandular cystic ovarian endometriosis (OE) is characterized by a more intensive blood supply than cystic OE. This type of OE is characterized by a high proliferative glandular epithelial activity detected by an immunohistochemical study using antibodies to PCNA and CA-125. Moreover, a positive correlation is found between the serum concentration of CA-125 and the expression of this antigen in the epitheliocytes of an endometrioid cyst in both glandular-cystic and cystic OE. Thus, the findings permit the determination of the morphofunctional activity of a type of OE and its aptness to the progression of the disease and to the development of recurrences.
