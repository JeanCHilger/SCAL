Endometriosis mimicking hernia recurrence. Endometriosis is a common gynecologic condition and has been described in several locations, mostly in the pelvis. Extragenital endometriosis may appear as a painful nodule evoking an inguinal hernia. Scar endometriosis after inguinal hernia repair seems to be a rare occurrence. We report an unusual case of a 28-year-old woman who developed a scar endometriosis 2 years after an inguinal hernia repair. This case highlights that the presence of a painless inguinal mass similar to a recurrent hernia, with possible swelling related to the menstrual cycle, may evoke endometriosis, especially after a previous hernia repair and should lead to prompt diagnosis, wide excision, and gynecological advice.
