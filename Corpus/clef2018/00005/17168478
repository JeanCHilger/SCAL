Endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain. Endometriosis /E/ is a frequently met disease in women in reproductive age. One of its most typical clinical manifestations is chronic pelvic pain /CPP/ and as components of the chronic pain syndrome- dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, intermenstrual pain, and sometimes dyschezia and dysuria.To build up pain profile of patients with E by using quantitative and qualitative characteristics.The study was conducted in the Clinic of Gynaecology at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Medical University-Pleven in the period 01.03.2004-01.02.2006 Sixty-six patients were included in the study. They were consecutively admitted in the Clinic for diagnostic specification or operative treatment, and in whom E was suspected or proved before. The patients were grouped according their age, fertility, body mass index, blood group affiliation, stage of the disease, etc. The following methods were used for the purpose of the study: pain map, monthly pain calendar, inquiry method-by a questionnaire /form/, based on instruments for pain assessment, which are accepted worldwide documentary method, R-AFS classification of E. Factors that provoke appearance and manifestation of pain, and factors that alleviate pain were studied too.The obtained results were statistically processed and were presented by the means of tables, graphics and numerical quantities. They corroborated the hypothesis for typical pain profile of women with E.The building up of pain profile in total with other diagnostic methods /ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging/ has a determining role in the further diagnostic and therapeutic management of women with E and CPP. Pain profile can also be used as an assessment tool of conducted treatment /conservative or surgical/.
