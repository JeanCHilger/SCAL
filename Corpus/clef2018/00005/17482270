Peritoneal fluid from endometriosis patients switches differentiation of monocytes from dendritic cells to macrophages. Immunological abnormalities of cell-mediated and humoral immunity might be associated with the pathogenesis of endometriosis. This study has examined the effects of peritoneal fluid obtained from patients with endometriosis (ePF) on the phenotypic characteristics of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) derived from monocytes. Monocytes were obtained from healthy young volunteers and cultured with ePF (n=12) or a control PF (cPF) (n=5) in the presence or absence of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) or IL-4 plus granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The ePF was demonstrated to increase expression levels of CD14 and CD64 on isolated monocytes in the presence or absence of M-CSF. Compared with cPF, addition of 10% ePF to GM-CSF plus IL-4-treated monocytes significantly down-regulated CD1a expression and up-regulated CD64 expression, but did not enhance expression levels of class II MHC. ePF had no effect, however, on tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced maturation of DC. Levels of IL-6, IL-10 and M-CSF production were higher in ePF-treated than cPF-treated monocytes for both cell culture conditions with GM-CSF plus IL-4 and M-CSF. A neutralizing IL-6 antibody, but not an IL-10 antibody, abrogated the ePF-induced down-regulation of CD1a, up-regulation of CD64 and secretion of M-CSF. These results suggest that ePF favorably induces monocyte differentiation toward macrophages rather than DCs, and that this effect is mediated by IL-6. A reciprocal mode of cell differentiation between macrophages and DCs in response to ePF may be related to the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
