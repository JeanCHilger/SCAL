Elevation of CA 19-9 and chromogranin A, in addition to CA 125, are detectable in benign tumors in leiomyomas and endometriosis. As the best-known tumor marker for ovarian carcinoma, CA 125 has also been commonly used to monitor patients with common benign gynecologic diseases such as endometriosis and leiomyoma. Both of these benign tumors are known to be at risk of developing into cancer. During the screening of an asymptomatic population with multiple tumor markers, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), CA 125, CA 19-9, CA 15-3, chromogranin A (CgA), and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), we have detected elevated tumor markers in 142 individuals 19 of them were diagnosed with endometriosis or leiomyoma or both. In addition to the detection of elevation of CA 125 in these benign tumors, elevated CA 19-9 or CgA was also found in these patients with endometriosis or leiomyoma. Many patients only had elevated CA 19-9 or CgA
