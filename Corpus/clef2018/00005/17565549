The impact of leukemia inhibitory factor in uterine flushing on the reproductive potential of infertile women--a prospective study. To determine the value of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) assessment for predicting the reproductive outcome.Two phase study. Phase I: assessment of LIF in uterine flushing. Phase II: 1,5 years after examining the last patient, a questionnaire was sent to all participants of the phase I. Phase I: Uterine flushing and endometrial samples were collected during implantation window from infertile patients with stage I/II endometriosis (n = 14), patients with idiopathic infertility (n = 27), luteal phase deficiency (n = 13), and fertile control (n = 21). LIF was assessed in uterine flushings in all patients by ELISA. In endometrium, semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed for LIF mRNA expression. Phase II: questionnaire has been sent to all infertile women taking part in the first phase of the experiment, regarding their reproductive outcome.65.4% patients who had returned the questionnaire did get pregnant. LIF concentration at a cut-off point of 2.31 pg/ml had a 95.7% sensitivity and 81.8% specificity in predicting the reproductive outcome.This prospective study for the first time in literature indicates that the LIF assessment can be used as a predictor of reproductive success.
