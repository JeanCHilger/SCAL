Expression of epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-2, and platelet-derived growth factor-A in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. The objective of the present study was to compare the levels of expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A) mRNA in the eutopic endometrium of women with and without endometriosis.Thirty-five women with advanced stage endometriosis and 31 control women were recruited. Following isolation of total RNA from endometrial tissue and reverse transcription, cDNA samples were amplified to quantify the level of expression of EGF, FGF-2, PDGF-A.While the levels of mRNA of EGF and FGF-2 were not different between the two groups, the PDGF-A mRNA level was significantly lower in the endometriosis group than in the control group during the secretory phase (6.12 +/- 0.51 vs 12.50 +/- 0.99, mean +/- SEM, P < 0.05).The expression level of PDGF-A, but not EGF and FGF-2, might be decreased during the secretory phase in the eutopic endometrium of women with advanced stage endometriosis.
