Psychosomatic aspects of endometriosis--current state of scientific knowledge and clinical experience. Current therapeutic options allow successful treatment in only part of the women presenting with endometriosis. Pain, fatigue/exhaustion, intensive and repeated therapies as well as a concentration on the disease lead to a variety of consequences concerning education/ profession, body perception, self-esteem, partnership/social contacts, sexuality and psychic well-being. Difficulties in becoming pregnant represent a further central problem in dealing with endometriosis. Therefore, biopsychosocial aspects should be integrated into current somatically oriented models of medical support.
