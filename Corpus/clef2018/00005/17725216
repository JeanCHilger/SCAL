Therapeutic progress in gynecology: organic diseases. Over the last ten years, progress in evidence-based medicine coupled with technological and surgical breakthroughs have deeply changed the management of our patients. Uterine bleeding is the first cause of gynaecological consultation and the intrauterine progestin delivery system as well as new hysteroscopic procedures have optimized the therapeutic approach to this problem. Introduction of magnetic resonance imaging and interventional procedures have improved breast disease diagnosis and management likewise sentinel node localization, introduction of aromatase and growth factors inhibitors, new radiotherapy procedures and pharmacogenomics, have helped to ameliorate breast cancer treatment. Pelvic surgery has been switching more and more towards laparoscopic procedures not only in the field of benign lesions (eg endometriosis), of surgery of prolapse and incontinence with new prosthetic materials, but also for an improved management of gynaecological cancers.
