Endosalpingiosis as a source of psammoma bodies in a Papanicolaou smear. A case report. Psammoma bodies are concentric, laminated structures produced by cross-sectioning the tips of calcified papillary formations and are usually associated with papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland, meningiomas and serous papillary tumors of the ovary. These structures have occasionally been seen in cytologic smears obtained from women with endometrial or ovarian carcinoma. A woman had Papanicolaou smears that continued to show psammoma bodies for over two years, eventually leading to a hysterectomy. Even though the presence of psammoma bodies on a Papanicolaou smear should always alert the physician to the possibility of ovarian carcinoma, leading to a thorough search for this malignancy, a variety of benign conditions, such as endosalpingiosis, may also be associated with this finding.
