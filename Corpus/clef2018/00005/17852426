Association study between epidermal growth factor receptor and epidermal growth factor polymorphisms and endometriosis in a Japanese population. We investigated a possible association between endometriosis and polymorphisms in the genes encoding epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and EGF in a Japanese population.We compared the distribution of the Egfr+2073 A/T and Egf+61 G/A polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 146 affected women and 181 controls.No significant differences in the frequency and genotype distribution of the Egfr+2073 A/T and Egf+61 G/A polymorphisms were found between endometriosis patients with all disease stages and controls. Stratification by disease stage had no effect on the results.The Egfr+2073 A/T and Egf+61 G/A polymorphisms are not associated with an increased risk of endometriosis in a Japanese population.
