The effect of interleukin-6 on ciliary beat frequency in the human fallopian tube. To investigate the effect of interleukin-6 (IL-6) on ciliary activity within the human fallopian tube in vitro.An experimental laboratory-based study.University teaching hospital.Fallopian tube specimens were obtained from eight women undergoing hysterectomy for fibroid uterus.Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) in the human fallopian tube.After baseline CBF measurements, increasing concentrations of IL-6 (10 pg/mL, 100 pg/mL, and 1000 pg/mL) were applied to fallopian tube mucosa explants and CBF measurements repeated. An anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody was added and CBF measured once more. Negative and antibody-only control samples were used.The CBF remained unchanged with the addition of IL-6 at concentrations of 10 pg/mL and 100 pg/mL but IL-6 at 1000 pg/mL significantly decreased CBF, an effect abolished by the addition of the specific antibody.These data suggest that IL-6 has an inhibitory effect on ciliary activity, suggesting a possible role for this cytokine in the subfertility process. This finding may be important in conditions where there are increased IL-6 levels in the peritoneal fluid, such as endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease.
