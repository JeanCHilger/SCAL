Elevation of serum CA 125 and D-dimer levels associated with rupture of ovarian endometrioma. Patients with endometriosis rarely have a serum CA 125 concentration >100 IU/mL. A raised plasma level of D-dimer indicates active fibrinolysis, either secondary to clot formation or primarily activated. This condition is seldom diagnosed in patients with endometriosis.A 53-year-old woman was referred to our institution for acute abdominal pain. Laparoscopic surgery revealed a large ovarian cyst with rupture on the left side. Preoperative laboratory tests detected high serum CA 125 and D-dimer levels. Adnexectomy was performed, resulting in a sharp decrease in serum CA 125 and D-dimer concentration. We describe the clinical course of the patient.Rupture of a large ovarian endometrioma can lead to a high serum concentration of CA 125, a condition which, in addition to the detected pelvic mass, may mimic a malignant process. The increased D-dimer plasma level indicated that a ruptured endometriotic cyst can induce coagulation reactions.
