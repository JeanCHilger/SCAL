Gene expression profiles and functional characterization of human immortalized endometriotic epithelial and stromal cells. To determine whether immortalized endometriotic cells can be used as potential models to unravel pathophysiology/pathogenesis of endometriosis in humans.In vitro study. Human immortalized endometriotic epithelial and stromal cells.College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University.Not applicable.None.Gene expression pattern and prostaglandin E(2) production and activity of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and matrix metalloproteinase 9.Several genes associated with estrogen and progesterone biosynthesis and signaling, cell cycle regulation, extracellular matrix degradation, angiogenesis, cell growth and survival, cytokine production, and prostaglandin E(2) biosynthesis, transport, and signaling were expressed in human immortalized endometriotic cells. These endometriotic epithelial and stromal cells exhibited migrating and invading potential, produced a high quantity of prostaglandin E(2), and showed higher matrix metalloproteinase 2 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 activity compared to normal endometrial, epithelial, and stromal cells.Human immortalized endometriotic epithelial and stromal cells could be used as ideal models to study the molecular and cellular aspects of endometriosis in humans.
