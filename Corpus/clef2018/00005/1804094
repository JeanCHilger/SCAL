Expression of tumour markers CA125, CASA and OSA in minimal/mild endometriosis. Ovarian cancer associated antigens CA125, CASA and OSA were measured in serum from 23 patients with mild endometriosis before, during and after medical therapy. Pretreatment CA125 levels were elevated above 35 mu/ml in 4(17%), and above 25 mu/ml in 7 (30%) patients. Mean CA125 levels decreased during treatment, but in only 10 patients did levels reflect disease response. There was no correlation between CA125 levels and disease severity as measured by modified American Fertility Society Scoring. Neither CASA nor OSA were detected in these women.
