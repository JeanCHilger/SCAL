Descriptive analysis of epidemiologic, clinical, diagnosis and therapeutic data was performed.prevalence of adenomyosis was 15% and multiparity observed for 90% of women was the main risk factor.women desirous of pregnancy and affected by adenomyosis can benefit from conservative treatment, but hysterectomy remains the reference treatment.
