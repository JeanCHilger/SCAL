Crohn's disease complicated by multiple stenoses and internal fistulas clinically mimicking small bowel endometriosis. We report a 31-year-old woman with Crohn's disease complicated by multiple stenoses and internal fistulas clinically misdiagnosed as small bowel endometriosis, due to the patient's perimenstrual symptoms of mechanical subileus for 3 years at first monthly, but later continuous, and gradually increasing in severity. We performed an exploratory laparotomy for small bowel obstruction, and found multiple ileal strictures and internal enteric fistulas. Because intraoperative findings were thought to indicate Crohn's disease, a right hemicolectomy and partial distal ileum resection were performed for obstructive Crohn's ileitis. Histopathology of the resected specimen revealed Crohn's disease without endometrial tissue. The patient made an uneventful recovery from this procedure and was discharged home 10 d post-operatively. The differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease with intestinal endometriosis may be difficult pre-operatively. The two entities share many overlapping clinical, radiological and pathological features. Nevertheless, when it is difficult to identify the cause of intestinal obstruction in a woman of child-bearing age with cyclical symptoms suggestive of small bowel endometriosis, Crohn's disease should be included in the differential diagnosis.
