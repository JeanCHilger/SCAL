Expression of aquaporin-1 in normal, hyperplasic, and carcinomatous endometria. To explore the relationship between aquaporin-1 (AQP1) and endometrial adenocarcinoma.Intratumoral microvessel density (IMD) was assessed as well as AQP1 and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in samples from 117 women, 75 with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, 17 with endometrial hyperplasia, and 25 with normal proliferative endometria.AQP1 was located in the epithelial cells of microvessels and small vessels in all samples. The AQP1/IMD ratio was highest in samples from the first, less in samples from the second, and least in samples from the third group. In samples from endometrioid adenocarcinoma, the AQP1/IMD ratio was significantly correlated with histologic grade, surgical stage, myometrial invasion, and extrauterine metastasis. There was a positive correlation between AQP1 expression and IMD and between AQP1/IMD ratio and VEGF expression.AQP1 may be involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of endometrioid adenocarcinoma by promoting angiogenesis, and AQP1 level may be both a tumor indicator and a new therapeutic target.
