Endometrioid epithelial ovarian cancer : 20 years of prospectively collected data from a single center. Clinicopathological features and outcome of women with endometrioid and serous ovarian adenocarcinoma were compared.Between 1984 and 2004, baseline and follow-up data were prospectively recorded on 1545 patients with ovarian cancer. Of these, 270 had pure endometrioid tumors 659 had pure serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary. Response to platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) overall survival, stage-for-stage median progression-free survival (PFS), and cause-specific median survival were compared. Independent predictors of survival were examined by using multivariate analyses.Median age of diagnosis for patients with endometrioid tumors was younger than those with serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary (60 years vs 62 years P = .013). They presented more often with early disease (stage I and IIDespite similar PBC response rates, endometrioid histology is associated with better survival compared with serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary, even with stage III or poorly differentiated tumors.
