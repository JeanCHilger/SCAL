Recent data on endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common disorder in young women of childbearing age and it leads to sterility in 25 to 30 percent of cases. This disorder, which is characterized by the heterotopical presence of endometrial tissue, has a complex physiopathology, which involves the tubal reflux of blood during the menses as well as immune theories involving the formation of autoantibodies to the endometrial cells. Treatment is based on producing a lower level of estrogen production, by administering LHRH analogs or danazol. LHRH analogs, such as nafareline, have no secondary metabolic effects and achieve a successful therapeutic response, with an 87 percent improvement rate as detected by celioscopy.
