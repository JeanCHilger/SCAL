Utility of a novel serum tumor biomarker HE4 in patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus. Tumor markers with increased sensitivity and specificity for endometrial cancer are needed to help monitor response to therapy and to detect recurrent disease. Currently, the tumor maker CA125 is utilized in this role with limited value. The objectives of this study were to examine the levels of several novel tumor markers HE4, SMRP, CA72.4 and CA125 as potential markers in patients diagnosed with endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus.Pre-operative serum samples from surgically staged patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus were analyzed for levels of HE4, SMRP, CA72-4 and CA125. Control samples were obtained from healthy postmenopausal women. Logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for each tumor marker and for all combinations, with cross-validation analyses to obtain average sensitivities at set specificities of 90%, 95%, and 98%.Serum samples from 156 healthy subjects and 171 patients with endometrial cancer (122 stage I, 17 stage II, 26 stage III, and 6 stage IV) were analyzed. At a 95% specificity, the sensitivities for differentiating between healthy subjects and all stages of cancer were 45.5% for HE4 and 24.6% for CA125. For stage I disease, HE4 yielded a 17.1% improvement in sensitivity compared with CA125.HE4 is elevated in all stages of endometrial can100cer and is more sensitive in early-stage endometrial cancer compared to CA125. Further investigation of HE4 as a marker for early detection of recurrent endometrial cancer and monitoring response to therapy is warranted.
