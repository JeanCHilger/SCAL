Magnetic resonance manifestations of endometrial cysts at 3 T compared with 1.5 T. To evaluate the feasibility of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 3 T compared with 1.5 T while focusing on the shading sign of endometrial cysts on T2-weighted images.Fifteen ovarian endometrial cysts in 10 patients underwent pelvic MR scans on 3-T and 1.5-T scanners. Fast spin-echo T2-weighted images were obtained. The images were evaluated qualitatively for the presence of the shading sign. Quantitative evaluation was performed by comparing the cyst-to-muscle signal intensity ratio at 3 T and that at 1.5 T.The signal intensity of the cysts was lower at 3 T than that at 1.5 T by visual evaluation. In 2 lesions, the shading sign was demonstrated at 3 T but was not at 1.5 T. The cyst-to-muscle signal intensity ratio at 3 T was significantly lower than that at 1.5 T.Magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T is useful for the diagnosis of endometrial cysts with better demonstration of the shading sign on T2-weighted images.
