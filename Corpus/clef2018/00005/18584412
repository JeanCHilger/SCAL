Gelatinase A (MM-2), gelatinase B (MMP-9) and their inhibitors (TIMP 1, TIMP-2) in serum of women with endometriosis: Significant correlation between MMP-2, MMP-9 and their inhibitors without difference in levels of matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases in relation to the severity of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a highly prevalent gynecological condition, where the formation of endometriotic foci is linked with locally increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that raised serum levels of MMPs might reflect the severity of endometriosis. We compared serum levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and of their tissue inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, in infertile women, matched for age and body mass index, with either mild (stage I, END-I n = 15) or severe endometriosis (stage IV, END-IV
