Association of cortactin, fascin-1 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in ovarian carcinomas: correlation with clinicopathological parameters. Cortactin, fascin-1 and EGFR are recognized as important factors in tumor progression. We tested the hypothesis that cortactin, fascin-1 and EGFR expression correlates with clinicopathological parameters of the four most common ovarian surface epithelial carcinomas--serous cystadenocarcinoma, mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, and clear cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of cortactin, fascin-1 and EGFR was performed using tissue microarrays of 172 specimens comprising 69 serous cystadenocarcinomas, 44 mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, 45 endometrioid adenocarcinomas and 14 clear cell carcinomas. All ovarian carcinomas showed significant expression of cortactin, fascin-1 and EGFR in staining intensity, tumor percentages and immunostaining scores. In addition, higher immunostaining scores of fascin-1 correlated with more advanced cancer stages (TNM), poorer histological differentiation and poorer survival rate of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. Similarly, higher immunostaining scores of cortactin correlated with T stages and histological differentiation of serous cystadenocarcinoma. The immunostaining scores of EGFR did not correlate with TNM stages, tumor differentiation or prognosis in the four ovarian surface epithelial carcinomas. Our findings suggest that cortactin and fascin-1 may serve as good biomarkers in evaluating aggressiveness of ovarian serous and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. And the pharmacological inhibitors of fascin-1 activity may slow down tumor progression and prolong survival time in patients with mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.
