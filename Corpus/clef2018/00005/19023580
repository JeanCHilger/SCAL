Cytokine and immune cell levels in peritoneal fluid and peripheral blood of women with early- and late-staged endometriosis. To investigate the level of cytokines and immune cells in the peripheral blood (PB) and peritoneal fluid (PF) of different stages of endometriosis.A prospective study was conducted to include 97 women with (n 60) and without (n 37) histopathologically confirmed endometriosis. Based on rASRM classification, stage I/II and stage III/IV were categorized as early-and late-staged endometriosis. Prior to surgery, 10 ml of blood was withdrawn from antecubital vein and serum was obtained. Aliquots were made and stored at -70 degrees C until assayed for cytokines. PF was aspirated from the pouch of Douglas. Peripheral and PF samples were analyzed by ELISA in terms of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-gamma. Determinations of T helper, T suppressor, NK, and B cells were assessed by using cluster determinant-3 (CD-3), CD4, CD8, CD25, CD28, CD45, CD16, CD23 and antibodies against early T cell activation antigens such as CD45RA/CD45RO, CD-69 and late activation antigens such as HLA-DR. A multiparameter flow cytometry was applied to detect the cell activation antigen expression.In terms of cytokine levels in PB and PF's of control group and early- and late-staged endometriosis cases, no significant difference was depicted in the cytokine levels (p > 0.05). Levels of immune cells did not differ between three groups (p > 0.05).The result of this study did not show any significant difference in PB and PF cytokine and lymphocyte subgroups between normal and early- and late-staged endometriosis.
