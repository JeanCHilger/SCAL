Differential diagnosis of gynecologic organ-related diseases in women presenting with ascites. Ascites is a pathologic accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity, and usually develops as a result of liver disease, congestive heart failure or nephrotic syndrome. Ascites is also a common manifestation of some gynecologic diseases. It is important that health care workers consider gynecologic problems among the potential differential diagnoses in patients presenting with ascites. Various kinds of ovarian diseases, such as epithelial ovarian cancer, benign ovarian fibroma, stromal hyperplasia, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, primary peritoneal serous carcinoma, endometriosis and peritoneal tuberculosis, should be kept in mind when women are found to have ascites.
