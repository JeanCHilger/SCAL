Nuclear factor kappaB pathway and interleukin-6 are affected in eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. In order to investigate the role of the nuclear factor kappaB (NFKB) pathway on gene expression in the eutopic endometrium in endometriosis, and in particular of interleukin-6 (IL6), we evaluated RELA, IkappaB kinase (CHUK), NFKBIA and IL6 expressions and NFKB DNA binding in eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis. Eutopic endometrium was obtained from 37 women with endometriosis and 42 fertile women during laparoscopy. We analysed RELA, CHUK, NFKBIA and IL6 mRNA levels (RT-PCR) RELA, CHUK and NFKBIA proteins and p-NFKBIA/NFKBIA ratio (western blot)
