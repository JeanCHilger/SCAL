The impact of previous danazol treatment on circulating hormone levels, follicular development and oocyte maturity in minimal-mild endometriosis. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of previous danazol treatment on peripheral endocrinology, folliculogenesis, oocyte maturity and follicular fluid endocrinology in women with minimal-mild endometriosis in a spontaneous menstrual cycle. A group of 10 women previously treated with danazol (Group A) and another group of 10 women whose endometriosis was left untreated (Group B) were studied. A group of 10 women with tubal infertility acted as a Control. Circulating hormone levels and characteristics of an endogenous luteinizing hormone (LH) surge were studied. A diagnostic laparoscopy was performed 32 h after the onset of an endogenous LH surge in all women to undertake follicular aspiration. There were no significant differences in oocyte maturity, fertilisation and cleavage rate among women studied in three study groups. The presence of peritoneal endometriosis did not affect the steroidogenic potential of the granulosa cells, and the endocrine milieu of the pre-ovulatory oocyte was comparable in all study groups.
