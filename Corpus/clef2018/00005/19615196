Expression of microRNAs in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. To analyze miRNA expression profile of endometrioid adenocarcinoma.Collect Endometrium was collected from cancer and park cancer tissue. And the total RNA was extracted. The microarray detection system was employed to analyze whether there was difference in microRNA expression between cancer tissue and park cancer tissue.A total of 111 differentially expressed miRNA were found, including 68 over-expression miRNA and 43 low-expression.MiRNA may play important roles in tumorigenesis of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The study of miRNA contributes to elucidate the molecular mechanism of endometrial cancer.
