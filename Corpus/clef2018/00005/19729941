Apoptosis in endometriosis. Apoptosis is a physiologic process that eradicates undesired cells without inducing an inflammatory reaction. It is an important regulator of eutopic endometrial function and evidence suggests that apoptosis aids in maintaining cellular homeostasis during the menstrual cycle by eliminating aging cells from the functional layer of the uterine endometrium. Endometriosis, which is characterized by the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, could result from increased cellular proliferation or decreased apoptosis in response to appropriate stimuli. Eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis has several differences compared with normal endometrium of women without endometriosis. These differences may contribute to the survival of regurgitated endometrial cells into the peritoneal cavity and thus to the development of endometriosis. In this article, we will summarize recent literature concerning apoptosis-related genes such as Bcl-2 and Fas, outline the molecular basis of apoptosis and review the literature focused on the alterations in regulation of apoptosis in eutopic and ectopic endometrium from women with endometriosis.
