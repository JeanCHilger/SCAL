Ureteral and vesical endometriosis. Two different clinical entities sharing the same pathogenesis. Ureteral or vesical endometriotic lesions affect about 1% of women with endometriosis. The diagnosis may be difficult when specific symptoms are lacking. A delay in diagnosis can lead to significant morbidity. An adequate comprehension of the circumstances in which ureteral and vesical endometriosis present or should be suspected, aided by advances in imaging techniques and laparoscopic surgery, may allow a significant progress in the treatment of these conditions. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of ureteral and vesical endometriosis are reviewed, with the aim of increasing the degree of awareness of the clinicians and helping in devising an adequate clinical management plan for the lesser understood aspects of the disease.
