Cervicovaginal cytology in uterine adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma. Comparison of cytologic and histologic findings. To investigate the diagnostic accuracy and to characterize the findings in false-negative cases, the results of cervicovaginal cytology in 56 adenocarcinomas and 25 adenosquamous carcinomas (42 cervical, 36 endometrial, 2 metastatic and 1 arising synchronously from both cervix and endometrium) were reviewed, including review of the actual slides in 56 cases. Overall, 80% of the initial cytologic diagnoses resulted in diagnostic curettage (i.e., cytology was effectively positive) 84% of the postreview diagnosis were effectively positive. Nine cytology slides showed no malignant cells
