Serum anti-PDIK1L autoantibody as a novel marker for endometriosis. To establish a novel serum marker for endometriosis, serum autoantibodies (autoAbs) were investigated using a proteomic approach.Retrospective study.Departments of Molecular Pathology and Obstetrics and Gynecology in Ehime University and University Hospital.Sixty-nine patients with endometriosis, 38 disease control patients without endometriosis, and 44 healthy volunteers.Autoantibodies in sera of endometriotic patients and healthy controls were investigated using a human fibroblast cell line, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting. Proteins in reacted spots were identified using MALDI time of flight mass spectrometry with MASCOT analysis. ELISAs were established using recombinant proteins, and autoAb-titers were estimated in sera of endometriotic patients and controls.Identification of serum autoAb useful for diagnosis of endometriosis.Several autoAbs were identified. ELISAs were established and serum autoAb titers were estimated. Among those identified, anti-PDIK1L-autoAb levels were significantly elevated in endometriotic patients. Sensitivity (59.4%) and accuracy (72.8%) of serum anti-PDIK1L-autoAb assay were better than those of serum CA125 levels (36.2% and 62.9%, respectively) in diagnosis of endometriosis. Additionally, anti-PDIK1L-autoAb could detect endometriotic patients in early stages.Serum anti-PDIK1L-autoAb can be a new serum marker for the diagnosis of endometriosis. This study validates further clinical evaluation of this novel marker.
