Abdominal wall endometrioma: a case report and review of the literature. Endometriosis is the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue that can respond to ovarian hormonal stimulation. Although it is uncommon, extrapelvic endometriosis can form a discrete mass known as an abdominal wall endometrioma. Endometriomas are thought to be caused by transfer of endometrial cells into a surgical wound, most often after a cesarean delivery. Endometriomas are diagnosed via ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration. Treatment options can be medical, but surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Perioperative nursing care includes patient teaching, taking steps to prevent surgical site infection and inadvertent hypothermia, ensuring availability of supplies (eg, the graft for abdominal wall repair if needed), and postoperative pain management.
