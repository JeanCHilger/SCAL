Genomic profile of endometrial tumors depends on morphological subtype, not on tamoxifen exposure. Tamoxifen has been a very effective treatment for breast cancer for several decades, however, at the same time increases the risk of endometrial cancer, especially after prolonged exposure. In addition, tamoxifen has been associated with a higher proportion of unfavorable uterine tumor subtypes (carcinosarcomas and serous adenocarcinomas) with worse survival. We investigated whether endometrial tumors, which developed after prolonged tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer, are genetically different from endometrial tumors without preceding tamoxifen exposure. Array CGH was used on archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded endometrial tumors to determine genomic aberrations. We compared the genomic profiles of 52 endometrial tumors from breast cancer patients after long-term (>or=2 years) tamoxifen use (endometrioid adenocarcinomas, n = 26 carcinosarcomas, n = 14
