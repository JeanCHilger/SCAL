Determination of glycodelin-A expression correlated to grading and staging in ovarian carcinoma tissue. Glycodelin is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 28 kDa. Due to its different glycosylation, several glycodelin molecules have been described, including glycodelin-A (amniotic fluid). The precise function of glycodelin is still not well understood, although immunosuppressive, contraceptive and marker of morphological differentiation roles have been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to assess the expression of glycodelin in malignant tumors of the ovary correlated to grading and staging.Paraffin sections of 187 ovarian cancer specimens (including 132 serous, 22 endometrioid, 17 mucinous, 12 clear cell and 4 borderline tumors) were analyzed with a monoclonal antibody GdA (MAb) and a peptide polyclonal antibody (PAb) against glycodelin. The intensity and distribution of the specific immunohistochemical staining reaction was evaluated by using a semi-quantitative method (immunoreactive score (IRS)).We identified significant changes in glycodelin-A expression corresponding to grading and staging. Analysis of glycodelin expression with the PAb did not result in significant differences. Glycodelin-A staining was significantly reduced in G2 carcinomas compared to G1 ovarian cancer tissue. Moreover, ovarian cancer of surgical stage FIGO III-IV demonstrated a significant lower glycodelin-A expression compared to FIGO I-II stage tumors.Glycodelin is a glycoprotein with immunosuppressive function. In particular, serous and endometrioid tumor tissue showed strong glycodelin-A expression. In addition, glycodelin expression is reduced in G2 and FIGO III-IV stages. Therefore, glycodelin also seems to be an important marker of morphological differentiation in ovarian cancer. The use of glycodelin as a tumor marker in ovarian carcinomas is currently under investigation.
