The peritoneal leptin, MCP-1 and TNF-α in the pathogenesis of endometriosis-associated infertility. To explore the roles of leptin, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the peritoneal fluid (PF) in the pathogenesis of endometriosis-associated infertility.Leptin, MCP-1, and TNF-α levels in the PF from 28 infertile women with endometriosis (study group), 23 women with fallopian-associated infertility (controls), and 24 women with myoma (controls) were determined by performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Leptin and TNF-α levels in the PF showed no significant difference among three groups. The MCP-1 level in patients with endometriosis was higher than those in fallopian-associated infertility group and myoma group (P < 0.01). There was a positive correlation between leptin and MCP-1 levels in the PF of patients with endometriosis (P < 0.05).Peritoneal leptin and MCP-1 play important roles in the pathogenesis of infertility in the early stage of endometriosis.
