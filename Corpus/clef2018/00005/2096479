Steroid receptors in the gestagen treatment of endometriosis. In 35 patients with laparoscopically proved endometriosis we determined the cytosolic estrogen and progesterone receptor content in endometrial samples before and after a 3-month course of progestagen treatment (DCC method). Dienogest was given in 20 cases, norethisterone in an other group of 15 patients. Compared with a normal group the receptor content was clearly higher in endometriosis patients. It correlated closely to the histological findings dated according to Noyes. In more than 60% of the pretherapeutic cycles there were some signs of disturbed differentiation. After 3 month of therapy the binding capacity of steroid receptors significantly decreased, particularly in norethisterone patients. Both clinical results and receptor conditions correspond to previous investigations concerning the competition behaviour, having confirmed different binding affinity to the receptor for the two gestagens here tested.
