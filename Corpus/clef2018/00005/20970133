In vitro effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ligands on gene expression in lipopolysaccharide-induced endometrial and endometriotic stromal cells. This in vitro study demonstrates the comparative anti-inflammatory effects of rosiglitazone and 15d-PGJ(2) in endometriosis and provides evidence for exploitation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ as a therapeutic target.
