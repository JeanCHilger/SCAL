Increased immunoreactivity to SLIT/ROBO1 and its correlation with severity of dysmenorrhea in adenomyosis. Compared with normal endometrium, SLIT expression was statistically significantly higher in ectopic endometrium from women with adenomyosis, while roundabout 1 (ROBO1) immunoreactivity and microvessel density (MVD) level were statistically significantly higher in both eutopic and ectopic endometrium than normal endometrium. Both SLIT immunoreactivity in ectopic endometrium and MVD in eutopic endometrium were positively correlated with the severity of dysmenorrhea and found to be significant predicators for dysmenorrhea severity in women with adenomyosis.
