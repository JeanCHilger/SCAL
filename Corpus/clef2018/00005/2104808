Long-term suppression of ovarian function by a luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone agonist implant in patients with endometriosis. Ten endometriosis patients received luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonist (buserelin) implant injections (6.6 mg subcutaneously) at days 0, 42, 84 and 126. Serum LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were lowered by day 14. Luteinizing hormone remained at basal concentrations while FSH returned to values in the low-normal range of the menstrual cycle by day 35. At the end of the luteal phase during which treatment commenced, estrone and pregnanediol declined and remained at postmenopausal or early follicular phase values until days 305 to 460. Time to first ovulation ranged from 321 to 481 days after starting treatment. After the initial menstruation, only three instances of bleeding occurred during treatment. Pelvic pain was relieved or markedly reduced by day 42 and remained absent throughout the period of ovarian suppression. These results indicate the potential of a long-acting LH-RH agonist implant to form the basis for the treatment of symptomatic endometriosis.
