Antiproliferative effects of cannabinoid agonists on deep infiltrating endometriosis. Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is characterized by chronic pain, hyperproliferation of endometriotic cells and fibrosis. Since cannabinoids are endowed with antiproliferative and antifibrotic properties, in addition to their psychogenic and analgesic effects, cannabinoid agonists have been evaluated in DIE both in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro effects of the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55212-2 were evaluated on primary endometriotic and endometrial stromal and epithelial cell lines extracted from patients with or without DIE. Cell proliferation was determined by thymidine incorporation and production of reactive oxygen species by spectrofluorometry. ERK and Akt pathways were studied by immunoblotting. Immunoblotting of α-smooth muscle actin was studied as evidence of myofibroblastic transformation. The in vivo effects of WIN 55212-2 were evaluated on Nude mice implanted with human deep infiltrating endometriotic nodules. The in vitro treatment of stromal endometriotic cells by WIN 55212-2 decreased cell proliferation, reactive oxygen species production, and α-smooth muscle actin expression. The decrease in cell proliferation induced by WIN 55212-2 was not associated with a decrease in ERK activation, but was associated with the inhibition of Akt activation. WIN 55212-2 abrogated the growth of endometriotic tissue implanted in Nude mice. Cannabinoid agonists exert anti-proliferative effects on stromal endometriotic cells linked to the inhibition of the Akt pathway. These beneficial effects of cannabinoid agonists on DIE have been confirmed in vivo.
