Preoperative administration of Planovar® in two cases of abdominal wall endometriosis after cesarean section. We describe 2 cases of abdominal wall endometriosis, a condition that usually occurs in surgical scars from previous cesarean sections and presents as a mass with cyclic pain and swelling. Wide local excision with clear margins seems to be the only effective treatment. However, the mass in our 2 cases changed in size with menstruation, and palpating the masses was sometimes difficult. Therefore, we administered an oral contraceptive containing a combination of estrogen and progesterone (Planovar®) preoperatively to each patient so that the endometrial mass could be reliably palpated on the day of operation. The mass was excised cleanly in each case.
