Molecular biological features of ectopic and eutopic endometrium in genital endometriosis. The molecular biological features of the eutopic and ectopic endometrium were studied in 46 patients with adenomyosis, 44 with endometrioid cysts in the ovaries, and 34 with disseminated mixed forms of genital endometriosis. Reproductive-aged patients with the eutopic endometrium in a proliferation phase with hyperplastic or inflammatory changes were selected. Ten samples of the endometrium in a phase proliferation, which had been obtained at medicolegal autopsy of women without reproductive disorders, were studied as a control group. Both the glandular and stromal components of the ectopic and eutopic endometrium in different forms of endometriosis were shown to differ from the intact endometrium in their molecular biological features (the expression of Ki-67, Bcl-2, Bax, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta1, matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 10, matrix metalloproteinase-2 inhibitor, the enzyme cytochrome P450 aromatase.
