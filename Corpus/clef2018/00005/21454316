Urocortin 2 and urocortin 3 in endometriosis: evidence for a possible role in inflammatory response. Urocortin 2 (Ucn 2) and urocortin 3 (Ucn 3) are neuropeptides expressed by human endometrium. This study evaluated (i) the expression of Ucn 2 and Ucn 3 mRNA in endometriotic lesions and in endometrium of women with endometriosis (ii) the effect of Ucn 2 and Ucn 3 on cytokines secretion from cultured endometrial stromal cells. Endometriotic tissue was collected from endometrioma (n=39)
