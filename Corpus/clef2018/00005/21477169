Association of the interferon-γ gene (CA)n repeat polymorphism with endometriosis. To investigate whether the interferon-γ (IFN-γ) gene (CA)(n) repeat polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to endometriosis.Case-control study.University Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.Women with (n = 622) and without (n = 442) endometriosis.Genotyping was performed by fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene-scan analysis.Genotype distribution and allele frequency of the dinucleotide (CA)(n) repeat polymorphism in the IFN-γ gene.Seven alleles (12-18 repeats) of the IFN-γ gene (CA)(n) repeat polymorphism were found. In both patients with endometriosis and controls the most common allele was composed of 13 repeats, followed by an allele of 15 repeats, and then by an allele of 12 repeats. Patients with endometriosis had a significantly higher incidence of genotypes with alleles composed of fewer repeats (12-13 repeats), compared with the controls (92.0 versus 84.4%, respectively, P < 001).Our results suggest that the (CA)(n) repeat polymorphism in the IFN-γ gene may be associated with a risk of endometriosis in the South Korean population.
