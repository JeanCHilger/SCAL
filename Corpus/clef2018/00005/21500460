Medical treatment of endometriosis. An update. Endometriosis is a major health problem, because of difficult diagnosis and limited therapies available. The surgical approach is done by very specialised surgeons, doing classical or laparoscopic ablative interventions. This article is an up-to date evaluation of medical treatment, reviewing the hormonal drugs (contraceptives, progestatives, GnRH analogues) and non-hormonal ones (anti-aromatase, anti-progestative, anti-tissular growth factors). The conclusion is that the medical treatment should be used in well selected cases, and adapted regimens, choosing among continuous contraceptives, intrauterine devices with levonorgestrel, or aromatase inhibitors. The main objective in this cases is rarely the complete cure, but more frequently optimal timing before surgery.
