Quantitative analysis of SLC34A2 expression in different types of ovarian tumors. The main purpose of this study was to estimate the SLC34A2 gene expression in normal ovary and different types of ovarian tumors.We have investigated SLC34A2 gene expression level in papillary serous, endometrioid, unspecified adenocarcinomas, benign tumors, and normal ovarian tissues using real-time PCR analysis. Differences in gene expression were calculated as fold changes in gene expression in ovarian carcinomas and benign tumors compared to normal ovary.We have found that SLC34A2 gene was highly expressed in well-differentiated endometrioid and papillary serous ovarian carcinomas compared to low-differentiated endometrioid carcinomas, benign serous cystoadenomas and normal ovary. Analysis of SLC34A2 gene expression according to tumor differentiation level (poor- and well-differentiated) showed that SLC34A2 is up-regulated in well differentiated tumors.Upregulation of SLC34A2 gene expression in well-differentiated tumors may reflect cell differentiation processes during ovarian cancerogenesis and could serve as potential marker for ovarian cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
