Effects on in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer outcomes of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, -2 and -3 in eutopic endometrial tissue of women with endometriosis.  This study was performed to assess the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, -2 and -3 mRNA in eutopic endometrial tissue and their effects on in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) outcomes in women with endometriosis.Twenty women with endometriosis III or IV (study group) and 20 with tubal infertility only (control group) were evaluated. Controlled ovarian stimulation in all patients consisted of the long protocol using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist. Prior to the administration of 0.1 mg triptorelin daily in the mid-luteal phase of the preceding menstrual cycle, a biopsy specimen was taken from the endometrial cavity, and the expression levels of VEGFR-1, -2 and -3 mRNA were analyzed with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.There were no significant differences in the numbers of retrieved oocytes and mature oocytes, fertilization rate and clinical pregnancy rate between the study and control groups. However, the implantation rate was significantly lower in the study group (P < 0.05). The relative amounts of VEGFR-1, -2 and -3 mRNA were significantly higher in the study group than in the control group (P < 0.001 each). The relative amounts of VEGFR-1 and -3 mRNA were significantly higher in the non-pregnant than in the pregnant subgroup of the study group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively).Increased expression of VEGFR in the endometrium, especially VEGFR-1 and -3, may be related to the development of endometriosis and may reduce the receptivity of the endometrium.
