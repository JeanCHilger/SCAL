Expression and localization of CXCL16 and CXCR6 in ovarian endometriotic tissues. Inflammatory mediators, including chemokines, may play crucial roles in the development of endometriosis. Therefore, we investigated the expression and localization of CXCL16 and its receptor, CXCR6, in ovarian endometriotic tissues. We also examined whether CXCL16 induces IL-8 production in endometriotic stromal cells.We performed immunohistochemical and Western blotting analyses of in vivo and in vitro samples. IL-8 production was assayed using an ELISA.Both CXCL16 and CXCR6 were expressed by endometriotic epithelial cells and stromal cells, but not normal ovarian stroma. A Western blotting analysis using primary cultured endometriotic stromal cells showed a constant expression of CXCL16 and CXCR6 in the proliferative phase, secretory phase and during gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy. CXCL16 induced IL-8 production in several endometriotic stromal cells in vitro.CXCL16 and CXCR6 might be involved in the pathophysiology of endometriosis through regulation of the inflammatory response.
