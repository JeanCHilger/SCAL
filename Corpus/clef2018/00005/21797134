Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the endometrium: a case report. Primary endometrial squamous cell carcinoma (PSECC) is a rare neoplasm. Squamous epithelium derived from endometrioid cancer or from cervical squamous cell carcinoma. The prevalence is about 0.1%. The genesis, histogenesis and biological behavior are unknown.A 48-year old woman in postmenopause, referring pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasound showed a bulky uterus with the endometrium containing an hyperecogenic area. Endometrial biopsy found an epidermoid carcinoma. MRI showed a 4 x 2 x 1.2 cm mass occupying the uterine cavity. The patient underwent radical treatment. Pathological examination showed features of PSECC. The mutation of p53 tumor suppressor protein was disclosed in 15% of neoplastic cells. PCR revealed the absence of HPV DNA.The findings of our case move us to underline that the pathogenesis of this tumor is still unclear. Moreover, preoperative diagnosis and staging of PESCC is extremely difficult. Most patients do not show characteristic symptoms and predisposing factors, making it almost impossible to diagnose the precise localization of tumor origin.
