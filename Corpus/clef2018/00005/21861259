Catamenial pneumothorax, clinical manifestations--a multidisciplinary challenge. Pleural endometriosis is a rare condition. Spontaneous, recurring pneumothorax occurring during menstruation, referred to as catamenial pneumothorax, is associated with pleural endometriosis. A multidisciplinary approach is needed for a successful result.During the last five years (2005-2010), we have treated six patients with menstruation related pneumothorax at Oslo University Hospital. The surgical treatment was performed by the thoracic surgery department but the medical follow-up was carried out by the gynecological and pulmonary medicine departments.We report three of the patients treated. All three patients were premenopausal, aged 19-36, and had recurring, menstruation related, spontaneous pneumothorax, predominantly on the right side. The condition was treated by various surgical approaches, including chest tube drainage, video assisted thoracic surgery, chemical pleurodeses and thoracotomy.Spontaneous, recurring pneumothorax in women with no previous history of endometriosis can be the first manifestation of pleural endometriosis. The disorder requires surgical intervention, but early diagnosis and postoperative hormonal therapy are just as important for a successful outcome.
