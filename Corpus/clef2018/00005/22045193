Role of histological type on surgical outcome and survival following radical primary tumour debulking of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancers. To assess the clinical impact of the two histological types as designated in the proposed model for ovarian tumourigenesis in primary epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer (EOC) patients.All consecutive EOC patients (n=632) after primary tumour debulking in our institution (09/2000-08/2010) were classified into one of two groups: type I tumours (n=100 15.8%) composed of low-grade serous, low-grade endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous and transitional carcinomasType II patients had a significantly higher incidence of advanced disease (FIGO III/IV) than Type I patients (79.8% vs 38%, respectively P<0.001). Median CA125 values (438 vs 93 U ml(-1)Type I EOC patients appear to present at earlier stages have significantly higher survival and more optimal surgical outcome compared with type II patients. However, in advanced stages, histology loses significance as an independent prognosticator.
