Laser capture microdissection with genome-wide expression profiling displayed gene expression signatures in endometrioid endometrial cancer. This research determined genes contributing to the pathogenesis of endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC). Eight pairs of microdissected EEC samples matched with normal glandular epithelium were analyzed using microarray. Unsupervised analysis identified 162 transcripts (58 up- and 104 down-regulated) that were differentially expressed (p < .01, fold change â‰¥ 1.5) between both groups. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) validated the genes of interest: SLC7A5, SATB1, H19, and ZAK (p < .05). Pathway analysis revealed genes involved in acid amino transport, translation, and chromatin remodeling (p < .05). Laser capture microdissection (LCM) followed by microarray enabled precise assessment of homogeneous cell population and identified putative genes for endometrial carcinogenesis.
