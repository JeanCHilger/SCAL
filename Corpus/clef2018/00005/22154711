Ovarian failure and polycystic ovary syndrome. The human ovary is commonly the target of an autoimmune attack leading to the ovarian dysfunction which can be manifested as premature ovarian failure (POF), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), unexplained infertility as well as endometriosis. In case of POF, the evidence for an autoimmune etiology is based on the presence of lymphocytic oophoritis, autoantibodies to ovarian antigens and association with other autoimmune disorders, which was clearly documented in many studies. The search for antiovarian antibodies has been undertaken in numerous studies, especially in patients with POF, however their results are still conflicting particularly due to difference in laboratory methods as well as many ovarian components being potential antigens. On the other side the autoimmune etiology of PCOS is still debated and was documented in some cases. Association of PCOS with non-organ specific autoimmune disorders is controversial however association with autoimmune thyroid disease was well demonstrated in some studies.
