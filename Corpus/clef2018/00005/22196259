Laparoscopic extramucosal partial bladder resection in a patient with symptomatic deep-infiltrating endometriosis of the bladder. Endometriosis is a complex disease, affecting the urinary tract, mainly the bladder, in 1% to 2% of cases. Thus far, partial cystectomy has been the treatment of choice for long-term relief of symptoms. Here, we describe the case of a 26-year-old patient with deep-infiltrating bladder endometriosis who was completely cured by laparoscopic extramucosal bladder resection. Diagnostic standards and factors affecting the rate of success for this additional option in endometriosis surgery are discussed.
