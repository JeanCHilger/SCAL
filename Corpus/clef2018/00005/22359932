The role of innate immunity system in the course of adenomyosis. The investigation of leukocytic elastase (LE) and alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha1-PI) from patients with different stage adenomyosis and in control group was found activation innate immunity system in all the patients with adenomyosis. The degree of LE activity is a prevalence rate of adenomyosis. The degree of alpha1-PI activity is correlated with antiproteolytic potential that blocks the effects shown by LE. It can lead the prognose of disease and timely treatment.
