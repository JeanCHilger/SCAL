Association between endometriosis and polymorphisms in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), TRAIL receptor and osteoprotegerin genes and their serum levels. To evaluate the relationship between endometriosis and polymorphisms in the genes encoding tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), TRAIL receptor (DR) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) and their serum levels in Korean women.A case-control study was conducted with 138 women with endometriosis and 214 women without endometriosis in academic medical center. TRAIL c.49G>A, c.592A>G, c.615A>G, and c.662T>C DR4 c.626G>C and c.1322A>GThe TRAIL c.49G>A, c.615A>G, and c.662T>C the DR4 c.626G>CEndometriosis is associated with circulating TRAIL and OPG levels in Korean women but not with the TRAIL, DR, and OPG polymorphisms.
