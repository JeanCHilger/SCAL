Vascular endothelial growth factor gene polymorphisms and endometriosis risk: a meta-analysis. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene polymorphism has been reported to be associated with endometriosis risk. The purpose of the present study was to perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to explore whether VEGF gene polymorphisms confer risk to endometriosis.By searching PubMed and EMBASE databases, a total of 11 studies were identified. Crude odds ratio (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for VEGF gene polymorphisms and endometriosis risk were calculated.An association of VEGF gene +936TC polymorphism with endometriosis was found (Fixed-effect model: TT + TC vs. CC: OR 1.184, 95% CI 1.027-1.366, P = 0.020 TC vs. CC: OR 1.187, 95% CI 1.024-1.375, P = 0.023. Random-effect model: TT + TC vs. CC: OR 1.203, 95% CI 1.003-1.443, P = 0.046Our results indicate that VEGF +936TC gene polymorphism is a risk factor for endometriosis, and not -460CT, +405CG, -2578AC, -1154GA.
