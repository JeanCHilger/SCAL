Gallbladder and muscular endometriosis: a case report. A 55-year-old woman referred to Radiology Department, with abdominal mass and chronic indefinite and vague abdominal pain, most severe in right hypochondrium and accentuated during menstruation. A history of two cesarean sections was revealed. The patient underwent an ultrasound and Computed Tomography with intravenous contrast media revealing the presence of gallbladder and abdominal wall hyperenhancing masses. Finally, Magnetic Resonance study with intravenous administration of paramagnetic contrast media confirmed the involvement of gallbladder by a solid tissue and the presence of a solid nodule on the abdominal wall. Considering imaging features and the contrast enhancement of the nodules, the patient was sent to surgery. Surgical removal of both gallbladder and abdominal solid implant was performed and histology confirmed the diagnosis of gallbladder and abdominal wall endometriosis.
