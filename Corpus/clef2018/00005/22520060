Expression of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in endometriosis: a tissue microarray study. The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) is thought to be involved in non-genomic estrogen responses as well as processes such as cell proliferation and migration. In this study, we analyzed GPER expression patterns from endometriosis samples and normal endometrial tissue samples and compared these expression profiles to those of the classical sex hormone receptors.A tissue microarray, which included 74 samples from different types of endometriosis (27 ovarian, 19 peritoneal and 28 deep-infiltrating) and 30 samples from normal endometrial tissue, was used to compare the expression levels of the GPER, estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, ER-beta and progesterone receptor (PR). The immunoreactive score (IRS) was calculated separately for epithelium and stroma as the product of the staining intensity and the percentage of positive cells. The expression levels of the hormonal receptors were dichotomized into low (IRS < 6) and high (IRS > = 6) expression groups.The mean epithelial IRS (+/- standard deviation, range) of cytoplasmic GPER expression was 1.2 (+/- 1.7, 0-4) in normal endometrium and 5.1 (+/- 3.5, 0-12) in endometriosis (p < 0.001), of nuclear GPER 6.4 (+/- 2.6, 0-12) and 6.8 (+/- 2.9, 2-12 p = 0.71), of ER-alpha 10.6 (+/- 2.4, 3-12) and 9.8 (+/- 3.0, 2-12The present data indicate a unique GPER expression pattern in endometriosis, especially in endometriomas as compared to the normal endometrium. The overexpression of GPER in endometriotic lesions suggests a potential role for GPER in the hormonal regulation of endometriosis, which should be taken into consideration for future hormonal treatment strategies.
