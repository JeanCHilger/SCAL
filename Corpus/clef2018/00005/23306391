Fatty acid synthase is a potential therapeutic target in estrogen receptor-/progesterone receptor-positive endometrioid endometrial cancer. In the current study we investigated the clinicopathological significance of fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression and its relationship with estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) in endometrioid endometrial cancer.FASN expression in endometrioid endometrial cancer was assessed by immunohistochemistry using 108 paraffin-embedded tissue specimens and clinical data collected from a retrospective chart review. The specific FASN inhibitor C75 was used to analyze the relationship between FASN expression and cell growth as well as ER/PR expression in endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines.Positive FASN immunostaining was observed in 77.8% (84/108) of the tumors analyzed. Deep myometrial invasion was significantly and inversely correlated with positive FASN expression (p = 0.024). Positive ER (p = 0.018) and PR status (p = 0.012) was significantly correlated with positive FASN expression. Patients with positive FASN expression in endometrioid endometrial cancer tissues tended to have a favorable progression-free/overall survival (p = 0.127 and p = 0.087, respectively). Ishikawa cells with high FASN expression also showed high expression of ER/PR, while HEC1B cells had low expression levels of both FASN and ER/PR. FASN inhibition by C75 (10 ÂµM) significantly reduced ER/PR expression compared with control dimethyl sulfoxide treatment of Ishikawa cells. The growth of Ishikawa cells having positive FASN and ER/PR expression was significantly inhibited in the presence of C75 or FASN small-interfering RNA compared to HEC1B cells that lacked FASN and ER/PR expression.The current findings suggest that there may be cross talk between the ER/PR and FASN signaling pathways that modulate ER/PR activation and could play a role in endometrioid endometrial cancer pathogenesis.
