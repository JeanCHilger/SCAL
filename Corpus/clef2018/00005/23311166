Magnetic resonance characteristics of endometriosis rat model. To establish a non-invasive, repeatable and dynamic study method in endometriosis rat model using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in order to explore the magnetic resonance characteristics of the model.Endometrium tissues were transplanted into left abdominal walls of unmated adult female SD rats. After surgery, pathological changes were observed and MRI scanning was made for the ectopic lesions.The endometriosis rat model was successfully established and the ectopic lesions imaged strong hyperintense on DWI, hypointense on T1WI, hyperintense on T2WI with a clear border, without enhancement on CE-T1 WI.The lesions can be clearly observed in the MRI images on the endometriosis rat model established by this method, which facilitates repeat experiments and continuous observation studies.
