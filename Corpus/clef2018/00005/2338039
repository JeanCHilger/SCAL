Cytology of nonneoplastic cysts of the ovary. From March 1986 through September 1988, cytologic material from 13 nonneoplastic ovarian cysts collected at the time of surgical removal of the ovary was compared with the histologic follow-up of these lesions in an attempt to characterize the cytologic features of benign ovarian cysts. In 22 additional nonneoplastic cysts, cellular material was obtained by the clinician with fine-needle aspiration. The 32 patients ranged in age from 18 to 64 yr (mean, 36.8 median, 35.5)
