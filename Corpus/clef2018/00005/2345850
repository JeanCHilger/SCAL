Clinical forms of genital endometriosis (excluding sterility). Genital endometriosis is divided into: (1) uterine endometriosis (adenomyosis) and (2) external endometriosis which may be intraperitoneal (ovaries, Fallopian tubes, peritoneum) or extraperitoneal (cervix, vagina, rectovaginal septum, vulva, perineum and inguinal ligament). Each of these forms of endometriosis has its own symptoms which depend on its location.
