Expression of adiponectin, leptin, and their receptors in ovarian endometrioma. To evaluate the expression of leptin, leptin receptor (ObR), adiponectin, and adiponectin receptor (AdipoR) in ovarian endometriomas compared with normal endometrium, and to analyze relationships among adipokines and their receptors.Experimental study.A clinic for the treatment of endometriosis and basic research laboratories.Forty-four women with endometriosis and 42 age-matched women with no laparoscopic evidence of endometriosis as control subjects.Endometrial tissue samples were obtained during laparoscopic surgery.Immunohistochemical staining for leptin, ObR, adiponectin, and AdipoR was performed with the use of tissue microarray. Clinical characteristics were reviewed from the patient's medical records. The effect of leptin on the expression of adiponectin was evaluated in endometriotic cell line using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.Positive expression rates of leptin and ObR were significantly higher in ovarian endometrioma compared with normal endometrium, but those of adiponectin and AdipoR were similar (ovarian endometrioma vs. normal endometrium, respectively: leptin 100% vs. 59.5% ObR 72.7% vs. 33.3%These data suggest that leptin and its receptor are induced in ovarian endometriomas, and that the leptin/ObR system regulates adiponectin gene expression in endometriotic cells.
