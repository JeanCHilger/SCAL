Prognostic significance and diagnostic value of PTEN and p53 expression in endometrial carcinoma. A retrospective clinicopathological and immunohistochemical study. To investigate the PTEN and p53 gene expression in endometrioid and serous papillary endometrial carcinomas and clarify their prognostic significance by studying the PTEN and p53 expression in relation to tumor stage and grade.Archival pathological sections of 61 cases with endometrial cancer examined in a 5-year-period (January 2006-December 2010) were retrieved and re-examined. Immunohistochemical investigation was performed by the Ventana system. Anti-PTEN and anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies were used. Disease staging was made according to the FIGO staging system.Forty-nine (80.32%) cases were endometrioid adenocarcinomas. Patient age ranged from 39-75 years (mean 62.5). Grade 1 tumors:19/22 (86.3%) cases had stage Ib, 2/22 (9.09%) stage Ic and 1/22 (4.54%) stage IIIc. Eighteen of 22 (81.8%) cases were PTEN positive and 4/22 (18.2%) p53 positive. Grade 2 tumors: 17/ 23 (73.91%) cases had stage I b, 4/23 (17.39%) stage Ic and 2/23 (8.69%) stage IIIc. Seventeen of 23 (73.91%) cases were PTEN positive and 47sol23 (17.3%) p53 positive. Grade 3 tumors: 2/4 (50%) cases had stage Ic and 2/4 (50%) stage IIIc. No case was PTEN positive and 2/4 (50%) were p53 positive. Twelve (19.35%) cases were serous papillary carcinomas. Patient age ranged from 63-79 years (mean 76). Five (41.66%) cases had stage Ic and 5 (41.66%) stage IIIc, with nodal metastases and peritoneal involvement. Two (16.66%) cases developed on endometrial polyps with minimal myometrial involvement (stage Ib) and in both cases elements of endometrioid adenocarcinoma were observed as well. Immunohistochemical study showed that 11 (91.66%) cases were p53 positive and 2 (16.66%) PTEN positive.PTEN and p53 immunoexpression helps both in accurate diagnosis and proper therapeutic approach of the various endometrial carcinomas. PTEN and p53 are also prognostic markers for these kind of tumors.
