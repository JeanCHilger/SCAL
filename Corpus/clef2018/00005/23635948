A nonsynonymous variant of IL1A is associated with endometriosis in Japanese population. Our previous genome-wide association study has demonstrated that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in intronic and downstream regions of IL1A (interleukin 1α) were associated with the risk of endometriosis. These SNPs on the genome-wide association study platform could be only surrogates for the true causal variant. Thus, we resequenced all the exons of IL1A in 377 patients with endometriosis and 457 healthy controls. We detected seven rare variants (minor allele frequency <0.01) and four common variants. All the rare variants were not associated with endometriosis. The four common variants (rs17561, rs1304037, rs2856836 and rs3783553) in IL1A were significantly associated with endometriosis (P=0.0024, 0.0024, 0.0014 and 0.0061, respectively). All the four SNPs were within a linkage disequilibrium block. Among them, only rs17561 was nonsynonymous (p.A114S), which has been reported to be associated with susceptibility to ovarian cancer. Taken together, we examined association between rs17561 and endometriosis in an independent validation data set (524 patients and 533 healthy controls) replicating significant association (P=4.0 × 10(-5) odds ratio (OR), 1.91
