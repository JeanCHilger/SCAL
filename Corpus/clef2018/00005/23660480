Iatrogenic endometriosis during reproductive age: main issues?. Among endometriotic lesions a small proportion is secondary to various medical activities, and may be considered as iatrogenic. Any medical or surgical procedure increasing the menstrual flow or the retrograde flow bears a potential risk: conization, hydrotubation or copper intra-uterine device. Surgical procedures, by laparotomy or laparoscopic approach, are able to favor transport and cutaneous seeding of endometrial tissue, especially when a hysterotomy has been performed. Diagnosis and treatment of these lesions are today standardized. Few preventive measures are available, besides adequate surgical procedure, but none has been properly evaluated, mainly because these lesions are not frequent.
