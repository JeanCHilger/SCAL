Colonic obstruction as an unusual presentation of endometrioma: a case report. Endometriosis usually occurs in the pelvis but can be found nearly anywhere in the body. Bowel involvement in endometriosis is uncommon and it is estimated to be present in 3.7% to 35% of women with endometriosis. It can rarely result in intestinal obstruction. Here, we present a synchronous localization of endometriosis, ovarian and intestinal, resulting in chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and colonic obstruction in a 33-year-old woman.
