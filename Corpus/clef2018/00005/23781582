The correlation between expression of synuclein-gamma, glucose transporter-1, and survival outcomes in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. To evaluate the correlation between immunohistochemical expression of synuclein-gamma, glucose transporter-1, and survival outcomes in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma.A tissue microarray was constructed using formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tissue that included 23 early and 18 advanced cases. The intensity and area of the immunohistochemical reactions were evaluated using the semi-quantitative scoring system.Synuclein-y expression was higher in the advanced stage, although it was not statistically significant (p = 0.51). Glucose transporter-1 was overexpressed in the advanced stage (p = 0.01). Synuclein-gamma (score = 0 vs > 0) and glucose transporter-1 (score < or = 7 vs > 7) did not show any differences in overall survival (p = 0.54, p = 0.48) and disease-free survival (p = 0.61, p = 0.14).In this study the expression of synuclein-y and glucose transporter-1 were not considered to be a prognostic factor and were not related with survival outcomes in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma.
