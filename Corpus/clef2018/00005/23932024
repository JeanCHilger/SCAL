The steps of the technique and the role of PlasmaJet are emphasized. The surgical technique report using anonymous patients is exempt from ethical approval by the IRB.The patient's outcome was uneventful, and colorectal complaints were completely relieved one week after surgery. Since November 2012, we have employed this technique in 18 patients, with only favorable outcomes.The technique described in this video article may represent a step toward a more complete removal of endometriotic implants and better colorectal outcomes.
