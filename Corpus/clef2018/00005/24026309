Is a positive family history of endometriosis a risk factor for endometrioma recurrence after laparoscopic surgery? A total of 148 patients were followed up for an average of 30.1 Â± 17 months following to laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometriomas by a single surgical team. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to investigate the association between endometrioma recurrence and several factors, age, body mass index, family history, cyst diameter, number and location, adhesions or peritoneal implants, occurrence of spillage, postoperative treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, or pregnancies. The overall recurrence rate of the endometriomas was 18.2%. At bivariate analysis, recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with a positive family history of endometriosis (40% vs 14.8%). Recurrence was also more frequent, albeit nonsignificantly, in patients with a history of dysmenorrhea, intraoperative spillage, and postoperative hormonal suppression. At multivariate analysis with logistic regression, a positive family history of endometriosis was the only variable independently associated with endometrioma recurrence following laparoscopic removal (odds ratio 3.245 95% confidence interval: 1.090-9.661).
