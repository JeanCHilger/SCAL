Immunohistochemical study of amylase in common epithelial tumors of the ovary. Cellular localization of amylase in various ovarian tumors was studied by the immunoperoxidase method using an antibody to human pancreatic amylase. Amylase was present in eight of 34 serous carcinomas and eight of 27 endometrioid carcinomas. However, only in one poorly differentiated serous carcinoma and two well-differentiated endometrioid carcinomas were a large number of amylase-reactive cells found. Five benign and three borderline serous tumors contained no amylase. Also, amylase was not detected in any of 34 mucinous tumors or five malignant clear cell tumors. The results obtained suggest that amylase will be a useful tumor marker, when present, for follow-up of endometrioid and serous carcinomas of the ovary.
