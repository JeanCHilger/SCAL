Serum HE4 as a prognostic marker in endometrial cancer--a population based study. HE4 has emerged as a promising biomarker in gynaecological oncology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate serum HE4 as a biomarker for high-risk phenotypes in a population-based endometrial cancer cohort.Peri-operative serum HE4 and CA125 were measured in 373 patients identified from the prospective Australian National Endometrial Cancer Study (ANECS). HE4 and CA125 were quantified on the ARCHITECT instrument in a clinically accredited laboratory. Receiver operator curves (ROC), Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and chi-squared and Mann-Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox multivariate regression analyses.Median CA125 and HE4 levels were higher in stage III and IV tumours (p<0.001) and in tumours with outer-half myometrial invasion (p<0.001). ROC analysis demonstrated that HE4 (area under the curve (AUC)=0.76) was a better predictor of outer-half myometrial invasion than CA125 (AUC=0.65), particularly in patients with low-grade endometrioid tumours (AUC 0.77 vs 0.64 for CA125). Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that elevated HE4 was an independent predictor of recurrence-free survival (HR=2.40, 95% CI 1.19-4.83, p=0.014) after adjusting for stage and grade of disease, particularly in the endometrioid subtype (HR=2.86, 95% CI 1.25-6.51, p=0.012).These findings demonstrate the utility of serum HE4 as a prognostic biomarker in endometrial cancer in a large, population-based study. In particular they highlight the utility of HE4 for pre-operative risk stratification to identify high-risk patients within low-grade endometrioid endometrial cancer patients who might benefit from lymphadenectomy.
