CA-125 levels in endometriosis. CA-125 is a cellular antigen detected in many patients with ovarian cancer, but it has also been detected in patients with endometriosis. Preoperative CA-125 levels were drawn from 113 patients before they underwent laparoscopy. Patients were categorized into diagnostic groups on the basis of pathologic findings. CA-125 levels in patients with evidence of intraabdominal adhesions were not statistically different from those in patients with normal pelvic anatomy. However, patients with advanced endometriosis had significantly elevated levels of CA-125 when compared with patients with normal pelvic anatomy (P less than 0.05). The clinical and immunologic implications of elevated CA-125 levels in patients with advanced endometriosis are discussed.
