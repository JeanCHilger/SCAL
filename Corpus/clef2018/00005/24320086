Resveratrol suppresses inflammatory responses in endometrial stromal cells derived from endometriosis: a possible role of the sirtuin 1 pathway. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) plays a role in regulation of inflammation. The role of SIRT1 in endometriosis remains unknown. We here addressed the anti-inflammatory effects of SIRT1 on endometriosis.The expression of SIRT1 in human ovarian endometriomas and eutopic endometria were examined using immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Endometriotic stromal cells (ESC) obtained from endometriomas were exposed to either resveratrol or sirtinol, an activator or inhibitor of sirtuins, respectively, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced interleukin (IL)-8 release from the ESC was assessed at mRNA and protein levels.Both immunochemistry and RT-PCR demonstrated that SIRT1 was expressed in ESC and normal endometrial stromal cells. Resveratrol suppressed TNF-α-induced IL-8 release from the ESC in a dose-dependent manner while sirtinol increased IL-8 release.These opposing effects of SIRT1-related agents suggest that IL-8 release from the ESC is modulated through the SIRT1 pathway. Resveratrol may have the potential to ameliorate local inflammation in endometriomas.
