Combinatorial therapy using dovitinib and ICI182.780 (fulvestrant) blocks tumoral activity of endometrial cancer cells. Mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) have been recently described as a molecular-specific feature in endometrial carcinomas and the presence of activated FGFR2 mutations is associated with poor prognosis. For that reason, inhibition of FGFR2 could be a therapeutic target in the treatment of endometriod carcinomas. In this work, we investigated the antitumoral activity of dovitinib (a multiple kinase inhibitor) in human endometrial cancer cell (ECC) lines. We found that dovitinib caused cell growth arrest, loss of clonogenic growth, and cell-cycle arrest in FGFR2-mutated ECCs in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Next, we investigated the mechanistic basis of dovitinib effects. We could determine that dovitinib modified expression levels of well-known key cell-cycle regulatory proteins that induce cellular senescence. To further investigate the role of dovitinib, we analyzed its effect on estrogen receptor α (ER-α) expression. Surprisingly, we discovered that dovitinib enhances ER-α expression in FGFR2-mutant ECCs. Because blocking one signaling pathway is often not sufficient to cause total tumor regression and the effectiveness of individual inhibitors is often short-lived, we examined the impact of targeting FGFR2 with dovitinib in combination with a selective ER antagonist, fulvestrant (ICI182.780). Combination of dovitinib plus ICI182.780 resulted in a significantly higher inhibition of cell growth than dovitinib treatment alone. These findings suggest that combinatory therapies using dovitinib plus ICI182.780 treatment can be truly effective in patients with endometrial carcinomas carrying FGFR2 mutations.
