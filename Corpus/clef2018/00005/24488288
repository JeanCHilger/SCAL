Thoracic endometriosis syndrome. Thoracic endometriosis syndrome is a rare constellation of different pathological entities arising from intrathoracic endometriosis. Reports from centers in Africa are scanty. Varying theories have been proposed but none satisfactorily explains the varying clinical manifestations.To describe the demographics, pathological spectrum, and outcome of treatment of patients seen at a single centre in West Africa with intrathoracic endometriosis.Twelve women who were seen at Ghana's National Cardiotharacic Centre with intrathoracic endometriosis from 2004-2012 were retrospectively reviewed.The age range was from 24 - 39 years with a mean of 32 Â± 5 years. Pelvic endometriosis was confirmed in 8 (66.7%) of the patients, 2 (16.7%) had ectopic endometrial tissue at the umbilicus and one (16.7%) had ectopic endometrial tissue at the mons pubis. Seven (58.3%) of the patients had undergone prior uterine surgery before the clinical onset of thoracic endometriosis. The right hemithorax was involved in all 12 (100%) patients studied. Pneumothorax was present in six (50%) women, hemothorax in five (41.7%) and hemopneumothorax in one (8.3%). Three of the four patients who benefited from video assisted thoracoscopy had abrasive pleurodesis followed by hormonal therapy. The rest of the patients had chemical pleurodesis with or without hormonal therapy.Thoracic endometriosis may be more prevalent in West Africa than previously believed. Outcome of treatment is satisfactory using a multidisciplinary approach.
