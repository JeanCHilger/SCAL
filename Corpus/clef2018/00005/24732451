Role of local bioactivation of vitamin D by CYP27A1 and CYP2R1 in the control of cell growth in normal endometrium and endometrial carcinoma. Vitamin D (VD) deficiency has been suggested as a risk factor for cancer. One recognized mechanism is that the low-serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) of VD deficiency reduces intratumoral 25(OH)D conversion to 1Î±,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D, the hormonal form of VD), compromising 1,25D-VD receptor (VDR) antitumoral actions. Reduced tumoral VDR and increased CYP24A1, the enzyme that degrades 1,25D and 25(OH)D, further worsen cancer progression. Importantly, in cells expressing CYP27A1 and/or CYP2R1, which convert inert VD into 25(OH)D, low-serum VD may reduce intratumoral 25(OH)D synthesis thereby compromising VDR antitumoral actions because 25(OH)D can activate the VDR directly and enhance 1,25D-VDR action. Therefore, this study examined whether abnormal endometrial expression of CYP27A1 and/or CYP2R1 may impair VDR-antiproliferative properties in endometrial carcinoma (EC). Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays of normal human endometrium (NE n=60) and EC (n=157) showed the expected lower VDR expression in EC (P=0.0002). Instead, CYP24A1 expression was lower in EC compared with NE, while CYP27A1 and CYP2R1 expressions were higher (P=0.0002
