HE4, Ca125 and ROMA algorithm for differential diagnosis between benign gynaecological diseases and ovarian cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), cancer antigen 125 (Ca125) and the risk of ovarian malignancy algorithm (ROMA) in discriminating ovarian cancer from other benign gynaecological diseases. Serum levels of HE4 and Ca125 were measured in 119 women with benign gynaecological diseases, 29 patients with primary ovarian cancer, 32 patients with ovarian cancer on chemotherapy treatment (18 of them with progressive disease), 6 patients treated and free of disease and 32 healthy women. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR Â±) were calculated. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, and the areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated. High serum levels for HE4, Ca125 and ROMA were observed in cancer patients. HE4 was elevated in 12.6 %, Ca125 in 21 % and ROMA in 9.2 % in the benign group, but HE4 was not elevated in endometriosis. The AUC values for HE4, Ca125 and ROMA were 0.92, 0.911 and 0.945 respectively. The sensitivity for discriminating ovarian cancer from benign gynaecological diseases was 86.2 % for HE4 and Ca125 and 93.1 % for ROMA. The specificity was 87.4, 78.9 and 90.7 % for HE4, Ca125 and ROMA. The overall positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 6.84 for HE4, 4.1 for Ca125 and 10.01 for ROMA. In premenopausal women, LR + was 11.86 for HE4, 5.11 for ROMA and 2.02 for Ca125. HE4 might be significant in the differential diagnosis of ovarian cancer. HE4 seems to be superior to Ca125 in terms of diagnostic performance of all premenopausal women. ROMA could help to discriminate in cases with any doubt with a high diagnostic accuracy.
