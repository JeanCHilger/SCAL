Management of pregnancy in woman with suspected malignant deep infiltrating endometriosis fistulised to the uterine cervix. Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is a well-known cause of pelvic pain and infertility. Malignant transformation of DIE is rare but can be suggested by MRI. We report a case of a spontaneous pregnancy in a woman with suspicion of malignant transformation of DIE with fistulisation to the posterior uterine isthmus through to the cervical canal. The pregnancy was closely monitored and an uneventful caesarian section was performed at 34â€…weeks of gestation. This case raises the issue of the relevance of imaging techniques and management of pregnancy.
