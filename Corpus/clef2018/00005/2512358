Relationship between luteal function and prolactin in infertile women with endometriosis. Luteal function in 44 infertile women with endometriosis were studied with reference to prolactin (PRL) and compared with 34 unexplained infertile women without endometriosis. To assess luteal function, serum progesterone (P4) levels were measured on the 3rd, 7th and 10th days of the luteal phase. On the 7th day, serum estradiol (E2) levels and PRL levels were also determined. The response of PRL secretion to TRH was examined at 30 and 60 after following TRH (500 micrograms, im.) administration. The incidence of hyperprolactinemia (basal PRL level greater than or equal to 25 ng/ml) and latent hyperprolactinemia (peak PRL level in TRH challenge test greater than or equal to 150 ng/ml) were 19% and 31%, respectively, in the endometriosis group and 14% and 33%, respectively in the control group. At the midluteal stage, serum P4 levels in endometriosis group were decreased significantly (p less than 0.05), whereas no difference was found between the serum E2 levels in the endometriosis group and the control. In the endometriosis group, there was no correlation between P4 and E2 levels and abnormal secretion of PRL such as hyperprolactinemia and latent hyperprolactinemia. These results indicate the close association of endometriosis with an inadequate luteal phase. However, it seems that the aberrant secretion of PRL has no relation to the impared luteal function in endometriosis.
