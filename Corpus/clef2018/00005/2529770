Buserelin versus danazol in the treatment of endometriosis-associated infertility. A total of 62 infertile women with a laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis were allocated randomly to two treatment groups, one of which (32 patients) received oral danazol 600 micrograms/day and the other (30 patients) received intranasal buserelin 1200 micrograms/day for 6 months. Suppression of serum levels of estradiol was greater with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment. Pain symptoms improved markedly during treatment in both groups. At the end of treatment a repeat laparoscopy was performed only in the patients who agreed to it (12 in the buserelin group and 13 in the danazol group), and it did not reveal significant differences in the effects of the two treatments on the endometriotic implants. All of the patients were followed up for at least 12 months, during which pregnancy was attempted. At 18 months the cumulative pregnancy rate was 48% in the patients treated with buserelin and 43% in those treated with danazol. Pain recurrence was observed in about half of the patients in each group 1 year after treatment suspension. The side effects were more frequent and more severe in the danazol-treated patients, whereas those given buserelin generally reported only symptoms of hypoestrogenism. The results of this study suggests that buserelin is at least as effective as danazol in the treatment of endometriosis when the outcome is considered in terms of restored fertility, and its side effects are less severe.
