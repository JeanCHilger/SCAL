Prolactin and its response to the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone thyrotropin-releasing hormone test in patients with endometriosis before, during, and after treatment with danazol. Basal levels of prolactin (PRL) were studied in 16 normal women and in 60 women with endometriosis, 37 of whom were infertile. In addition, the authors studied the response to an intravenous (IV) injection of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) (100 micrograms) plus thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) (300 micrograms) in the 16 normal women and in 18 endometriosis patients, examining the basal PRL and thyrotropin, and at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes after the IV bolus. After laparoscopy and/or conservative surgery, the patients were treated with danazol for 6 months and a second laparoscopy was performed. The LH-RH/TRH test was carried out in the third month of danazol treatment in 6 endometriosis patients and before the second laparoscopy in 11 patients. The results show that there was both an increase in the mean basal levels of PRL and in the percentage of cases of moderate hyperprolactinemia in endometriosis patients. There also was a greater rise in PRL with the LH-RH/TRH test in moderate and severe endometriosis. The PRL response was significantly greater in endometriosis than in normal women, and was not related to TSH response. Danazol treatment reduced significantly the PRL response. The PRL response before treatment was significantly higher in patients who after treatment showed persistent endometriosis at the second laparoscopy. This could suggest a lower effectiveness of danazol in patients with endometriosis and a PRL hyper-response to LH-RH/TRH.
