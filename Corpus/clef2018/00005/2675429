Endometriosis--new perspectives. 2. Classification and treatment. The disease, endometriosis, occurs in very varying forms and degrees of severity. Classification of the disease is therefore important. Acosta's classification was previously most frequently employed. A more recent system of classification (R-AFS) proposed by the American Fertility Society is employed here. This system is based on scoring of various elements of endometriosis. Employing this system of classification, which is now internationally used, a more differentiated description of the disease is obtained and also improved assessment of bilateral involvement. Various therapeutic possibilities are reviewed including the question of whether minimal-mild endometriosis should be treated at all. Recent therapeutic possibilities for endometriosis with laser surgery and "medical oophorectomy" employing GnRH analogues are discussed and also employment of in vitro fertilization for patients with endometriosis is mentioned. Finally, treatment with danazol and the classical therapeutic agents such as oral contraception, gestagens and surgery are reviewed with the authors' proposals of suitable patients for each form of treatment.
