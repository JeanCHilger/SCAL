Ureteric endometriosis: 3 case reports and a review of the literature. Endometriosis involving the ureter is a relatively rare phenomenon but at least 121 cases have been reported previously. The 3 cases presented in this report emphasize some important facets of this condition: the lack of symptoms leading to late diagnosis, the presence of severe renal damage with very localized pelvic disease, how an incomplete initial operation may lead to further major difficulties, and the failure of medical therapy to halt its progress. The potentially lethal nature of ureteric endometriosis is stressed, and the different treatment modalities for patients of different ages and parity discussed. Surgical management, either conservative or radical, is suggested as the modality of choice, and where conservative operation is undertaken very careful continuing observation of renal function is a necessity.
