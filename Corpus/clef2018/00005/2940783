The role of microcolpohysteroscopy in the diagnosis of endometrial pathology. In this study it's valued the utility of microcolpohisteroscopy, as diagnostic investigation in gynecology. This technique proved to be easy to do, welcomed by the patients, innocuous and full of information about the physiology, physiopathology and pathology of the structures studied. The examination has to be done in the second half of the endometrial proliferation, anaesthesia isn't necessary and it can also be performed to out-patient women. In 1984, in Obstetric and Gynecology Clinic of Parma, this method practised using Homou's microcolpohysteroscope, has been used in 96 patients, whose age was between 20 and 68 years: our women affected by numerous gynecological pathologies like metrorrhage or intermenstrual blood loss, and sterility. It was possible to prove several pathological alterations: endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial polypuses were the most frequent. In sterile women examined we found synechie and endometrial atrophy more frequently. Only in 4 out of 96 women patients underwent this exam no lesion to be evidenced by microcolpohysteroscopy.
