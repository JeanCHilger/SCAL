Laparoscopic diagnosis and evaluation of danazol therapy of endometriosis in sterility. In twenty two sterile women, endometriosis externa were diagnosed and classified laparoscopically. Classifying the severity of endometriosis by Beecham's and/or Sugimoto's classification, 17 cases were declared mild and only 5 cases severe (one was stage IV and the others were stage III by Beecham's classification, and 4 were grade III by Sugimoto's classification). All these patients were treated with Danazol (Bonzol) 400 mg/day or 300 mg/day for about 24 weeks. Four weeks after the termination of Danazol administration, the effects of Danazol therapy were examined according to the number of blueberry spots, adhesion severity and chocolate cyst size under re-laparoscopy, as well as dysmenorrhea and other complaints. The results were as follows: Dysmenorrhea was relieved in 60.0% of 15 cases, Blueberry spots were decreased or paled in 88.9% of 18 cases, Adhesion was weakened or partially separated spontaneously in 71.4% of 7 cases, Chocolate cyst size became smaller in 85.7% of 7 cases, The patient complained of mild side-effects, namely acne in 45.5% of cases, a weight gain of more than 2 kg in 54.5%, and hoarseness developed in one. The results of laboratory tests performed before and during the treatment remained slightly abnormal or within normal limits.
