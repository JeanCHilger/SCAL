The differences between findings at laparoscopy and at subsequent fertility surgery. In a series of 42 patients, the findings during fertility microsurgery were compared to the findings at both laparoscopy performed by referring gynaecologists and re-laparoscopy performed in our regimen. Since significantly fewer discrepancies were found in the latter group, this re-laparoscopy may be considered useful and justified. The importance of meticulous laparoscopy is emphasized.
