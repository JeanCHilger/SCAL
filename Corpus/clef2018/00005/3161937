Luteal insufficiency and endometriosis. Comparative study of plasma progesterone and of the evolutionary stage. 24 patients who had more than two years of infertility were checked by laparoscopic and hormone (plasma progesterone) tests at the 21st-23rd day of the cycle. Two comparable groups were found: Group A with no visible endometriosis, and Group B with obvious endometriosis (stage I, IIa, IIb according to Kistner's classification). There is a significant difference between the two groups as far as the levels of progesterone in the plasma are concerned, because they are lower in Group B than in Group A. On the other hand, there is no correlation to be demonstrated between the severity of the endometriosis and the low level of progesterone.
