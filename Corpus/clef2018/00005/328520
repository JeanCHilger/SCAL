Endom√©triosis of the small intestine. Report of 4 new cases of stenosis of the small intestine (author's transl). The authors report 4 new cases of stenosis of the small intestine of endometrial origin. They emphasize the rareness of these stenosing forms which in most recent series intervened in 1 case of endometriosis out of 1,000 (Martinbeau). They consider the various clinical presentations encountered, asymptomatic forms discovered by chance, forms associated with suggestive gynecological disorders, chronic stenosis of the small intestine or presentation with intestinal obstruction. They consider the diagnostic difficulty in the isolated forms (2 cases) in the absence of pelvi-genital lesions. Among the positive factors, they consider the recrudescence during theperiods of the digestive signs, the macroscopic appearance of the lesions and, above all, the mucosal integrity noted on opening the specimen after intestinal resection. Finally, they consider certain special problems, that of bi-polar intestinal involvement with double localisation, involving the ileum and the recto-sigmoid areas.
