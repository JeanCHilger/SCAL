The potential value of imprint cytology in cytochemical localization of steroid hormone receptors in ovarian cancer. Steroid hormone receptors were studied in 45 patients with primary, recurrent, or metastatic ovarian cancer in cryostat-frozen sections and imprint preparations. The ligands, 17 B-estradiol-6-carboxymethyloxine-bovine serum albumin fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-BSA estradiol) and hydroxyprogesteronehemisuccinate bovine serum albumin tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TMRITC-BSA progesterone) were used in the fluorescent cytochemical method. Results were compared with standard dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) biochemical assay. An overall significant correlation between biochemical values and cytochemical results was found. However, the imprint results were more sensitive and more specific than the frozen section results. A statistically significant difference (P less than 0.05) was observed between touch preparation material and frozen section specimens by the fluorescent method.
