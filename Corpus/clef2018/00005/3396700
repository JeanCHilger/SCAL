Hormonal profiles and embryo quality in women with severe endometriosis treated by in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. A study was undertaken comparing the outcomes of 30 women with infertility due to untreated severe (grade IV) pelvic endometriosis with a comparable series of 28 women whose infertility was caused solely by irreversible tubal disease. There were no significant differences in either the follicular phase or luteal phase hormonal profiles of estradiol and progesterone, but there was a significantly reduced pregnancy rate in those women with severe endometriosis. In part, this was due to the recovery of fewer oocytes from the endometriosis patients (P less than 0.001) despite the fact that the peak estradiol levels and ovarian accessibility were similar in the two groups. However, there were no significant differences in the proportion of oocytes that fertilized or the number that demonstrated normal embryo growth and high-grade embryo quality. There also appears to be an implantation inhibitory factor in patients with severe endometriosis as the pregnancy rate/embryo transferred and number of gestational sacs identified/embryo transferred were significantly reduced (P less than 0.05).
