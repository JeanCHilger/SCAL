Combination assay of CA125, TPA, IAP, CEA, and ferritin in serum for ovarian cancer. The levels of CA125, TPA, IAP, CEA, and ferritin in the serum were measured simultaneously in 68 healthy nonpregnant females and 133 patients with various gynecological diseases, and were subjected to statistical discriminant analysis for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. The usefulness and the limits for diagnosis of various gynecological diseases were investigated for each tumor marker. Also, the diagnostic usefulness of the stepwise discriminant analysis employing the values of these five tumor markers in the serum in cases of ovarian cancer was compared with that of CA125 measurements alone. Because the frequency of cases with an elevated serum CA125 level increased more specifically in the ovarian cancer group than those of other tumor makers in the serum, this parameter was considered to be more useful for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer than the levels of the other tumor markers. The frequencies of cases with the elevated serum CA125 levels, however, also increased in the groups of patients with endometriosis and at an early stage of normal pregnancy more than in the group of healthy nonpregnant females. In the ovarian cancer patients, the discriminant analysis employing the values of CA125 and four other tumor markers in sera was more useful for early diagnosis, differential diagnosis, early detection of recurrences, and the determination of complete remission after therapy than the measurement of the serum CA125 level alone.
