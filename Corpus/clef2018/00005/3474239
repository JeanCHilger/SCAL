The effect of hysterectomy on serum CA 125 levels in patients with adenomyosis and uterine fibroids. The human endometrium has been reported to release CA 125 in tissue culture, and elevated levels have been found in patients with endometriosis and adenomyosis. The serum levels of CA 125 were measured in 22 women undergoing hysterectomy for adenomyosis (n = 11) or fibroids (n = 11) of the uterus. In 20 patients (91%) the pre-operative CA 125 level was normal (less than 35 U/ml). All patients with adenomyosis had a normal pre-operative serum CA 125 concentration. Five weeks after the operation the CA 125 levels did not differ from the pre-operative levels. Our results show that the uterine contribution to the serum CA 125 level is minimal, and do not confirm the initial enthusiasm concerning the possible use of levels as an aid in the diagnosis of adenomyosis.
