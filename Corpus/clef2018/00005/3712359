Adenomyosis in pregnancy. A review. Adenomyosis of the gravid uterus has been considered a rare condition, associated with a high incidence of obstetric and/or surgical complications. In addition, various studies have claimed that the adenomyotic implants hormonally respond only to estrogen. A careful review of the literature does not support these notions. The incidence of adenomyosis in the gravid uterus appears to be about 17%. However, 80 years' worth of literature contains only 29 reports of associated obstetric complications. There is also ample evidence of adenomyosis demonstrating progesterone effects within the hormonal milieu of pregnancy.
