Cyclic changes of peritoneal fluid parameters in normal and infertile patients. This study compared peritoneal fluid volume, macrophage count, and macrophage concentration by diagnosis and cycle week of 426 patients undergoing laparoscopy. Patient diagnosis and cycle week had no significant interaction. Peritoneal fluid volume was dependent upon cycle week and diagnostic group, but macrophage count depended only upon diagnostic group. Endometriosis was associated with a significantly elevated total number of macrophages. Postovulatory peritoneal fluid volumes were significantly higher than preovulatory values. Cyclic and postovulatory differences in peritoneal fluid volume support proposed pathophysiologic roles.
