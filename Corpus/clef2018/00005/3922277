Human in vitro fertilization. Human in vitro fertilization has become a widely accepted method of treatment for infertile couples. The list of indications for this technique is rapidly growing and includes oligospermia, endometriosis, and unexplained infertility. The techniques of follicular recruitment, ovum maturation, and follicular aspiration, as well as laboratory culture techniques, are described. The various factors to be taken into consideration when trying to assess possible success of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer are discussed in this paper.
