Gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT): a new technique for the treatment of unexplained infertility. The Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT) was carried out in 12 couples with unexplained infertility, in 2 cases with infertility associated with mild endometriosis, in 1 case of hostile mucus and 3 cases in which phymosis of the ampulla and/or periadnexal adhesions were previously identified. In 7 couples GIFT was carried out after several AID cycles for husband azoospermia or severe oligospermia. Three different protocols were used for the controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. In all cases an adequate follicular growth was obtained and mature oocytes were recovered. At first attempt 12 ongoing pregnancies (1 triplet, 1 twin) were obtained with a present pregnancy rate of 48%.
