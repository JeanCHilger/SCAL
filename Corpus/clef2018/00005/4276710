Chronic pelvic disease of unknown origin. Obscure, chronically recurring pains in the lower abdomen and back are common symptoms in the office of the gynecologist or practitioner. Often the cause has never been found. Many are functional or psychosomatic disturbances. There is no  objective measurement of the quality or amount of pain. Common diagnoses have been chronic adnexitis, chronic appendicitis, retroflexion of the uterus, or adhesions. Too often surgical operations have been of little benefit. When  consultations with other specialists have not helped, laparoscopy is indicated. Endometriosis is a common finding. Cauteriziation of this lesion at laparoscopy is better than hormone therapy. Adhesions may be severed with relief of symptoms.  Varicose enlargement of ovarian veins is sometimes seen. Laparotomy may be indicated for conditions not readily treated by laparoscopy. However, indications for surgery should be carefully considered to avoid iatrogenic damage in an already  apprehensive patient. Tranquilizers and small doses of cortisone may be adequate. In about 80% of patients complaining of chronic lower abdominal pain, organic disorders may be found by laparoscopy.  The procedure should be recommended more frequently.
