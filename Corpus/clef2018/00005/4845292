Menstrual disorders at puberty. This is a complete outlined summary of menstrual disorders of puberty.  First diagnostic procedures are suggested, such as history, evaluation of degree of pubertal development, and gynecologic, neurologic, and psychiatric exam, with temperature curve, vaginal smear, basal and stimulated hormone tests, and  chromosome studies as required.  Common but probably not pathologic complaints include dysmenorrhea (rule out ovarian cyst, endometriosis, congenital malformation) menstrual irregularity (rule out Stein-Levinthal syndrome)
