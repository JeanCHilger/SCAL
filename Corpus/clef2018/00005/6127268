Multiple primary neoplasms of the ovary and uterus. Multiple primary neoplasms arising in the ovary and uterus were analyzed in 55 patients: 49 synchronous and 6, metachronous. When they occurred synchronously, 74.5% of the ovarian carcinomas and 93.6% of the uterine carcinomas were stage I lesions. The endometrial carcinomas were invariably well differentiated and superficial. It was the stage of the ovarian carcinomas that determined the prognosis of these patients. Ways of their identification as separate neoplasms are discussed. The potential to develop further neoplasms in the gastrointestinal tract and breasts should be borne in mind.
