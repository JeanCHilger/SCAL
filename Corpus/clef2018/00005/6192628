Peritoneal endometriosis. Report of a case with cytologic, cytochemical and histopathologic study. The cytologic and histochemical data in a case of extensive peritoneal endometriosis are presented. The presence of macrophages heavily laden with blue and dark pigment (as demonstrated by May-Gr√ºnwald-Giemsa, Perls and Fontana stains) and scattered non-neoplastic endometrial cells in hemorrhagic ascitic fluid indicated a diagnosis of peritoneal endometriosis. Metabolized hemoglobin material was related to both recent and older hemorrhages.
