Cellular components in peritoneal fluid in infertile patients with and without endometriosis. Cellular components in peritoneal fluid of infertile patients with and without endometriosis were evaluated in 102 patients with Wright's-Giemsa and Papanicolaou stains. The secretory activity of these cells was studied indirectly by assaying acid phosphatase, prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha and PGE2 and complement components C3c and C4. The results showed that macrophages and lymphocytes were the dominant cells in peritoneal fluid of these patients. These cells were significantly increased in endometriosis patients, as compared with control subjects. In addition, peritoneal fluid acid phosphatase, PGF2 alpha and PGE2, and complement components C3c and C4 were significantly increased in patients with endometriosis. These cellular changes and their activation in peritoneal fluid may explain infertility associated with endometriosis.
