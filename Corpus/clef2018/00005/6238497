Regression of endometriosis following shorter treatment with, or lower dose of danazol. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment laparoscopic findings in the Scandinavian multi-center study. One hundred and sixteen patients with laparoscopically confirmed primary or recurrent endometriosis were treated with danazol, either 600 mg daily for 4 months (group A, n = 76) or 600 mg daily for the first 2 months, followed by 400 mg daily for an additional 4 months (group B, n = 40). The only surgery performed before treatment was biopsies, resection of endometriomas greater than or equal to 3 cm and/or adhesiolysis. The extent of endometriosis before and after treatment was established laparoscopically and recorded by means of a modified AFSrecord as mean additive diameter of implants (mean ADI) in millimeters. This provided a uniform and reproducible quantitative registration for each type and location of endometriotic implant. Both treatment schemes resulted in a highly significant (p less than 0.001) reduction of endometriosis, by 79 and 89% in groups A and B, respectively. However, the reduction in mean ADI was significantly greater (p less than 0.025) in group B which had been treated for a longer period. Moreover, the proportion of patients with extensive pre-treatment lesions (mean ADI greater than or equal to 40 mm) was significantly greater in this group. Active residual endometriosis was found in 21 and 17.5% in groups A and B, respectively. These patients had significantly more extensive endometriosis before treatment. The regression of endometriotic implants was independent of type and/or location, i.e. superficial or scarred peritoneal, ovarian, or tubal. There was no apparent correlation between the quantitative reduction of endometriosis and amenorrhea versus occasional spotting and/or irregular menstruations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
