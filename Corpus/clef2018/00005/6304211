Isoelectroforetic analysis of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AG) in gynecological malignancy. alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1AG) in the blood of gynecologic malignancy was measured by the S.R.I.D. method and analyzed by isoelectrofocusing. The usefulness of these methods for diagnosis and prognosis was examined. A. Quantitative analysis In normal healthy women alpha 1AG was measured (62.2 +/- 2.7 mg/dl) and did not increase before operation in benign gynecologic tumor. In cervical cancer, according to the development of cancer, a quantitative increase was apparent. Upon estimation, a significant difference from healthy women was observed at T1 but not T0. Two weeks after operation a quantitative increase was observed after which there was a gradual decrease but one year later not down close to the value before operation even in patients with good prognosis. In recurrent patients there was a marked increase. In ovarian cancer stage III, alpha 1AG markedly increased to 144.9 +/- 36.6 mg/dl before the operation, being a higher value. B. Isoelectrofocusing analysis Upon isoelectrofocusing, 9 bands were observed between pH3.1 and pH3.5. In normal healthy women I and IX bands were not recognized. In cervical cancer an increase in ratio groups I and II and groups VIII and IX and a decrease in ratio group (IV, V, VI) were seen according to development of the cancer. Ovarian cancer showed the same course as cervical cancer. The measurement and the isoelectrofocusing analysis of alpha 1AG were useful for diagnosis of gynecologic malignancy and its prognosis, and these methods are especially useful in case of ovarian cancer.
