LRF and TRF test during long-term danazol treatment: increase of the LH and FSH responses but decrease of the prolactin and TSH responses. Seven patients suffering from severe endometriosis were treated with danazol 200 mg X 3 daily for 6 months. Clinical symptoms were alleviated and menses disappeared in response to the treatment. After cessation of the treatment the menstrual bleedings returned in 1-3 months. Blood samples for determination of gonadotrophins, prolactin (Prl), oestradiol (E2), progesterone, thyroid hormones and thyrotrophin in radioimmunoassays were taken and a combined TRF and LRF test carried out in the follicular phase before treatment, at the 6th month of treatment and after reappearance of the first menses. There were no statistically significant changes in the basal levels of serum FSH, LH or TSH during the danazol treatment. Neither was there any change in episodic secretions of FSH, LH or Prl, as determined by the mean coefficients of variation of the hormone levels in seven consecutive samples taken at 20 min intervals. On the other hand, serum E2, Prl and thyroid hormone levels were significantly decreased in the 6th month of treatment. In the TRF-LRF test the responses of serum FSH and LH were significantly higher and those of serum Prl and TSH significantly lower during danazol treatment than before. Prl responses remained lowered after the treatment. It appears that low serum oestrogen levels, induced by the danazol treatment, sensitize the pituitary gonadotrophs to exogenous LRF, but make the sensitivity of thyrotrophs and lactotrophs lower to exogenous TRF. These results thus indicate that danazol does not make the pituitary gonadotrophs insensitive to LRF, but danazol may rather inhibit the secretion of hypothalamic LRF.
