Autoimmune phenomena in infertile patients with endometriosis. To assess the presence of autoimmune factors in patients with endometriosis, endometrial homogenates, peritoneal fluid, and serum were evaluated in 23 patients with endometriosis and 22 control subjects. The methods used were Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and radial immunodiffusion. The study demonstrated precipitation lines between endometrial homogenates and serum from some endometriosis patients but not from the control subjects. Immunoelectrophoresis demonstrated precipitation lines at beta-globulin position when endometrial homogenates were used against serum of patients with endometriosis and with goat antihuman serum. It is suggested that an antigen, possibly a glycoprotein, is present in the endometrial homogenates. Radial immunodiffusion studies for immunoglobulins (Ig) G, A, and M and complement components C3c and C4 showed significantly higher concentrations of C3c and C4 in serum and peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis than the control subjects (P less than .05). There was no significant difference in concentration of IgG, A, M, factor B, and properdin.
