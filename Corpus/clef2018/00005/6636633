Clinico-morphological characteristics of marginal epithelial ovarian tumors. Clinico-morphological features of 228 proliferating epithelial ovarian tumors of various histological patterns were studied. The group under study consisted of 135 serous (59.2%), 54 mucinous (23.7%) and 39 endometroid cystadenomas (17.1%). These tumors spread by implantation only. Metastases were registered in 20.2% of cases. Their incidence increased significantly in younger patients of reproductive age and in those with bilateral lesions, ascitis, cystic-solid and papillary types of tumor growth, mucinous tumors and invasive neoplasms. A correlation was established between the degree of tumor proliferation and the clinical course of the disease: 79.4% of patients of the atypical proliferation group revealed apparent manifestations of malignancy.
