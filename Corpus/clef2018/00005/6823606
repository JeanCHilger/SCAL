Invasive endometriosis of the terminal ileum: a cause of small bowel obstruction of obscure origin. A 40-year-old woman with a five-month history of intermittent abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant, diarrhea, and signs of small bowel obstruction was thought to have Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum. At operation, endometriosis of the terminal ileum was found and treated by resection. Enteric endometriosis is a rare cause of small bowel obstruction and the correct diagnosis is usually made at surgery.
