Endometriosis of the ureter can present as renal failure: a case report and review of endometriosis affecting the ureters. Of the female subjects with pelvic endometriosis 1.2 per cent are found to have involvement of the genitourinary tract. Ureteral obstruction secondary to endometriosis is uncommon and usually is unilateral. We report a case of renal failure with hypertension due to bilateral ureteral obstruction from pelvic endometriosis. Ureteral endometriosis and its treatment are discussed. In premenopausal women presenting with bilateral obstruction of the distal ureters endometriosis should be part of the differential diagnosis.
