Relationship of luteinizing hormone, pregnanediol-3-glucuronide, and estriol-16-glucuronide in urine of infertile women with endometriosis. The concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH), pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PGD), and estriol-16-Glucuronide (E3G) were measured in daily morning urine specimens from 53 infertile women. In 26 of 29 women with various degrees of proven endometriosis, two distinct midcycle peaks of LH were found 2 or 3 days apart. Patients with LH peaks separated by 3 days had significantly more severe endometriosis than those with a single peak. Maximum concentrations of E3G were found to be delayed until after the first LH peak in these patients, and PGD concentrations did not rise until the time of the second LH peak, making actual luteal function of shorter duration than normal. From the data on LH, it appears that an inappropriate hormonal feedback mechanism is operative in endometriosis.
