Endosalpingiosis. Endosalpingiosis is defined as ectopic tubal epithelium and is considered homologous with endometriosis. In its usual form, the lesion is asymptomatic and has no serious prognostic associations. Recognition of endosalpingiosis, however, is important in avoiding overdiagnosis of disseminated lesions. The possibility of carcinoma--usually serous--arising primarily in a focus of endosalpingiosis is discussed.
