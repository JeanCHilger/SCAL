Clinical aspects relating to extragenital endometriosis (author's transl). Endometriosis was recorded from 26 per cent of more than 5,800 pelviscopic checks at the Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of the University of Kiel, according to a comprehensive statistical record covering a period between 1971 and 1979. Sterility patients ranked high on the list they accounted for 51 per cent. -Systematic examinations were performed on a more stringently selected group of 611 patients, over the last two-and-a-half years. They were similar to studies conducted by Scott and Te Linde as well as by Meigs. Extragenital endometriosis was diagnosed in 26.2 per cent of the latter cases. -Clinically measurable symptoms were recorded from not more than about 50 per cent of those patients. -Treatment should always be given on the basis of one definitely established therapeutic scheme. Three-step treatment, including pelviscopy followed by six-months antigonadotrophin treatment and, finally, by re-pelviscopy with correction of the tube factor, has proved to be extremely successful for sterility patients. Larger manipulations on the tubes should be preceded by complete elimination of extragenital endometriosis to prevent fimbrial reclosure after a few months.
