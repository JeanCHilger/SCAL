Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein-2 are increased in cyst fluids of epithelial ovarian cancer. Expression of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), its receptor, and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) by epithelial ovarian cancer cells and its mitogenic effect on these cells in vitro suggest that IGF-I may have a role in the regulation of human ovarian cancer. To examine this role in vivo, we explored the IGF-I/IGFBP system in sera and cyst fluids of women undergoing surgery for simple and other benign cysts (n = 20) and borderline (n = 5) and invasive malignant epithelial neoplasms (n = 11). The IGF-I level was significantly higher in cyst fluid from invasive malignant compared to cyst fluid in benign neoplasms (16.1 +/- 2.2 vs. 7.3 +/- 1.2 nmol/L P = 0.002). Although benign cysts contained almost no IGFBP, high IGFBP-2 levels were detected in malignant cysts regardless of histological type. Serum IGFBP-2 levels were also higher in women with invasive malignancy than in benign controls (1.32 +/- 0.32 vs. 0.53 +/- 0.07 relative units
