Intestinal endometriosis: presentation, investigation, and surgical management. The study was undertaken to identify the presenting features of intestinal endometriosis and to evaluate its investigation and surgical management. Twenty-six cases of intestinal endometriosis were identified during a fourteen year period. The commonest site of occurrence was the rectosigmoid region (11 cases) followed by the appendix (9 cases), and ileocaecal region (6 cases). Abdominal pain was the main presenting feature in 20 cases, with associated nausea and vomiting in 12 cases and altered bowel habit in ten. Other presenting features included rectal bleeding, abdominal bloating and tenesmus. Endometriosis was not suspected preoperatively in any of the patients without a past history of this condition. Accurate preoperative diagnosis proved very difficult, with only laparoscopy providing definite evidence of intestinal endometriosis prior to formal surgery. Colonic resections were performed in 12 cases, small bowel resection in six cases and appendicectomy in nine cases, together with resection of adjacent adherent structures. This series illustrates the difficulty of establishing an accurate preoperative diagnosis, and the propensity of intestinal endometriosis to mimic other gastrointestinal diseases, particularly carcinoma and inflammatory bowel disease.
