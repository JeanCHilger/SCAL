Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFA) expression in different endometrial cancers. The role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFA) in endometrial cancer is still controversial. In this study the immunostaining of EGF-R and TGFA, investigated in 44 cases, proved to be related to endometrial cancer histotype regardless of the tumor grade or the extent of myometrial invasion. In fact, EGF-R expression was observed in 12.5% (1/8) of cases with classical endometrioid adenocarcinoma, in 91% (10/11) with endometrial adenocarcinoma and benign squamous metaplasia, and in 35% (6/17) with adenosquamous carcinoma. TGFA expression was concomitant with EGF-R in the first two histotypes, and was present in about 50% (9/17) of the latter. Conversely, in mucinous and serous papillary adenocarcinoma, EGF-R and TGFA immunostaining was not observed. In conclusion, EGF-R positivity was observed in endometrial cancer with squamous differentiation, especially in those cases with benign squamous metaplasia. EGF-R and TGFA coexpression appeared as a constant feature of benign squamous metaplasia.
