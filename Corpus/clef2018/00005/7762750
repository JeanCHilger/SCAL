Diagnosis of internal endometriosis of the uterus. The authors analyze the informative value of instrumental methods of examination (hysteroscopy, hysterosalpingography, ultrasonic scanning) and measurements of blood phosphatidyl inosites in 50 patients with internal endometriosis and come to a conclusion that it is in proportion with the disease severity, hysteroscopy being the most informative. A reliable reduction (p < 0.001) of blood phosphatidyl inosites were seen in endometriosis patients as against normal subjects. Combined examinations making use of instrumental methods and blood phosphatidylinosite measurements essentially improve the accuracy of internal endometriosis diagnosis and help develop a rational treatment strategy.
