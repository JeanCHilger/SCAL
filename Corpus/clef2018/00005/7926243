Danazol influences gonadotropin secretion acting at the hypothalamic level. The purpose of the study was to determine the influence of danazol on gonadotropin secretion.Ten endometriotic patients were treated with danazol for 6 months. To evaluate gonadotropin and estradiol secretion, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) test and a clomiphene citrate (CC) challenge test were carried out in the follicular phase before treatment, during the sixth month of treatment and after the reappearance of the second menses. The same tests were also performed, only once, in the follicular phase of ten normal women.GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin response during danazol treatment was significantly higher than that in the same group of women before and after danazol treatment, as well as in controls. Gonadotropin increase after clomiphene citrate administration during danazol treatment was not significant moreover, LH response was significantly lower than that in the same group of patients before and after danazol treatment, as well as in controls.Our results suggest that danazol exerts a suppressive effect on gonadotropin secretion acting at the hypothalamic level.
