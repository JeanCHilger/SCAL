MR appearance of umbilical endometriosis. We describe the MR appearance of endometriosis involving the umbilicus in two patients. One patient had a history of laparoscopy performed through the umbilicus the other had an umbilical hernia.MR imaging was performed using both a body coil and a spine coil (with the patient lying prone on the spine coil). The lesions were surgically removed and their MR appearance was correlated with the results of histologic analysis.The lesions were well delineated on MRI and showed evidence of prior hemorrhage consistent with endometriosis. Both lesions were shown to be endometriosis at surgical pathology.MR imaging was useful for delineating the size and location of the lesions and excluding intraabdominal extension.
