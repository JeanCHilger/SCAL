Carbonic anhydrase antibody in sera from patients with endometriosis. Sera from 16 of 23 (69.6%) patients with endometriosis, a potential autoimmune disease, and 2 of 17 (11.8%) control individuals had autoantibodies against the bovine carbonic anhydrase (CA) molecular weight marker, as determined by the Western blot technique. The reactivity of these antibodies to purified human CA I, human CA II, and two preparations of bovine CA II were investigated. Of the 16 endometriosis patients who were reactive to the bovine CA molecular weight marker, 14 were reactive to at least one purified human CA isoenzyme tested, 8 were reactive to at least one purified bovine CA II, and 2 did not react with any of the CA isoenzymes tested. Variation in cross-reactivity between species and in the biochemical characteristics of various CA isoenzyme preparations may partially explain these findings. Autoantibodies to CA isoenzymes have recently been reported in other autoimmune diseases. Further investigation is required to determine the significance of CA autoantibody production in patients with endometriosis.
