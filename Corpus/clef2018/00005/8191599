Relation between ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens in tumor tissue and detached cyst fluid cells of patients with ovarian neoplasms. The expression and potential diagnostic value of ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens were estimated in different types of epithelial ovarian neoplasms. The comparison of antigenic expression was performed on solid tumor tissues and loose cyst fluid cells in individual cases of malignant and benign ovarian neoplasms.All studies were performed using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens (OC125, OV-TL3, OV632, 10B, 8C) by 3-step peroxidase-antiperoxidase test.All ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens were detected in most serous and endometrioid carcinomas. In mucinous carcinomas as well as in benign ovarian neoplasms these antigens were present only in some cases. Significant inter- and intratumoral immunological heterogeneity was evident however, the antigens detectable in tissue sections were also found in detached cyst fluid cells.Our results show that mAb show OV-TL3 is the best marker for endometrioid carcinomas and confirmed that mAbs OV632, OC125 and OV-TL3 could be good complementary markers for differentiating malignant and benign lesions in the ovary. The percentage content of all ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens in solid tumors and respective cyst fluid cells was comparable.
