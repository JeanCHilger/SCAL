Effects of peritoneal fluids from patients with endometriosis on capacitated spermatozoa. To determine the effects of peritoneal fluid (PF) from patients with endometriosis on capacitated sperm.Capacitated donor sperm were allowed to migrate into straws filled with pooled PF from patients with unexplained infertility without endometriosis (n = 4) and those with mild (n = 4) and moderate-severe (n = 4) endometriosis, respectively, for 3 hours.Sperm motility, sperm membrane integrity, and acrosomal loss were determined.Statistically, no significant differences were found among the various sperm parameters determined.Peritoneal fluid from patients with endometriosis does not appear to adversely affect capacitated spermatozoa.
