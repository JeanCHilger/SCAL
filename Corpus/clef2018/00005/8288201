Study on estrogen and progesterone receptors in endometriosis and adenomyosis. Estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR) in 18 cases of ovarian endometriosis and 13 cases of adenomyosis were determined with dextran coated charcoal (DCC) method. The levels of ER and PR in those specimens were lower than those of normal endometrium. Among the 18 cases of ovarian endometriosis, 6 (33.4%) were negative for PR, which accounted for the unsatisfactory results of progesterone treatment for some endometriosis. In the 13 cases of adenomyosis there were 10 (76.9%) showing positive PR. It is suggested that the hormone therapy may be useful to treat those young patients with adenomyosis instead of surgery. The correlation of the ER and PR levels, the treatment and prognosis in endometriosis and adenomyosis are worth further studying.
