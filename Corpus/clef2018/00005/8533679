Prostatic adenocarcinoma showing features of endometrioid and mucinous carcinomas: a case report. A 77-year-old male was admitted for the examination of post renal acute renal failure. Blood examination revealed renal dysfunction and elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Computed tomography and retrograde pyelography showed bilateral hydronephrosis due to ureteral stenosis. He died of renal failure and autopsy was done. Histologic findings showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate associated with endometrioid and mucinous carcinoma, and metastases of retroperitoneal lymph nodes and multiple bones. Immunohistochemically, endometrioid carcinoma was positive for prostatic acid phosphate (PAP) and prostatic specific antigen (PSA), and negative for CEA. Mucinous carcinoma was negative for PAP and PSA, and positive for CEA. Including our case, 29 cases of endometrioid and 32 of mucinous carcinoma of the prostate reported in the Japanese literature are reviewed.
