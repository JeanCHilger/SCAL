Adenomyosis--an unusual cause of sciatic pain. We report the case of a female patient who presented with a 5-month history of sciatic pain. She was referred to us for investigation and eventual surgical treatment of a suspected herniated lumbar intervertebral disc. Because of an ill-defined clinical picture at admission, she was treated conservatively. After 2 weeks without any improvement, imaging of the spine by MR was performed. No signs of a herniated disc or intraspinal, space-occupying lesion were apparent, but a right paramedian pelvic mass was seen. Ultrasonography confirmed an enlarged, irregular uterus. Hysterectomy abolished the symptoms.
