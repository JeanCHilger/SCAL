Spontaneous and induced synthesis of cytokines by peripheral blood monocytes in patients with endometriosis. To investigate the capacity of peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) from women with endometriosis to secrete tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL) IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10.Peripheral blood monocytes were cultured in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide for 24 hours before assessment of cytokines in supernatants by enzyme immunoassay.Institute for the Study and Treatment of Endometriosis and university-based research laboratories.Fertile controls, n - 10 women with endometriosis, n = 20.None.Basal synthesis of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 and the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated synthesis of TNF-alpha by PBM from women with endometriosis was significantly greater in comparison to that of fertile controls. Endometriosis had no effect on the basal or stimulated synthesis of IL-10.These data show that endometriosis is associated with increased basal and stimulated synthesis and secretion of several different cytokines by PBM. Each of the cytokines found to be affected has the capacity to play a role in the symptomatology or pathogenesis of the disease.
