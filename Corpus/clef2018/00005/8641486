Flow cytometric evaluation of leukocyte subpopulations in the follicular fluids of infertile patients. To evaluate the leukocyte subpopulations present in follicular fluid (FF) of infertile patients undergoing IVF-ET for tubal factor, idiopathic infertility, and endometriosis.Sixty patients undergoing IVF-ET with a tubal factor diagnosis (n = 35), idiopathic infertility (n = 13), and endometriosis (n = 12) had their subpopulations of FF leukocytes analyzed by flow cytometry.Nonblood-contaminated samples of FF were collected under sterile conditions and centrifuged. Cells were labeled with a panel of monoclonal antibodies: anti-CD3, -CD4, -CD8, -CD14, -CD20, -CD45, and -CD56, and analyzed by cytofluorometry.Follicular fluid leukocytes from patients with idiopathic infertility had a significantly higher proportion of T lymphocytes than tubal factor and endometriosis patients. Endometriosis patients had significantly higher proportions of natural killer (NK) cells, B lymphocytes, and monocytes compared with groups of idiopathic infertility and tubal factor.The differences observed in the leukocyte subpopulations from FF of patients with idiopathic infertility and endometriosis may affect folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation. Moreover, these modifications could be one of the factors altering their fertility.
