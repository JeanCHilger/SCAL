Laparoscopic treatment of ovarian endometrioma. One year follow-up. Thirty-six women with ultrasonographic diagnosis of ovarian endometrioma (bilateral in nine of them), have been treated laparoscopically. After the surgical procedure the patients were assigned to one of the following regimes: Gn-RH-a for 3 months, oral contraceptives if they wanted to avoid pregnancy, or nothing. The follow-up consisted in 1-3-6-12 months ultrasound. The first recurrences were observed at the 6-month ultrasound with an overall recurrence rate after 12 months of 11%. Improvement of pain symptoms occurred in 87% of the patients and fertility rate was 45%.
