Expression of E-cadherin, alpha- and beta-catenin mRNAs in ovarian endometriosis. To establish the mechanism of development of ovarian endometriosis from the biological function of the adherens junction, we have investigated the expression of E-cadherin, alpha- and beta-catenin mRNAs in ovarian endometriosis in comparison with that in normal uterine endometrium. The expression of E-cadherin, alpha- and beta-catenin mRNAs in ovarian endometriosis was not altered during the menstrual cycle. On the other hand, the expression in normal uterine endometrium significantly was increased at the secretory phase, and was significantly higher than that in ovarian endometriosis. In conclusion, the expression of E-cadherin, alpha- and beta-catenin mRNAs for adherens junction in ovarian endometriosis appeared to be decreased after ovulation, which might, at least in part, contribute to detachment as the first step of development of endometriotic cells.
