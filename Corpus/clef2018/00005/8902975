Cyclic sciatica. A manifestation of compression of the sciatic nerve by endometriosis. A case report. A case of cyclic sciatica secondary to ovarian cyst endometriosis is presented.To report the clinical description and magnetic resonance imaging aspects of cyclic sciatica.Endometriosis of the sciatic nerve is rare, but must be included in the differential diagnosis of sciatic mononeuropathies.The authors report a new case of a woman whose cyclic sciatica was caused by an ovarian cystic endometriosis lesion.Magnetic resonance imaging was described as hyper- and hypointense on T1-weighted sequences, and hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences at the sciatic notch.Magnetic resonance imaging may permit a specific diagnosis of this unusual cause of sciatica by showing a hemorrhagic mass in the region of the sciatic nerve. Early recognition is necessary to prevent permanent damage to the sciatic nerve.
