Comparison of transvaginal sonography and bimanual pelvic examination in patients with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis. To determine the usefulness of noninvasive clinical tests to diagnose symptomatic endometriosis, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 91 patients with chronic pelvic pain and laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis. Thirty-seven women (41%) had pelvic peritoneal endometrial implants with adhesions in 44 (48%) the ovaries were also affected, and in 10 (11%) the disease involved both the uterus and ovaries. Seventy-nine (87%) women had dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, or both. Forty-three (47%) had a normal bimanual pelvic examination and 37 (41%) an unremarkable transvaginal sonographic evaluation (no significant difference). The women were divided into two groups: group 1, in whom the disease extended to the ovaries and uterus, and group 2, those in whom only peritoneal implants and adhesions were present. In group 1, 48 women (89%) had an abnormal ultrasonographic evaluation compared with only 4 (11%) in group 2 (p <0.001). Our findings indicate that bimanual pelvic examination and transvaginal sonography are equally accurate in detecting endometriosis
