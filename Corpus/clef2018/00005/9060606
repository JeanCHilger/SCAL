Florid soft-tissue decidual reaction: a potential mimic of neoplasia. While undergoing a repeat Caesarian section, a 21-year-old woman was found to have a subcutaneous, 3.5-cm tumor-like lesion in the abdominal wall. It had a lobulated contour and consisted of gelatinous tan nodules with intervening fibrous septa. It had a composite histology, including a solid pattern of large glassy cells with a predominant perivascular and pericystic/cisternal topography (35% surface area) a pattern of dyscohesive, vacuolated cells including physaliphorous-like forms (35% surface area)
