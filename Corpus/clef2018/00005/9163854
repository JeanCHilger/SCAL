Tubal endometriosis diagnosed within one month after menarche: a case report. A 13-year-old nulligravida girl, 158.5 cm in height and 76.0 kg in body weight, came to our department complaining of continuous right lower abdominal pain. One month earlier, an ovarian cyst in the right ovary, about 3 cm in diameter, was found when she underwent appendectomy at another hospital, but was left untreated. Menarche occurred at the age of 13 years and 1 month, which was after the appendectomy and 24 days before the present operation. Right hematosalpinx with peripheral obstruction and a para-ovarian serous cyst on the same side were diagnosed, and therefore right salpingectomy with para-ovarian cyst resection was performed. The bilateral ovaries and uterus were completely normal by inspection. The post operative histological examination confirmed hematosalpinx and revealed tubal endometriosis.
