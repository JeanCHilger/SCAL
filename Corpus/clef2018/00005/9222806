Changes in immunologic variables (TNF-a, sCD8 and sCD4) during danazol treatment in patients with endometriosis. The levels of TNF-a, sCD8, and sCD4 were measured in serum samples taken from 20 women. Blood samples for TNF-a, sCD8 and sCD4 levels were taken from 10 endometriotic women before treatment, during the last 15 days of a 6-month administration of danazol and 3 months after treatment. Blood samples were taken only once from 10 women without endometriosis (control group).TNF-a levels were higher in women with endometriosis before treatment compared to controls (P < .05). Administration of the drug significantly reduced the levels of TNF-a (P < .01) and sCD8 (P < .001).This study indicates that danazol significantly reduces endometriosis-associated autoimmune abnormalities.
