Adjuvant therapy in uterine myoma. Many-year studies and clinical experience with steroidal and peptide sexual hormone agonists and antagonists of different generations provides a pathogenetic concept for their use in the treatment of patients with uterine myoma. The impact of adjuvant therapy has been found to be determined by tumor tissue sensitivity to hormonal effects, dosages, therapy duration to a greater extent than the type of a drug from this group. The scope of indications for drug use to suppress the growth of a tumor is limited by its small sizes and its concurrence with benign endometrial hyperplastic processes and/or early internal genital endometriosis.
