Angiogenesis. Endometriosis remains a significant cause of pain and ill health for women and is a significant factor in reducing quality of life for women. The ability of desquamated endometrium to attach and implant within the peritoneal cavity is dependent upon its ability to establish and maintain an adequate blood supply. New vascularization is therefore a key part in the progression of endometriosis. Increased angiogenic activity is present in the peritoneal cavity of patients who suffer from the disease and more recently the potent angiogenic growth factor VEGF has been shown to be increased in the peritoneal fluid in patients with this disease. Whilst the desquamated endometrium itself under the influence of hypoxia further to retrograde menstruation is a likely rich source of VEGF, activated peritoneal fluid macrophages and infiltrating macrophages are also a rich source of this angiogenic growth factor. Surprisingly, steroidal regulation of macrophage expression of VEGF also appears to be a feature of this disease.
