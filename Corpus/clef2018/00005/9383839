Does disruption of immune and endocrine systems by environmental toxins contribute to development of endometriosis? The proper function of the normal human endometrium relies on well organized cell-cell interactions regulated locally by cytokines and growth factors under the direction of steroid hormones. The onset and progression of the disease processes of endometriosis may result from disruptions of this well balanced cellular equilibrium. Evidence continues to accumulate indicating that environmental toxins, whether naturally occurring or man-made, may directly (hormone disruptor) or indirectly (immune toxin) affect the response of the endometrium to steroids, resulting in various pathological states including endometriosis.
