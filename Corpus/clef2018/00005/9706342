Importance of the study of the expression of MIB-1 (Ki-67) for the diagnosis of endocervical glandular lesions. The morphological criteria for the diagnosis of endocervical atypia and dysplasia are variably defined. Diagnosis is difficult. MIB-1 (Ki-67) cell proliferation-associated antigen was detected retrospectively by immunohistochemistry in 230 cervical cone specimens. The percentage of MIB-1 positive cells was 1 to 25% (median 2%) and limited to small hot spots in normal and subnormal glands (140 cases). It was 1 to 30% (median 4%) in endometrioid metaplasia and microglandular hyperplasia (55 cases) 30 to 60 (median 40%) and limited to 1-3 glands in atypia (24 cases)
