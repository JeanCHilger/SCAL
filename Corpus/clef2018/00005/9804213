Aneuploidy in human granulosa lutein cells obtained from gonadotrophin-stimulated follicles and its relation to intrafollicular hormone concentrations. Proliferation of granulosa cells is inversely related to differentiation and hormone production. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the intrafollicular and serum steroid concentrations and to compare these results to granulosa cell proliferation as measured by DNA flow cytometry. Human granulosa lutein cells in follicular fluid of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) patients were investigated with regard to ploidy, percentage of S-phase cells and proliferation index (PI: percentage of cells in the S- and G2/M-phase). The study was originally designed to indicate an additional marker for the outcome of IVF treatment by DNA flow cytometric measurements of granulosa lutein cells. Follicular fluids of 160 follicles (45 patients) were evaluated 45.6% (n = 73) of the follicles showed aneuploid granulosa lutein cells and 5.6% (n = 9) of the follicles contained multiploid granulosa cells, defined as at least two aneuploid populations of cells with different DNA indices. A total of 48.8% (n = 78) of the follicles had only diploid cells. Thus >50 % of the investigated follicles showed aneuploidy. In all, 73% (33 of 45) of patients had at least one follicle containing aneuploid granulosa lutein cells. The PI of the aneuploid cell populations significantly exceeded that of the diploid cell populations (median: aneuploid: 15.5
