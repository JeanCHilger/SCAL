Thymidine phosphorylase expression is predominantly observed in stroma of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of endometrium and correlates with a frequency of vascular involvement. Thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase) expression was studied in 20 cases of well-differentiated endometrial carcinomas to examine the clinicopathological significance. Immunohistochemical study showed predominant dThdPase expression in tumor stroma. No expression was detected in coexisting normal endometrial stroma or stroma of endometriosis. Seven cases (35%) showed strong stain and 13 (65%) showed weak stain. Based on the strength of immunoreactivity, patients were grouped into two groups: group S (strong) and group W (weak). In group S, 5 (71%) showed vascular involvement whereas in group W, only 3 (23%) cases were positive, giving a significant difference in the frequency of vascular involvement between the two groups (P < 0.03, chi2 analysis). No correlation was found between dThdPase expression and myometrial invasion. Patients with vascular involvement resulted in poorer outcome (P < 0.003) whereas between group S and W, there showed no difference in survival (group S vs group W P < 0.15). A multivariate analysis including stage, vascular involvement, and dThdPase stain as variables showed none as independent risk factors. However, univariate analysis showed that the presence of a vascular involvement was a risk factor for a shorter survival (relative risk = 6.277, 95% range = 1.2-32.6, P < 0. 03). It is concluded that expression of dThdPase in endometrial carcinoma is a marker of a desmoreaction and a risk factor for vascular invasion. Since vascular invasion is a risk factor for poor outcome, the significance of dThdPase expression in endometrial carcinoma requires further clinical evaluations.
