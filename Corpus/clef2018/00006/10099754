Radical surgery for endometriosis. Infiltrative endometriosis is an uncommon condition that may involve all pelvic organs and is associated with considerable morbidity. A small percentage of patients will have disease that is unresponsive to hormonal therapy and is unsuitable for conservative surgery. Presented is a review of 5 case reports of patients who required radical surgery for control of symptoms caused by endometriosis. Radical surgery was associated with minimal morbidity and a high rate of resolution of symptoms. Radical surgery should be considered as part of the treatment strategy particularly when there is evidence of endometriosis invading into the adjacent gastrointestinal tract or urinary tract.
