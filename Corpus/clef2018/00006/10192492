Carcinosarcoma, endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma and endometriosis after tamoxifen therapy in breast cancer. The fourth case of heterologous mesodermal tumour of the uterine corpus, that developed, years following tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer in a postmenopausal woman with no previous pelvic irradiation, is presented with coincidental endometriosis and endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma. This coincidence after tamoxifen treatment appears to be an indication for the possible carcinogenic potency of tamoxifen.
