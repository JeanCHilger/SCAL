The genetics of endometriosis. There is mounting evidence that endometriosis is inherited as a complex trait, like diabetes or asthma. This implies there are environmental factors, such as dioxin, that are interacting with multiple genetic susceptibility loci to produce the phenotype. The Oxford Endometriosis Gene (OXEGENE) study, an international collaborative project, seeks to identify the susceptibility loci using linkage analysis the aim then is to use positional cloning techniques to identify genes that predispose women to the disease. Analysis of the biochemical function of the gene products will lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology and aetiology of endometriosis. New therapies may be designed based upon knowledge of the gene function and disease associated genetic markers may be used to identify women at high risk of developing the disease.
