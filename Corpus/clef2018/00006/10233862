Physiological and cytogenetic characterization of immortalized human endometriotic cells containing episomal simian virus 40 DNA. The study of misplaced endometrial cells, which abnormally implant and grow outside the uterine cavity, is of considerable interest for the understanding of the pathophysiology of endometriosis. However, endometriotic cells, particularly epithelial cells, required for primary cell culture are not easily available. We report here the characterization of an endometriotic cell line immortalized after infection of primary endometriotic cell cultures with simian virus 40. Transformed cells express T-antigen, and blot hybridization analysis showed that the viral genome is present as an episome. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a polyploid karyotype with numerical and structural rearrangements involving mainly the same chromosomes (6, 10, 11, 15, and 17). The cell line has been maintained in culture for over 80 passages and was still proliferating without any noticeable change in the biological properties investigated. Transformed endometriotic cells expressed both progesterone and estradiol receptors and were stimulated by these ovarian hormones to secrete monocyte chemotactic protein-1, a factor that may play an important role in the recruitment and activation of peritoneal macrophages. In addition, this response was enhanced in interleukin-1-treated cells. Taken together, these findings support the view that this cell line may be an interesting tool for the study of the pathophysiology of endometriosis.
