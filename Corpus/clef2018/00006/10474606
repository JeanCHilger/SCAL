Diaphragmatic endometriosis. Endometriosis is a relatively common condition usually found in the pelvis. However, lesions do occur outside the pelvis and, more rarely, in the upper abdomen. In the case reported here, the patient presented with chronic right shoulder tip pain. The diagnosis of extrapelvic endometriosis is often not considered in such circumstances. This patient's symptoms were relieved by surgical excision of the diaphragmatic lesion.
