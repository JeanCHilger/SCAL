Genetic factors of predisposition to endometriosis and response to its treatment. The relative frequencies of the normal (+) and null (0) alleles of the glutathione-S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) gene, as well as those of the rapid (R) and slow (S) forms of N-acetyl transferase 2 (NAT-2), were studied in the Russian and French populations and in endometriosis (EM) patients. In the total Russian and French populations, the proportions of homozygotes for deletion in gene GstM1 (0/0) were 42.2 and 45.8%, respectively, whereas in Russian and French EM patients, these values were 58.6 and 76.9%, respectively. The differences in these proportions between the total population and subjects with EM were significant at the confidence levels of 0.98 (chi 2 = 5.45 P < 0.02) and 0.90 (chi 2 = 3.01
