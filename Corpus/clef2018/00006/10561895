Endometriosis. 27 year old Melinda presents to you with increasingly severe dysmenorrhoea. She has been using condoms for contraception and is no longer able to control the pain with the anti inflammatory tablets you suggested at the last consultation 6 months ago. She also complains of the recent development of deep dyspareunia. She has been in her current relationship for the last 5 years. Examination illicits similar pain and tenderness to that which she feels during intercourse. A Pap smear and STD screen are normal. You refer her to a gynaecologist who undertakes a laparoscopy on Melinda. What is seen? Ovarian adhesions secondary to endometriosis (Figure 1). Classic endometriosis (Figure 2).
