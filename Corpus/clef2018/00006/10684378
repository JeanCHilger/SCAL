Endometrioid carcinoma arising in pericecal endometriosis clinically mimicking Crohn's disease. A case of endometrioid carcinoma arising in pericecal endometriosis that clinically and radiologically mimicked Crohn's disease is presented. After developing several complications of steroid therapy for presumed Crohn's disease, a 48-year-old woman developed intestinal obstruction and underwent a right hemicolectomy. A pericecal mass composed of endometriosis and endometrioid carcinoma and a locally metastatic ileal carcinoid tumor were resected. The patient recovered fully and is clinically free of tumor at 36 months. The pertinent literature is reviewed and the etiologic, therapeutic, and prognostic implications of this case are discussed.
