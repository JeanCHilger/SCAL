Induction of an angiogenic phenotype in endometriotic stromal cell cultures by interleukin-1beta. Activated peritoneal macrophages are associated with endometriosis and may play a central role in its aetiology by releasing interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in response to refluxed endometrium. Pari passu with the establishment of endometriotic implants is the development of a vascular supply. In this study we investigated the angiogenic properties of two endometrial proteins, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and assessed their production in response to IL-1beta stimulation in human stromal cells isolated from normal endometrium (NE) and endometriotic lesions (EI). Proliferation of bovine brain capillary endothelial cells (BBCE) with a [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation assay was observed when VEGF (2.1 +/- 0.2-fold P < 0.05) or VEGF and IL-6 (1.8 +/- 0.1-fold
