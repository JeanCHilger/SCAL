Effect of an in vitro fertilization program on serum CA 125, tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor, free beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin, and common alpha-subunit of glycoprotein hormones. To investigate the impact of an IVF program on serum levels of tumor markers CA 125, tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor, free hCG beta-subunit, and free glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit.A prospective controlled clinical study.Outpatient university infertility clinic.Seventy-one infertile patients (with tubal occlusion, pelvic endometriosis, or unexplained infertility) undergoing IVF and nine control women with regular menstrual cycles.Serial blood sampling before, during, and after IVF, or during one ovulatory menstrual cycle in the controls.Serum levels of CA 125, tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor, hCG-beta, and glycoprotein hormone-alpha.Before IVF, all tumor markers were within the normal range except for CA 125, which was elevated in patients with endometriosis. IVF led to significant increases in CA 125 and glycoprotein hormone-alpha that differed from the changes seen during normal menstrual cycles. The luteal phase increase in CA 125 correlated with levels of E(2) and P and the number of follicles. Two months after IVF, levels of CA 125 were 12% higher than levels before treatment. Tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor and hCG-beta revealed no cyclicity.An IVF regimen increased the release of CA 125 and glycoprotein hormone-alpha. The CA 125 elevation after IVF implies a persistent effect of ovarian hyperstimulation on CA 125 release.
