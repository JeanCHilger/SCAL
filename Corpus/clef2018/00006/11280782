Expression of erbB-4/HER-4 growth factor receptor isoforms in ovarian cancer. Immunohistochemical expression of erbB4 protein was identified in 93% (49 of 53) of ovarian cancers using the HFR-1 antibody (targeted to the cytoplasmic domain of the erbB4 receptor) and in 89% (47 of 53) of ovarian cancers using the H4.77.16 antibody (targeted to the extracellular domain). Tumors of serous histology were more likely to express a higher level of erbB4 than endometrioid tumors, and for stage III serous tumors, long-term survival was associated with moderate to high coexpression of erbB4 and erbB2. Within ovarian cancer cell lines, high erbB4 expression was associated with cisplatin resistance. Using reverse transcription-PCR, the presence of multiple isoforms of erbB4 mRNA was identified in both ovarian primary tumors and cell lines. Splice variants in the juxtamembrane (JM-a and JM-d) and cytoplasmic (CT-a and CT-b) regions were identified in mRNA of both cell lines and primary tumors. The use of an anti-erbB4 blocking antibody suggested that erbB4 was not the mediator of the growth stimulatory effects of neuregulin in ovarian cancer cells and indeed could potentially antagonize this effect.
