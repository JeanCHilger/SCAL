The success of laser laparoscopy in the treatment of endometriosis: a two-step analysis. The most advantageous treatment for nonextensive endometriosis has long been the subject of debate. In recent years, the ability to detect atypical presentations has allowed the gynecological surgeon to treat this disease more readily. The treatment in the past has only been concerned with the singular treatment being applied at the time, not on the effects that previous treatments have had. The purpose of the current study was to see whether previous unsuccessful treatment modalities affected subsequent laser laparoscopy treatment of endometriosis.Patients who were previously treated for their endometriosis (minimal and mild) underwent treatment of their disease by laser laparoscopy and the results were analyzed by chi2 (chi-square) analysis.Those patients previously treated with laser laparoscopy and laparotomy demonstrated poorer results than those previously treated with expectant, medical, or cautery. The sum of the original treatments plus the second treatment of laser laparoscopy was equal in all groups.If endometriosis is diagnosed at the time of laparoscopy and is easily amenable to treatment, it behooves the physician to treat it at the time of surgery.
