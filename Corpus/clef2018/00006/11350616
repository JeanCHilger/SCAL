Endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising from adenomyosis: report and immunohistochemical analysis of an unusual case. A case of endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising from adenomyosis is reported. The patient was a 53-year-old woman who complained of vulvar itching. Smear cytology of the endometrium revealed adenocarcinoma. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis revealed a lesion with a slightly high intensity in the uterine fundus on a T2-weighted image. Semiradical total hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy were performed, followed by chemotherapy. Histologically, the lesion in the uterine fundus was composed mostly of adenocarcinoma with stromal invasion. There were many adenomyotic foci in and around the carcinoma, including some showing transition to adenocarcinoma. There was no malignant finding in the normally situated endometrium. The carcinoma invaded in the myometrium, involving the uterine serosa, but no dissemination to the peritoneal cavity was found. The carcinoma was, therefore, considered to be endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising from adenomyosis. Immunohistochemistry showed expression of p53 oncoprotein and Ki-67 antigen in the carcinoma cells. The value of immunohistochemistry in predicting prognosis is discussed.
