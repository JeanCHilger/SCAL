Prognostic significance of hysteroscopic imaging in endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to relate hysteroscopic features of endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma to stage, grade and overall survival.Sixty women with endometrioid adenocarcinoma underwent laparotomy and staging according to current FIGO classification. Before surgery hysteroscopy was performed in all patients to establish the morphology of neoplasia, the extent of endometrial lining involvement, and endocervical spreading. These hysteroscopic parameters were related to overall survival, surgical stage, and grade of disease.First-stage carcinomas were found in 50 patients, second-stage in 4, third-stage in 3, and fourth-stage in 3 patients. Well-differentiated tumors were detected in 32, moderately differentiated in 21, and poorly differentiated in 7 patients. The cumulative 48-month probability of survival was 86.6%. The morphology of adenocarcinomas was unrelated to both their stage and their grade no relationship to survival was found. The extent of carcinomatous spread within the endometrial cavity was significantly related to stage, grade, and survival. Endometrial lining involvement of less than 50% was associated with 100% survival, 97.1% of first-stage diseases, and 96.6% of low-grade carcinomas. These percentages dropped to 73.1, 65.3 (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.001), and 76.9% (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.035), respectively, when tumoral growth involved more than half of the endometrium. Hysteroscopy detected all carcinomas metastasizing to the cervixThe extent of endometrial lining involvement in patients with endometrioid carcinoma provides preoperative information on the risk of extrauterine spread. We confirm the high accuracy of hysteroscopy in excluding cervical spread.
