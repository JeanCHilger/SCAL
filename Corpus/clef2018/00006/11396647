Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist: how good is the new hope? Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists have been widely used to prevent luteinizing hormone surges during controlled ovarian stimulation in assisted reproductive technologies. Treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists of uterine myoma, endometriosis and some hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast, ovarian, endometrial and prostate cancer, also seems to have a beneficial effect. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists have the disadvantage of inducing an initial stimulatory effect on gonadotropin secretion, necessitating 2-3 weeks before pituitary desensitization is achieved. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists, on the contrary, cause an immediate inhibition of gonadotropin secretion by competitive blocking of pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors. Some advantages of their clinical use in controlled ovarian stimulation have already been demonstrated. Randomized comparative studies are needed to investigate their benefit over gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists for myoma and hormone-related disorders.
