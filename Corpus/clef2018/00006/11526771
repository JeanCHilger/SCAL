Two years experience of laparoscopic management of the deep posterior vaginal endometriosis. Our three year experiences of laparoscopic operations recto-vaginal endometriosis is presented here. We treated 15 patients. The main symptom was severe dyspaurenia. Laparoscopic (n = 14) and laparotomic (n = 1) excision of endometriotic nodules resulted in considerable pain relief. The surgical techniques was excision with scissors and bipolar coagulation. In all the procedures the anterior rectum was freed to the loose areolar tissue of the recto-vaginal septum, prior to excising deep fibrotic endometriosis. Operation time was average 135 minutes and intraoperative blood loss was minimal. Postoperative hospital stay was average 4.8 days. Fourteen patients were free from the preoperative symptoms at six month follow-up. Laparoscopic surgery for deep recto-vaginal endometriosis is an effective treatment and offers significant symptom relief.
