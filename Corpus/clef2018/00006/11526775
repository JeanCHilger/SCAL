Endometriosis of the appendix vermiformis. 11 cases of the endometriosis of the appendix vermiformis were analyzed among women in age between 19-57 years. We observed that endometriosis of appendix were accompanied by advanced stages of the ovarian or peritoneum endometriosis in 9 cases. Diagnosis of endometriosis of the appendix is almost impossible before operation because it often could be covered by other genital organs diseases such like: uterine fibromas, ectopic pregnancy, PID.
