Menorrhagia and adenomyosis in a patient with hyperhomocysteinemia, recurrent pelvic vein thromboses and extensive uterine collateral circulation treatment by supracervical hysterectomy. A 37-year-old patient had recurring thromboses, occlusion of the left femoral vein with hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia, hypermenorrhea and anaemia. Conservative therapy with endometrium ablation and gestagene failed. A supracervical hysterectomy was done to preserve the presacral and left lateral, dorsal and caudal collaterals beside the uterus, and prevent a postoperative congestion, especially of the left leg.
