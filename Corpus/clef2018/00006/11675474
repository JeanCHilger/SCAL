Linkage and association studies of the relationship between endometriosis and genes encoding the detoxification enzymes GSTM1, GSTT1 and CYP1A1. An association between endometriosis and the glutathione S-transferase (GST) M1 null mutation has been reported in French and Slavic populations. We aimed to replicate this association of endometriosis in a UK population, and to test for association with the GSTT1 null mutation or the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 MspI polymorphism. We genotyped 148 women each with endometriosis (sporadic cases, n = 91 familial cases, n = 57), a population control of 95 male blood donors, and a control group of 53 women with a normal pelvis at hysterectomy. No significant differences were found between cases and controls in the frequencies of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 null mutations, or the CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism. However, the combination of the GSTM1 null genotype and the CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism was associated with a small increased risk of endometriosis, and this warrants further investigation. We also tested for linkage to the chromosome 1p13 region, to which GSTM1 has been mapped, in 52 sister-pairs with stage III-IV disease using three highly polymorphic microsatellite markers. However, there was no evidence of linkage, suggesting that this region may not be implicated in disease susceptibility.
