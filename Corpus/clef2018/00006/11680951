Diagnosis and follow-up of endometriosis during consultation: changes. In a literature review, news in symptomatology and follow-up of endometriosis were analyzed (infertility, pain, hemorrhage, adnexal tumors). Survey and examination can be made with improved quality (pain scale, menorragha scheme of Higham). Diagnosis and follow-up of endometriosis are more perfect by ultrasonographical examination by the gynecologist in his office. Ultrasonography is better for endometrioma and adenomyosis than other localisation (complementary explorations-magnetic resonance imaging, outside of consultation, are useful for deeper and superficial lesions). In follow-up, clinical research and ultrasonic exploration show the true relapses. Treatment's observance and success will be improved by ultrasonic analysis. Intolerances, add-back therapy, contraception, substitutive hormonal treatment of menopauses and cancer risk, are different problem and solution will be offer.
