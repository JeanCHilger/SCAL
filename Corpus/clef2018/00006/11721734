Successful laparoscopic treatment of ileo-cecal endometriosis producing bowel obstruction. Bowel endometriosis manifesting with ileus is difficult to diagnose, often requiring laparotomy for diagnosis and treatment. We report here a case of ileo-cecal endometriosis causing bowel obstruction. A diagnosis of intestinal endometriosis with menstruation-associated bowel symptoms was made, and the patient was successfully treated by laparoscopic ileo-cecal resection.
