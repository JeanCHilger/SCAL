Danazol and limb-threatening arterial thrombosis: two case reports. Danazol is a synthetic androgenic steroid used clinically for the treatment of a wide variety of disorders. Although there is no extensive evidence that androgens are thrombogenic in humans, there are case reports of cerebral, coronary, and peripheral arterial thrombosis in young male athletes abusing anabolic-androgenic steroids. There are also two reported cases of arterial and venous thrombotic events attributed to danazol therapy. We report two additional cases of limb-threatening arterial thrombosis in patients undergoing danazol therapy, and suggest the possibility that danazol may be an independent risk factor for arterial thrombosis.
