Expression of human leucocyte antigen in ectopic endometrial tissue of endometriosis. To investigate the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) expression of ectopic endometrial epithelial cells in cases with endometriosis and its role in pathogenesis of endometriosis.By immunohistochemical analysis, HLA expression was observed in ectopic endometrial epithelial cells of 25 endometriosis patients. Ectopic endometrial cells were cultured in vitro successfully and the expression of HLA were analyzed by flow cytometry in 10 out of the 25 patients. Eutopic endometrium of 15 normal women were taken as control.(1) Expression of HLA class I molecule on ectopic endometrial epithelial cells of endometriosis measured by the immunohistochemical analysis was lower than those of controls, (4.0 +/- 0.5) score and (1.2 +/- 0.8) score respectively. So was the expression rate by flow cytometry in vitro culture (63.38 +/- 11.88)% and (5.27 +/- 2.88)% respectively (P < 0.01). (2) The expression of HLA class II molecule on ectopic endometrial epithelial cells of endometriosis was significantly increased. The outcome by immunohistochemical analysis was (0.2 +/- 0.1) score (control group) and (4.1 +/- 0.7) score (case group) and by flow cytometry was (7.19 +/- 2.43)% and (58.57 +/- 14.99)% respectively (P < 0.01).The abnormal HLA expression could play a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
