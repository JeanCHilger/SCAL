Evaluation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 levels in serum and peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis. To evaluate the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) before and after conservative laparoscopic surgery in patients with endometriosis.The TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels in serum and peritoneal fluid of 20 endometriotic patients and 10 control patients were determined by radioimmunoassay.Significant parallel relationship existed between the stage of endometriosis and the TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels in serum and peritoneal fluid in endometriosis patients (r values: serum: 0.80, 0.52 peritoneal fluid: 0.79, 0.49, P < 0.05). After clearance of endometriosis foci with laparoscopic conservative surgery, the TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels decreased significantly.Measuring TNF-alpha and IL-6 level may have important value in postoperative follow-up, surveillance and evaluation of the effectiveness of surgery.
