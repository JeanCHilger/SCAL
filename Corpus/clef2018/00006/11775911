Expression of mismatch repair gene hMSH2 in human malignant ovarian tumors and its clinical significance. To study the expression of hMSH2 gene in human malignant ovarian tumor and its relationship to clinicopathological characteristics.The expression of hMSH2 gene in 42 patients with malignant ovarian tumor was detected by immunohistochemistry streptomycin peroxidel method using monoclonal antibody to hMSH2 protein.hMSH2 expression was observed in the 26 of 42 malignant ovarian tumors (62%), more frequently present in serous and mucinous adenocarcinoma (80%, 80%) than in endometrioid adenocarcinoma and malignant germinal tumors (1/6, 1/6) (P < 0.05). It was significantly higher in high grade than in low grade (P < 0.05), and the reduced expression of hMSH2 was also significantly more often in lymphnodes metastasized cases. Statistical analysis indicated that hMSH2 expression wasn't related to the stage of the tumors.These results suggest that the abnormal expression of hMSH2 might be involved in the carcinogenesis process and progression of malignant tumor, and that the loss of the hMSH2 protein expression might be a useful predictor of early diagnosis and prognosis of malignant ovarian tumor.
