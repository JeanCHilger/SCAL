Assessment of the PCNA and P53 proteins expression in the proliferative, hyperplastic and neoplastic human endometrium. In the current study, PCNA and p53 proteins were immunohistochemically studied in the proliferative (n = 5), hyperplastic (n = 4) and neoplastic (n = 20) human endometrium. PCNA immunostaining was noted in 2 out of 5 (40%) proliferative, 4 out of 4 (100%) hyperplastic, and in 18 out of 20 (90%) neoplastic slides. Concomitant PCNA and p53 expression was reported in 12 out of 20 (60%) malignant tumors. All non-endometrioid neoplasms were PCNA-positive, suggested this proliferative marker is commonly expressed in the unfavorable histological types of endometrial cancer.
