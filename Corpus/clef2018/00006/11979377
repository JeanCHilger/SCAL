Microsatellite instability, loss of heterozygosity, and loss of hMLH1 and hMSH2 protein expression in endometrial carcinoma. Microsatellite instability (MSI) due to replication errors occurs frequently in hereditary tumors. Association with functional inactivation of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes and lack of protein expression has been described. In endometrial carcinoma (EC), the prevalence and clinical significance of these phenomena are not well known. Therefore, DNA samples from 89 EC and 5 metachronous tumors were analyzed with polymerase chain reaction, using 5 microsatellite markers and a DNA sequencer for amplicon detection. The results were correlated with immunohistochemistry of hMLH1 and hMSH2. MSI at >or=2 loci (MSI-H) was detected in 10/89 EC (11%) 1 of 10 showed loss of both hMLH1 and hMSH2, and 5 of 10 showed loss of hMLH1 (P < 0.0001). MSI-H was observed frequently in tumors with mucinous differentiation (P = 0.048), >10% of solid-cribriform pattern (P = 0.037), International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO) stage III to IV (4 of 13
