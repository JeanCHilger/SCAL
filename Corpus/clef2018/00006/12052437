Priming effects of novel nonsteroidal progesterone receptor modulators CP8816 and CP8863 on the development of adenomyosis in the mouse uterus. The possibility of therapeutic application of novel nonsteroidal progesterone receptor modulators CP8816 and CP8863 for preventing the development of uterine adenomyosis was investigated in mice. First priming effects of CP8816 on 17beta-estradiol (E2)-induced cell division in uterine tissues were examined. As a result, pretreatment with CP8816 or progesterone significantly suppressed the elevation of the mitotic activity in the luminal epithelial cells of mice treated with E2 later. Priming with CP8816 had little effect on the stromal cells, but progesterone priming caused an increase of stromal mitotic activity in mice treated with E2 later. To evaluate the inhibitory effect of these compounds on the development of adenomyosis induced experimentally by pituitary grafting, 7-week-old female mice were isografted with a single anterior pituitary in the uterus and divided into four groups. Two groups of mice were given daily subcutaneous injections of 1 mg of CP8816 or the vehicle alone for 6 weeks from the day after the grafting. Remaining two groups of mice were given oral administration of 1 mg of CP8863 or the vehicle only for 5 weeks starting one week after the grafting. The incidence of adenomyosis was significantly lower in the groups of mice treated with CP8816 and CP8863 than in the respective control groups. The mechanism by which CP compounds inhibited the development of adenomyosis might be related to their priming effects, i.e., their inhibitory effect on epithelial cell division and lack of effect on stromal cell division after subsequent exposure to E2.
