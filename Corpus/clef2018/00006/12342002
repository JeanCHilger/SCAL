LHRH analogues in female contraception. Since the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) has been identified and its mode of action understood, it has become possible to imagine a therapeutic use of long acting, nontoxic analogues.  Biochemical modifications of the decapeptide have resulted in the synthesis of potent LH-RH antagonists and agonists.  Paradoxically, however, the agonists, devised to induce ovulation, exert an antagonistic action due to a decrease in the number of pituitary LH-RH receptors and to desensitization of the pituitary gland to the decapeptide.  These inhibitory effects are associated with the prolonged activity of the analogues, in contrast with the stimulant effects of physiological LH-RH which has a short 1/2-life and is secreted in bursts.  These effects have been used in order to inhibit ovulation in female contraception.  Preliminary studies clearly indicate a high efficiency of these molecules devoid of metabolic side effects.  However, it appears necessary to add sequential progestin therapy on a monthly basis as estradiol levels are those of an early follicular phase.  Such a peptide contraception aims at ovulation suppression and not at a complete blockage as in cases of endometriosis and estrogen-dependent cancers.  (author's)
