Analysis of p53 and c-erbB-2 expression in ovarian endometrioid carcinomas arising in endometriosis. We assessed the immunohistochemical expression of p53 and c-erbB-2 oncoproteins in 13 ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas arising from endometriosis (group 1) and compared the findings with 15 otherwise similar cases without associated endometriosis (group 2). Tumors in group 1 showed a higher expression of both p53 and c-erbB-2 (p = 0.015 and p = 0.048, respectively). The expression of the two proteins was also significantly associated in group 1 (p = 0.013) but not in group 2 (p = 0.63) tumors. The different pattern of expression of p53 and c-erbB-2 in the two groups suggests that different molecular pathways may be involved in their pathogenesis.
