The role of CD10 staining in distinguishing invasive endometrial adenocarcinoma from adenocarcinoma involving adenomyosis. Adenomyosis may be involved by endometrial adenocarcinoma, but in contrast to true myometrial invasion, the depth of an adenomyotic focus involved by carcinoma does not alter pathologic tumor staging. Therefore, distinction from carcinoma invading myometrium is clinically relevant. We hypothesized that CD10, a marker of non-neoplastic and neoplastic endometrial stroma, would highlight the stromal component of adenomyotic foci and be useful in this distinction. Thirty-nine cases of endometrial adenocarcinoma were analyzed and divided into three groups: I, invasive endometrial adenocarcinoma (n = 14) II, endometrial adenocarcinoma involving adenomyosis but without myometrial invasion (n = 18)
