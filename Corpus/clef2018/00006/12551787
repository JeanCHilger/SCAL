Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis correlates with the extension of peritoneal implants. To investigate the correlation of the concentrations of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) in the peritoneal fluid (PF) with the extent of peritoneal endometriotic lesions and with the presence of red lesions (RLs).Sixty-seven patients with endometriosis and 19 controls with normal pelvis had PF samples collected during laparoscopy.The concentrations of sICAM-1 in the PF of patients and controls were not different. Patients with peritoneal implant scores 4 or more had higher concentrations of sICAM-1 in the PF than those with implant scores less than 4 (P=0.018) and controls (P=0.031). No significant difference was found in sICAM-1 levels in patients with and without RLs. No correlation was detected between sICAM-1 and interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) in either patients or controls.The increased concentrations of sICAM-1 in the PF of patients with greater implant scores may indicate an active shedding of the molecule from the endometriotic peritoneal tissue. No significant association was found with the presence of RLs. The levels of IL-1beta in the PF were not a relevant factor influencing the concentrations of sICAM-1.
