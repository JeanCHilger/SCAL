Studies on the human leukocyte antigen class I antigens in Japanese patients with macroscopically diagnosed endometriosis. An increasing number of reports suggest that endometriosis is associated with abnormal immune function, although the etiology of the disease remains undefined. The human leukocyte antigen system (HLA) is known to play a role in the etiology of a number of diseases. This study examines the possible association between the HLA system and endometriosis. Fifty-five patients diagnosed with endometriosis by laparoscopic examination were typed for HLA class I antigens - HLA-A, -B, and -C antigens - using the standard microlymphocytotoxity technique of Terasaki. The frequency of HLA-B 54 and that of HLA-Cw7 were significantly higher in the patient population than in the control population. No significant difference was found between the two groups in the frequencies of the other HLA-class I antigens. The results of this study may implicate the HLA system in the development of endometriosis.
