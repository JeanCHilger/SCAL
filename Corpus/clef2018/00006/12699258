Adenomyosis. Adenomyosis is characterized as ectopic endometrial tissues within the myometrium in the uterus. The etiology and pathogenetic mechanism(s) responsible for adenomyosis are poorly understood. Definite diagnosis is made on hysterectomy specimens, although attempts are made at securing preoperative diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging and myometrial biopsies. Definite treatment of symptomatic women is hysterectomy.
