A novel anti-dysmenorrhea therapy with cyclic administration of two Japanese herbal medicines. Using two Japanese herbal medicines, Shakuyaku-kanzo-to (SK) and Toki-shakuyaku-san (TS), we have evaluated a novel strong antidysmenorrhea therapy. SK/TS cyclic therapy, in which the herbs are administered alternately within the menstrual cycle.All of the 17 dysmenorrhea patients including recurrent endometriotic and adenomyotic patients after treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or danazol, obtained complete relief within three months when treated with the SK/TS cyclic therapy. Nine of 12 patients treated with the SK/TS cyclic therapy ovulated as determined by biphasic changes in basal body temperature patterns. All the three secondary ammenorrhea patients with moderate levels of serum estradiol, but not the three secondary amenorrhea patients with little serum estradiol, ovulated during the SK/TS cyclic therapy. One of the treated patients, who had a history of 10 repetitive spontaneous abortions. carried the 11th pregnancy to term resulting in a normal newborn.The SK/TS cyclic therapy can be a conservative antidysmenorrhea therapy for endometriotic and adenomyotic patients who desire pregnancy.
