Overexpression of the p53 protein and allele loss at 17p13 in ovarian carcinoma. Mouse monoclonal antibodies PAb 240 and PAb 1801 which specifically immunoprecipitate p53 protein, were used to examine 27 fresh ovarian tumours (16 serous adenocarcinomas, six endometrioid carcinomas, one mucinous adenocarcinoma, one mucinous borderline tumour and three benign adenomas). Eleven out of 16 (69%) serous adenocarcinomas and one endometrioid tumour showed positive staining with one or both antibodies and none of the mucinous or benign tumours stained with either antibody. DNA from tumour and peripheral blood leukocytes was used to identify allelic deletions on chromosome 17p in tumours. 11/12 positively staining tumours showed less of heterozygosity (LOH) on 17p at the nearest informative locus to the p53 gene. In this series of ovarian tumours, LOH on 17p correlates closely with the aberrant expression of the p53 protein in a high proportion of advanced stage serous adenocarcinomas. This observation suggests that the p53 tumour suppressor gene is involved in the evolution of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and may have prognostic significance.
