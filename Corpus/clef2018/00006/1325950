Receptors for hormones and growth factors and (onco)-gene amplification in human ovarian cancer. Receptor status and gene amplification were studied in advanced human ovarian adenocarcinoma tissues, borderline and benign ovarian tumours and normal ovarian tissues. Sixty-five percent (53/82) of ovarian adenocarcinomas, 57% (8/14) of benign/borderline tumours and only 31% (5/16) of normal ovarian tissues studied showed specific 125I-EGF (epidermal growth factor) binding (median: 17 10
