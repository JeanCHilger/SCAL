Mechanisms involved in the pituitary desensitization induced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. We investigated the mechanisms of desensitization induced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist in the pituitary.Effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist on the pituitary were studied in vitro and in vivo in the rat. In the clinical study serum luteinizing hormone was measured by radioimmunoassay with a polyclonal luteinizing hormone antibody (luteinizing hormone-radioimmunoassay) and by immunoradiometric assay with monoclonal luteinizing hormone antibodies (luteinizing hormone-immunoradiometric assay) during gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment.In the in vitro study bead-attached pituitary cells that were desensitized with a continuous infusion of 10(-7)mol/L gonadotropin-releasing hormone responded to 50 mmol/L K+. In the in vivo study gonadotropin-releasing hormone binding sites and rat luteinizing hormone beta-messenger ribonucleic acid in the pituitary decreased during gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment, but serum levels of rat luteinizing hormone did not decrease. In addition, a disparity between luteinizing hormone-radioimmunoassay and luteinizing hormone-immunoradiometric assay was demonstrated during gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment.Pituitary desensitization in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist may not be wholly receptor mediated and a nonreceptor process may be involved.
