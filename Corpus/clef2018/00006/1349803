Expression of a human multidrug resistance gene in human ovarian carcinoma cell lines. To investigate the possible role of the multidrug resistance phenotype to chemoresistance in human ovarian carcinoma, we have analyzed human multidrug resistance gene (mdr 1) expression in 8 human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines. An increase in P-glycoprotein level specific to multidrug-resistant tumor cells was not apparently associated with the increase in resistance to vincristine (VCR) or doxorubicin (Adriamycin). Mdr 1 transcripts (4.5 kilobases) were observed in the RNA preparation obtained from only one cell line (SHIN-3) that showed the highest resistance to both drugs in vitro and in vivo. No cell lines showed mdr 1 DNA amplification. These results suggest that the insensitivity of human ovarian carcinoma to chemotherapy could be partly explained by the expression of mdr 1.
