Neu oncogene expression in ovarian tumors: a quantitative study. We studied neu mRNA expression by slot blot analysis and protein product expression by capture ELISA and immunohistochemistry in 57 primary and metastatic ovarian neoplasms, two paraovarian leiomyosarcomas, and eight normal ovaries. Some 61% of ovarian tumors but none of the paraovarian neoplasms or normal ovaries overexpressed neu mRNA. A total of 96% of the ovarian tumors that overexpressed neu were of epithelial type. Epithelial ovarian tumors had significantly higher amounts of the neu oncogene product as determined by capture ELISA than either germ cell and stromal tumors or normal ovaries (p less than 0.025). Different subtypes of ovarian carcinomas had significantly different amounts of neu oncogene product as measured by capture ELISA endometrioid tumors had the highest, and poorly differentiated carcinomas not otherwise specified had the lowest (p less than 0.025). ELISA values, mRNA overexpression, and immunohistochemical staining intensity did not correlate with stage at diagnosis or architectural or nuclear grade in ovarian tumors. We conclude that capture ELISA is a simple, effective way to measure the neu oncogene protein product and that there is a good correlation between ELISA levels and immunohistochemical staining intensity. However, ELISA values did not correlate with stage or histologic prognostic factors in ovarian neoplasms.
