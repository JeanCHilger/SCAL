Endometriosis co-existing with bilateral dermoid cysts of the ovaries treated by laparoscopy. Endometriosis co-existing with bilateral dermoid cysts of the ovaries is a rare occurrence although both benign conditions are said to be common in women in the reproductive age group. We present a case of a young woman with primary infertility associated with incapacitating dysmenorrhoea. Sonographic evaluation revealed bilateral ovarian cysts. Video-assisted laparoscopy was performed which revealed bilateral dermoid cysts and endometriotic deposits in the pelvis. The ovarian cysts were enucleated and the endometriotic deposits were endo-coagulated. The patient was treated with GnRH agonist for three months. There have been only two reports of benign and malignant teratomas co-existing with endometriomas.
