Coordinate expression of Cdc25B and ER-alpha is frequent in low-grade endometrioid endometrial carcinoma but uncommon in high-grade endometrioid and nonendometrioid carcinomas. Overexpression of cdc25B, an important cell cycle regulator, has been shown to result in mammary gland hyperplasia in transgenic mice and to increase steroid hormone responsiveness as a direct coactivator of the estrogen receptor (ER). We investigated the potential role of cdc25B in the pathogenesis of endometrial carcinomas in conjunction with ER-alpha. We examined the expression of cdc25B and phosphorylated ER-alpha in 4 archived human specimens of normal endometrium 7 endometrial hyperplasia with or without atypia
