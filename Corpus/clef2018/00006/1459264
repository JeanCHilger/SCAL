In vitro lymphocyte activity in women with endometriosis--an altered immune response? To determine the possible role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.The lymphocyte proliferative response in the presence of autologous endometrial cells was assayed by tritiated thymidine incorporation.Patients were recruited from a university outpatient clinic.To determine the lymphocyte proliferative response to endometrium in controls and patients with endometriosis.Twenty patients with endometriosis and 26 control women were studied.The lymphocyte proliferative response in the presence of autologous endometrium was significantly lower in women with endometriosis when compared with controls.This study indicates that an altered lymphocyte/endometrial cell relationship is operational in women with endometriosis and may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.
