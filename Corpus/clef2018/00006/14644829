Urokinase-type plasminogen activator and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 mRNA expression in endometriotic lesions and eutopic endometrium: implications for the pathophysiology of endometriosis. The peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis contains an increased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) bioavailability, which is produced by limited hydrolysis of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) on IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3). Recently, IGF-1 was shown to inhibit apoptosis of endometrial-like cells in vitro, suggesting that a microenvironment of increased IGF-1 bioavailability can optimize the survival of endometrial cells grown ectopically. Here the expression of mRNA of IGFBP-3 and uPA in tissue biopsies from eutopic endometrium and endometriotic lesions obtained at laparoscopy from women with endometriosis have been analyzed, and it is documented that both IGFBP-3 and uPA mRNA expression are increased from 3- to 10-fold in endometriotic lesions versus eutopic endometrium. Consequently, the necessary components (uPA and IGFBP-3 expression) of endocrine/autocrine/paracrine enhancement of local IGF bioavailability mediated by uPA hydrolysis of the IGFBP-3 were present in endometriotic lesions. These data possibly explain the origin of the increased content of uPA activity, IGF-1 bioavailability, and NH(2)-truncated forms of IGFBP-3 in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis.
