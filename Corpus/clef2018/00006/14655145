PCNA and laminin as prognostic factors in primary Fallopian tube carcinoma. Primary Fallopian tube carcinoma (PFTC) is one of the rarest malignant tumours of the female genital tract. Staging of the disease according to FIGO scale is the most common prognostic indicator. Others, such as histological type, grading according to Hu classification, depth of tubal wall invasion, the presence of neoplastic cells in peritoneal leakage, invasion of the lymphatic and blood vessels, mitotic activity, DNA ploidy, Ki-67 expression, AgNOR level and p53 and c-erbB-2 immunoreactivity, are not widely accepted. 70 cases of primary Fallopian tube carcinomas were analysed with regard to clinicopathological data, survival and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and laminin. Histological classification of PTFC revealed 26 cases of the endometriod type, 16 undifferentiated, 15 serous, 8 urothelial, 3 clearcell and 3 of other types. A total of 70 cases revealed positive nuclear staining for PCNA. The index of PCNA (labelling index, LI, proportion of PCNA-positive cells relative to all neoplastic cells) was evaluated. PCNA LI values were classified as high, > 0.45, or low, </= 0.45. Intracellular expression of laminin was found in 46 cases and extracellular in 28 cases. There was no significant correlation between the expression and distribution of laminin and survival. The p value was statistically significant only for PCNA LI as an independent prognostic factor.
