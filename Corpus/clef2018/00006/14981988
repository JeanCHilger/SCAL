DNA ploidy is an independent prognostic indicator of overall survival in stage I endometrial endometrioid carcinoma. The current retrospective follow-up study aimed to evaluate DNA ploidy, S-phase fraction and preoperative serum CA 125 level as prognostic factors of endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma.A total of 115 patients with FIGO stage I endometrial endometrioid carcinoma who had undergone abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and, in most cases, pelvic lymph node dissection at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Oulu University Hospital, Finland, were included. Flow cytometry was performed on fresh primary tumor samples. Blood samples were obtained within 2 weeks before surgery. The median follow-up time was 98 months. In univariate analysis, DNA ploidy, serum CA 125 level (< or = 13 U/ml versus > 13 U/ml), clinical stage and histological grade of differentiation correlated significantly with survival. S-phase fraction failed in this function. In multivariate analysis, clinical stage, grade of histological differentiation and DNA ploidy (diploid versus nondiploid RR 5.1) remained significant independent predictors of overall survival.The results suggest that DNA ploidy could be helpful in the standard management of patients with early stage endometrial adenocarcinoma. The results also suggest that even slightly elevated preoperative serum CA 125 levels may be helpful in identifying the patients at high risk.
