Incidence of pelvic and extrapelvic endometriosis in Eastern region of Nepal. Endometriosis is described as the presence of endometrial glands or stroma in abnormal locations outside the uterus. It afflicts 10% women of childbearing age. A 5-year retrospective analysis of histopathologically proven cases of endometriosis was done. Haematoxylin and Eosin stained slides were reviewed for type of lining epithelium, endometrial glands, stroma, fresh and old hemorrhage & inflammatory cells. Clinical details were analyzed. Age of the patient ranged from 22 - 48 years. The most common site of endometriosis was ovaries (69.23%) followed by scars (11.43%), cervix (7.69%), fallopian tube (3.84%), vagina (3.84%) and appendix (3.84%) in descending order of frequency. Most common symptom was pain. On ultrasound and X-ray diagnosis could not be made in any case. Clinically endometriosis was diagnosed in 9 (34.62%) cases. On histopathological examination majority of the cases (42.3%) had endometrial glands, stroma and hemosiderin laden macrophages. 3 cases (11.43%) had endometrial lining epithelium and stroma only, which on laproscopy also were diagnosed to have endometriosis. It was concluded that high rate of surgical excision of organs were done because of misdiagnosis.
