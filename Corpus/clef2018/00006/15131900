Fractal dimension in endometrial carcinoma. To mathematically assess in a pilot study, endometrial glandular margin irregularity in simple hyperplasia, complex atypical hyperplasia and well-differentiated endometrial carcinoma with the help of box counting of fractal dimension and to discriminate these lesions on the basis of box counting of fractal dimension of the gland.Ten cases each of endometrial simple hyperplasia (without atypia), complex hyperplasia with atypia and endometrial carcinoma (well-differentiated, endometrioid) were assessed in the study. Five fields at 20 x magnification from each case were randomly selected, and the glands were outlined with the help of a pointer. Using the box counting method, the fractal dimension of each case was measured.Mean fractal dimension in simple hyperplasia, complex atypical hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma was, 0.899 +/- 0.13, 0.932 +/- 0.042 and 0.939 +/- 0.02, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that the fractal dimension of glands of simple hyperplasia were significantly different from that of complex atypical hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma (P = .041 and .013, respectively, ANOVA). However, there was no significant difference in fractal dimension between glands of complex hyperplasia and of endometrial carcinoma (P = .659, ANOVA).This study provides mathematical (objective) assessment of the measurement of glandular margin irregularities in simple hyperplasia, complex atypical hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma. Fractal dimension of gland margin may have diagnostic potential in the future.
