Comparison of the effects of leuprorelin acetate and danazol treatments on serum CA-125 levels in women with endometriosis. To investigate the effects of danazol and leuprorelin acetate on CA-125 levels during treatment for endometriosis.Fifty women with laparoscopically diagnosed and treated endometriosis, and 50 women without pelvic disease as a control group. Following surgical treatment, 35 women with endometriosis were divided into two groups. The first group (20 women) received 200 mg danazol three times daily for 6 months the second group (15 women) received 3.75 mg leuprorelin acetate depot every 28 days for 6 months. Serum CA-125 levels were measured before medical treatment, during the last 15 days of the 6-month treatment course, and 3 months after treatment.Serum CA-125 levels were significantly higher in women with endometriosis than in women in the control group. Before treatment, CA-125 levels in patients with stage III/IV endometriosis were significantly higher than those in stage I/II endometriosis. Six months of danazol or leuprorelin acetate depot treatment decreased serum CA-125 levels. Three months after stopping danazol, CA-125 levels remained significantly lower than pretreatment levels. On the other hand, 3 months after stopping leuprorelin acetate, CA-125 levels returned to pretreatment levels.(a) Danazol and leuprorelin acetate are equally effective in the treatment of endometriosis. (b) Moreover, the results support the view that the determination of CA-125 levels may assist in evaluating progress of endometriosis treatment.
