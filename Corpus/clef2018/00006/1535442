Endometriosis. Diagnostic clues and new treatment options. Endometriosis results in significant pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and infertility. Recognition of the signs and symptoms of endometriosis can result in early diagnosis and treatment. Management includes surgical intervention to debulk large lesions and pharmacologic therapy to produce a medical oophorectomy. Primary care physicians should suspect endometriosis in infertile patients with pelvic pain.
