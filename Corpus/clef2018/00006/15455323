Endometriosis: insights into its pathogenesis and treatment. Clinical and basic science research in endometriosis has been severely hampered by the lack of accurate noninvasive diagnostic tools. The advent of powerful genomic and proteomic technology may help elucidate the etiology and pathophysiology of this complex and enigmatic disease and open new avenues for diagnosis and treatment. Genomic techniques have demonstrated that certain gene products are abnormally expressed in endometriotic tissues.
