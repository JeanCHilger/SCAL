Irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common. The symptom criteria for the diagnosis of IBS remain non specific. Similarly, pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis present with symptoms that may be similar to those of IBS. The site of pain, intermenstrual bleeding and exacerbation of symptoms by food may be able to help differentiate the two groups. However, there is still considerable overlap in the symptomatology of the two conditions and to this end both specialties should work together to investigate and manage these patients.
