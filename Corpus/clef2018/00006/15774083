Conservative surgery combined with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate in treatment of moderate or severe endometriosis. To evaluate the efficiency and side-effects of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate in the treatment of moderate or severe endometriosis after conservative surgery.Ninety-four women with moderate or severe endometriosis after conservative surgery were divided into three groups: 34 cases in the group of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) received intramuscularly depot medroxyprogesterone acetate 150 mg every 28 - 30 days for 6 months 30 cases in the group of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a) received hypodermically leuprorelin acetate 3.75 mg every 28 - 30 days for 6 monthsBoth DMPA and GnRH-a treatment achieved similar significant relief of pelvic symptoms and signs (88% and 93%) compared with the control group (chi(2) = 12.273, P < 0.01 chi(2) = 9.604, P < 0.01). The cumulative recurrence rates of DMPA and GnRH-a groups were 6% and 7%, significantly lower than that of the control group (chi(2) = 5.222, P < 0.05Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate seems to be an effective, safe, and convenient treatment for endometriosis with low-cost, good compliance, and few side effects.
