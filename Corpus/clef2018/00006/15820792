Elevated levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in the peripheral blood of women with endometriosis. To evaluate the concentrations of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in the peripheral blood of normal women and patients with endometriosis.Retrospective study using ELISA to measure peripheral blood MIF.Gynecology clinic and human reproduction research laboratory.Thirty-eight normal women and 55 women with endometriosis.Peripheral blood samples were obtained a few days before laparoscopy.The MIF concentrations in blood serum.This current study showed a 364% increase in MIF concentrations in women with endometriosis as compared to normal women. A significant increase was seen in endometriosis stages I-II, but a more marked increase was observed in the more advanced stages of the disease (III-IV). Both fertile and infertile women with endometriosis had higher levels of MIF than normal controls, but the difference was more significant in infertile women with endometriosis. Women with endometriosis with no pelvic pain had higher levels of MIF than normal controls, but a more significant increase in MIF levels was observed in women with endometriosis reporting pelvic pain.This study showed a marked increase in MIF concentrations in the peripheral blood of women with endometriosis and a relationship with disease progress, and suggests that MIF may be involved in endometriosis-related pain and infertility.
