Changes in cytokine levels of patients with ovarian endometriosis after treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue, ultrasound-guided drainage, and intracystic recombinant interleukin-2. To determine the changes in cytokine levels from women with endometriomas who are treated with recombinant interleukin-2 after ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration, and to relate these changes to the clinical results observed in these patients.A double-blind randomized controlled trial.University hospital.Twenty-four women with endometriosis-related symptoms and endometriomas.Endometriomas in women receiving GnRH analogues and undergoing transvaginal ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration were injected with dextrose that did or did not contain recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2). Serum samples were collected before and after treatment.Serum samples were analyzed by enzyme immunoassay to determine the levels of IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, and IL-17.The cytokine levels after treatment with GnRH analogues and recombinant IL-2 were similar to the initial levels. The patients receiving GnRH analogues without IL-2 had higher IL-1, IL-2, IL-8, and IL-13 levels. Good clinical results were observed in 90% of the patients in the first group but in only 30% of the second one.Administration of recombinant IL-2 intracystically decreases cytokine production in women with endometriomas. These results have important implications for the design of future therapies based on immunomodulation, such as using higher or repeated doses of recombinant IL-2 in the cysts.
