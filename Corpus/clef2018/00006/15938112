Immunohistochemical profile of endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus: ER, PR, HER-2, Ki-67 and their prognostic value. 76 endometrioid adenocarcinomas of the uterine body were studied. Expression of the above markers is of essential value together with metastatic involvement of regional lymph nodes, stage of the disease and pathogenetic variant for determining prognosis of carcinoma aggressiveness and disease outcome. Positive hormonal-receptor status of the tumor is characterized by well-differentiated tumor cells, small depth of invasion, rare metastases to regional lymph nodes and higher survival (5 year--81%) of patients comparing with cases where ER and PR were not determined (53%). On the contrary, overexpression of oncoprotein HER-2 and Ki-67 higher than median (42%) was associated with high tumor aggression resulting finally in a significant fall in the survival (from 75% to 58% and from 79% to 60%, respectively). Combination of HER-2 overexpression with a high level of Ki-67 is particularly unfavourable (5-year survival--43%).
