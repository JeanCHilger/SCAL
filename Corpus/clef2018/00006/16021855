Steroids and protein markers in the follicular fluid as indicators of oocyte quality in patients with and without endometriosis. To investigate the concentrations of steroid hormones (estradiol, progesterone), pregnancy-associated protein-A, IGF-binding protein-4 and leptin in the follicular fluid of infertile patients with and without endometriosis.Follicular fluid of IVF patients with and without endometriosis was aspirated, centrifuged and stored to analyze the above mentioned hormones and to compare their concentrations between women with and without endometriosis.Follicular fluid estradiol levels were significantly higher in controls than in affected women. The concentrations of the other markers did not differ between the two groups.Since not only the follicular fluid concentration of estradiol, but also the oocyte quality is decreased in women with endometriosis, we suggest that estradiol can be considered as a marker not only of oocyte maturity but also of oocyte quality.
