Effect of progesterone on the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in human ectopic endometrial stromal cells. To determine the effect of progesterone on the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in ectopic endometrial stromal cells.Ectopic endometrial stromal cells were obtained from 17 patients with endometriosis. Endometrial stromal cells were obtained from 12 patients with endometriosis and 14 cases of controls. Ectopic endometrial stromal cells of 15 cases were treated with progesterone. Culture supernatants of these stromal cells were analyzed for MMP-2 and MMP-9 by zymography.Endometriotic stromal cells released significantly higher levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 than endometrial stromal cells from women with and without endometriosis. Progesterone at 10(-9) mol/L caused endometriotic stromal cells a significant reduction MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. When progesterone concentration was increased from 10(-9) mol/L to 10(-7) mol/L, the release of MMP-9 was almost completely inhibited, wherease that of MMP-2 was not completely inhibited.Progesterone may inhibit the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in ectopic endometrial stromal cells, especially MMP-9.
