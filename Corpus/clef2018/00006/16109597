Matrix metalloproteinase-13 and membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. It is becoming more and more evident that different types of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) are involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The aim of the present study was to measure levels of the active forms of MMP-13 and membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP)/MMP-14 as well as TIMP-2 in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis.We determined the levels of the active forms MMP-13 and MT1-MMP/MMP-14 as well as TIMP-2 in the peritoneal fluid of 20 women with endometriosis and 18 controls by different types of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.We found that the concentrations (mean +/- standard deviation) of total active MMP-13 and endogenous active MT1-MMP/MMP-14 in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis were 1.69 +/- 0.67 and 3.12 +/- 1.07 ng/ml, respectively. In control women the corresponding values were 3.02 +/- 0.43 and 4.45 +/- 1.03 ng/ml. The differences were statistically significant (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0004 for MMP-13 and MMP-14, respectively). Levels of TIMP-2 did not differ significantly.Decreased concentrations of active MMP-13 and MT1-MMP/MMP-14 may imply that the proteolytic activity of the peritoneal milieu of women with endometriosis is disturbed, which may have implications in the pathogenesis of the disease.
