Cancer transformation of adenomyosis. Adenomyosis cancerous transformation (AMCT) was observed in a 48-year old female without cancer of the endometrium. Various forms of transformation (stages of AMCT morphogensis) in and outside of denomyosis (AM) foci are described (adenomatosis, invasive cancer, metastases). AMCT diagnosis requires histologic examination of the surgical material with establishing multicentric tumor transformation of AM foci at different stages of morphogenesis. Early intramural tumor cell embolism and metastases worsens prognosis.
