Pregnancy after laparoscopic treatment of ovarian endometriotic cysts. The aim of study was to present the optimal laparoscopic treatment of the ovarian endometriotic cysts in patients who had been treated of sterility and to present the success of the sterility treatment.Ovarian endometriotic cysts do not have proper reaction to hormonal supressive therapy and surgical treatment is required. Laparoscopic cystectomy of ovarian endometriotic cysts using electrocision was performed in 45 patients who previously underwent laboratory tests specific for that type of patients, as well as sperm analysis of their husbands. At the same time, potency test of the uterine tubes was performed.34 patients had normal uterine tubes potency and normal semen analysis of their husbands. Out of 34 patients, 12 (35%) spontaneously got pregnant during 12 months following laparoscopic treatment. At the same period of 12 months, in 6 (13,3 %) patients recurrent ovarian cysts were discovered.Laparoscopic cystectomy of ovarian endometriotic cysts is efficient method of preserving fertility in certain number of patients.
