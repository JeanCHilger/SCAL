Increased granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 concentrations in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. To evaluate the release of granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 (GCP-2) into peritoneal fluid in women with endometriosis, we measured its concentration with reference to the disease stage and the phase of the menstrual cycle.Surgery was scheduled in the proliferative or secretory phase of the menstrual cycle for 64 women with endometriosis (n = 38) or cystadenomas (n = 26). GCP-2 concentrations in the peritoneal fluid were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Our findings indicated elevated concentrations of GCP-2 in peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis during the proliferative phase, which were positively correlated with the stage of endometriosis.Inflammation associated with endometriosis may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease through increasing levels of peritoneal fluid GCP-2.
