Fine needle cytology of endometriosis: experience with 10 cases. To evaluate whether commonly used cytologic criteria for the diagnosis of endometriosis are sufficiently specific, to assess the possible role of special methods in the differential diagnosis and to assess the clinical meaning and drawbacks of a cytopathologic diagnosis of endometriosis by fine needle aspiration.We retrieved 10 cases of endometriosis from our files that had been diagnosed primarily by fine needle cytology (FNC) with subsequent tissue study. In some cases additional cytospin preparations and/or smears had been used for cytochemistry (periodic acid-Schiff stain, mucicarmine) or immunocytochemistry (pan-cytokeratin, cytokeratin 7, vimentin, CD10) using a 3-step streptavidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase reaction.The cell pattern and immunocytochemical profile of the cases suggested a diagnosis of endometriosis. All cases were histologically confirmed.With optimal preparations a confident cytologic diagnosis of endometriosis may be made with ease, permitting correct treatment of the disease and, in selected cases, planning of preoperative pharmacologic therapy.
