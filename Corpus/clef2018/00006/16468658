Expression of matrix metalloproteinase and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase in adenomyosis. To investigate the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase -2, -3 (MMP-2,-3) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) in internal uterine endometriosis tissue and endometrium from women with and without endometriosis throughout the menstrual cycle.Immunohistochemical staining of tissues was performed to study the expressions and locations of MMP-2, MMP-3, TIMP-2 between women with and without endometriosis. The real-time PCR technique was applied to detected the mRNA expressions of MMP-2, MMP-3 and TIMP-2.We found that ectopic endometrium from patients with endometriosis expressed higher levels of MMP-2 and MMP-3 and lower levers of TIMP-2 than normal controls did (P < 0.05). MMP-2 and MMP-3 were detected strongly in both stromal and epithelial cells of ectopic endometrium from patients with endometriosis, when mostly detected in the epithelial cells in the control group. All eutopic and ectopic endometrium samples from women with and without endometriosis throughout the menstrual cycle showed similar expressions of MMP-2, MMP-3 and TIMP-2. Quantitative expressions of MMP-2 mRNA, MMP-3 mRNA and TIMP-2 mRNA were significantly lower in eutopic endometrium from controls compared with ectopic endometrium from patients with endometriosis (P < 0.05). Eutopic endometrium from controls in the proliferative phase showed significantly increased expressions of MMP-2 mRNA compared with that in the secretory phase (P < 0.05).The results suggest that ectopic endometrium with adenomyosis has more invasiveness and is prone to peritoneal implantation maybe to involved in the high expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-3 and the less expressions of TIMP-2 than endometrium from women without adenomyosis does.
