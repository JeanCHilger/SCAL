Expression of interleukin1-alpha, beta and interferon-gamma in macrophages from endometrium of women with endometriosis. To assess interleukin (IL)-1alpha, beta and interferon (IFN) gamma expression in macrophages in eutopic and ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis.In situ hybridization was used to examine the expression of IL-1alpha and beta and IFN-gamma in macrophages from eutopic and ectopic endometrium of 40 women with endometriosis and 15 control women. Eutopic endometrial samples were histologically classified into proliferative and secretary phases. Cervical polyp tissue was used as positive control.Expression of IL-1alpha and beta in macrophages from eutopic and ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis were significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Both gene expression in macrophages from ectopic endometrium was higher than that in eutopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis (P < 0.05). The expressions of the two genes were significantly increased in secretory phase of endometrium when compared to that in proliferative phase (P < 0.05). There was no difference in IFN-gamma expression in macrophages of endometium between patients with endometriosis and control (P > 0.05). No cycle dependent variation of the gene expression in the macrophages was found either in endometriosis group or in control group.There is a significant increase in the expression of IL-1alpha and beta in macrophages of endometriosis. IL-1 and activated macrophages may play an important role in the development and progression of endometriosis.
