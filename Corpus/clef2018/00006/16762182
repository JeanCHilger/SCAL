Expression of midkine in eutopic and ectopic endometrium of patients with severe endometriosis and its clinical significance. To investigate the expression of midkine (MK) in eutopic and ectopic endometrium of patients with severe endometriosis and its clinical significance.Immunohistochemical streptavidin-biotin peroxidase (SP) method was used to detect MK expression and microvessel density (MVD) in eutopic and ectopic endometrium. Specimens of eutopic and ectopic endometrium were collected from 41 patients with serious endometriosis (study group) and 32 patients with uterine fibroid (control group).The positive rate of MK expression in the eutopic endometrium from study group was 63% (26/41). It was significantly higher than that in the ectopic endometrium from study group was 29% (12/41) and the eutopic endometrium from control group was 22% (7/32, P < 0.05). MK expression was positively correlated to microvessel density (r = 0.637, P < 0.05).Over-expression of MK protein is showed in the eutopic endometrium of patients with severe endometriosis and correlated to endometriotic angiogenesis. The change of MK expression in eutopic endometrium may be related to the pathogenesis of severe endometriosis.
