DeltaNp63 protein expression in uterine cervical and endometrial cancers. To investigate the significance of p63 expression in uterine cervical and endometrial cancers.DeltaNp63 protein expression was studied in a variety of 127 cases of uterine cervical lesions (20 non-neoplastic cervices, 43 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN], 54 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), 40 adenocarcinomas, and 13 other histologic types) and 30 endometrioid type of endometrial adenocarcinomas by using immunohistochemistry. One SCC cell line (ME-180) and one adenocarcinoma cell line (HeLa) were also included.In uterine cervix, the expression of DeltaNp63 was increased with progression of CIN, and positive in all SCCs, transitional cell carcinomas, and adenoid basal carcinoma, but negative in all adenocarcinomas. Adenosquamous cell carcinoma and mixed neuroendocrine and squamous cell carcinoma were positive in squamous component, but not in adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma components. ME-180 cell line was positive, whereas HeLa cell line was negative. Endometrioid type of endometrial adenocarcinomas showed a positive staining in glandular (26.7%) and squamous component.Immunohistochemical staining for DeltaNp63 is a powerful marker for squamous differentiation and useful in exclusion of glandular and neuroendocrine differentiation in uterine cervical cancers, but not always in endometrial cancers.
