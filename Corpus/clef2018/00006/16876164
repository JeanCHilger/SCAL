Expression of an extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (basigin) in the human ovary and ovarian endometriosis. To characterize the expression of basigin in ovarian endometriotic tissue, normal ovary, and endometrium during the menstrual cycle.Controlled, retrospective study for evaluation of basigin expression in archived specimens.Academic research environment: University of Kentucky College of Medicine.Archived surgical specimens selected by retrospective chart review of age-matched (39 +/- 2.5 years) patients with and without ovarian endometriosis.None.Expression localization of basigin mRNA and protein.Basigin (mRNA and protein) was localized to granulosa cells (follicles of all stages), the ovarian surface epithelium, and granulosa and theca lutein of corpora lutea. Differential patterns of expression were apparent among samples of eutopic endometrium collected during the proliferative and secretory stages. In endometriotic lesions on the ovary, basigin was detected in the glandular epithelia and stroma of proliferative and secretory phase samples, but patterns of expression were unsynchronized with those of the eutopic endometrium from the same patient.The current data demonstrate unique expression patterns of basigin in the human ovary and endometriotic tissue, thereby supporting a possible role in normal ovarian function and in the dysregulation of proteolytic matrix metalloproteinases in endometriosis.
