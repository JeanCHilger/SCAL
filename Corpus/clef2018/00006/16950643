Endometriosis in teenagers. Endometriosis has long been considered as a disease of women over 30 years old. However, recent data from the literature demonstrated its high incidence in teenagers. Endometriosis in teenagers is generally associated with chronic pelvic pains and cyclical signs are less common than in adults. The persistence of the pain despite an estroprogestative contraception associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is a strong argument for the diagnosis and justifies a laparoscopic exploration. During this laparoscopy, the search for atypical lesions, which are much more common than typical ones, is essential. Biopsies of these lesions is mandatory in every patient to rule out false positives and false negatives which are common in atypical lesions. The aim of the treatment is to improve the pain. The first line of medical treatment is based on the estroprogestative contraception and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The prescription of GnRH should be the ultimate solution because the bone reserve increases until the age of 18 to 20. The laparoscopic treatment, when required, should be as complete as possible. Early diagnosis and medical management may prevent the development of the disease. However, further studies in the teenager are essential to improve the current empirical management.
