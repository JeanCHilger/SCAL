Ovarian oxyphilic Sertoli cell tumor: case report and review of the literature. Ovarian oxyphilic Sertoli cell tumor is a rare neoplasm (only three cases were reported in literature). Sometimes the rarity itself of a lesion raises some problem in the diagnostics, especially if the case is send to several consultants. An unusual case of ovarian neoplasm came to our attention, and we sent some slides of the case to two well known referees of different Departments of Pathology. Pathologist 1 made a diagnosis of endometrioid adenocarcinoma, while Pathologist 2 made the diagnosis of oxyphilic Sertoli cell tumor. He sends the same slides to Pathologist 1, who confirmed his diagnosis. The two different diagnosis set different managements of the lesion for the clinician, but overall they set the pathologist who requested the consultation in a difficult position. In fact, when a pathologist sends to two experienced consultants a case, he really thinks to solve definitely the case itself. Unfortunately, sometimes it does not happen.
