Serum dioxin-like compounds and aromatase (CYP19) expression in endometriotic tissues. Dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) are suspected etiological factors of endometriosis but their potential mechanisms of action remain elusive. Because endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent disease and since aromatase (CYP19), a key enzyme in estrogen biosynthesis, was recently demonstrated to be expressed in endometriotic lesions, we hypothesized that dioxin-like compounds could modulate local estrogen production through an up-regulation of aromatase. We tested this hypothesis by examining the correlation between serum DLC levels and CYP19 expression in endometriotic tissue obtained from 47 patients with peritoneal, ovarian endometriosis and/or deep endometriotic nodules of the rectovaginal septum. Aromatase expression was assessed by real-time RT-PCR in biopsied endometriotic tissues [peritoneal (n=19), ovarian (n=17) endometriosis and deep endometriotic nodules of the recto-vaginal septum (n=29)]. The relationship between aromatase expression and DLCs was traced by simple regression analysis. DLCs did not appear to be significant determinants of aromatase expression. CYP1A1 expression, measured as a positive control, was found associated with current smoking but not with DLCs. We conclude that DLCs do probably not facilitate the growth of endometriotic lesions by up-regulating the local expression of aromatase.
