Expression of organic cation transporter SLC22A16 in human endometria. SLC22A16 is one of newly isolated organic cation transporters, which is responsible for uptake and transport of adriamycin into cells. Adriamycin is one of the key drugs for treatment of endometrial cancer. Therefore, we examined expression of SLC22A16 in human endometrium and its disorders. Protein and mRNA expression levels of SLC22A16 were examined in 124 endometrial cancer specimens, 25 normal endometrial tissue samples (15 in proliferative phase, 10 in secretory phase), and 7 endometrial cancer cell lines using immunohistochemical analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Changes in SLC22A16 mRNA expression level after progesterone exposure were also examined. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that SLC22A16 protein was highly expressed in endometrium during the normal secretory phase, but its level was significantly reduced in the proliferative phase. SLC22A16 protein was detected in 59 of 124 (48%) endometrial cancer specimens and 3 of 7 (43%) endometrial cancer cell lines. The mRNA levels measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were comparable with levels of protein expression. Furthermore, SLC22A16 mRNA levels were increased in endometrial cancer cell lines in the presence of progesterone. In conclusion, SLC22A16 is expressed in various endometrial tissues. Its expression level is high during the secretory phase and may be regulated by progesterone. Our findings also suggest that it may be possible to use progestins to increase the response of endometrioid endometrial carcinoma with SLC22A16 expression to adriamycin-based chemotherapeutic regimens.
