Expression of Tn and sialyl-Tn antigens in tumor tissues of the ovary. The expression of sialyl-Tn and Tn antigens in various benign, borderline, and malignant ovarian tumors was examined immunohistochemically using newly developed antibodies specific for sialyl-Tn and Tn antigens. Sialyl-Tn antigen was detected in only one benign tumor, a mucinous adenoma that showed faint cytoplasmic staining in a few cells. However, sialyl-Tn was present in 5 of 12 serous borderline tumors, 10 of 19 mucinous borderline tumors, 10 of 13 serous adenocarcinomas, 15 of 16 mucinous adenocarcinomas, 14 of 15 endometrioid adenocarcinomas, and 7 of 7 clear cell carcinomas of the ovary. The antigen expression was observed throughout the cytoplasm of cancer cells and in the apical cytoplasm and luminal contents of some glands. The incidence and intensity of staining for sialyl-Tn antigen were higher in malignant tumors than in borderline tumors, but these results did not correlate with the histologic classification or differentiation. Coexpression of sialyl-Tn antigen and Tn antigen was observed in two serous adenocarcinomas, six mucinous borderline tumors, five mucinous adenocarcinomas, eight endometrioid, and seven clear cell carcinomas. In no case was Tn antigen expressed without concomitant sialyl-Tn antigen expression. Accumulation of sialyl-Tn antigen seems to be an early event of carcinogenesis of the ovary.
