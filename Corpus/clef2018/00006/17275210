Endometriosis anatomoclinical entities. The aim of this literature review is to precise definition, anatomoclinical entities and natural history of endometriosis to allow clinical guideline establishment.Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue (glands and stroma) outside the uterus. This histologic definition does not implicate symptoms. Macroscopic lesions supposed to be endometriosis are not always confirmed by histology. Histology is recommended to confirm endometriosis. Negative histology does not exclude endometriosis.Three endometriosis entities are described: peritoneal endometriosis, ovarian endometrial cyst, and deeply infiltrating endometriosis. There is no evidence to establish a different pathogenesis of theses entities.It is not well known. It may progress or regress with or without treatment. There is no evidence of treatment in case of asymptomatic endometriosis. There is an association between endometriosis and ovarian cancer. The risk of endometriosis malignant transformation is still a subject of controversy. There is no evidence for a specific oncologic follow-up of woman having endometriosis.
