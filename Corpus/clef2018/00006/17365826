Immunohistochemistry as a diagnostic aid in cervical pathology. As with biopsies from other sites in the female genital tract, immunohistochemistry is now being increasingly used in cervical pathology as an aid to diagnosis. In this review, I discuss applications of immunohistochemistry in diagnostic cervical pathology with a particular focus on recent developments. It is emphasised that immunohistochemistry is to be used as an adjunct to routine morphological examination and that no marker is totally specific or sensitive for a given lesion. Although much of this review focuses on glandular lesions, the value of markers, such as MIB1 and p16, in the assessment of pre-invasive cervical squamous lesions is discussed. In the broad field of cervical glandular lesions, topics covered include: the value of markers such as MIB1, p16 and bcl-2 in distinguishing adenocarcinoma in situ and glandular dysplasia from benign mimics markers of mesonephric lesions, including CD10
