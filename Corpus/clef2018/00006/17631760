Clinicopathologic analysis and expression of cyclin D1 and p53 of ovarian borderline tumors and carcinomas. To study the clinicopathological features and expression of cyclin D1 and p53 in epithelial ovarian tumors, and to investigate the correlation between pathogenesis of ovarian cancer and epithelial borderline tumors.Fifty four cases of ovarian borderline tumors and 45 cases of ovarian carcinomas from the People's Hospital, Peking University were reviewed retrospectively. The clinical data and pathological findings were analyzed. Immunohistochemical study of cyclin D1 and p53 was performed in all 99 cases.(1) In borderline tumors, the age of patients ranged from 14 - 82 (mean age = 42.5) years. International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage of borderline tumors was stage I in 48 cases, stage II in 3 cases, and stage III in 3 cases. In ovarian carcinomas, the age of patients ranged from 26 - 80 (mean age = 53.5) years. FIGO stage of carcinoma was stage I in 6 cases, stage II in 8 cases, stage III in 26 cases, and stage IV in 5 cases. In follow-up of 54 cases with borderline tumors the 5-year survival rate was 98% and of 45 cases with carcinomas a 5-year survival rate of 51% was noted. (2) In 54 cases of borderline tumors, mucinous types accounted for 56% (30/54) and serous types accounted for 30% (16/54). There were 5 cases with micropapillary pattern, 3 cases with peritoneal implants, 3 cases with lymph node involvement, 6 cases with microinvasion, one case with intraepithelial carcinoma, and one case with mural nodules. In 45 cases of carcinomas, serous carcinoma was the most (49%, 22/45). The remainder included 3 cases of mucinous types, 8 cases of endometrioid types, 6 cases of transitional cell types, 3 cases of mixed phenotype and 3 cases of undifferentiated types. (3) Overexpression of cyclin D1 and p53 was observed in 31% (14/45) and 56% (25/45) of ovarian carcinomas, respectively. There was a significant association between p53 overexpression and tumor grade. In the borderline tumor group, 69% (37/54) had overexpression of cyclin D1 and 6% (3/54) had overexpression of p53. There were significant differences in expression of cyclin D1 and p53 between conventional serous borderline tumors and high-grade serous carcinomas (cyclin D1: 91% vs 26% p53: 0 vs 58%). However, micropapillary serous borderline tumors and low-grade serous carcinomas showed remarkably similar expression of cyclin D1 and p53.Epithelial ovarian borderline tumors are distinct from ovarian cancer in clinical progress and prognosis, and histological types. Overexpression of cyclin D1 is common in ovarian borderline tumors and low grade carcinomas. And overexpression of p53 is more common in high grade ovarian carcinomas. Conventional serous borderline tumors are distinct from high-grade serous carcinomas in pathogenesis. Micropapillary serous borderline ovarian tumors may be closely related to low grade serous carcinomas.
