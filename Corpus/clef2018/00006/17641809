Endometriosis of the abdominal wall. Endometriosis is characterized by the presence and proliferation of ectopic endometrial tissue. It occurs most often in the pelvic area but sometimes it presents as a lump in the abdomen. We report three cases of endometriosis of the abdominal wall, presented at the Emergency University Hospital of Bucharest during the last year. The diagnosis was made by the histopathological analysis of the surgical specimen.
