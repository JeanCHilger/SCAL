Follicular fluid vascular endothelial growth factor and tumour necrosis factor alpha concentrations in patients with endometriosis undergoing ICSI. The aim of this study was to investigate follicular fluid vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) concentrations in endometriosis, and their effect on the outcome of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). A prospective study was performed among patients who had either a laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis (n = 48) or who had normal laparoscopic findings with unexplained infertility (n = 43). The number of gonadotrophin units, peak oestradiol concentrations, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization, cleavage and pregnancy rates, and number of embryos transferred, were the main outcome measurements. There was no difference in these parameters between the two study groups. Significantly higher concentrations of VEGF were found in the endometriosis group (P = 0.031), but there was no difference in TNFalpha concentrations. No relationship was found between VEGF and TNFalpha concentrations and ICSI outcome. Despite a higher concentration of intrafollicular VEGF in the endometriosis group, it was concluded that this parameter had no predictive value with respect to ICSI outcome. In addition, intrafollicular TNFalpha concentrations were not different in the endometriosis group and there was no relationship between VEGF or TNFalpha concentrations and the outcomes measured.
