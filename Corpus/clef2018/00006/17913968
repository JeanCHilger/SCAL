Relative expression of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor, vitamin D 1 alpha-hydroxylase, vitamin D 24-hydroxylase, and vitamin D 25-hydroxylase in endometriosis and gynecologic cancers. The authors demonstrate expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and its hydroxylases in the endometrium and ovaries of women with and without endometriosis and endometrial or ovarian cancer. Immunohistochemistry showed strong staining of the VDR in endometriosis and endometrial cancer, with the most intense staining in epithelial cells. The VDR mRNA was significantly increased in patients with endometrial and ovarian cancer compared to the control group. There was a significantly higher 1 alpha-hydroxylase expression in the endometrium of patients with endometriosis compared to healthy controls. The observed differences in VDR and 1 alpha -hydroxylase mRNA levels were maintained at the protein level. The authors found no differences in 25-OH vitamin D levels between the serum of patients with endometriosis (25.7 +/- 2.1 ng/mL, n = 46) and healthy controls (22.6 +/- 2.0 ng/mL, n = 33, P = .31). They hypothesize that vitamin D might influence the local activity of immune cells and cytokines thought to play important pathogenic roles in the development and maintenance of endometriosis.
