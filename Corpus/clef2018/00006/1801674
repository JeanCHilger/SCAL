Progestogens: an occasional review. Progestogens are drugs which share the ability to stimulate the progesterone receptor, but differ in many other aspects. Some of their uses include the regulation of menstrual bleeding, protection of oestrogen-primed endometrium, contraception and as anticancer therapy. However, progesterone physical and psychological side-effects and potentially adverse metabolic effects including lipoprotein changes must be considered. An understanding of these differences will permit appropriate prescribing of these drugs for gynaecological and medical disorders.
