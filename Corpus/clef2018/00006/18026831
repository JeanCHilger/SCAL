The expression of human alpha and beta defensin in the endometrium and their effect on implantation. Alpha and beta defensins have been isolated from various human tissues and form an important part of the innate immune system. Their role in implantation of the embryo has not yet been studied. This study was designed to detect both alpha and beta defensins in the mid luteal phase endometrium and investigate the correlation between the defensin expression and implantation of the embryo.An experimental study was designed to detect alpha defensin (HNP1-3) and beta defensin (HBD1) in midluteal phase endometrial samples obtained from women attending the IVF unit at the Liverpool Women's Hospital, UK. Samples were obtained at least two menstrual cycles before IVF treatment was commenced. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to estimate defensin expression. Some endometrial stromal cells stained positive for HNP1-3 during the midluteal phase. HNP1-3 expression is significantly higher in cases presenting with female factor infertility as compared with purely male factor infertility. A significant increase was not observed in tubal factor or endometriosis when considered separately. Endometrial stromal neutrophils were shown to be the main source of endometrial HNP1-3. HBD1 was the only beta defensin detected by immunochemical staining in the midluteal phase endometrium. The intensity of staining was significantly different in the endometrial stroma, luminal and glandular epithelia. HBD1 expression is not significantly higher in female factor infertility.The study confirmed secretion of HNP1-3 by endometrial stromal neutrophils. Glandular epithelium is the main source of HBD1 expression in the human endometrium. HNP1-3 shows increased expression in female factor infertility. HBD1 expression is not higher in female factor infertility. These defensins do not appear to influence implantation.
