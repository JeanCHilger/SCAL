Open laparoscopy simplifies instrumentation required for laparoscopic oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy. Eight consecutive cases of open laparoscopic oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy are reported. A modified technique that requires fewer specialized instruments and includes removal of the intact adnexa is demonstrated. Patients were not included if there was any suspicion of malignancy. Indications for surgery included chronic pelvic pain after hysterectomy (N = 5), endometriosis (N = 1), estrogen receptor-positive metastatic breast carcinoma that had not responded to chemotherapy (N = 1), and tuboovarian ectopic pregnancy (N = 1). No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. The average hospital stay was 1.1 days, and patients were released 3-14 days postoperatively. Five of the six patients with chronic pelvic pain had prompt resolution of their symptoms. In one patient who had a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, a contralateral procedure was required 3 months later because of continued chronic pelvic pain her pain subsequently resolved. Laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy has the potential to decrease morbidity as compared with laparotomy in appropriately selected cases.
