In vivo analysis of progesterone receptor action in the uterus during embryo implantation. In order for a successful pregnancy to occur, the embryo must attach to the luminal epithelial cells and invade into the stroma. Then, the surrounding stromal cells need to undergo decidualization in order to establish the vasculature necessary for survival of the embryo. These events in early pregnancy are tightly regulated by the steroid hormones, estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4), through their cognate receptors, the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR), respectively. Using a mouse model in which the PR has been ablated, it was demonstrated that the PR is necessary for embryo implantation and decidualization. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of PR action in the adult uterus is necessary in order to understand the events of early pregnancy. Insights from both mouse models and human samples have been integral in elucidating uterine PR action. These studies have shown that not only PR target genes, but also mediators of PR action are important for correct PR action in early pregnancy. Many of the genes involved in PR action in early pregnancy have also been shown to have roles in uterine diseases such as endometriosis and endometrial cancer. Therefore, the integration of mouse and human studies on PR action in the uterus will be important for the future understanding of uterine diseases and in the development of treatment for these diseases.
