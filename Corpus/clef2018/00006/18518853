Current trends in N-acetyltransferase research arising from the 2007 International NAT Workshop. Arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) research has been influenced in recent years by the rapid progress in genomics, proteomics, structural genomics and other cutting-edge disciplines. To keep up with these advancements, the NAT scientific community has fostered collaboration and exchange of know-how between its members. As a specialized event bringing together experts from many different laboratories, the triennial International NAT Workshop has been instrumental in maintaining this culture over the past ten years. The 2007 Workshop took place in Alexandroupolis, Greece, and covered ongoing research on the structure and enzymatic function of human NATs, the prokaryotic and eukaryotic models for NAT, the mechanisms of NAT gene regulation and expression, the frequencies and effects of polymorphisms in the human NAT genes, and the involvement of NATs in multifactorial diseases, including cancer, allergic conditions, endometriosis and endemic nephropathies. Gene nomenclature issues were also addressed and the participants discussed current trends in the field.
