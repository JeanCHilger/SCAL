Polymorphisms in the vascular endothelial growth factor gene and the risk of familial endometriosis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an endothelial cell-specific angiogenic protein suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis by establishing a new blood supply to the human exfoliated endometrium. Several transcription factor-binding sites are found in the VEGF 5'-untranslated region and variation within the region increases the transcriptional activity. Six previous studies which tested between one and three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in samples comprising 105-215 cases and 100-219 controls have produced conflicting evidence for association between the SNPs in the VEGF region and endometriosis. To further investigate the reported association between VEGF variants and endometriosis, we tested the four VEGF polymorphisms (-2578 A/C, rs699947 -460 T/C, rs833061
