Expression of mesothelin mRNA and protein in ovarian carcinomas. To investigate the expression of mesothelin (MESO) mRNA and protein and its significance in ovarian carcinomas.Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression level of MESO mRNA and protein, respectively, in 124 samples of ovarian tumor and normal tissues, including 84 epithelial ovarian carcinomas, 12 borderline ovarian tumors, 16 benign ovarian tumors and 12 normal ovarian tissues.The expression of MESO mRNA and protein in epithelial ovarian carcinomas (1.4005 +/- 0.4646, 2.7857 +/- 2.2712) and borderline ovarian tumors (1.0650 +/- 0.3100, 2.9167 +/- 2.391) were significantly higher than that in benign ovarian tumors (0.6463 +/- 0.2419, 1.2500 +/- 1.6125) and normal ovarian tissues (0.6439 +/- 0.2729, 0.9167 +/- 1.2401) (P < 0.05), and also significantly higher in serous cystadenocarcinoma (1.5255 +/- 0.4151, 3.3036 +/- 2.6141) and endometrioid carcinoma (1.5250 +/- 0.5419, 3.0000 +/- 2.3094) than that in mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (1.0675 +/- 0.3149, 1.0556 +/- 1.9242) (P < 0.05). The expression of MESO mRNA and protein in stages II and IV carcinomas (1.5100 +/- 0.4142, 3.6087 +/- 3.3959) was significantly higher than that in stages I and II carcinomas (1.1190 +/- 0.4909, 1.7895 +/- 2.6320 P < 0.05), and also significantly higher in grade 3 carcinomas than that in grade 1 and 2 ones (P < 0.05), but was not correlate with age or serum CA125 of the patients (P > 0.05).The results of this study demonstrated that the expression of MESO mRNA and protein is increased in ovarian carcinomas and borderline ovarian tumors, and MESO may play a role in the adhesion and dissemination of ovarian carcinomas.
