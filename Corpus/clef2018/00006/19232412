Evaluation of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in comparison with C-reactive protein as biochemical serum markers in women with endometriosis. To compare high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) with CRP as a soluble serum marker for the diagnosis of women with endometriosis.Prospective nonrandomized controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification II-1).University hospital.Eighty-two women were laparoscopically evaluated. No endometriosis was diagnosed in 34 women (the non-E group). Endometriosis was confirmed by histology in 48 women (the E group). Eighty-two women did not undergo laparoscopic evaluation (the unknown-E group). Afterward, the women were staged according to the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine criteria (r-ASRM).CRP and hs-CRP were measured initially before laparoscopy.The hs-CRP and CRP levels and the correlation of those parameters with the stage of the disease.There was a trend toward higher CRP levels and higher hs-CRP levels in the E group, while the lowest levels of both markers were found in the non-E group. There was a significantly lower hs-CRP level in the non-E group in comparison with the CRP level in this group. No differences between the different stages of the disease were found with either marker.Measurement of the two markers did not appear to be advantageous for the diagnosis of endometriosis independent of the stage of the disease. Nevertheless, a very low hs-CRP level might serve as a marker for an absence of endometriosis.
