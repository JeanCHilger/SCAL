TNFalpha gene silencing reduced lipopolysaccharide-promoted proliferation of endometriotic stromal cells. We previously reported that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-promoted endometriotic stromal cell (ESC) proliferation by inducing TNFalpha production. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of TNFalpha gene silencing on LPS-treated ESCs.Endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs) and endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) (EMSCs) were obtained from ovarian chocolate cysts and uterine myoma, respectively. Using PCR array, LPS-induced gene expression profiling after transfection of TNFalpha siRNA into ESCs was performed. Down-regulated genes by TNFalpha silencing were examined using real-time RT-PCR. Effect of TNFalpha silencing was examined using ELISA and BrdU incorporation, respectively.In PCR array, TNFalpha silencing in ESCs repressed LPS-induced expression of cIAP2 and IL-8, NFkappaB pathway responsive genes. After adding LPS, the levels of cIAP2 and IL-8 expression in ESCs were higher compared with those in EMSCs. TNFalpha silencing attenuated the LPS-induced ESC proliferation.Tumor necrosis factor alpha may be involved in cell proliferation of endometriotic tissues.
