Pulmonary metastases from uterine neoplasms after long tumour-free interval: four cases and review of the literature. Uncommon cases of lung metastasis from different types of uterine neoplasms with a long tumour-free interval after hysterectomy are reported.Four cases were retrieved from our surgical pathology archives. Case 1 was a 68-year-old woman who had three pulmonary nodules 23 years after hysterectomy for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LGESS). The nodules obtained with video-assisted thoracic surgeries were consistent with metastatic LGESS. Case 2 was a 36-year-old woman who had numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules 6 years after hysterectomy for leiomyoma. A transthoracic biopsy revealed benign metastasising leiomyoma. Case 3 was a 77-year-old woman who had a large lung mass with satellite nodules 17 years after hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and subsequent radiotherapy for endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EEA). The biopsied and resected lung tumour was consistent with metastatic EEA. Case 4 was a 51-year-old woman who underwent total hysterectomy and subsequent radiotherapy for endocervical adenocarcinoma 12 years ago and lung lobectomy for metastatic disease 8 years ago. She then developed two pulmonary lesions 14 months ago, and these resected after radiotherapy were metastatic endocervical adenocarcinoma.A review of the literature revealed that late pulmonary metastasis from uterine neoplasms is rare but not negligible. Immunohistochemical studies and molecular tests, together with detailed clinical information and imaging findings, are important for rendering a diagnosis.
