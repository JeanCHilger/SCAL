Correlation of anterior vaginal wall pain with endometriosis in infertile patients. To investigate whether anterior vaginal wall tenderness in a patient with unexplained infertility correlated to a high percentage of finding endometriosis on laparoscopy.Fifty-five consecutive patients with unexplained infertility had vaginal examinations with anterior wall palpation to determine whether there was tenderness (AVWT). As part of the infertility workup, laparoscopy, biopsies and cystoscopy with hydrodistention were performed.The prevalence ofendometriosis in this study was 78%. The sensitivity of positive AVWT on palpation with patients who were found to have endometriosis was 84%, and the specificity was 75%. The positive predictive value was 86% and the negative predictive value was 69%.Unexplained infertility may be amenable to treatment in finding problems such as endometriosis, adhesions or subtle other problems that can be corrected by use of laparoscopy instead of going directly to in vitro fertilization. AVWT is a test that may be able to aid physicians in choosing a management to treat a patient with a laparoscopy early in the workup.
