Review: luminescence as a tool to assess pelvic endometriosis development in murine models. Classic murine endometriosis models may be insufficient to evaluate the effect of therapeutic agents on endometriosis development, because the process of identification and measurement of induced lesions is often impeded, as implants are small and embedded in murine tissue. In this context, as summarized in the current review, luminescence techniques have proved useful for identifying and visualizing or quantifying endometriotic transplants. They are also a valuable tool for endometrial cell tracking in live animals, yielding further information by adding spatial and temporal dimensions to biological processes in vivo. Such approaches involve transplanting luminescently labeled murine or human endometrium into animals. Two main strategies are applied to label endometrium before injection: use of genetically modified tissue or tissue labeled with a fluorescent dye. Each model has its advantages and disadvantages, the choice of model depends on the study objectives/design (long- or short-term studies, homologous or heterologous model).
