Aromatase, cyclooxygenase 2, HER-2/neu, and p53 as prognostic factors in endometrioid endometrial cancer. The prognostic value of aromatase, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), HER-2/neu, and p53 expression was determined in endometrioid endometrial cancer. Tissue microarrays were constructed comprising samples from 315 endometrioid endometrial cancer patients. Expression of aromatase, COX-2, HER-2/neu, and p53 was determined by immunostaining and related to classical clinicohistopathologic parameters, in addition to recurrence of disease and survival. Median follow-up time for all patients was 5.0 years. Patients were classified as Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie Obstétrique stage I (59.0%), stage II (17.1%), stage III (19.4%), and stage IV (4.1%). Sixty-five patients (20.6%) developed recurrent disease, and 38 (12.1%) died because of endometrial cancer. Aromatase, COX-2, HER-2/neu, and p53 expression was observed in 133 (42.2%), 107 (34.0%), 17 (5.4%), and 21 (6.7%) tumor cases, respectively. Aromatase expression in tumor cells was related to aromatase expression in stromal cells (P < 0.0001) and to HER-2/neu expression in tumor cells (P = 0.019). Aromatase expression in tumor as well as stromal cells was related to a low stage of disease (P = 0.02 and P = 0.001, respectively), whereas aromatase expression in stromal cells was also related to a low tumor grade (P = 0.021). P53 expression was related to a high stage and a high grade (P = 0.006 and P < 0.0001, respectively). In multivariate analysis, p53 overexpression was independently related to death because of the disease (P = 0.043 odds ratio 3.0
