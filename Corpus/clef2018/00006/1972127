Differential diagnosis of ovarian cancer, benign ovarian tumor and endometriosis by a combination assay of serum sialyl SSEA-1 antigen and CA125 levels. We used a combination assay of serum sialyl SSEA-1 antigen (SLX) and CA125 levels, and evaluated the clinical usefulness of this technique for a differential diagnosis of ovarian cancer, benign ovarian tumor and endometriosis. In 82 patients with ovarian tumors, the sera of 20 (64.5%) of 31 with ovarian cancer and 15 (48.4%) of the 31 with endometriosis (endometrial cyst) were positive for both SLX and CA125, but serum SLX level was 5 U/ml or less in these 14 SLX- and CA125-positive patients with endometriosis. The sera of 16 (80.0%) patients with benign ovarian tumor were negative for both tumor markers. The sera of 3 (9.7%) of 31 with ovarian cancer and the sera of 2 (6.5%) of 31 with endometriosis were negative for both markers. The diagnostic accuracy (true positive rate X true negative rate) of the combination assay for ovarian cancer was 49.0% when the cutoff value of the serum SLX was 38 U/ml but improved to 78.5% when the value was set at 50 U/ml. When the cutoff value of serum SLX was set at 50 U/ml and that of serum CA125 at 35 U/ml, 27 of 37 patients who were positive only for CA125 had endometriosis. From the above observations, a combination assay of serum SLX and CA125 is a promising method for the differential diagnosis of malignant and benign ovarian tumors. Our results also suggest that to improve the diagnostic accuracy, the cutoff value of the serum SLX level should be 50 U/ml for ovarian tumors alone.
