Leptin in non-autoimmune inflammation. Leptin is an adipokine that modulates multiple functions including energy homeostasis, thermoregulation, bone metabolism, endocrine and pro-inflammatory immune responses. Several studies have implicated leptin in the pathogenesis of chronic autoimmune inflammatory conditions such as autoimmune encephalomyelitis, intestinal bowel inflammation and type-1 diabetes. This review focuses on the role of leptin in non-autoimmune inflammatory diseases that include renal, liver and lung inflammation, atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome, Beh√ßet's disease and endometriosis.
