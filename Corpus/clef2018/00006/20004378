B lymphocyte stimulator -817C>T promoter polymorphism and the predisposition for the development of deep infiltrating endometriosis. The prevalence of the BLyS -817C>T polymorphic variant among women with either deep infiltrating endometriosis or adenomyosis compared with a group of gynecologic patients without symptomatic endometriosis and a group of healthy women was assessed in this study. Patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis had less often a BLyS -817C/T genotype as compared with the reference group, with an odds ratio of 0.50 (95% confidence interval 0.27-0.93 versus the C/C genotype).
