Antiproliferative effects of anastrozole, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil on endometriosis in vitro and in vivo. To investigate the effects of antiproliferative drugs (anastrozole, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) on the proliferation of endometriotic cells in vitro and in vivo.Ex vivo study on human endometrial and endometriotic cells in culture establishment of a murine model using mice implanted with human endometriosis.University research center.Ten patients with ovarian endometrioma, 10 patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis, and 10 patients without endometriosis.Stromal and epithelial cells were extracted from endometrial and endometriotic biopsies from patients with endometriosis and from patients without endometriosis. Cells were treated in vitro with anastrozole, methotrexate, progesterone, or 5-FU. Human endometriotic lesions were implanted in nude mice. Mice were treated with 5-FU or phosphate-buffered saline during 4 weeks before sacrifice and extraction of the endometriotic implants.Stromal and epithelial cell proliferation and pathology score of endometriotic implants.Although anastrozole, methotrexate, and progesterone were ineffective, 5-FU significantly decreased the proliferation of endometriotic cells in vitro and controlled the growth of both cells from ovarian endometrioma and deep infiltrating endometriosis.Considering common features between endometriotic cells and tumor cells, the use of 5-FU could be an option in the management of severe endometriosis.
