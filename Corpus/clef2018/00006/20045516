Identification biomarkers of eutopic endometrium in endometriosis using artificial neural networks and protein fingerprinting. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) protein chip array technology was used to detect biomarkers of eutopic endometrium in endometriosis patients. Five potential biomarkers (6,898 m/z, 5,891 m/z, 5,385 m/z, 6,448 m/z, and 5,425 m/z) were found.
