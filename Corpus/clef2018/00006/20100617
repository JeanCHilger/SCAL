Polymorphisms in MMP-2 and MMP-9 promoter regions are associated with endometriosis. In this case-control study, we investigated the potential associations of MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene promoter region polymorphisms as well as MMP-2 promoter haplotypes with susceptibility to endometriosis in women of caucasian origin. The results demonstrated that polymorphisms in MMP-2 (-735 C/T) and MMP-9 (-1562 C/T) were associated with elevated risk of endometriosis and that certain MMP-2 promoter haplotypes were more common in control group.
