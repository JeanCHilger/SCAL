Extragenital endometriosis. In recent years, there have been significant changes in many aspects of extragenital endometriosis ranging from the epidemiology to the management of the disease. Advances in minimally invasive surgery and expansion of the field have lead to further research in management of extragenital endometriosis. As a result, treatment has shifted from medical management toward a surgical, multidisciplinary approach. Surgery for extragenital endometriosis clearly improves outcome through relief of symptoms, improved quality-of-life, increased fertility rates, and reduced recurrences. Endoscopy has a pivotal role as both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool.
