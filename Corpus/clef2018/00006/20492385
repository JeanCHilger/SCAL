Gene expression profiles and microsatellite instability in uterine corpus endometrioid adenocarcinoma. We examined corpus cancer to identify whether there are distinctive patterns of global gene expression and microsatellite instability, and to gain molecular understanding of its carcinogenesis and progression.Thirty endometrioid corpus cancer tissue samples (21 of G1 and nine of G2/3) were analyzed by cDNA microarray based on 637 cancer-associated genes and by a polymerase chain reaction method for microsatellite instability.Of the 30 cases, 10 (33%) were recognized as having microsatellite instability. In all cases, four genes were overexpressed and five genes were underexpressed. There were six microsatellite instability-specific overexpressed or high-frequency genes and 15 underexpressed or low-frequency genes. Furthermore, we identified several genes by grade analysis.These results may be useful resources for the development of diagnostic assays, prognostic factors, or therapeutic targets for corpus endometrioid cancer.
