Endometriosis. Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependant disease that affects 10 to 15% of women of reproductive age. Its aetiology and molecular mechanisms involved have not yet been fully explored. Endometriosis is defined by the presence of endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus, primarily on the pelvic peritoneum and ovaries. The main clinical features are chronic pelvic pain, pain during intercourse, and infertility. Due to the limitations of clinical examination, additional explorations such as transvaginal sonography and magnetic resonance imaging are required to precise mapping of endometriotic lesions. Medical therapies based on progesterone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists have a suspensive effect. In some cases, surgery is necessary and will be best achieved in specialized centers.
