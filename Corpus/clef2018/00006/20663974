Incidental adnexal masses detected at low-dose unenhanced CT in asymptomatic women age 50 and older: implications for clinical management and ovarian cancer screening. To determine the prevalence, work-up, and outcomes of indeterminate adnexal masses identified at low-dose unenhanced computed tomography (CT) in asymptomatic women age 50 and older undergoing colonography screening.This study was institutional review board approved and HIPAA compliant. Informed consent was waived. The fate of indeterminate adnexal lesions identified at unenhanced CT in 2869 consecutive women (mean age, 57.2 years age range, 50-97 years) undergoing colonography screening between April 2004 and December 2008 was evaluated.One hundred eighteen women (mean age, 56.2 years), representing 4.1% of the screening cohort, had an indeterminate adnexal mass (108 unilateral, 10 bilateral mean size, 4.1 cm) at prospective CT interpretation. A total of 80 women underwent some combination of further imaging evaluation (n = 76) (transvaginal ultrasonography [n = 71], pelvic magnetic resonance imaging [n = 7], contrast material-enhanced CT [n = 7]) and/or surgery (n = 26). Mean serum CA-125 level in 33 women was 12.8 U/mLIncidental indeterminate adnexal lesions were relatively common at unenhanced CT (4.1%), but subsequent work-up revealed no ovarian cancers. Furthermore, a normal finding at CT was not protective against short-term development of ovarian cancer. More sophisticated risk factor assessment is needed to identify women at higher risk.
