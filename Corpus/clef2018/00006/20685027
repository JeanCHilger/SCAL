Genetic variations in vascular endothelial growth factor but not in angiotensin I-converting enzyme genes are associated with endometriosis in Estonian women. To determine plausible associations between endometriosis and vascular endothelial growth factor gene (VEGF -2578 A/C, -1154 G/A, -634 G/C and 936 C/T), also angiotensin I-converting enzyme gene (ACE -240 A/T and 2350 A/G) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as their respective haplotypes.PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used to detect SNPs in VEGF and ACE genes in 150 Estonian women with endometriosis and 199 control subjects.The CC genotype of the VEGF -2578 A/C SNP was correlated with a decreased risk of endometriosis (OR=0.40, 95% CI 0.20-0.78). Other VEGF and ACE SNPs and haplotypes were not associated with endometriosis.This case-control study demonstrated that the VEGF -2578 A/C SNP may influence susceptibility to endometriosis in the Estonian population, while associations between endometriosis and other VEGF and ACE SNPs, as well as the respective haplotypes are unlikely.
