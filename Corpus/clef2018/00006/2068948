S-100 protein in ovarian tumors. A comparative immunohistochemical study of 135 cases. The distribution of S-100 protein in 135 ovarian tumors, of which 127 were epithelial, was investigated using the immunoperoxidase method. S-100 protein has been demonstrated previously in tumors of various origins. The present study further revealed its characteristic distribution in common epithelial tumors of the ovary. S-100 protein was present in 69% of serous tumors (benign, 50% borderline, 100%
