Perineal endometriosis: a case report and review of the literature. Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity, which most commonly affects peritoneal surfaces, ovaries and uterine ligaments. Even it is quite rare, endometriosis may affect the vulva, vagina, rectovaginal septum or perineal region, generally secondary to obstetric or surgical trauma. In this case report, we present a patient with perineal endometriosis in an episiotomy scar. Diagnostic tools used included transvaginal and endorectal ultrasonography (USG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biopsy. The endometriotic mass was wide-excised together with episiotomy scar. The recovery was uneventful with excellent functional and esthetic results. Six months after operation, woman is asymptomatic. According to the literature and our own experience, wide excision of endometriotic tissue seems to be the best chance of cure with satisfactory functional results and should be recommended.
