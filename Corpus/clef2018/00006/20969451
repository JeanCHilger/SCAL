Triptorelin embonate: a 6-month formulation for prostate cancer. Luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LH RH) agonists are the major agent for androgen deprivation therapy in advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. They also have a role in endometriosis, uterine fibroids and central precocious puberty.Triptorelin embonate 22.5 mg is a new, sustained-release, 6-month formulation of an LH RH agonist. It possesses longer duration of action than the current standard 3-month preparation and appears to have similar efficacy and side effects.The use of LH RH agonists for androgen deprivation in prostate cancer has increased considerably in the last 20 years. Recent work has shown that some of this usage has constituted overtreatment and it is within these newer paradigms of therapy that the new 6-month preparation is situated.The new 6-month LH RH preparation - triptorelin embonate - will be of help in several key areas of therapy for prostate cancer, notably as an adjunct to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. It possesses a similar effect, but with fewer side effects, than those that are now commonly available.
