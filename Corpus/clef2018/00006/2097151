Placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP)/PLAP-like alkaline phosphatase as tumour marker in relation to CA 125 and TPA for ovarian epithelial tumours. The significance of the PLAP (Placental alkaline phosphatase)/PLAP-like isozyme as tumour marker in relation to CA 125 and TPA for the monitoring of patients with malignant ovarian epithelial tumours was evaluated. Of all patients (n = 85), 40% had all three markers elevated. CA 125 being the most sensitive (60%), and the PLAP/PLAP-like isozyme and TPA both 40%. A tendency to certain tumour marker patterns of these three antigens in serum can be seen with regard to histopathology. Serous and anaplastic adenocarcinomas usually have all three markers moderately elevated, mucinous and mesonephric adenocarcinomas both have low incidences and low average levels of all three markers. Endometrioid and non-mucinous adenocarcinomas are often associated with high levels of the PLAP/PLAP-like isozyme and CA 125, while TPA shows moderate elevation. The PLAP/PLAP-like isozyme is positively correlated to tumour burden and the outcome of the disease. It may provide additional information on CA 125 in the monitoring of patients with ovarian cancer.
