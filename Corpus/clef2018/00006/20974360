Radiology of benign disorders of menstruation. Menstrual complaints are common and include pain, abnormal bleeding, and menstrual irregularity. The etiology is wide-ranging and includes endometriosis, fibroids, adenomyosis, pelvic congestion syndrome, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometrial hyperplasia, and polyps. Polycystic ovarian syndrome and some congenital uterine anomalies may present with menstrual disturbance and have been included in this review. Transvaginal ultrasound is widely used as first-line investigation. Magnetic resonance imaging is used increasingly with high diagnostic accuracy and confidence. Its multiplanar capacity and superior tissue contrast resolution enable accurate presurgical mapping of fibroids, deep pelvic endometriosis, and adenomyosis. Similarly, accurate differentiation of congenital uterine anomalies depends on multiplanar imaging with either 3-dimensional ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging. Recent advances in imaging and radiological intervention, combined with an understanding of the underlying causes of menstrual dysfunction, therefore aid in accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning.
