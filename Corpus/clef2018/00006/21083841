Endometrioid ovarian cancer and endometriotic cells exhibit the same alteration in the expression of interleukin-1 receptor II: to a link between endometriosis and endometrioid ovarian cancer. Endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary is the third most common type of epithelial ovarian cancer. Endometrioid tumors as well as endometriotic implants are characterized by the presence of epithelial cells, stromal cells, or a combination of booth, that resemble the endometrial cells, suggesting a possible endometrial origin of these tumors. Th1 cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1 have been reported to be involved in both endometriosis and ovarian carcinogenesis. We assessed the expression of receptors of IL-1 (IL-1RI and IL-1RII, the signal transducer and the specific inhibitor of IL-1, respectively) in cells of the most common subtypes of ovarian cancer compared to endometrial cells.IL1-Rs expression was analyzed at the levels of the protein and mRNA using immunofluorescent and real-time polymerase chain reaction methods, respectively.We showed that endometrioid cells exhibit a specific decrease of IL-1RII expression, whereas IL-1RI was constantly expressed in all studied cell subtypes.As already reported in endometriotic cells, endometrioid ovarian cancer cells exhibit the same alteration in the expression of IL-1RII, a key protector against tumorigenic effects of IL-1. Our findings highlight a common signature between endometrioid ovarian cancer and implants of endometriosis, which needs to be fully explored.
