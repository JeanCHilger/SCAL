Surgical procedures and their cost estimates among women with newly diagnosed endometriosis: a US database study. This descriptive study assessed the rate and costs of surgical procedures among newly diagnosed endometriosis patients.Utilizing the Medstat MarketScan database, commercially insured women aged 18-45 with endometriosis newly diagnosed during 2006-2007 were identified. Each endometriosis patient was matched to four women without endometriosis (population controls) based on age and region of residence. Surgical procedures received during the 12 months post-diagnosis were assessed. Costs of surgical procedures were the amount paid by the insurance companies.This study identified 15,891 women with newly diagnosed endometriosis and 63,564 population controls. More than 65% of endometriosis patients received an endometriosis-related surgical procedure within 1 year of the initial diagnosis. The most common procedure was therapeutic laparoscopy (31.6%), followed by abdominal hysterectomy (22.1%) and vaginal hysterectomy (6.8%). Prevalence and type of surgery performed varied by patient age, including a hysterectomy rate of approximately 16% in patients younger than 35 and 37% among patients aged 35-45 years. Average costs ranged from $4,289 (standard deviation [SD]: $3,313) for diagnostic laparoscopy to $11,397 (SD: $8,749) for abdominal hysterectomy.Diagnosis of endometriosis cannot be validated against medical records, and information on the severity of endometriosis-related symptoms is not available in administrative claims data.Over 65% of patients had endometriosis-related surgical procedures, including hysterectomy, within 1 year of being diagnosed with endometriosis. The cost of surgical procedures related to endometriosis places a significant financial burden on the healthcare system.
