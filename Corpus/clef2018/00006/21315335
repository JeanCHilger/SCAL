Comparison of revised American Fertility Society and ENZIAN staging: a critical evaluation of classifications of endometriosis on the basis of our patient population. To develop a classification that takes deep infiltrating endometriosis into account, the ENZIAN score was introduced. The ENZIAN classification supplements the revised American Fertility Society (AFS) score with regard to the description of deep infiltrating endometriosis, retroperitoneal structures, and other organs. The null hypothesis was that classifying a lesion by the revised AFS as well as the ENZIAN system is not meaningful, because the two systems express different locations.Retrospective.Hospital admissions.Two hundred nineteen women admitted for endometriosis.Surgical interventions.Classification of the severity of endometriosis according to the revised AFS and the ENZIAN classification, focusing on the distribution pattern in deep infiltrating endometriosis, and the identification of duplicate classifications of the same lesions in the revised AFS as well as the ENZIAN systems.Deep infiltrating endometriosis was diagnosed in 160 of 219 patients (73%). These patients had 236 lesions of deep infiltrating endometriosis, which were classified by ENZIAN as follows: compartment a (vertical): 26% compartment b (horizontal): 41%The ENZIAN score is a helpful aid to describe deep infiltrating endometriosis, but needs to be adapted.
