Is uterine-sparing surgical management of persistent postpartum hemorrhage truly a fertility-sparing technique? Among 23 women who underwent diagnostic hysteroscopy after triple uterine artery ligation with or without hemostatic multiple square suturing for the management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), five had abnormal findings. Endometritis was statistically significantly associated with abnormal diagnostic hysteroscopy findings. Twelve patients developed subsequent pregnancies, and four had abnormal obstetric outcomes: one placenta percreta, one placenta accreta, one recurrent postpartum hemorrhage, and one intrauterine growth retardation.
