Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule expression is up-regulated in the development of endometrioid carcinoma. Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM/CD166) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that contributes to cell migration. The present study investigated the potential role of ALCAM in the transition from normal endometrium to endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EEC).To clarify the role of ALCAM in endometrial tumorigenesis, we determined the levels of protein and messenger RNA expression of ALCAM in human endometrial tissue (proliferative phase [n = 20], secretory phase [n = 20], simple hyperplasia [n = 15], complex hyperplasia [n = 12], atypical hyperplasia [AH, n = 14], EEC [n = 42]) using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively.Expression of ALCAM detected by immunohistochemistry showed a gradual increase from normal endometrium to atypical hyperplasia in a membranous pattern in addition, cytoplasmic staining emerged in a few cases of simple hyperplasia and complex hyperplasia, which also showed an increasing tendency. Most cases of EEC showed a homogenously strong staining in all parts of the tumorThe up-regulation of ALCAM expression during endometrial carcinogenesis and the correlations of ALCAM expression with grade and myometrial invasion suggest its potential role as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.
