Periodontal status of males attending an in vitro fertilization clinic. An association has been demonstrated previously between periodontal diseases and various systemic conditions, including endometriosis. A possible role of dental infection in male infertility was also suggested. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between fertility parameters and the periodontal status of men attending a fertility and in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinic.The study population consisted of 75 men attending the clinic for sperm analysis before homologue semen insemination or IVF. The quality of sperm was assessed according to WHO criteria. On the same day, patients received a clinical periodontal examination.The patients were diagnosed with either gingivitis (40%) or periodontitis (48%), whereas the remaining 12% were classified as "periodontally healthy". Normospermia was attributed to 37%, oligozoospermia to 48% and azoospermia to 15% of these patients. Familial infertility was significantly associated with having at least one WHO parameter contributing to infertility. A higher number of sites with deep periodontal pockets tended to associate positively with sperm sub-motility. Clinical attachment levels were significantly associated with sperm sub-motility.These findings may point to a possible association between male infertility, diminished semen quality and periodontal infections in men attending fertility and IVF clinics.
