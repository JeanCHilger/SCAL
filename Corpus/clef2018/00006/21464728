Expression of tissue factor and heparanase in endometrial clear cell carcinoma: possible role for tissue factor in thromboembolic events. Earlier reports have indicated that patients with endometrial clear cell carcinoma (CCC) may have an increased risk for thromboembolic events. Tissue factor is a 47-Kd transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in platelet activation, fibrinogenesis, blood clot formation, and as such, general hemostasis. The mammalian heparanase is an endo-Î²-glucuronidase that can cleave heparan sulfate at specific molecular sites, resulting in structural modification of the extracellular matrix barrier, facilitating cancer cell invasion, and eventual metastasis. Recent reports indicate that heparanase may also induce tissue factor expression. The purpose of this study is to assess the clinicopathologic significance of tissue factor and heparanase expression, especially as they relate to the risk of thromboembolic events, in endometrial CCC and selected other endometrial cancers. Eighty-four endometrial carcinomas, including 17 CCC, 20 endometrial serous carcinomas, 15 grade 1 endometrial endometrioid carcinomas (EEC), 15 grade 2 EEC, 10 grade 3 EEC, and 7 mixed endometrial carcinomas with at least a 10% clear cell component (mixed CCC) were evaluated for the immunophenotypic expression of heparanase and tissue factor, and their associated frequency of thromboembolic events. Seven of the 84 patients experienced 8 thromboembolic events during the follow-up period. By multivariate analysis, the pure CCC histotype [odds ratio 5.2 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4523-13.6754
