Adenomyosis and junctional zone changes in patients with endometriosis. To evaluate image findings in the junctional zone (JZ) in patients with endometriosis and correlate with image findings of adenomyosis. To attempt a correlation of the degree of adenomyotic infiltration with the degree of infiltration and stage of endometriosis.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the uterus was performed in 153 women with suspected deeply infiltrating endometriosis and planned surgery, and in a reference group of 129 women without endometriosis, verified during hysterectomy. Changes in the JZ and endometriosis in the pelvis were described in detail. Diagnosis of adenomyosis at MRI was based on optimal criteria derived from the hysterectomy control group. The stage of endometriosis (AFS stage) was determined during surgery.In the group of women with endometriosis 34.6% had adenomyosis compared with 19.4% in the reference group (p<0.05). More women with endometriosis (39.9%) had an irregular JZ compared to 22.5% in the reference group (p<0.01). Among women with severe endometriosis (AFS stage IV) 42.8% had adenomyosis compared to 29.4% in the women with other stages of endometriosis (AFS stages I+II+III) (p=0.10). More women with severe endometriosis (AFS stage IV) had deeper wall invasion of adenomyosis (p>0.05) but the presence of deep infiltrative rectovaginal endometriosis and the size of infiltration were not correlated to adenomyosis or depth of infiltration of adenomyosis.In a group of young women with severe symptomatic endometriosis and planned surgery a systematic evaluation of the JZ revealed that one third had uterine adenomyosis, but the invasive potential of endometrial cells in the uterus and in the peritoneum corresponded only to a limited degree.
