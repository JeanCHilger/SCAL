Genetic polymorphism of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. To investigate the association of uPA system genes, including uPA, uPA receptor (uPAR), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 gene polymorphisms, with risk of endometrial cancer.In the present case control study, we enrolled a total of 134 patients with endometrial cancer confirmed by histopathology and 302 unrelated healthy individuals. Genetic polymorphisms of uPA system genes, including uPA rs4065 C/T SNP, uPAR rs344781 T/C SNP, and PAI-1 rs1799889 4G/5G SNP were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) genotyping analysis.Frequency of PAI-1 rs1799889 4G/4G genotype and 4G allele differed significantly between patients with endometrial cancer (36.6% and 61.6%, respectively) and healthy individuals (25.5% and 52.2%, respectively). Individuals with PAI-1 rs1799889 4G/4G genotype were at higher risk of endometrial cancer (OR = 2.26 95% CI: 1.20-4.27). Stratification analysis showed individuals with PAI-1 rs1799889 4G/4G genotype were at elevated risk for endometrioid type (OR = 2.49Individuals with PAI-1 rs1799889 4G/4G genotype were at significantly higher risk of endometrial cancer in this study.
