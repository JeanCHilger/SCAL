Ovarian clear cell carcinoma as a stress-responsive cancer: influence of the microenvironment on the carcinogenesis and cancer phenotype. Although it is well known that ovarian endometriosis occasionally gives rise to ovarian cancers with specific histology such as endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas, its etiology is not fully understood. We have shown that a stressful microenvironment within the endometriotic cyst may lead to cancer development by inducing unique gene expressions, which potentially serves as a molecular marker for treatment modality. In this review, by referring to other articles in this field, we explore how the carcinogenic microenvironment affects the phenotype and gene expression of a cancer, and how we can develop new treatment based on this concept.
