Management of hereditary ovarian cancer. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes account for the majority of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Approximately 10% of cases of ovarian cancer are due to germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Ovarian cancer associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations has a distinct histological phenotype. This type of cancer is predominantly of serous or endometrioid histology and is high grade. Patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations should be offered risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy by age 40 years, or when childbearing is complete. Nowadays there are no differences between the treatments provided for sporadic and hereditary ovarian cancer, although there are indications that targeted therapy is effective in women with BRCA1/BRCA2-associated tumors. Retrospective studies reveal a high level of sensitivity to platinum agents in BRCA-associated tumors and initial trials show good efficacy and tolerability for polyADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors in mutation carriers with advanced ovarian cancers. These agents might also potentially be used in chemoprevention. Authors review the current management of hereditary ovarian cancer.
