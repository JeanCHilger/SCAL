Loss of ARID1A protein expression occurs as an early event in ovarian clear-cell carcinoma development and frequently coexists with PIK3CA mutations. ARID1A is a recently identified tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in âˆ¼50% of ovarian clear-cell carcinomas. This mutation is associated with loss of ARID1A protein expression as assessed by immunohistochemistry. The present study aimed at determining the timing of the loss of ARID1A protein expression during the development of ovarian clear-cell carcinoma and assessing its relevance in correlation to PIK3CA gene mutations. A total of 42 clear-cell carcinoma cases with adjacent putative precursor lesions (endometriosis-associated carcinoma cases (n=28) and (clear-cell) adenofibroma-associated carcinoma cases (n=14)) were selected and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for ARID1A protein expression and direct genomic DNA sequencing of exons 9 and 20 of the PIK3CA gene. ARID1A immunoreactivity was deficient in 17 (61%) of the 28 endometriosis-associated carcinomas and 6 (43%) of the 14 adenofibroma-associated carcinomas. Among the precursor lesions adjacent to the 23 ARID1A-deficient carcinomas, 86% of the non-atypical endometriosis (12 of 14) and 100% of the atypical endometriosis (14 of 14), benign (3 of 3), and borderline (6 of 6) clear-cell adenofibroma components were found to be ARID1A deficient. In contrast, in the 19 patients with ARID1A-intact carcinomas, all of the adjacent precursor lesions retained ARID1A expression regardless of their types and cytological atypia. Analysis of 22 solitary endometrioses and 10 endometrioses distant from ARID1A-deficient carcinomas showed that all of these lesions were diffusely immunoreactive for ARID1A. Among the 42 clear-cell carcinomas, somatic mutations of PIK3CA were detected in 17 (40%) tumors and majority (71%) of these were ARID1A-deficient carcinomas. These results suggest that loss of ARID1A protein expression occurs as a very early event in ovarian clear-cell carcinoma development, similar to the pattern of PIK3CA mutation recently reported by our group, and frequently coexists (not mutually exclusive) with PIK3CA mutations.
