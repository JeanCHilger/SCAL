Laparoscopic management of large ovarian cysts. The aim of this study was to describe a new technique for laparoscopic removal of large ovarian cystic masses. The authors performed a retrospective study during the period January 2008 to December 2009 in the Second Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Aretaieion University Hospital 19 women with large ovarian cysts were included in the study. During the study period, 53 women underwent laparoscopic excision of ovarian cysts. Among them, 19 had very large complex ovarian cysts with a mean diameter of 8.4 cm. The mean age of the patients was 32.1 years. Ultrasound examination revealed findings suggestive of benign disease in all patients. In 8 out of 19 patients CA-125 levels were elevated, ranging from 40.5 to 194.7 IU/mL. A 5-mm suprapubic trocar was directly inserted into the cyst and fluid contents aspirated, so the decompressed cyst could fit in a 5-cm laparoscopic bag. The cyst wall was carefully detached from the healthy ovarian tissue and placed in the bag without any spillage. The remaining cyst wall was removed from the peritoneal cavity with the laparoscopic bag. The mean operative time was 45 minutes. No operative or postoperative complications were noted. There was no conversion to laparotomy. Mean hospital stay was 1 day. Pathology revealed 7 endometriomas, 3 mucinous cystadenomas, 3 serous cystadenomas, 3 serous cysts, and 3 teratomas. Direct trocar insertion within the ovarian cyst followed by aspiration of the fluid contents is a safe and feasible method for the laparoscopic management of large ovarian cysts.
