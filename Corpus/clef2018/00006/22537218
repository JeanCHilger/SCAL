Imbalance in cytokines from interleukin-1 family - role in pathogenesis of endometriosis. To assess whether interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-18 and interleukin-1 converting enzyme (ICE) are involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.Peritoneal fluid (PF) was obtained from 85 women with and without endometriosis. Peritoneal macrophages were cultured and the culture media collected. IL-1beta, IL-18 and ICE levels were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Levels of IL-1beta and ICE in PF of women with endometriosis were higher than those in the control group. However, PF level of IL-18 was significantly lower in the study group than in the controls. Higher secretion of IL-1beta by peritoneal macrophages and lower IL-18 and ICE in endometriosis patients than in control were observed. Following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, the macrophages secreted more IL-1beta, IL-18 and ICE in all groups.The results pointed to impairment of the secretion of the IL-1 cytokine family in endometriosis. Invalid IL-1beta and IL-18 maturation by ICE may be an important pathogenic factor in endometriosis.
