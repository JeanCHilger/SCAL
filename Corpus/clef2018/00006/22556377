Combined mRNA microarray and proteomic analysis of eutopic endometrium of women with and without endometriosis. An early semi-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis has the potential to allow early treatment and minimize disease progression but no such test is available at present. Our aim was to perform a combined mRNA microarray and proteomic analysis on the same eutopic endometrium sample obtained from patients with and without endometriosis.mRNA and protein fractions were extracted from 49 endometrial biopsies obtained from women with laparoscopically proven presence (n= 31) or absence (n= 18) of endometriosis during the early luteal (n= 27) or menstrual phase (n= 22) and analyzed using microarray and proteomic surface enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, respectively. Proteomic data were analyzed using a least squares-support vector machines (LS-SVM) model built on 70% (training set) and 30% of the samples (test set).mRNA analysis of eutopic endometrium did not show any differentially expressed genes in women with endometriosis when compared with controls, regardless of endometriosis stage or cycle phase. mRNA was differentially expressed (P< 0.05) in women with (925 genes) and without endometriosis (1087 genes) during the menstrual phase when compared with the early luteal phase. Proteomic analysis based on five peptide peaks [2072 mass/charge (m/z) 2973 m/zmRNA expression of eutopic endometrium was comparable in women with and without endometriosis but different in menstrual endometrium when compared with luteal endometrium in women with endometriosis. Proteomic analysis of luteal phase endometrium allowed the diagnosis of endometriosis with high sensitivity and specificity in training and test sets. A potential limitation of our study is the fact that our control group included women with a normal pelvis as well as women with concurrent pelvic disease (e.g. fibroids, benign ovarian cysts, hydrosalpinges), which may have contributed to the comparable mRNA expression profile in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis and controls.
