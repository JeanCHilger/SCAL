Inflammation: a link between endometriosis and preterm birth. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting women's health. Pain and infertility are the major symptoms caused by a hormonal/immunological dysfunction, which causes an endometrial impairment. The same pathogenetic mechanisms are also associated with preterm birth: hormones, cytokines, neurohormones, and growth factors interact in modulating extracellular matrix and prostaglandin secretion, thus activating the inflammatory process in placental membranes and myometrium. An overlap of molecules and mechanisms may explain the evidence that preterm birth is a common outcome in pregnant patients with endometriosis.
