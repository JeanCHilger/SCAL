The hormonal status and steroid receptor system of the endometrium in patients with benign tumors and endometrioid cysts of the ovaries. Plasma concentrations of protein hormones (LH, FSH, prolactin) and steroid hormones (estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol) have been assayed during the follicular and luteal phase of the cycle in patients with benign cysts and endometrioid cysts of the ovaries. Endometrial estradiol and progesterone receptors were also examined in these patients in the midluteal phase. These studies described steroid and gonadotropic hormone secretion of both the luteal and follicular phase in the two populations, as well as steroid receptors of the secretory endometrium. The most serious abnormalities were found in the endometrium of the patients with endometrioid ovarian cysts. These disorders suggest their relationship with infertility in the patients with benign ovarian neoplasms.
