Survivin, MMP-2, MT1-MMP, and TIMP-2: their impact on survival, implantation, and proliferation of endometriotic tissues. In order to study survivin, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2), membranous type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), and tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) expression immunohistochemically in endometriotic tissues and normal endometrium, our retrospective study considered 194 patients affected by endometriosis and 71 patients with normal endometrium. Tissue microarrays were created from paraffin-embedded blocks immunohistochemistry was used to assess protein expression. In endometriotic tissues, survivin was expressed at a higher level than in normal endometrium
