TP53 PIN3 and PEX4 polymorphisms and infertility associated with endometriosis or with post-in vitro fertilization implantation failure. p53 has a crucial role in human fertility by regulating the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a secreted cytokine critical for blastocyst implantation. To examine whether TP53 polymorphisms may be involved with in vitro fertilization (IVF) failure and endometriosis (END), we have assessed the associations between TP53 polymorphism in intron 2 (PIN2 G/C, intron 2), PIN3 (one (N, non-duplicated) or two (D, duplicated) repeats of a 16-bp motif, intron 3) and polymorphism in exon 4 (PEX4
