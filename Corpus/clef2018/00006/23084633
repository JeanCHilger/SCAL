Mammaglobin expression in gynecologic adenocarcinomas. Mammaglobin (MGB) has been proposed as a sensitive and specific immunohistochemical marker for adenocarcinoma of the breast. The differential diagnosis of breast adenocarcinoma versus a gynecologic primary frequently arises. We performed a semiquantitative survey of MGB immunoreactivity in 26 benign gynecologic tissues (6 ectocervices, 9 endocervices, 11 endometria), 86 ovarian adenocarcinomas, 70 endometrial adenocarcinomas, and 10 endocervical adenocarcinomas. Among ovarian tumors, MGB was present in 40% of endometrioid carcinomas 36%, serous carcinomas
