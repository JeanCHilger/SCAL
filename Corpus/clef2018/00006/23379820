Promoter hypermethylation contributes to TIMP3 down-regulation in high stage endometrioid endometrial carcinomas. Expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) has been found to be decreased in several types of cancer by promoter gene hypermethylation. However, little is known regarding the silencing effect of TIMP3 promoter hypermethylation on gene and protein expression in endometrial carcinomas and its prognostic significance.TIMP3 promoter hypermethylation and gene copy number variations were evaluated using a methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification approach in 60 cases of endometrioid endometrial carcinomas. TIMP3 expression was also evaluated at the transcript and protein levels. Loss of TIMP-3 protein expression was found in 44 (73%) of 60 carcinomas. Promoter hypermethylation was identified in 25% (15 of 60) was more frequent in stages II-IV (55%, six of 11) than in stage I (18%, nine of 49TIMP3 promoter hypermethylation was associated with high stage endometrioid endometrial tumours with extrauterine spread. Nevertheless, promoter hypermethylation and loss of heterozygosity are not the only mechanisms for TIMP3 inactivation.
