Autoimmune polyglandular syndromes. The autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS) is defined as the manifestation of at least two endocrine autoimmune diseases. In order to take the wide spectrum of components and the variations of the disease fully into account, APS is usually divided up into the rare juvenile type (APS I) and the more common adult type (APS II-IV). APS I is caused by a monogenetic mutation whereas APS II-IV has a multifactorial genesis with combination related subgroups. Early diagnosis, individual adjustment of therapy and screening of high risk patients in particular are regarded as clinically relevant. In addition to the patient's history, the diagnosis of APS encompasses serologic measurement of organ-specific autoantibodies as well as a clinical examination and functional tests. However, the analysis of immunological modificating, zytokine-coding and tissue-specific genes could also be important within a screening. Although APS is a rather rare disease with an incidence of 1:100 000 (juvenile APS) and 1:20 000 (adult APS), the possibility of an autoimmune polyglandular syndrome should be timely considered. By this means, severe complications can be avoided to some extent and the patients' physical as well as psychological quality of life can be ensured.
