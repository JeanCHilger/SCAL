Animal models for anti-angiogenic therapy in endometriosis. Endometriosis is a gynecological disease characterized by the growth of endometrium outside of the uterine cavity. It is often associated with dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, pelvic pain and infertility. One of the key requirements for endometriotic lesions to survive is development of a blood supply to support their growth. Indeed, dense vascularization is characteristic feature of endometriotic lesions. This has led to the idea that suppression of blood vessel growth (anti-angiogenic therapy) may be a successful therapeutic approach for endometriosis. Potential effectiveness of anti-angiogenic therapies has been assessed in some animal models but there are no reports of human clinical trials. Without understanding the specific mechanism by which endometriosis lesions establish a new blood supply, short-term animal experiments will have limited value for translation into human medicine. Further, it is crucial to use appropriate animal models to assess efficacy of anti-angiogenic compounds. Syngeneic and autologous rodent models, where endometrial fragments are auto-transplanted into the peritoneal cavity are commonly used in anti-angiogenic therapy studies. Another approach is xenograft models where human endometrium is engrafted into immunodeficient mice. Here we review the animal models and experimental techniques used to evaluate anti-angiogenic therapies for endometriosis. We also review our own work on the role of stromal cell derived factor-1 in the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells in endometriotic lesion angiogenesis, and the effects of the anti-angiogenic peptide ABT-898, a thrombospondin-1 mimetic, on endometriotic lesion growth and vascular development.
