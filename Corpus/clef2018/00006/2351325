Endometrial adenocarcinoma with variable-level myometrial involvement limited to adenomyosis: a clinicopathologic study of 23 cases. Endometrial adenocarcinoma (EA) with myometrial involvement limited to foci of adenomyosis has been associated with a better 5-year survival than EA with myometrial invasion at the corresponding depth. We identified 23 cases of stage I EA diagnosed between 1975 and 1981 in which myometrial involvement was confined entirely to adenomyotic foci. Histopathological criteria used to determine adenomyotic involvement by EA included presence of endometrial stroma presence of adjacent benign "marker" glands to indicate partial replacement of adenomyosis
