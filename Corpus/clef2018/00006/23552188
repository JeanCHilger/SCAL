Endobronchial endometriosis presenting as central-type lung cancer: a case report. A 45-year-old female patient was referred to our hospital for complaining of dyspnea and coughing in the past four months. The computed tomography scanning demonstrated a central lesion in the upper lobe of the left lung close to the hilar, and the subsequent bronchoscopy revealed a polypoid lesion of the distal of the left main bronchus. This patient was diagnosed clinically as "possibly central-type lung cancer". However, the pathologic result of the surgically excised polypoid lesion was endobronchial endometriosis.The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1077439085928525.
