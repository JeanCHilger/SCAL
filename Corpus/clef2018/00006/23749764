Influence of ovarian endometrioma on expression of steroid receptor RNA activator, estrogen receptors, vascular endothelial growth factor, and thrombospondin 1 in the surrounding ovarian tissues. This study investigates the influence of ovarian endometrioma on expression of steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA), estrogen receptors (ERs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) in the surrounding ovarian tissues. Taken from the women with ovarian endometrioma and mature teratoma during laparoscopy, the biopsies were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Our results indicated that ovarian tissues surrounding endometrioma had lower SRA and ER-α levels but higher SRA protein (SRAP) and ER-β levels than ovarian endometrioma. With lower VEGF levels and higher TSP-1 levels, the surrounding ovarian tissues showed higher expression levels of SRA, SRAP, ER-α, and ER-β in the ovarian endometrioma group when compared to the controls. These data showed that ovarian endometrioma increases SRA, ERs, and TSP-1 but decreases VEGF levels in the surrounding ovarian tissues, suggesting that abnormal expression of these molecules may affect biological behaviors of ovarian endometrioma.
