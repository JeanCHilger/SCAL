Expression patterns of progesterone receptor membrane components 1 and 2 in endometria from women with and without endometriosis. Endometriosis is a hormone-dependent inflammatory condition associated with pain and infertility. A growing body of evidence supports attenuated secretory-phase progesterone responsiveness in women with this disease. Herein, we compare the expression of progesterone receptor membrane components (PGRMC) 1 and 2 in eutopic endometrium from 11 women with laparoscopically and/or histologically proven stage III/IV endometriosis and 23 disease-free women. Menstrual cycle phase was determined using a combination of reported cycle day, serum hormone profile, and endometrial histologic dating. The PGRMC-1 (fold change -3.3 P < .05) and PGRMC-2 (fold-change -8.8
