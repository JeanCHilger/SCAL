RECQL1 DNA repair helicase: a potential therapeutic target and a proliferative marker against ovarian cancer. This study analyzed the clinicopathological correlation between ovarian cancer (OC) and RECQL1 DNA helicase to assess its therapeutic potential.Surgically resected OC from 118 retrospective cases, for which paraffin blocks and all clinical data were complete, were used in this study. RECQL1 and Ki-67 immunostaining were performed on sections to correlate RECQL1 staining with subtype and patient survival. Ten OC and two normal cell lines were then examined for RECQL1 expression and were treated with siRNA against RECQL1 to assess its effect on cell proliferation.Of the 118 cases of adenocarcinoma (50, serous 26, endometrioidRECQL1 DNA helicase is a marker of highly proliferative cells. RECQL1-siRNA may offer a new therapeutic strategy against various subtypes of OC, including platinum-resistant cancers, or in recurrent cancers that gain platinum resistance.
