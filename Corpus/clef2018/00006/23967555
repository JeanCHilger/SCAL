Morular endometrial metaplasia: review of the literature and proposal of the management. Morular endometrial metaplasia is a rare condition that can be often misdiagnosed and overtreated, because it can be mistaken for a malignant disease. The aim of this review was to update the current opinion on the significance of this pathology and its risk for potential malignancies.The authors report their experience of two cases of morular metaplasia involving very young women managed conservatively with hysteroscopic resection of the affected areas.Hysteroscopic resection of these lesions can be an adequate and fertility-sparing treatment of morular metaplasia in women of childbearing age.Morular metaplasia has indeed a mutational origin but it is a benign and hormonally inert condition. The risk to develop cancer is closely associated with premalignant or malignant endometrioid glandular proliferations that are often associated with hysthological finding of morules rather than with morules themselves. Management of this condition requires trained pathologists and gynecologists and should be adapted to the age of the patient.
