Cytogenetic study of solid ovarian tumors. With the use of a short-term tissue culture method, 27 solid ovarian tumor specimens (from 22 patients) were successfully karyotyped. The majority of the specimens were from serous carcinoma (18 specimens, 2 of which were not invasive). Adenocarcinomas (two specimens), two endometrioid carcinomas, and one each of clear cell, mucinous, sarcoma, squamous carcinoma, and an unclassified sex cord carcinoma were also analyzed. The specimens showed marked cytogenetic heterogeneity, ranging from a normal karyotype (46,XX) to very grossly aneuploid, with multiple rearrangements. All chromosomes, excepting 13, 15, 19, 20, and 21 were positively identified in at least one rearrangement. Chromosomes 1, 6, and 7 were most commonly involved. Identified rearrangements were not limited to one carcinoma type. The most common deletions of 1p and 6q were identified in both serous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Deletion of 7q,(del(7)(q32)), was observed only in serous carcinoma but was limited to three patients. Correlations of modal chromosome count and number of marker chromosomes appeared to be associated with good prognosis for patients with serous carcinoma.
