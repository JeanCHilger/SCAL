TNFAIP8 as a predictor of metastasis and a novel prognostic biomarker in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Tumour necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8) has been recently documented in various malignancies, but its role in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains unknown.Tumour necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8 expression was determined by real-time reverse transcription PCR and western blot analysis. Tumour tissues, consisting of serous, mucinous, endometrioid and clear cell histotypes, from 202 EOC patients (International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians I-IV) who underwent primary cytoreduction were collected. Then, we examined the immunohistochemical expression of TNFAIP8 and evaluated its clinical significances.Tumour necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8 overexpression was significantly associated with high histologic grade (P=0.005), large residual tumour size (P=0.014), recurrence (P=0.024) and response to chemotherapy (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that TNFAIP8 overexpression was independently correlated with the presence of lymph node (odds ratio (OR): 4.129 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.491-11.435The present data provide evidence that TNFAIP8 predicts EOC metastasis and poor survival, highlighting its potential function as a therapeutic target for EOCs.
