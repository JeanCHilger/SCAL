Sigmoid endometriosis: a diagnostic dilemma on multidetector CT. Intestinal endometriosis represents a common condition that occurs particularly in women of reproductive age. The gastrointestinal tract is the third most common localization of endometriosis, after the ovaries and the peritoneum, and recto-sigmoid tract is involved in 70% of cases. Recto-sigmoid endometriosis has to be differentiated from other diseases of large bowel, especially in patients without a history of endometriosis. We report a case of sigmoid endometriosis which represented a diagnostic dilemma on multidetector computed tomography.
