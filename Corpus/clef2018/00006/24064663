Vitamin D binding protein plays an important role in the progression of endometriosis. Endometriosis, characterized by the growth of the endometrial gland and stroma outside the uterine cavity, is a gynecological disorder affecting 6‑10% of women of reproductive age. However, the pathogenesis of endometriosis and the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of this disease remain to be clarified. Therefore, in this study two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2‑DE) combined with mass spectrometry (MS) were applied to explore endometrial proteins with a role in the progression of endometriosis. Expression of global proteins in ectopic endometrial tissue (n=13 endometriosis group) was compared with that of the normal endometrial tissue (n=6
