Effect of GnRH-II on the ESC proliferation, apoptosis and VEGF secretion in patients with endometriosis in vitro. To study the effect of GnRH-II on the cell proliferation, apoptosis and secreting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) of ectopic, eutopic and normal endometrial stromal cells (ESC) from patients with or without endometriosis (EMs) in vitro.The ectopic, eutopic and normal ESC were isolated, cultured and identified, then added 0 M, 10(-10) M, 10(-8) M, 10(-6) M GnRH-II. The growth and proliferation of three ESC were measured by MTT assay the cell apoptosis were detected with the method of Hoechst staining and Flow Cytometry testGnRH-II inhibited the proliferation of ectopic, eutopic ESC from patients with endometriosis and normal ESC from control patients, in a dose- and time-dependent manner (P<0.05) GnRH-II increased the apoptotic rate of three ESC in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05)GnRH-II significantly inhibited the cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis and decreased the VEGF secreting of ectopic, eutopic and normal ESC in EMs in vitro, and these effects were the strongest on ectopic ESC, which suggested that GnRH-II may become a new effective treatment for endometriosis.
