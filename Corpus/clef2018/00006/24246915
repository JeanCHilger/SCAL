Expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 and caspase-3 in endometriosis and their correlation. To investigate the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling(SOCS)-3 and caspase-3 and their correlative significance in endometriosis.Immunohistochemical EnVision method was used to detect the SOCS-3 and caspase-3 protein expression in ectopic and eutopic endometrium (n = 32) of patients with endometriosis, as well as normal endometrium (n = 30) of women without endometriosis.SOCS-3 and caspase-3 proteins were expressed in all three groups and not affected by the menstrual cycles. The expression of SOCS-3 in ectopic endometrium (5.54 ± 2.12) was significantly lower than that in eutopic (7.39 ± 1.09, P = 0.001) and control group (7.48 ± 1.26, P < 0.01), but without difference between the eutopic and control group (P = 0.756). SOCS-3 expression in ectopic and eutopic endometrium was significantly lower in III/IV stages than that in I/II stages of endometriosis (P < 0.05). Significantly lower expression of caspase-3 protein was found in ectopic (3.20 ± 1.24) and eutopic endometrium (3.88 ± 1.93) as compared with the control group (6.49 ± 1.85, P < 0.01), however ectopic and eutopic endometrium showed no significant difference (t = 1.66, P = 0.10). There was no significant difference of the expression of caspase-3 in ectopic and eutopic endometrium at different disease stages (P > 0.05). Positive correlation was found between the expression of SOCS-3 and caspase-3 proteins in ectopic endometrium (r = 0.655, P < 0.01).SOCS-3 may be involved in the development of endometriosis through inhibition of apoptosis of ectopic endometrial cells.
