Immunohistochemical demonstration of HNK-1-defined antigen in gynecologic tumors with argyrophilia. Gynecologic tumors with argyrophilia were tested immunohistochemically for reactivity with monoclonal antibody HNK-1, which detects normal and neoplastic cells derived from the neuroectodermal and the amine-precursor-uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) systems. The tumors included six small cell carcinomas and four adenocarcinomas of the cervix 23 adenocarcinomas of the endometrium (13 with type I and 10 with type II argyrophil cells)
