MiR-195 inhibits proliferation and growth and induces apoptosis of endometrial stromal cells by targeting FKN. MiR-195, which exhibits a proliferation-inhibiting role in different tumors, has been reported to be down-regulated in the ectopic endometrium. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of miR-195 on the biological characteristic of the endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). MiR-195 has been presumed to target the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of Fractalkine (FKN), which also plays important roles in endometriosis. Fluorescence reporter assays showed that miR-195 effectively binds to the 3'-UTR of FKN. The normal ESCs showed a significant higher miR-195 expression than that of eutopic and ectopic ESCs associated with endometriosis, while the FKN expression showed opposite results. MiR-195 mimics inhibited proliferation and growth and induced apoptosis of eutopic ESCs, and these effects were abolished by FKN-siRNA. miR-195 could decrease the expression of survivin, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and up-regulate the expression of CD82, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) and TIMP2 of eutopic ESCs by targeting FKN. Our study has demonstrated for the first time that miR-195 plays important roles in regulating the functions of ESCs through targeting FKN. The information may be useful for developing a new therapeutic strategy for endometriosis.
