Classification of endometrial carcinoma: more than two types. Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecological malignancy in Europe and North America. Traditional classification of endometrial carcinoma is based either on clinical and endocrine features (eg, types I and II) or on histopathological characteristics (eg, endometrioid, serous, or clear-cell adenocarcinoma). Subtypes defined by the different classification systems correlate to some extent, but there is substantial heterogeneity in biological, pathological, and molecular features within tumour types from both classification systems. In this Review we provide an overview of traditional and newer genomic classifications of endometrial cancer. We discuss how a classification system that incorporates genomic and histopathological features to define biologically and clinically relevant subsets of the disease would be useful. Such integrated classification might facilitate development of treatments tailored to specific disease subgroups and could potentially enable delivery of precision medicine to patients with endometrial cancer.
