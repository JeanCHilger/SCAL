Immunolocalization of ERK1/2 and p-AKT in normal endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia, and early and advanced stage endometrioid endometrial adenocancer and their prognostic significance in malignant group. To analyze the expression patterns of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and phosphorylated (p)-AKT in the tissues of non-pathologic endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia, and early and advanced stage endometrioid endometrial adenocancer using indirect immunohistochemistry, and also to investigate the effect of ERK1/2 and p-AKT expression patterns on prognosis in endometrioid adenocancer.Immunolocalization of ERK1/2 and p-AKT was examined in six different types of endometrial tissues: proliferative endometrium (PE n=10, 11.2%), secretuar endometrium (SEIn the malignant group, 23 of 41 patients (56.1%) had high ERK1/2 and p-AKT expression, whereas only three of 48 patients in the benign group (6.3%) had high ERK1/2 and p-AKT expression (P<0.0001 and P<0.0001, respectively). p-AKT expression was significantly higher in women with positive lymph nodes (OR 9.0 95% CI: 1.2-100.0
