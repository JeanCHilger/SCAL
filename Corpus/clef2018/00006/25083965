PAX8 expression in uterine adenocarcinomas and mesonephric proliferations. PAX8 is a useful immunohistochemical marker for the diagnosis of gynecologic tract malignancies. Several studies have described PAX8 expression in a wide variety of epithelial neoplasms, including ovarian and endometrial carcinomas. The goal of this study was to evaluate PAX8 expression in various types of uterine adenocarcinomas and mesonephric proliferations. Ninety-four cases of uterine adenocarcinomas (52 endometrial endometrioid carcinomas, 21 endometrial serous carcinomas, and 21 human papillomavirus-related endocervical carcinomas), 11 cases of benign mesonephric proliferations (remnants/hyperplasia), and normal endometrial and endocervical glandular epithelium in 58 cases were studied. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with the rabbit polyclonal anti-PAX8 antibody. All adenocarcinoma groups demonstrated a high frequency of PAX8 expression but with relatively high variability in the extent of staining among different subtypes. Both serous carcinomas and endometrioid carcinomas were positive in most cases (95% and 96%, respectively), but serous carcinomas displayed a significantly higher level of expression (immunohistochemical composite scores based on combined extent and intensity of expression) compared with endometrioid carcinomas (mean immunohistochemical composite scores: 8.3 vs. 5.3, respectively P<0.006). Endocervical adenocarcinomas also had a high frequency of PAX8 expression (86% of cases), but the level of expression was significantly less than that of endometrial adenocarcinomas (mean immunohistochemical composite scores: 2.9 vs. 5.3-8.3, respectively
