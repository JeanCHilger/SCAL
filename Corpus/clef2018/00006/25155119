The laparoscopic management of endometriosis in patients with pelvic pain. Endometriosis, an underdiagnosed and undertreated condition, affects 1 in 10 women and is associated with pain and infertility. Preoperative evaluation should include testing and management of other causes of pelvic pain. Ultrasonography can aid in surgical planning. Hormonal suppression improves symptoms, but should not be used to diagnose endometriosis, and is not shown to be effective in preventing disease recurrence nor in improving fertility. The goal of surgical management should be optimal removal or treatment of disease and should include measures for adhesion prevention. Rates of recurrence of endometriosis depend on the surgical completeness of removing the disease.
