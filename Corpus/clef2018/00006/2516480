Multiple correlation analysis of hormone parameters in sterile female patients with hyperandrogenism (correction of endometriosis). The authors examined 100 infertile women of reproductive age with various degrees of hyperandrogenism. As a result of multiple correlation analysis it was found that the state of hirsutism and the ratio of body weight to height are the most sensitive indicators of the testosterone action in reproductive age (r = + 0.56, p less than 0.1, r = + 0.60, p less than 0.05). There was no correlation between LH, FSH, PRLI, E2 T and K values. The assembled results suggest the variable character of factors which influence clinical manifestations of the disease and explain the heterogeneity of symptoms.
