Recurrence factors in women underwent laparoscopic surgery for endometrioma. The aim of this paper was to assess the risk factors for endometrioma recurrence in women underwent laparoscopic surgery for endometrioma.This retrospective designed study included 113 cases that underwent laparoscopic surgery for endometrioma of these women, recurrent endometrioma was detected in 33 (29.20%) subjects and other showed no recurrence (70.80%). Age, gravidity, parity, diameter of the mass, bilaterality, previous pelvic surgery, operation type, presence of adhesions, Ca 125 levels and recurrence time was obtained from hospital records and special gynecology forms.Demographic and obstetric past history of the cases showed no statistically significant difference between the groups (P>0.05). Higher diameter of the mass, previous pelvic surgery, operation type, presence of adhesion and higher Ca 125 levels were risk factors for endometrioma recurrence (P<0.05). Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis demonstrated that diameter of the mass, previous pelvic surgery and Ca 125 levels may be discriminative risk factors for endometrioma recurrence.Endometriomas â‰¥ 4.5 cm, especially in cases with pelvic adhesions, previous pelvic surgery and higher Ca 125 levels should be excised totally.
