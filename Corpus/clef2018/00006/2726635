Ileal endometriosis. A difficult preoperative diagnosis. Despite an occasional temporal relationship between abdominal pain and menstruation, the clinical features of endometriosis are often nonspecific. Diagnostic tests are usually unrewarding, and diagnosis is most often made at surgery. Endometriosis is a progressive disease, and recurrence is common despite therapy. In the case described, a woman with symptoms mimicking acute appendicitis was found at exploratory laparotomy to have ileal endometriosis. Her symptoms coincided with menses.
