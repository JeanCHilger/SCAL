Uterine neoplasms: MR imaging. Magnetic resonance (MR) studies were performed on 20 healthy volunteers and 41 patients with proved cervical and uterine neoplasms. MR imaging demonstrated normal uterine landmarks in all patients. On T2-weighted images, the normal uterine wall could be differentiated into three distinct layers: a central high-intensity zone, a junctional low-intensity band, and a peripheral medium-intensity area. While most of the normal cervices had only two distinct zones (central high-intensity zone and peripheral low-intensity zone), a small percentage had three layers of signal intensity, similar to the uterine body. Primary cervical and uterine neoplasms could be identified on MR images. In 18 of 22 patients with proved carcinoma, a mass with a signal intensity higher than that of normal cervical lips was seen on T2-weighted images. Endometrial carcinoma was most often identified as expansion of the central high-intensity area discrete tumor nodules were visible in nine of 15 patients. Mixed m√ºllerian sarcoma appeared as a large pelvic mass with complete obliteration of normal uterine landmarks. MR imaging delineates primary cervical and endometrial carcinoma better than computed tomography does.
