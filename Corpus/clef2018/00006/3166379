Immunoscintigraphy of ovarian endometriosis. A preliminary study. CA-125 is a membrane antigen detected in the serum of some women with gynaecological disease including endometriosis. We attempted to use a radioiodinated anti-CA-125 monoclonal antibody, OC-125, to image ovarian endometriosis using immunoscintigraphy. Two women with significant endometriosis and normal serum CA-125 levels had positive immunoscintigraphy. In one woman, all areas of endometriosis were imaged in the other, endometriosis in one affected ovary was seen, but uptake in the other ovary was less than the extent of the disease.
