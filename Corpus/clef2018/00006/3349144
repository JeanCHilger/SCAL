Effect of danazol on the function of the estrogen and progesterone receptor systems of the human endometrium. Quantity of estrogen- and progesterone-specific binding sites was measured in endometrial tissues of 10 females treated with danazol during 3 month in a dose of 400 mg per day after surgical treatment for endometriosis. It was demonstrated that the amount of estrogen receptors in endometrium of the patients was the same as in endometrial tissue of healthy females but the quantity of nuclear progesterone receptors was markedly increased.
