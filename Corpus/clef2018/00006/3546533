Flow cytometric DNA analysis of gynecologic malignant tumors using paraffin-embedded tissue. We have studied flow cytometric DNA analysis of gynecologic malignant tumors using paraffin-embedded tissue for histopathology. A close correlation was observed between the DNA indices obtained from fresh unfixed tissue and from paraffin-embedded tissue (r = 0.993). The coefficient of variation (CV) for the diploid G0G1 peak of the paraffin-embedded tissue was one and half greater than that obtained from fresh tissue on the average. In the DNA analysis of 64 endometrial carcinomas, DNA aneuploidy was detected in 3% of nuclear grade 1, in 25% of nuclear grade 2 and in 63% of nuclear grade 3. That is, the more abnormal the nuclear findings, the higher the percentage of DNA aneuploidy. In the analysis of 48 ovarian tumors, DNA aneuploidy was detected in 79% of serous adenocarcinoma, in no of mucinous adenocarcinoma, in 17% of endometrioid carcinoma, in all of clear cell carcinoma and dysgerminoma, that is, its incidence was different among histological subtypes.
