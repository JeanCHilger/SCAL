Endometriosis in the uterosacral ligament giving orthopedic symptoms through compression of the sciatic nerve and surgically treated via an extraperitoneal approach keeping the pelvic organs intact. Sciatic pain in a young woman was not relieved by orthopedic treatment. The gynecologist found a large hard tumor-like mass in the uterosacral ligament extending to the pelvic wall. Cytologic examination of fine needle aspirate indicated an endometriotic lesion. The large tumor-like mass was extirpated by an extraperitoneal technique and the pain disappeared.
