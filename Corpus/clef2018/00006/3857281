Differential diagnosis between leiomyomata uteri and adenomyosis using CA 125 as a new tumor marker of ovarian carcinoma. To differentiate pre-operatively between leiomyomata uteri and adenomyosis, we measured serum levels of an antigen (CA 125) common to most nonmucinous epithelial ovarian carcinoma in patients with benign uterine tumor (11 of leiomyomata uteri, 7 of adenomyosis and 1 of adenomyosis with leiomyomata uteri). CA 125 in serum samples pre and postoperatively were measured using an RIA Kit. The normal range of CA 125 levels was below 35U/ml. The mean CA 125 level (+/- S.D.) was 18.3 +/- 6.1U/ml in patients with leiomyomata uteri and 93.3 +/- 49.4U/ml in those with adenomyosis. Student's t-test showed a significant correlation (0.001 less than p less than 0.01). The mean CA 125 level in patients with adenomyosis was statistically higher than that in disease-free women. Among 7 patients with surgically demonstrable adenomyosis, the CA 125 values were over 35U/ml (87.5%). In all 11 patients with surgically demonstrable leiomyomata uteri, the CA 125 level was below 35U/ml. The CA 125 level in patients with adenomyosis gradually decreased postoperatively and in all was below 35U/ml up to one month postoperatively. Using this approach, leiomyomata uteri and adenomyosis can be differentiated, pre-operatively.
