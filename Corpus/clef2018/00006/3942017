Endometrial carcinoma of prostate. Endometrial carcinoma of the prostate is a unique lesion which contrasts markedly to the more ubiquitous prostatic acinar carcinoma with regard to morphology, clinical manifestations, localization stage at diagnosis, and possibly prognosis. Although endometrial carcinoma of the prostate may occur more commonly than previously recognized, wider recognition and study are essential for further delineation of this lesion. Finally, the inherent limits of endoscopic or of enucleative surgery and the propensity of endometrial carcinoma to present at a low stage suggest in appropriately selected cases that radical prostatectomy or possible external radiotherapy may offer the best opportunity for cure.
