Serum hormone and steroid hormone receptor levels during luteal-phase and long-term treatment with danazol. This study was designed to clarify the effects of danazol on levels of serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, progesterone (P), and 17 beta-estradiol and endometrial steroid receptors (for estrogen [ER], progestin [PR], and androgen [AR] ) during luteal-phase and long-term treatment. These levels were compared with midluteal-phase levels for a histologically in-phase endometrium. Danazol given during the luteal phase to patients with in-phase endometrium decreased endometrial steroid receptor levels (total ER and total PR), and decreased serum P, LH, and FSH levels. Ten of the 17 patients treated (59%) still had in-phase endometrium. Danazol (400 mg/day) given for 1 month or more to patients with pelvic endometriosis increased serum LH and FSH levels within the normal range and endometrial total ER and PR levels. It appears that the effects of short-term and long-term treatment with danazol on serum hormone and endometrial steroid receptor levels differ.
