Endometriosis and spontaneous abortion. There seems to be an association of first-trimester spontaneous abortion and untreated endometriosis. In this report, 52% of an untreated group of patients with endometriosis aborted. However, 12% of a second group of surgically treated patients and 7% of a third group of patients treated with danazol aborted. Therefore, either medical or surgical therapy for endometriosis lowers the abortion rate significantly.
