The relationship of tubal blockage, infertility of unknown cause, suspected male infertility, and endometriosis to success of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. The success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer has been examined with regard to five categories of infertility over a 2-year period. Fertilization rates in vitro were highest in women with bilateral tubal blockage and women treated for endometriosis. There was a significant reduction of approximately 13% in the fertilization rate of couples with idiopathic infertility and women who had failed to conceive after 12 cycles of artificial insemination by donor. A further substantial reduction in the fertilization rate occurred when the husband had low quality semen, particularly when no abnormality was detected in the wife. Repeated IVF in couples with idiopathic infertility eventually resulted in fertilization. It is recommended that donor spermatozoa not be used for cases of idiopathic infertility, but it may be needed in cases of poor semen quality. There were no differences in the pregnancy rates following embryo replacement in any of the groups studied, nor was there any detectable effect of age on fertilization or pregnancy rates up to the age of 44 years.
