Endometritis--a diagnostic problem. Differentialdiagnostical considerations including histological and microbiological methods (author's transl). In 100 patients with the assumed diagnosis "endometritis" an examination program including histological and microbiological methods was conducted. In only 73% of these, the histological examination confirmed the assumed diagnosis, and only in 3% concerning the microbiological tests therefore other diagnoses such as peritoneal irritation at ovulation, adenomyosis uteri and spastic pelviopathias were dominant. The diagnosis of an endometritis therefore is often an exclusive one and should induce subtle examination methods before an unspecific antibiotic therapy is begun. This procedure is absolutely possible regarding out-patients.
