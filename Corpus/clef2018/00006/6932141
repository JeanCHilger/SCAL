The cytology of the pouch of Douglas in polycystic ovarian disease. Cul-de-sac aspiration was performed for cytologic sampling in 137 cases of polycystic ovaries treated by wedge resection. Fifty patients undergoing abdominal tubal ligations also underwent aspiration of the pouch of Douglas as a control group. The cytodifferential count in polycystic ovarian disease showed 30% to 40% mesothelial cells, 15% to 20% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 15% to 20% lymphocytes, 10% to 15% squamous cells and 1% to 5% histiocytes. The corresponding count in the control group showed 15% to 20% mesothelial cells, 20% to 25% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 15% to 20% lymphocytes, 10% to 15% squamous cells and 1% to 3% histiocytes. Cells exfoliated from the fimbrial end of the tube were encountered in most smears. Abnormal cells were diagnosed in seven cases of polycystic ovarian disease due to a coexistent neoplasm, i.e., two dermoid cysts, a carcinoid tumor, a hilus cell tumor, a simple serous cyst, a pseudomucinous cystadenoma and endometriosis of the ovary. All tumors were histologically diagnosed in the resected wedges of the ovaries.
