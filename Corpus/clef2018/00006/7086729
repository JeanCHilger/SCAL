Generalized adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder: ultrasonographic appearance in one case (author's transl). Ultrasonographic images were correlated with radiological and pathological findings in a case of generalized adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder. Emphasis is placed on the importance of the methods employed for filling the biliary tracts with opaque medium, to confirm a suspected diagnosis suggested by the heterogeneous irregular thickening, with a fringed internal limit, of the gallbladder wall.
