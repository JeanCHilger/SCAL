Ureteral endometriosis. The authors present two cases of ureteral endometriosis. Urinary tract endometriosis has been frequently described affecting mainly the bladder. In the ureter, it is a rare pathology, of difficult identification. Treatment aims at ureteral disobstruction together with eradication of endometrial foci. This is accomplished by surgical, radiotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic means.
