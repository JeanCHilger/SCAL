Endometriosis of the colon and rectum: an indication for peroperative coloscopy. Endometriosis in women is a frequent disease and not uncommon is the implant of ectopic endometrium in the colon and rectum. In the present study three cases are reported without intestinal symptoms related to endometriosis, in which the intraoperative findings of thickened and stricturing areas of the colon and rectum--generally attached to the posterior portion of the uterus and presenting the aspects of a cancer--caused serious differential diagnostic problems, and made the choice of treatment difficult. These problems were solved by peroperative coloscopy that, revealing an extrinsic compression of the colonic and rectal wall in the presence of an intact mucosa, indicated the conservative treatment of the lesions in all three cases.
