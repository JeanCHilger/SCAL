Magnetic resonance imaging of the uterus. MR imaging has emerged as the most accurate imaging modality for the evaluation of many conditions affecting the uterus. This technique can both define the normal internal anatomy of the uterus and monitor the physiologic responses of this organ to various endogenous and exogenous stimuli. MR imaging provides unique diagnostic information that may guide therapeutic management of developmental anomalies, adenomyosis, and endometrial carcinoma.
