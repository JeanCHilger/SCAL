An unusual case of endometriosis. Endometriosis can be found in 10 to 20% of all menstruating women. Most often the lesions are localized in the pelvis, but in rare cases they can be found in almost every region of the body. The diagnostic clue is the typical history of premenstrual pain. Imaging can demonstrate the site and size of extra-pelvic lesions and an image-guided diagnostic puncture for histological diagnosis can be done.
