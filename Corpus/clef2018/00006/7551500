The transport system in the in vitro fertilization program. The programme of in vitro fertilization helps at present successfully to resolve the problem of sterility in an ever increasing number of married couples. It is, however, a method which is very pretentious from the technical aspect, from the aspect of time and financial demands. Therefore in February 1994 with the Institute for the Care of Mother and Child in Prague-Podolí collaboration in the Transport IVF programme was started. In our clinic the first two stages of the IVF programme are implemented, i.e. stimulation of the ovaries and aspiration of the follicles. The patients of our centre for sterility are included in the programme, if the following indications are present: tubal factor 82%, idiopathic sterility 4%, the remainder being endometriosis, andrological factor and others. The majority of women were in the age group from 30-35 years. Stimulation is most frequently implemented by GnRh analogues and menopausal gonadotropins, aspiration of follicles by the transvaginal route with short analgosedation under so-called semi-ambulatory conditions. The aspirated follicular fluid is immediately stored in a special transport incubator G-812 of K-system Co., Denmark. Within 20 minutes it is taken by the patient's husband to the embryological laboratory of the Institute for the Care of Mother and Child in Prague-Podolí. Between February and December 1994 a total of 69 aspirations in 56 patients were made and 15 pregnancies were achieved. It is 23% pregnancies by transfer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
