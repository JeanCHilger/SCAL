Prognostic value of epidermal growth factor receptor expression in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. We report here a retrospective study of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in 140 patients with human endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (median period of follow-up, 43.8 months ranging from 1 to 155 months). Tumor specimens were immunohistochemically examined for the overexpression of EGFR, and the correlation among EGFR status, various clinicopathologic parameters, and prognosis was statistically evaluated. Monoclonal antibody (clone 31 G 7), which recognizes the extracellular domain of the EGFR molecule, was used for immunostaining. Ninety-four of 140 cases were immunohistochemically positive for EGFR (67.1%). The presence or absence of EGFR did not correlate with surgical stage, depth of myometrial invasion (DI), or lymph node involvement, but did correlate with histological grade and patient's age. Furthermore, patients with EGFR-positive endometrial carcinoma had a statistically significant shorter length of survival than those with EGFR-negative tumors (P = .018). This trend is more apparent among the patients more than 50 years old (P = .003). When adjusted for surgical stage, DI, and patient age, EGFR status retained prognostic value by multivariate analysis. However, when adjusted for surgical stage, histological grade, DI, and patient age, EGFR status failed to retain prognostic value by multivariate analysis. The results of this study suggest that EGFR expression is correlated with histological grade and greater invasiveness of human endometrioid endometrial carcinoma.
