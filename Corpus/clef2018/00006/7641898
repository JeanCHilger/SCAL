Endosalpingiosis found at laparoscopy for chronic pelvic pain. To assess a correlation between endosalpingiosis and pelvic pain.A retrospective analysis of every patient undergoing laparoscopy for chronic pelvic pain at Yale-New Haven Hospital by one surgeon from August 1992 through October 1993 was performed, focusing on those cases with endosalpingiosis.Of 51 laparoscopies performed for chronic pelvic pain, 37 demonstrated visual evidence of implants and pathology specimens were read as either endometriosis or endosalpingiosis in 23 cases. Of those 23 cases, 6 demonstrated endosalpingiosis, and 4 of those 6 demonstrated both endosalpingiosis and endometriosis. In all six cases endosalpingiosis was found in locations consistent with the patients' pelvic pain symptoms, and all six patients experienced relief from their pain symptoms after surgery.Endosalpingiosis may be found in association with chronic pelvic pain. The pelvic distribution of endosalpingiosis in patients with chronic pain is consistent with that generally found in endometriosis.
