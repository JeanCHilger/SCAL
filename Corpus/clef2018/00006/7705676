Steroid hormone receptor content and lymph node status in endometrial cancer. The purpose of this study was to correlate the steroid hormone receptor status in endometrial adenocarcinoma with tumor metastasis to the pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, and with other known prognostic variables which influence survival. Tumor samples from 85 patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, or adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation of the endometrium who underwent complete surgical staging, were assayed for cytoplasmic steroid hormone receptors using a dextran-coated charcoal technique. Steroid hormone receptor content was correlated to lymph node status, along with other prognostic variables, such as patient's age, depth of myometrial invasion, tumor grade, and pelvic cytology. By univariate analysis, the likelihood of nodal involvement was associated with younger age and poorly differentiated tumors. Multivariate analysis revealed that age, tumor grade, and myometrial involvement added significant independent prognostic information. Estrogen or progesterone receptor content did not add independent prognostic information concerning lymph node status once other factors were controlled. Knowledge of estrogen and progesterone receptor binding status in adenocarcinoma of the uterus does not replace the prognostic information imparted by careful sampling of lymph nodes.
