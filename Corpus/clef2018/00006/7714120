Dysregulation of interleukin-6 responses in ectopic endometrial stromal cells: correlation with decreased soluble receptor levels in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. Endometriosis (EM) is characterized by the aberrant growth of endometrial cells at sites outside the uterus. We showed previously that peritoneal leukocyte interleukin-6 (IL-6) production is altered in women with EM relative to that in normal control women. Because studies suggest that IL-6 may be growth regulatory for endometrial cells, we examined IL-6 and IL-6 soluble receptor (IL-6sR) in the peritoneal fluid of 40 women. In addition, the growth responsiveness of ectopic endometrial stromal cells to IL-6 was evaluated. The severity of EM correlated with increased levels of IL-6 accompanied by decreased IL-6sR in peritoneal fluid (controls, 1.0 +/- 0.1 and 525.4 +/- 53 stage I-II EM, 1.4 +/- 0.2 and 274.6 +/- 26
