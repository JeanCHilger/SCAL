Infertility evaluation in fertile women: a model for assessing the efficacy of infertility testing. A standard infertility evaluation consists of a semen analysis, hysterosalpingogram, post-coital test, endometrial biopsy and laparoscopy. Although these tests are well grounded in clinical experience, information on their ability to discriminate between fertile and infertile couples is limited. In this study, we performed standard infertility tests plus two others--sperm antibodies and cervical culture for Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum--on fertile and infertile couples. Women in the fertile group were selected from those who had delivered a child within the previous 2 years and who were scheduled for a laparoscopic tubal ligation. Women in the infertile group were selected from those presenting for an infertility evaluation (mean duration of infertility 4.2 years), and they were matched by age (+/- 3 years) and race with fertile subjects. Subjects were recruited from both private and clinic patients. A total of 64 couples (32 matched pairs) completed the evaluation. At least one 'abnormal' infertility test was found in 69% of fertile and 84% of infertile couples. With the exception of tubal damage and endometriosis, which as expected were more common in infertile couples, no significant differences between groups for remaining infertility factors could be demonstrated. Despite the small size of the current study, these results confirm the feasibility and importance of comparisons of the prevalence of infertility factors in fertile and infertile couples.
