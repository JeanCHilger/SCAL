Evaluation of epithelial ovarian neoplasm immunologic reactivity using monoclonal antibodies. The reactivity of five monoclonal antibodies against ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens (OC125, OV632, OV-TL3, 8C, 10B) on tissue sections of malignant and benign ovarian neoplasms was estimated and compared using PAP technique. The immunodiagnostic usefulness of OC125 and OV-TL3 antibodies in differentiation between serous and endometrioid ovarian carcinomas was indicated. OV632 monoclonal antibody appears to be a good marker for differentiation between malignant and benign changes in ovary. Difficulties in typing of monoclonal antibodies for immunodiagnostic purposes were pointed out.
