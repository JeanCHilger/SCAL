Ureteral endometriosis. Ureteral involvement due to endometriosis is uncommon. Its silent onset and the progression of ureteral obstruction, if undiagnosed, can lead to the loss of the renal unit. The present case is described to underscore the importance of early diagnosis.We report on a patient with obstructive uropathy secondary to intrinsic ureteric endometriosis that had undergone nephrectomy due to parenchymal destruction. One year following resection of the endovesical portion, recurrence in the ureteral stump was observed. The clinical features, the diagnostic and clinical aspects are briefly discussed.Although ureteric involvement is uncommon, renal function of patients with pelvic endometriosis must be followed closely by analyses, ultrasound and/or intravenous urography for early detection of this condition.
