Klimonorm and precanceroses of the endometrium. In the prospective study the authors administered for one year the preparation Klimonorm (Jenapharm) to 90 women divided into three groups. Of 90 patients at the onset 30 women suffered from precancerous endometriosis confirmed by histological and cytological examination. The remaining 60--half with and half without menstrual bleeding--all had climacteric complaints. The authors evaluated by statistical methods various parameters, in particular Kuppermann's index, the thickness of the endometrial mucosa in the uterine cavity by ultrasound, the oncological endometrial cytology by a cytobrush and subsequent lavage of the uterine cavity during 4 check-up examinations after three-month intervals. At the onset of the investigation and after one year the hormonal serum levels (FSH, LH, 17-beta oestradiol) were assessed and in the patients with precancerous conditions also the histology of the endometrium. The results are promising, in particular the significant drop of Kuppermann's index already after three months to one third of the baseline value in all three groups of patients complete reversal to the negative side as regards the cytological finding on the endometrium, correlating with the histological finding
