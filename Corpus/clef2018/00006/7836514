Investigations on the cell type responsible for the endometrial secretion of complement component 3 (C3). It has been shown that rat and human endometria have the capacity to produce complement component 3 (C3). In rats, endometrial C3 is an oestrogen-dependent protein produced and secreted by glandular cells. The cell responsible for the synthesis and secretion of human endometrial C3 has not been clearly defined. Our study was aimed at answering this question. Samples of endometrium obtained from hysterectomies were either immunostained for C3 or digested with collagenase then the stromal and glandular cells were separated and immunopurified (or not) with an antibody to CD45 coupled to magnetic beads to eliminate the endometrial lymphomyeloid cells. Cells were cultured for 2 weeks and C3 measured in the medium by an in-house radioimmunoassay. Glandular as well as stromal cells stained positively for C3 and released C3 in vitro. The release of C3 from both cell types could be inhibited by cycloheximide. Epithelial cells produced significantly more C3 than stromal cells, and endometrial C3 production was higher for both cell types when these were obtained from secretory as compared to proliferative endometria. Lymphomyeloid cells were possibly a source of C3 since after immunoadsorption of these cells, the remaining stromal or glandular cells produced significantly less C3. We conclude that endometrial stromal, glandular and lymphomyeloid cells all produce C3.
