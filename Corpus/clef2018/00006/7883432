Uterine atypical polypoid adenomyoma and ovarian endometrioid carcinoma: metastatic disease or dual primaries? Atypical polypoid adenomyoma (APA) is an uncommon uterine tumor that rarely metastasizes, although it closely resembles a well-differentiated endometrioid carcinoma. A 37-year-old woman with a history of pelvic endometriosis and oral contraceptive use developed an APA and later presented with bilateral ovarian endometrioid carcinomas. DNA ploidy analysis and human papilloma virus (HPV) typing of the APA and ovarian carcinomas were performed to characterize the primary or metastatic nature of the tumors. Both tumors were aneuploid. The APA had a DNA index of 1.53, compared with 1.19 for the ovarian carcinoma. The APA contained HPV 18, and the ovarian carcinoma a mixed infection of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18, with types 6 and 11 predominating. These differences in DNA index and HPV type supported the autonomous nature of the APA and the ovarian carcinomas. The report affirms the benign outcome of APA, highlights its complication by a second malignancy, and suggests an etiological role for endometriosis, steroid hormones, and possibly the HPV in the formation of one or both tumors.
