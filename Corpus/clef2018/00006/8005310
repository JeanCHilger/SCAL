Effect of danazol in vitro and in vivo on monocyte-mediated enhancement of endometrial cell proliferation in women with endometriosis. To investigate danazol's effect in vitro and in vivo on the ability of peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) from women with endometriosis to stimulate endometrial cell proliferation.Uterine endometrial cells from untreated or danazol-treated patients with endometriosis were cultured with or without autologous or heterologous PBM in the presence of different concentrations of danazol for 72 hours before assessment of endometrial cell proliferation by thymidine incorporation.Not for profit clinical research institute and academic cell culture laboratory.Women of reproductive age undergoing laparoscopy for endometriosis, 19 untreated patients and 17 danazol-treated patients.Peripheral blood monocytes and endometrial biopsies obtained at laparoscopy. Danazol (800 mg/d) administered for 2 to 6 months (treated group) or added to cell cultures in concentrations of 10(-6), 10(-7), or 10(-9) M.Endometrial cell proliferation was enhanced by autologous or heterologous PBM from untreated patients with endometriosis but was unaffected or suppressed by PBM from danazol-treated patients. Danazol in vitro reduced PBM-enhanced endometrial cell proliferation. Endometrial cell proliferation from danazol-treated patients was not enhanced by PBM from untreated patients with endometriosis.Danazol treatment in vitro or in vivo suppresses PBM-mediated enhancement of endometrial cell proliferation. The effects are against both PBM and endometrial cells, suggesting that danazol affects monocyte-derived growth-stimulating factors and endometrial cell response to growth-stimulating factors.
