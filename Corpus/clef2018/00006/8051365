Catamenial sciatic pain due to endometriosis of the sciatic nerve. Review of the literature, apropos of a case. Sciatic nerve endometriosis is rare but must be included in the sciatic pain aetiology diagnosis. Typically the patient's sciatic pain is cyclic. Electromyography and computed tomographic scanning or nuclear resonance imagery contribute to the diagnosis. Different mechanisms of this localization have been proposed. The patient often requires conservative surgery with excision of endometriosis from the nerve. Medical treatment (LH-RH analogues) may be associated in young patients who need to preserve reproductive function. Total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be mandatory in stage III or IV endometriosis and older patients.
