Value of CA125 (carbon hydrate tumor-associated antigen) and endometrial antibodies for the detections of endometriosis. Levels of CA125 and endometrial antibodies (EMAb) in serum and peritoneal fluid were determined in 42 cases, including 28 cases of endometriosis as trial group and 14 infertile patients without endometriosis as controls. Results showed that the levels of CA125 and EMAb in peritoneal fluid were higher significantly than in serum, but no difference were found between two groups. Serum EMAb levels were significantly higher in the trial group than in the controls. There was no significant difference in the levels of serum CA125 between two groups. The positive rate of serum CA125 and EMAb were 71.43% and 82.14% respectively. The sensitivity of CA125 and EMAb measurements in the diagnosis of endometriosis were 71.43% and 82.14%, and the specificity were 57.21% and 57.14% respectively.
