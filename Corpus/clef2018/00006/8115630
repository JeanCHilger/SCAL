Adenomyosis: prospective comparison of MR imaging and transvaginal sonography. To prospectively compare conventional spin-echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transvaginal sonography for the diagnosis of adenomyosis.Twenty women with clinically suspected adenomyosis underwent MR imaging and transvaginal sonography performed within 3 months of each other. Pathologic proof was obtained in all cases.Seventeen patients were proved to have adenomyosis. The correct diagnosis was achieved with MR imaging in 15 of 17 cases. One false-positive and two false-negative diagnoses were made with MR imaging. With transvaginal sonography, nine of 17 cases of adenomyosis were correctly diagnosed. One false-positive and eight false-negative diagnoses occurred. The most frequent cause of false-negative diagnoses with transvaginal sonography was the misinterpretation of adenomyosis as leiomyomas (seven cases).MR imaging is significantly better (P < .02) than transvaginal sonography in the diagnosis of adenomyosis.
