Markers for endometriosis. Screening for endometriosis is subject to general rules. The two most important conditions, i.e. the disorder should be well-defined and serious, and there must be an effective way to treat or prevent it through screening, are not satisfied for endometriosis. Given the lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease and the disreputable evidence of treatment effectiveness, other criteria for worthwhile screening programmes, such as prevalence, cost effectiveness and screening test performance, cannot be evaluated. Markers may be applied in the diagnostic process in the individual patient, although it should be realized that the best results will be obtained in patients with advanced disease, in whom routine pelvic examination will establish the diagnosis on purely clinical grounds anyway. The development of appropriate tissue markers may in the future shed more light on the intricate mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
