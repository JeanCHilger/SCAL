Endometriosis of the bladder. We report a case of endometriosis of the bladder in a 32-year-old healthy woman suffering from longstanding suprapubic pain, and urinary urgency and frequency. The disease, which is uncommon, usually has a high morbidity rate and is difficult to diagnose. A high level of suspicion is necessary for diagnosis, since neither the clinical presentation, nor imaging procedures are pathognomonic for endometriosis.
