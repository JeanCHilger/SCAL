Tissue and endocrine responses to gestrinone and danazol in the treatment of endometriosis. An open comparative study of gestrinone and danazol in the treatment of endometriosis demonstrated a similar decrease in the extent of active endometriotic deposits, assessed visually following therapy. Biochemical endocrinological changes during therapy with gestrinone showed that basal concentrations of gonadotrophin remained unchanged, oestradiol concentrations varied and the free fraction of testosterone increased. A similar range of side effects was reported in both treatment groups, consisting predominantly of 'androgenic' effects in 10 of 15 women treated with gestrinone and 5 of 12 treated with danazol. The results suggest that gestrinone is an effective alternative agent for the treatment of endometriosis.
