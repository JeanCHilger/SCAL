New data on the pathogenesis of endometriosis interna. Eighty-six patients with histologically verified internal endometriosis were examined using histochemical, morphometric methods, and measurements of blood and myometrial tissue phosphatidyl inosites. Blood levels of phosphatidyl inosites were found reliably decreased in the patients vs. normal subjects, whereas their levels in myometrial tissue were significantly increased. Increased counts of tissue basophils, microcirculation disorders, lymphostasis and membranogenic stromal edema development were observed round endometriosis foci. Changes in the basic substance and fibrous structures of myometrial connective tissue complex were revealed, most marked in the areas adjacent to the endometrium. A possible mechanism of the development of pathologic shifts in internal endometriosis is discussed.
