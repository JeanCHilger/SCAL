Immunohistochemical markers of uterine receptivity in the human endometrium. The factors responsible for the initial interaction between maternal and fetal epithelium leading to the establishment of pregnancy remain poorly understood. Temporal and spatial expression of specific endometrial peptides in response to ovarian steroids is thought to contribute to the development of a period of uterine receptivity, whereby the endometrium becomes hospitable to the implanting blastocyst. The failure to establish receptivity may account for a significant percentage of the cases of infertility in the female, especially affecting women with luteal phase deficiency, leiomyomata uteri, endometriosis, habitual abortion, and unexplained infertility. In addition, despite increasing global experience with advanced reproductive technologies, the majority of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) attempts remain unsuccessful, most likely on the basis of implantation failure. In this article, we review the concepts involved in the study of uterine receptivity in the human, highlight potential immunohistochemical (IHC) markers that have recently been discovered, and discuss how IHC assessment of the endometrium is a potentially valuable method for the evaluation of the receptive endometrial state. Using this approach we have examined several new potential markers of uterine receptivity. Endometrial progesterone receptors and one of the integrin cell adhesion molecules appear to undergo changes in expression around the time of implantation, and may be sensitive indicators of the receptive state. Further, these markers are delayed in women with infertility and luteal phase deficiency. These studies illustrate the utility of IHC diagnosis for the evaluation of endometrial function.
