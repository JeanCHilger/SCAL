Asymptomatic peritoneal endometriosis following cesarean section. Endometriotic peritoneal implants of small dimensions were discovered in five patients undergoing laparoscopic examination for diseases unrelated to endometriosis. All patients were asymptomatic for endometriosis and each had undergone at least one previous cesarean section. Biopsies taken were studied by light microscopy which evidenced variably predominating epithelial or stromal components of lesions Perls' method was used to evidence tissue ferric iron resulting from long-standing micro-haemorrhagic foci. From this study, isolated, asymptomatic peritoneal implants of endometrium are suspected to occur frequently after cesarean section although the progression of this condition to a symptomatic state is considered infrequent and independent of specific histologic aspects of lesions.
