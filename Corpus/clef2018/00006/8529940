Postcoital test evaluated in peritoneal fluid. The role of the peritoneal fluid in the physiology of reproduction, as well as in the transportation and survival of gametes, is little recognized. Taking this into consideration, the authors have examined the occurrence of spermatozoa in the peritoneal fluid, collected from patients during diagnostic laparoscopies, following intrauterine insemination with husband's sperm, in, so-called, Templeton's Test. In the group of patients with cervical factor six (6) mobile spermatozoa (85%) were observed, in the group with male factor -- three (3) (42%) and in the group with idiopathic infertility -- 1 (25%). A high utility of this test has been indicated, especially in infertility caused by the male factor and in endometriosis.
