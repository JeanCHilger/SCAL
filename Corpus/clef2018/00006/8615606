Sensitivity to taxoid derivatives of a newly established human endometrioid ovarian adenocarcinoma radioresistant cell line. An endometrioid ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line CAVEOC-2 was characterized. Maintained in monolayered culture, CAVEOC-2 cells exhibited a 33-hr doubling time. When xenografted into nude mice, these cells produced fast growing tumors. Colony-forming efficiency in agar was 50%. DNA index was 1.5 and cytogenetic analysis showed a triploid karyotype. CAVEOC-2 cells did not express mdr-1 gene and were chemosensitive to doxorubicin (IC50 = 1.82 +/- 0.76 mumol/l), paclitaxel (IC50 = 3.33 +/- 0.26 nmol/l) and docetaxel (IC50 = 0.68 +/- 0.28 nmol/l), while they showed an intermediate sensitivity to cisplatin (IC50 = 9.40 +/- 1.02 mumol/l). CAVEOC-2 cells seemed highly radioresistant (SF2 = 0.81, alpha = 0.02 Gy-1, beta = 0.025 Gy2, and MID = 4.31 Gy). Activities of glutathione S transferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were respectively 23.5- and 3.4- fold higher than those of sensitive A2780 cell line. These characteristics make the CAVEOC-2 cells a suitable model for the study of human endometrioid ovarian adenocarcinoma.
