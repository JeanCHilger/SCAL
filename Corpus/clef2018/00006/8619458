Extrapelvic endometriosis: diagnosis and treatment. Young women with nondescript abdominal pain can be difficult to diagnose. Although extrapelvic endometriosis is infrequent, we have treated 7 patients over the past 3 years with endometriosis in the abdominal wall, inguinal canal, or surgical incisions as the etiology of their symptoms.We reviewed the medical records of patients whose final pathology report confirmed a diagnosis of extrapelvic endometriosis. Seven women who were treated at the University of Rochester Strong Memorial Hospital from May 1, 1991 through April 30, 1994 were identified.All patients were premenopausal with no history of pelvic endometriosis. In 4 patients, symptoms were cyclical. Surgical excision was initially curative in 5 patients. Two women required reexcision. The diagnosis of endometriosis was established at exploration by gross appearance and by frozen section.Endometriosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of a symptomatic mass in a celiotomy scar, the abdominal wall, or the inguinal canal. Principles of management include obtaining an accurate diagnosis and performing an adequate excision to prevent recurrence.
