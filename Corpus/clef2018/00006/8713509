Intestinal endometriosis. Pelvic endometriosis affects 5 to 10% of all menstruating women, and of these 3% to 34% have intestinal involvement. Commonly, intestinal endometrial lesion affects only the serosa. Although the invading endometrial tissue may extend into the intestinal wall, it does not usually reach the mucosa. The majority of the patients are asymptomatic. The most common symptom is lower recurrent abdominal pain. It has been estimated that 0,9% of women with intestinal endometriosis have obstructive symptoms. Occasionally deeper and more extensive intestinal wall involvement results in cyclic menstrual rectal bleeding. The authors describe a case with obstructive symptoms associated to rectal bleeding. This is an uncommon finding. Histological confirmation of deep muscular and mucosal involvement was obtained. This case led us to some considerations about the diagnostic difficulties and therapeutic possibilities in the present.
