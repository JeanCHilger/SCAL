An immunohistochemical study of intestinal mucinous antigens and CEA in ovarian epithelial tumors. Using monoclonal antibodies specific to the large intestinal mucinous antigen (LIMA), small intestinal mucinous antigen (SIMA) and CEA, the expression and localization of these proteins in 78 formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues from ovarian epithelial tumors were studied. The localization of LIMA, SIMA and CEA was associated with tumor features and differenciation. Positive stain of benign and borderline tumors were mostly located on the lumina border while malignancies were situated both on the lumina border and in the cytoplasm and tended to concentrate in the latter with the increase in histological grade. No difference in positive rate was seen between serous and mucinous carcinomas. However, staining intensity of CEA in serous carcinomas was lower than that in mucinous carcinomas and the expression and intensity in endometrioid carcinomas were low. On the other hand, positive CEA and LIMA was associated with a significantly worse survival.
