Ovarian endometrioid tumors with yolk sac tumor component, an unusual form of ovarian neoplasm. Analysis of six cases. The clinical, morphological, and immunohistochemical findings in six cases of ovarian endometrioid tumors (five endometrioid carcinomas and one carcinosarcoma) with a yolk sac tumor (YST) component are described. The age of the patients ranged from 31 to 73 years (average, 53), and only two patients were premenopausal. Two cases were stage Ia tumors, three stage III, and one stage IV. A substantial postoperative elevation of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was seen in two patients and a mild increase in another two. All six patients had surgery and postoperative cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens, four of whom died of tumor 3 to 14 months after surgery without response to treatment. Only a stage Ia patient is alive and well 1 year after surgery. The tumors were large (average, 17 cm). Benign endometrioid lesions were found in the homolateral ovary in two cases and in the contralateral ovary in another two. All cases had endometrioid ovarian carcinomas (EOC) of various types admixed with typical YST components. Immunohistochemically, EOC areas differed from YST in their positivity for OC 125, CA 19.9, and nuclear estrogen and progesterone receptors and in their negativity for AFP, which was conspicuously positive in the YST areas. The clinicopathological profile of ovarian endometrioid tumors with YST also differs from that of YST in that it occurs in the same age range as EOC, it shows coexistence of benign endometrioid lesions, and it has a poor response to chemotherapy. The histological pattern in transitional areas may be difficult to differentiate from "endometrioid-like" (enteroblastic) YST and clear cell tumors. Ovarian endometrioid tumors with YST component should be considered a variant of endometrial carcinoma. Its recognition is necessary in view of its unusually aggressive behavior and poor prognosis.
