Effect of danazol on the immunocompetent cells in the eutopic endometrium in patients with endometriosis: a multicenter cooperative study. To assess the effects of danazol on immunocompetent cells, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression, and adhesion molecules in the eutopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis.Antigens were localized immunohistochemically in the endometria, before treatment and during treatment (2 months later).Ten patients with laparoscopically proven endometriosis who consented to participate in this study were treated with 400 mg/d of danazol for 4 months. Forty-two infertile patients without endometriosis or adenomyosis served as controls.Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly increased expression of the T cell subsets, macrophages, adhesion molecules, and HLA antigens in eutopic endometrium in patients with endometriosis compared with the infertile group. Treatment with danazol reduced the number of cells in T cell subsets, adhesion molecules, or HLA antigen expression, especially of gamma delta T cells, to 39.5% of the pretreatment value in patients with endometriosis.Danazol had an immunomodulatory effect on the autoimmune response in endometrium associated with endometriosis.
