Bcl-2 expression is correlated with a low apoptotic index and associated with progesterone receptor immunoreactivity in endometrial carcinomas. A total of 103 endometrial carcinomas (endometrioid type), as well as 15 samples of normal (atrophic or proliferative phase) and 26 of hyperplastic endometrium, were immunohistochemically investigated for expression of Bcl-2, and oestrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), and the results compared with findings for apoptosis and cell proliferation. Carcinoma cases were subdivided into tubular and solid components on the basis of tumour growth patterns. Immunopositivity for Bcl-2, ER, and PR in tubular components was significantly higher than in the solid category, being negatively associated with histological grading. Immunoreactivity scores revealed that Bcl-2 in the tubular group was positively correlated with PR but not ER, while its expression in normal and hyperplastic endometrium was closely linked with both. Apoptotic and mitotic indices (AI and MI) were both significantly lower in tubular than in solid areas. In the tubular areas, AI, values were significantly lower in the subgroup with a high level of Bcl-2 expression than in either low-level or negative groups. These results indicate that Bcl-2 expression may play a central role in the inhibition of apoptosis in endometrial carcinoma, in particular those cases with tubular components, possibly being associated with PR rather than ER. Changes in the propensity for apoptosis may be related to alterations of tumour growth pattern and of features of differentiation.
