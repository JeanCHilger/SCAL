Complications in 5,000 pelviscopies at the Kiel University Gynecologic Clinic. From 1987 to 1991 a total of 5035 pelviscopies were done at the Kiel University Hospital of Gynaecology. More than 90% of these were surgical pelviscopies, whereas less than 10% were diagnostic procedures only. Serious complications requiring laparotomy or repeat pelviscopy or laparotomy within 4 weeks after the original procedure, occurred in 2.0% of the cases and slight complications were seen in 2.9%. Procedures for acute abdomen or adhesiolysis after multiple laparotomies bore the greatest risk of serious complications. Low risk was associated with sterilisations, procedures for female sterility, endometriosis or tubal pregnancy.
