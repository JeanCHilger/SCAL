Microsatellite instability is uncommon in uterine serous carcinoma. Thirty-four uterine serous carcinomas, a type of endometrial carcinoma with aggressive behavior and a high frequency (90%) of p53 gene mutations, were analyzed for microsatellite instability (MI). Genomic DNA isolated from paired normal and tumor tissue was analyzed at eight microsatellite loci (D2S119, D2S123, D2S147, D10S197, D13S175, D18S58, D18S69, and ATn) located on four different chromosomes. All 34 tumors failed to meet the criteria for MI, defined as an alteration in the size of at least two of the microsatellite loci in tumor DNA when compared with normal DNA. Only three tumors demonstrated a shift in the size of a single microsatellite locus. Previously we reported MI in 20% of uterine endometrioid carcinomas, the most common type of endometrial carcinoma. The observed difference in the MI frequency between endometrioid and serous carcinoma is statistically significant (P = 0.003). Our data demonstrate that MI is uncommon in uterine serous carcinoma and support that different pathogenetic mechanisms are involved in the development of the two most common types of endometrial carcinoma.
