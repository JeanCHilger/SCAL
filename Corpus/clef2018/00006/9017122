Effect of peritoneal fluid on sperm motility parameters in women with endometriosis. To clarify the effect of peritoneal fluids (PF) of women with various stages of endometriosis on sperm motility, we utilized computer-aides sperm analysis (CASA) to analyze sperm movement characteristics. PF was collected in the early follicular phase (days 4-8) of the menstrual cycle from 48 women undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy. Only sperm samples having normal sperm parameters were chosen for study. Swim-up separation was performed for 1 h at 37 degrees C. Sperm suspension was mixed at a ratio of 1:1 with each of the following four groups: group 1, human tubal fluid (HTF) with 10% fetal bovine serum (control), group 2, normal PF (n = 16) group 3, minimal or mild endometriosis PF (n = 16)
