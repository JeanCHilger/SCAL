The combination of p53 and age predict cancer specific death in advanced stage (FIGO Ic-IV) of endometrial carcinoma of endometrioid type. An immunohistochemical examination of growth fraction: Ki-67, MIB-1 and PC10 suppressor oncogene protein: p53 Early surgical stage (FIGO Ia + b) is an excellent predictor of survival in endometrial carcinoma of endometrioid type (EC), in contrast to advanced stage which only predict cancer specific death (CSD) in approximately 20-30% of the patients. The value of growth fraction, p53 and p185 as predictor of CSD in EC was studied.One hundred and eleven patients (45% hormone-users) with EC were entered prospectively and consecutively into an immunohistochemical study of growth fraction (Ki-67, MIB-1 and PC10), suppressor oncogene protein (p53) and oncogene protein (p185).All markers except p185 intercorrelated significantly, although weakly, however, marked differences were found in median values of the markers of growth fraction (GF). It was shown that immunohistochemical demonstration of p53 and p185 proteins and stage correlates independently with CSD in EC.The study indicates that the markers of GF do not give exact information about the proliferative compartment of the EC, and it is shown that p53 correlate to CSD, while stage indicate crude death.
