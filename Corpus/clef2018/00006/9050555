The effectiveness of cryoendoscopic treatment for tubal infertility. Seventy-three women experienced bilateral proximal tubal occlusion caused by adhesions or polyps arising from the uterotubal junction in at least one tube. There were no other identifiable causes of infertility. All patients were treated with cryosurgery, which restored tubal patency in 61 (83.6%). Of 45 women with restored patency, who were followed 6 to 12 months, 20 (27.4% of 73) conceived and 16 (21.9%) delivered viable babies.
