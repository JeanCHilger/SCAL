Adenomyosis in the broad ligament and tamoxifen: report of a case. Adenomyosis confined to the broad ligament is extremely rare. Herein we present a case of adenomyosis in the broad ligament with unusual gross features. This 41-year-old woman had been on tamoxifen therapy for 3 years due to breast cancer. Ten months after discontinuing tamoxifen, she underwent exploratory laparotomy for a right adnexal mass suspected as ovarian malignancy. At laparotomy, the mass was located in the right broad ligament with a fibrous stalk connecting to the uterus. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Histopathologic examination revealed adenomyosis with cyst formation and an unusual thick capsule. The possible effects of tamoxifen upon the uterus are discussed in this article, in view of reports of tamoxifen associated with endometrial carcinoma and endometriosis.
