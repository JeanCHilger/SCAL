Selected immunologic markers for evaluation of peripheral blood in patients with internal endometriosis. In group of 16 patients with internal endometriosis verified by histopathological investigations following immunological indices in peripheral blood were estimated: 1) number of leucocytes and neutrophils, 2) neutrophil adherence to fibres, 3) phagocytic activity of neutrophil using the latex granules, 4) concentration of immunological complexes in serum. The results were compared with those in control group (20 healthy women). In patients with internal endometriosis compared to control group the increase of the number of leucocytes and neutrophils and decrease of phagocytic activity of neutrophils were observed.
