Distribution of heat shock proteins in eutopic and ectopic endometrium in endometriosis and adenomyosis. To evaluate the pathophysiologic role of heat shock proteins and to examine the effect of danazol on these proteins in patients with endometriosis and adenomyosis.Immunohistochemical identification of human heat shock proteins 27, 60, and 70 in endometrial glandular cells identified using monoclonal antibodies.Department of obstetrics and gynecology in a university hospital.Subjects were 119 women with documented endometriosis or adenomyosis. The subjects were divided into three groups: fertile control (n = 38), with 14 in the proliferative phase and 24 in the secretory phase endometriosis (n = 38)Staining of glandular cells by semiquantitative immunostaining (evaluation nomogram) score.Significantly increased expression of heat shock protein 27 was noted in eutopic endometrium from patients with endometriosis and adenomyosis as compared with controls, regardless of the menstrual phase. The scores for heat shock protein 27 and heat shock protein 70 in the ectopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis were low compared with those in eutopic endometrium, whereas in adenomyosis, the scores were similar to those of eutopic endometrium. After treatment with danazol, the expression of heat shock proteins returned to control levels.We suggest that abnormally increased expression of heat shock proteins plays a role in the pathophysiology of endometriosis and adenomyosis.
