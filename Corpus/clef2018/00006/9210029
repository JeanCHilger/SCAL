Colonic adenocarcinoma in a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). A spontaneous colonic adenocarcinoma and endometriosis was diagnosed in a 34-year-old female rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). The tumor caused partial obstruction of the ascending colon and histologically resembled the commonly described napkin-ring tumors of the descending and sigmoid colon found in humans. Serum levels of CA 125, a high-molecular-weight glycoprotein antigen that has been reported elevated in a variety of pathological conditions of the pelvic cavity in humans, was severely elevated. Both the adenocarcinoma and the endometriosis may have contributed to this finding.
