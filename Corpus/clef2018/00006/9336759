The procedure is safe, with a major complication rate of 0.5% and the most common minor complication, spotting.A 27-year-old woman underwent amniocenteses to document pulmonary maturity prior to cesarean section. She presented 18 months later with a 6-month history of left abdominal wall pain and a mass that enlarged 2 days prior to menses and shrank 1 week after. The mass was located at the prior amniocentesis site. Excisional biopsy revealed endometriosis on final pathology.To our knowledge, this is the first well-documented case of abdominal wall endometriosis following third-trimester amniocentesis.
