Clinical remission of colonic endometriosis with danazol: case report and bibliographic considerations. A case of a 42 years-old woman suffering from lower abdominal pain, constipation and rectal bleeding during menses is reported. A barium enema showed an extrinsic filling defect on the rectosigmoid junction. Laparoscopy confirmed the clinical suspicion of endometrosis. She received danazol for a 6-month period during which she developed adverse effects that disappeared when the drug was discontinued. The patient remained asymptomatic after two years of follow up. Data from literature concerning diagnostic and treatment techniques are discussed.
