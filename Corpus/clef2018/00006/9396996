Diagnostic laparoscopy for chronic right iliac fossa pain: a pilot study. The aim of this study was to determine the value of diagnostic laparoscopy in patients with chronic right iliac fossa pain.A retrospective study at Echuca Hospital involving case-note review and telephone questionnaire of patients who had undergone diagnostic laparoscopy for chronic right iliac fossa pain at least 12 months earlier (September 1992 to August 1995) was carried out.Forty-one cases were identified and followed up 12-40 months postoperatively (median 21 months). Eleven cases had positive findings at laparoscopy, of whom eight obtained lasting relief after treatment. Of the remaining 30 patients 17 had a normal-looking appendix removed and 12 were cured these were younger patients with episodic symptoms and localized signs. Of eight patients who had adhesions divided, four with adhesions beneath old scars obtained relief. Altogether 32 of the 41 patients considered the laparoscopy worthwhile even though in some cases it did not relieve their chronic pain.Diagnostic laparoscopy is worthwhile for patients with chronic right iliac fossa pain. Concurrent appendicectomy should be considered in young patients with episodic, well-localized symptoms associated with systemic malaise while adhesiolysis may be beneficial for viscero-parietal adhesions beneath abdominal wall scars.
