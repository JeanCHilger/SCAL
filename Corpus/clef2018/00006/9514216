Effect of estrogen suppression on the mineralization density of iliac crest biopsies in young women as assessed by backscattered electron imaging. The effects of estrogen suppression on bone mineralization in young women were studied by quantitative backscattered electron (BSE) imaging of transiliac biopsies taken before and after treatment for endometriosis. Treatment (6 months) was with analogs of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) given either alone (six paired biopsies), which resulted in a marked reduction in the levels of circulating estrogen, or in conjunction with tibolone, a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, progestrogenic, and androgenic properties (four paired biopsies). Estrogen withdrawal increased (p < 0.01) and concomitant tibolone treatment decreased (p < 0.05) the overall mean bone density. Estrogen withdrawal increased the fraction of bone with a high mineralization density [pretreatment: 0.236+/-0.007 GnRH: 0.279+/-0.009, mean +/- standard error of the mean (SEM)
