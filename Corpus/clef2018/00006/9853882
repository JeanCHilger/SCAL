Serum concentrations of soluble human leukocyte class I antigens and of the soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in endometriosis: relationship with stage and non-pigmented peritoneal lesions. Serum concentrations of soluble human leukocyte class I antigens (sHLA-I) and of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) are increased in the early inflammatory stages of several immune-related diseases. These soluble molecules also exert immunomodulatory activity, including regulation of natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. The aim of this study was to verify whether sHLA-I and sICAM-1 serum concentrations are related to the various stages of pelvic endometriosis, which is an immune-related disorder associated with impaired in-vitro NK cell activity. Serum sHLA-I and sICAM-1 concentrations were similar in patients and in healthy donors. However, when evaluated according to disease stage, sHLA-I and sICAM-1 concentrations were higher in patients with endometriosis stage I-II (revised American Fertility Society classification), or with non-pigmented peritoneal lesions. In conclusion, studies on sHLA-I and sICAM-1 may help to clarify the pathogenic mechanisms of endometriosis, and their serum concentrations may serve as additional markers for the early detection of recurrence of the disease during the monitoring of treatment outcome.
