HER-2/neu oncogene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization in epithelial tumors of the ovary. HER-2/neu gene amplification and protein overexpression have been associated with prognosis in breast, lung and prostate cancers but have not been extensively studied in ovarian carcinoma. For the study, we selected 5-micron-thick, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 74 cases of ovarian epithelial tumors of low malignant potential and ovarian carcinoma. Tumors were graded and staged and evaluated for amplification of the HER-2/neu gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization. HER-2/neu amplifications was present in 3 of 13 serous, mucinous, and endometrioid epithelial tumors of low malignant potential and in 40 of 61 epithelial carcinomas. In the carcinoma group, amplification did not correlate with stage, grade, or tumor type. Mean follow-up was 31 months 1 patient with a low malignant potential tumor and 32 patients with carcinomas died of disease. On univariate and multivariate analysis, survival correlated with stage of disease but not with HER-2/neu amplification. HER-2/neu amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization can be performed on tissue sections of ovarian neoplasms
