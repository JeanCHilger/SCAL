Increase in the production of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and interleukin-12 by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from women with endometriosis. To verify whether the peritoneal macrophage (PM) is activated in endometriosis.We examined the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), total antioxidant, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and IL-12 by cultured PMs, which were either unstimulated or stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), from women with endometriosis (early, n = 12 advanced, n = 11) or without endometriosis (n = 13).After stimulation with 2 ng/mL LPS for 24 hr, PMs from women with early-stage endometriosis secreted more NO, IL-6, and IL-10 than the controls. Higher IL-12 levels were noted in women with advanced endometriosis when compared with the controls. After 2 ng/mL-LPS stimulation for 24 hr, we also detected higher total antioxidant levels in the advanced-endometriosis group than those in the early-endometriosis group.The increased production of IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12 by stimulated PMs confirmed previous observations that the PM is the principle source of these cytokines in peritoneal fluid.
