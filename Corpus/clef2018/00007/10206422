Recurrent clear cell carcinoma of the ovary changing into producing parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP) with hypercalcemia. We experienced the case of a clear cell carcinoma of the ovary arising from an endometrial cyst, which started to produce parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP) in a recurrent tumor, thus inducing hypercalcemia. Using immunohistochemical analysis, we demonstrated that the primary carcinoma was immunonegative for PTH-rP, but that the recurrent carcinoma was strongly immunopositive for PTH-rP.
