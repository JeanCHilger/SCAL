The putative role of cell adhesion molecules in endometriosis: can we learn from tumour metastasis? Endometriosis, one of the most frequent diseases in gynaecology, is a considerable threat to the physical, psychological and social integrity of women. The etiology and pathogenesis of this important disease, defined as the ectopic location of endometrium-like glandular epithelium and stroma outside the uterine cavity, is poorly understood. Clinical observations and in vitro experiments imply that endometriotic cells are invasive and able to metastasize. Analogous to tumour metastasis, it is likely that cell adhesion molecules are central for the invasion and metastasis of endometriotic cells. Investigation of these molecules in endometriosis should increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this disease.
