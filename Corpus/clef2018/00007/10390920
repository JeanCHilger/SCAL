Usefulness of selected circulating biochemical markers in diagnosis and monitoring of endometriosis. A review of the literature for searching of biochemical marker of endometriosis is presented. The investigations with CA 125, antiendometrial antibodies, placental protein 14 and others have not established a sensitive screening test for predicting endometriosis, especially in early stages of the disease. Most authors confirm usefulness of those markers in monitoring therapy and predicting recurrences. This may allow to avoid commonly performed "second look" laparoscopy.
