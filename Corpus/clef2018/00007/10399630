Tissue quantification of CA 125 in epithelial ovarian cancer. The objectives of this study were the determination of CA 125 in the cytosol of healthy and carcinomatous ovarian tissue by immunoanalysis, analysis of its correlation with the biological characteristics of ovarian carcinoma, determination of serum CA 125 levels, and study of the prognostic value of the marker in cytosol. The levels of the marker depend not only on the tumor's production rate, so its determination in tissue can indicate more accurately if the tumor is a producer of the marker and establish its value for the prognosis of the disease. Determination of CA 125 in tissue was performed by immunoanalysis in 50 ovarian epithelial cancer samples, 13 benign pathology samples and 32 healthy ovary samples. The presurgical serum level of the marker was also obtained. The correlation between the CA 125 level in the cytosol and the different biological characteristics of the ovarian carcinoma, the serum levels of the marker and survival were analyzed. The CA 125 level proved to be higher in malignant tissue (p < 0.0001). There was a significant association between the tissue marker and histological type (high CA 125 was associated with serous and endometrioid tumors) and between the marker and survival. No relation with stage was found. There was a correlation between the CA 125 level in the cytosol and serum both variables being dependent, with a correlation coefficient of 0.44. This good correlation speaks in favor of the usefulness of CA 125 determination in serum in the follow-up of ovarian cancer. Tumors having high tissue expression of CA 125 were found to have a double relative risk of death, independently of tumor stage.
