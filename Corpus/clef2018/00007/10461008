Endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising from adenomyosis. In spite of many references to carcinoma arising from endometriosis at extrauterine sites, there are few documented cases of carcinoma developing in association with adenomyosis. We present 2 rare cases of adenocarcinoma arising from adenomyosis. The relationship between prior frequent estrogen use and carcinogenesis and the possible effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy are reviewed.
