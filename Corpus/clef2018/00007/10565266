A case of parenchymal pulmonary endometriosis. Pulmonary Endometriosis is a rare disease entity and we report a 23-year-old single woman with a history of hemoptysis in association with menstruation. She was previously treated effectively with hormone therapy for 3 months, but decided to undergo surgical resection because of the high cost of hormone therapy. Radiographic finding of the chest showed haziness in the right lower lung field, and chest CT showed a ground-glass appearance in the posterobasal and laterobasal segment. The patient underwent basal segmentectomy of the right lower lobe. There was no incidence of hemoptysis during her menstruation following the operation.
