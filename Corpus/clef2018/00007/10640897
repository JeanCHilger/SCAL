Dominant expression of progesterone receptor form B mRNA in ovarian endometriosis. This study was designed to examine the biological implications of progesterone receptor form A (PR-A) and B (PR-B) mRNA expressions in human ovarian endometriosis (ectopic endometrium). A high ratio of PR-B to PR-AB (PR-A+PR-B) mRNA expression was found in 8 of 14 cases of endometriosis, compared with the ratio in eutopic endometrium. The mean ratio in ectopic endometria was significantly (p < 0.01) higher than in eutopic endometria. The ratio in eutopic and ectopic endometria showed no significant change during the menstrual cycle. The mean ratio in ectopic endometria in the proliferative and secretory phases of the endometrium was significantly (p < 0.01) higher than in eutopic endometria. In conclusion, PR-B mRNA was relatively highly expressed in some endometriomas, which might lead to aberrations in the control of progestational effects involving responsiveness to sex steroidal growth regulation.
