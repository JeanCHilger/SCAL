Optimal use of infertility diagnostic tests and treatments. The ESHRE Capri Workshop Group. The general definition of infertility is a lesser capacity to conceive than the mean capacity of the general population and infertile couples can be characterized in two groups: those unable to conceive without therapy and those who are hypofertile, but conceive without therapy. The initial diagnostic tests for infertility should include a midluteal phase progesterone assay, a semen analysis and a test for tubal patency such as a hysterosalpingogram. Measuring progesterone is the best test for confirming ovulation. To predict ovulation, evaluating the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge is the best single assay while measurement of LH plus preovulatory oestrogen is the best prediction. Today primary investigation of the morphology of the uterus and tubes should be by hysterosalpingography. However, ultrasound, particularly with simple contrast media, is likely to gain in importance. Laparoscopy should be reserved as a further diagnostic procedure or in combination with endoscopic surgery. There are situations in which semen analysis is of utmost importance and of absolute predictive value, namely, in cases of azoospermia. In general semen analysis remains a substantial part of the fertility workup, but any consideration of its predictive value has to be cautious. Performing genetic tests before, during and after assisted reproductive techniques (ART) is an intrinsic part of good clinical practice. These tests allow one to reach a correct diagnosis, to give adequate genetic counselling to the couple and their families in cases such as (i) women with Turner syndrome (ii) men with 47, XXY
