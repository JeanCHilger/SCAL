Smooth muscles are frequent components of endometriotic lesions. Deep infiltrating endometriosis (deeper than 5 mm under the peritoneum) often takes the form of a nodular lesion (or 'adenomyotic nodule') consisting of smooth muscles and fibrosis with active glands and scanty stroma. Thus, among endometriotic lesions, a certain distinction is drawn between musculo-glandular lesions and glandular lesions composed of endometrial-like epithelium surrounded by a cell-producing (cytogenous) stroma. The aim of this study was to detect by immunohistochemistry, with a monoclonal antibody against muscle-specific actin, the presence of smooth muscles in 54 endometriotic lesions originating from four different pelvic locations (peritoneum, ovary, rectovaginal septum and uterosacral ligaments) and to quantify the smooth muscle content. Smooth muscles were frequent components of endometriotic lesions in pelvic locations. In addition, smooth muscles were significantly (P < 0. 001) more abundant in endometriotic lesions than in their respective unaffected sites. This finding supports, at least partially, the occurrence of a metaplastic phenomenon in the pathogenesis of endometriotic lesions. The definition of distinct endometriotic entities based on the difference in the tissue composition of the lesions (endometriotic nodules versus adenomyotic nodules) is inconsistent with the very frequent presence of smooth muscle cells in endometriosis irrespective of its localization.
