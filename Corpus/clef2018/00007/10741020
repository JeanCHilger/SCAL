Endometriosis--an inflammatory disease in women. Pain and reduced fertility are serious symptoms. Endometriosis is a common disease with serious consequences for the patient and for society. Until now there has been no reliable method for diagnosing endometriosis besides direct visualization, e.g. utilizing laparoscopy. IVF offers the most successful treatment of endometriosis-related infertility, and a patient should be offered that treatment after one year of infertility. Waiting lists are often rather long, and other treatment modalities might be attempted while waiting for IVF. Pharmacological treatment does not increase the chances of pregnancy, while surgical extirpation of mild to moderate endometriosis might well result in a pregnancy earlier than anticipated.
