Bladder endometriosis. Apropos of 4 cases and review of the literature. The aim of our study is to evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic attitude toward endometriosis of the bladder. We have analysed four observations treated in the gynecologic service of Hotel-Dieu in Paris between January 1989 and January 1998, which represents 1.3% of all endometriosis operated during this period. Every patient underwent echography, RMN, UIV and cystoscopy. In all for cases a surgical treatment by laparotomy was realised. The choice of this way is explained by the multiple localisations of endometriosis in three cases and the impossibility of a coelioscopic treatment in the forth. The anatomopathologic exam found endometriosis in all of the cases.
