Autoimmunity in endometriosis: relevance to infertility. Endometriosis is a complicated multi-factorial disease. Genetic and immunologic factors play a key role in its pathophysiology. We were the first to describe endometrial and ovarian autoimmunity in women with endometriosis in 1981.ELISA and Western blot analysis. It is accepted that women with endometriosis have autoimmunity to endometrial, ovarian and nuclear antigens. We have now established that: 1. The endometrial autoantigens to which the endometriosis patients have autoimmune reactions are endometrial transferrin and alpha 2-HS glycoprotein. 2. Levels of antibodies to both these proteins are specifically elevated in women with endometriosis, thus making them important candidates for developing an endometrial antibody assay for a non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis. 3. Levels of transferrin and alpha 2-HS glycoprotein are significantly elevated in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. 4. Antibodies to transferrin and alpha 2-HS glycoprotein also inhibit in vitro sperm motility.These data strongly suggest the possibility of endometrial autoantibodies playing an important role in the infertility often associated with endometriosis.
