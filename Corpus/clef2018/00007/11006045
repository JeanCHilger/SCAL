Endometrial carcinoma remaining after term pregnancy following conservative treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Successful pregnancies after conservative progestin treatment to young women with endometrial carcinoma have recently been reported. However, it is not known for certain whether the lesion is completely eradicated in such patients. We present a case of residual endometrial carcinoma after term pregnancy which had been treated conservatively before the pregnancy began.A 28-year-old woman with endometrial carcinoma received conservative treatment with high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and then conceived. After delivery at term, atypical cells were found in the endometrial curettage specimen. A hysterectomy was performed 6 months after delivery and revealed the presence of a small focus of intramucosal, grade 1, endometrioid-type adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors.We concluded that while MPA treatment had been effective, it had not completely eradicated the carcinomatous lesion, which remained during and after the term pregnancy.
