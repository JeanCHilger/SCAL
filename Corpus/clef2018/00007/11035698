Catamenial hemoptysis from tracheobronchial endometriosis: reappraisal of diagnostic value of bronchoscopy and bronchial brush cytology. To analyze the clinical data of four patients with a diagnosis of tracheobronchial endometriosis, and to reappraise the diagnostic value of bronchoscopy and bronchial brush cytology in these patients.We conducted a retrospective study of four patients with documented tracheobronchial endometriosis treated at National Taiwan University Hospital from 1994 to 1998. The complete histories, diagnostic time interval, results of physical examinations, laboratory data, bronchoscopic findings, cytologic results, chest radiographs, and chest CT of these patients were analyzed.These patients tend to be younger and nonmultiparous as compared to other patients with thoracic endometriosis. Bronchoscopic examination performed within 1 day or 2 days of menses disclosed multiple purplish-red submucosal patches bilaterally that bled easily when touched. Cytologic evaluation of the brushing specimens demonstrated clusters of small cuboid cells consistent with an endometrial origin. Follow-up bronchoscopic examination in the middle of the menstrual cycle showed disappearance of the previous tracheobronchial lesions. The mean diagnostic interval was 3.25 months. All four patients were successfully treated with danazol therapy.Tracheobronchial endometriosis consists of a special subgroup of patients with thoracic endometriosis. Proper timing of bronchoscopic examination plays an important diagnostic role in these patients. Cytologic features as well as cyclic changes in bronchoscopic findings are sufficient to warrant the diagnosis. The results of treatment with danazol in these patients seemed favorable.
