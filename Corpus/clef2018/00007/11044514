Transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy, a new technique for pelvic assessment. Transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy is based on classic culdoscopy. With alterations in equipment and method, the procedure holds promise for evaluation of pelvic pathology. We performed transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy in the operating room just before operative laparoscopy in 15 patients, to evaluate the feasibility of this procedure. Excellent images of the cul-de-sac, fimbriae, and caudal surface of the uterus, ovaries, and pelvic sidewall were obtained. We believe this is a practical and convenient office diagnostic procedure.
