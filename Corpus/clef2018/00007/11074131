Three-year follow-up of [CA-125, CA 19-9, CA 15-3, SIL-2R, IL-6, IL-la, TNF-a, sCD8 and sCD4] levels in a woman with severe endometriosis. A 37-year old woman presented with severe endometriosis and the patient underwent a conservative operation. We investigated the effect of treatment with danazol on the levels of CA-125, CA-19-9, CA 15-3, SIL-2R, IL-6, IL-1a, TNE-a, SCD8 and SCD4 in this woman. Our findings suggest that severe endometriosis is a condition which induces a rise of tumor markers and cytokine levels that are suppressed on danazol treatment.
