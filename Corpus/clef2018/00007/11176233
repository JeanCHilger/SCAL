Developments in the pathology of ovarian tumours. The understanding of the pathogenesis and pathology of ovarian tumours is constantly evolving. Dominant themes in recent studies of ovarian tumours include prognostic features in borderline tumours, molecular events in the pathogenesis of ovarian tumours, the assessment of tumour features that may have prognostic or treatment implications, and the development of techniques that may enhance diagnostic accuracy. The literature has been reviewed with an aim to identifying those studies that can potentially impact practice and improve patient care. The most noteworthy developments include: the understanding that so-called 'tumours of low malignant potential' are virtually always benign, and that one can identify those rare cases with malignant potential the importance of the recognition of micropapillary serous carcinomas
