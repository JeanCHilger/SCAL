Mesonephric adenocarcinomas of the uterine cervix: a study of 11 cases with immunohistochemical findings. Mesonephric adenocarcinoma is a rare variant of cervical carcinoma with relatively few, well-documented cases reported. We describe the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of 11 examples of this neoplasm, which occurred in women between the ages of 35 and 72 years (mean, 52 years). Most (64%) patients had abnormal vaginal bleeding. Eight tumors were stage IB, and one each was stage IIB and IVB in one, the stage was unknown. Microscopically, the carcinomas showed various morphologies, most commonly a small tubular pattern or a ductal pattern resembling endometrioid adenocarcinoma
