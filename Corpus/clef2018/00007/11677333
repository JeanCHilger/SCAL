Appendiceal disease in women with endometriosis and right lower quadrant pain. To evaluate the frequency and range of appendiceal disease in women with endometriosis and right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, and to estimate the value of preoperative gastrograffin enema (GGE) as a screen for the disease.Nonrandomized clinical trial (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).University-affiliated hospital with a private practice setting.A subpopulation of 65 women from a group of 337 patients undergoing laparoscopy for symptomatic endometriosis.Preoperative GGE was performed whenever possible in these women. At laparoscopy, the appendix was removed if it appeared abnormal or if the preoperative GGE was positive.Of 65 women (19%) with symptomatic endometriosis and preoperative RLQ pain, 52 (80%) underwent appendectomy as part of surgery. Of these 52 excised appendixes, 39 (75%) had histologically confirmed pathology including appendicitis or periappendicitis, endometriosis, fibrous obliteration, lymphoid hyperplasia, and carcinoid tumor. Preoperative GGE had sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 83% for appendiceal disease. Its positive predictive value was 95% and negative predictive value was 42%. No complications from laparoscopic appendectomy occurred.Disease of the appendix is common in women with endometriosis and RLQ pain. Appendectomy is particularly likely if preoperative GGE is positive.
