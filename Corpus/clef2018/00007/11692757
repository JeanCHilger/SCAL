Colorectal endometriosis. Diagnosis and management. Endometriosis occurs in 5 to 10% of the female population. Bowel involvement present in 6 to 30% of cases is predominantly localized in the pelvic parts of the colon and rectum, close to the uterus. The goal of this work was to describe the present diagnostic and therapeutic management of deep colorectal endometriosis defined as infiltrating the digestive wall and usually requiring surgery. Colorectal endometriosis is a disabling disease. Anatomic lesions mimic those of a cancer. Modern investigations include endorectal endosonography, recognized as the best mean to assess the depth of invasion into the intestinal wall, and magnetic resonance imaging. Associated to exploratory laparoscopy, these investigations allow to select the optimal operative strategy for multifocal and complex lesions. Surgical objective is a total resection of endometriomas, to guarantee symptom relief and avoid recurrence. Difficulties in these procedures are usually due to fibrotic and vascularised lesions and associated gynaecological disorders. In elective cases, preoperative GH-RH analog hormonal treatment makes easier the surgical procedure. Colonic and/or rectal restorative resections, performed through laparoscopic approach or more frequently through laparotomy, have to be done according to the usual standards of colorectal surgery. Conservative surgery of the ovaries is mandatory in premenopausal patients.
