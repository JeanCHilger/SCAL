Endometriosis of the lung: case report. The first case of a clinically and histologically verified miliary form of endometriosis of the lung is reported here. The cardinal symptom was a menstrually synchronised hemoptysis, which by treatment with high doses of progestins disappeared. After operative castration a complete remittence with normal chest X ray was attained. Pathogenesis and frequency were briefly described. The 11 previously published cases served as a basis. Taking into account experimental and clinical experience, we propound the opinion the endometriosis of the lung occurs via hematological spread as a result of uterine operations or pregnancy. The conditions under which endometrium survives in the lung remain uncertain. Large doses of gestagen drugs are to be recommended as therapy and should be this prove unsuccessful operative castration.
