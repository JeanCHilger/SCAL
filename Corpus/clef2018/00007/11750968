Gliomatosis peritonei: a report of two cases and review of the literature. Gliomatosis peritonei is the implantation of miliary glial tissue within the peritoneal cavity of patients with ovarian teratomas. Up to now 86 cases of this rare entity have been reported. In addition to the small number of reported gliomatosis peritonei cases, a condition easily mistaken for peritoneal carcinomatosis, we report two further cases, one combined with endometriosis (fifth case published until now) and one without endometriosis. Both cases were followed up for more than 5.5 years. Thus, further data concerning biological behaviour and prognosis of this rare entity are made available. In addition, a review of all cases published until today is provided, thus summarising the data presently known.
