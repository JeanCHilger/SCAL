Increased killer inhibitory receptor KIR2DL1 expression among natural killer cells in women with pelvic endometriosis. To investigate the host immunologic response to endometriosis in terms of killer inhibitory receptor (KIR) expression by natural killer (NK) cells.Case-control study of immunologic markers.University hospital.We compared cells from Japanese women with laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis to cells from 40 women with other laparoscopic diagnoses.Peripheral venous blood sampling and laparoscopic peritoneal fluid collection.Flow cytometry was used to assess expression of KIR by NK cells in the cell samples.The percentage of cells that expressed KIR2DL1 among NK (KIR2DL1(+)NK) cells in peritoneal fluid and peripheral blood was significantly higher in women with endometriosis than in controls. The proportion of KIR2DL1(+)NK cells in peripheral blood NK cells before and 1 month after laparoscopic surgery did not differ significantly.The proportion of KIR2DL1(+)NK cells was increased in peritoneal fluid and peripheral blood in women with endometriosis this difference is probably related to NK cell suppression in endometriosis. This increase in KIR2DL1 expression by NK cells may represent a risk factor in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
