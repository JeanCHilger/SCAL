Recurrence of endometriosis in women with bilateral adnexectomy (with or without total hysterectomy) who received hormone replacement therapy. To estimate the risk of recurrence after administration of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) among women who have had endometriosis and who underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO).Prospective randomized trial (115 women receiving HRT and 57 not receiving HRT). SETTING Public university hospital.Women with a histologic diagnosis of endometriosis in whom BSO was performed 91.8% had a total hysterectomy.Periodical clinical examination, vaginal ultrasound, and CA-125 levels surgical evaluation and histologic study.Recurrence rate, prognostic factors, and a mean follow-up time of 45 months.There was no recurrence among women who did not receive HRT, versus a 3.5% rate (4 out of 115), or 0.9% per year, in women who received HRT. Two recurrences required abdominal surgery. There was one additional patient who required surgery, but the relationship to the endometriosis recurrence was controversial. Among women receiving HRT, the following risk factors were detected: peritoneal involvement > 3 cm (2.4% recurrence per year vs. 0.3%) and incomplete surgery (22.2% per patient vs. 1.9%).Patients with a history of endometriosis in whom total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy have been performed have a low risk of recurrence when HRT is administered. In those patients, HRT is a reasonable option. However, in cases with peritoneal involvement > 3 cm, the recurrence rate makes HRT a controversial option if HRT is indicated, it should be monitored closely.
