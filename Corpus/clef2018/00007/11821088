PROGINS receptor gene polymorphism is associated with endometriosis. To investigate the association between the 306-base pair insertion polymorphism in intron G of the progesterone receptor (PROGINS) and endometriosis.Case-control study.Tertiary care center.Ninety-five white women with surgically diagnosed and histologically confirmed endometriosis and 107 white women without endometriosis (controls).Determination of PROGINS was performed by polymerase chain reaction and gel electrophoresis. MAIN OUTCOIME MEASURE(S): Frequency and distribution of the PROGINS allele.Frequencies of the mutant allele T2 was 0.17 among women with endometriosis and 0.08 among controls (odds ratio, 2.41 [CI, 1.31-4.53]). Homozygosity for allele T2 was present in 3.2% of women with endometriosis and 0.9% of controls.PROGINS appears to be associated with endometriosis in white persons.
