Enhanced T cells interactions with extracellular matrix proteins in infertile women with endometriosis. Essential features of endometriosis involve interactions with extracellular matrix (ECM). Recent data emphasize the important role of ECM proteins in the regulation of T cell function. The aim of this study was to determine activated T cell adhesion to ECM proteins in infertile women with endometriosis. Nine women with endometriosis diagnosed by laparoscopy according to the Revised American Fertility Society classification and ten normal healthy women with a previous successful pregnancy outcome were studied. We investigated phorbol acetate myristate (PMA) or phytohemaglutinin (PHA) activated peripheral blood T cell adhesion to the following proteins of ECM: collagen IV (C-IV), elastin (E) and fibronectin (Fn). In addition, CD4, CD8, CD29, CD45RO expression on peripheral CD3(+) T cells were studied using flow cytometry. We determine that PHA-activated T cell adhesion to C-IV and Fn are significantly higher in infertile women with endometriosis when compared to normal healthy women (P<0.05). No significant differences were noted in T cell's surface antigens expression between study groups. Our data suggest the existence of disturbed T cell-ECM interactions in infertile women with endometriosis. Further studies are needed to determine the role of these abnormalities in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
