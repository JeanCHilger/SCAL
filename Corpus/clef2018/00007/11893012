Expression and function of 3beta hydroxisteroid dehydrogenase (3beta HSD) type II and corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) in granulosa cells from ovaries of women with and without endometriosis. To investigate the secretion of progesterone (P4) and corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) by granulosa luteal cells (GC) as well as the mRNA levels of CBG and 3beta hydroxisteroid dehydrogenase (3beta HSD), in women with and without endometriosis in vivo and in vitro.Prospective study in a private, university-affiliated assisted reproduction unit, including women with severe endometriosis (n = 14) or without the disease (n = 20) undergoing in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection and embryo transfer. GC were obtained from each follicle aspirated, pooled for each patient, and follicular and blood contaminating leukocytes depleted through immunomagnetic purification. Secreted P4 and CBG, and mRNA for both 3beta HSD and CBG were determined in vivo and in vitro using RIA and reverse transcription followed by competitive polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR).The pattern of expression of 3beta HSD and CBG mRNAs in vivo and in vitro was similar in both groups. Also, GC from patients with endometriosis produced equal amounts of P4 and CBG than controls without the disease, either in freshly isolated cells or in 24-h cultures.The GC function in terms of 3beta HSD and CBG mRNA expression and P4/CBG secretion does not seem to be altered in patients with endometriosis in comparison with those without this condition.
