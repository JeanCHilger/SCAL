Aberrant expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and killer inhibitory receptors induces immune tolerance in women with pelvic endometriosis. To investigate host immunologic response to endometriosis in terms of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression by macrophages and killer cell inhibitory receptor (KIR) expression by natural killer (NK) cells.Case-control study of immunologic markers.University hospital.Twenty-eight Japanese women with endometriosis. Control subjects were 26 women without endometriosis. Diagnoses were made at laparoscopy.Venipuncture and laparoscopic peritoneal fluid collection.ICAM-1 expression by macrophages and KIR expression by NK cells, measured by flow cytometry.In women with endometriosis, expression of ICAM-1 by peritoneal macrophages was significantly lower and expression of KIR by NK cells in peritoneal fluid and peripheral blood was significantly higher than in control subjects.Properties of macrophages and NK cells in women with endometriosis promote immunotolerance to implanted tissue in the peritoneal environment. Increased KIR(+)NK cells in peripheral blood may represent a risk factor for endometriosis.
