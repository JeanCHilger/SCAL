Carcinoma developing in extragonadal endometriosis--analysis of two cases. Two cases of invasive carcinoma developing in extragonadal endometriosis are presented. Each case had a different clinical course. In addition to routine histopathologic studies immunohistochemical studies to assess the expression of cytoceratin and glycoprotein CD-44 were performed. In both cases CK-7 expression was higher in malignancy then in the endometrioid tissue. Very high expression of CD-44 protein (marker of metastatic potential) was found in patients with poor progress of the disease.
