Reproductive performance after ultrasound-guided transvaginal ethanol sclerotherapy for ovarian endometriotic cysts. Ultrasound-guided transvaginal ethanol sclerotherapy (TV-EST) has been widely practised in Japan for ovarian endometriotic cysts. We investigated the possible adverse effects of TV-EST for ovarian endometriotic cysts on reproductive performance.We reviewed retrospectively medical records and compared clinical outcomes of 45 subfertile women who underwent TV-EST for ovarian endometriotic cysts (Study group) with those of 65 subfertile women without ovarian endometriotic cysts (Comparison group). Patients were followed up monthly for 24 months. Serum levels of LH, FSH, CA125 and CA19-9 were determined before and after TV-EST.No complications associated with TV-EST were observed. There were no differences in the numbers of pregnancies (47% (21/45) versus 39% (25/65)), term deliveries (76% (16/21) versus 76% (19/25)), abortions (19% (4/21) versus 24% (6/25)), retrieved oocytes, or quality of embryos between the Study and Comparison groups, respectively. The serum levels of LH and FSH did not increase after TV-EST. The serum levels of CA125 and CA19-9 did not significantly decrease after TV-EST. Ovarian cysts recurred in six (13.3%) of the 45 women 5.2+/-3.9 months after TV-EST.Although only a small number of women were studied, our observational study suggested that TV-EST appeared not to adversely affect reproductive performance in subfertile women with ovarian endometriotic cysts.
