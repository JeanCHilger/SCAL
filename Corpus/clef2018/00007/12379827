MRI in gynecology. To review the complementary role and contribution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in gynecology diseases.Tissue characterization can be obtained with T2, T1 weighted images before and after contrast medium injection and T1 fat sat sequences. Localization of the lesion and relationships with adjacent structures are facilitated by multiplanar imaging. Endometrium and ovarian follicles display high signal intensity, visualizing the normal uterine and ovarian components. The relative high signal intensity of uterine tumors facilitates evaluation of extension. Uterine leiomyoma diagnosis is supported by its low signal intensity, allowing localization, size, and number assessment, and to distinguish adenomyoma. In doubtful malformation cases, MRI may be contributive. Ovarian mass characterization can be done with MRI, particularly for dermoid cyst and endometrioma. In this case, deep endometriosis can be associated and be extensive. Recent technical advances enable fast imaging, which can be useful for pelvic floor assessment with dynamic evaluation.MRI is becoming the complementary reference imaging tool for us. Its increasing indications are: gynecologic cancer, pelvis endometriosis, pelvis floor, indeterminate pelvis mass and fibroleiomyoma.
