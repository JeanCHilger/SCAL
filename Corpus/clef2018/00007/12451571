Pelvic endometriosis diagnosed on touch imprint cytology. A case of pelvic endometriosis on touch imprint cytology in a 34-yr-old woman is presented and discussed. Touch preparations of the core biopsies showed both epithelial and spindle cell components. Bland-appearing epithelial cells, arranged in tight clusters and sheets, contained finely granular chromatin and scant cytoplasm. Clusters of bland-appearing spindle cells with oval nuclei containing small prominent nucleoli were present. The differential diagnosis and diagnostic pitfalls are discussed.
