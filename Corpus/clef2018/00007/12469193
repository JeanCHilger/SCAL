Apoptosis, proliferation, and hormone receptors in endometrial carcinoma: results depending on methods of analysis. Apoptosis and proliferation were studied in 29 endometrial adenocarcinomas of the endometrioid type and characterized by the immunohisto-chemical pattern of estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and progesterone receptor (PR) expression. Intratumoral heterogeneous distribution of both ER and PR as well as of the proliferation marker Ki-67 was studied and quantified. Both density and heterogeneity of the two steroid receptors and Ki-67 varied, depending on the histological malignancy grade (grades 1-3, or G1-3) interestingly, however, the apoptotic index (Ai) was in the same range for all grades. Receptor staining was evaluated by three different methods: i) counting the percentage of stained cells (staining index), according to stereological principles
