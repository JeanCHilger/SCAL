Postlaparoscopic vulvar edema, a rare complication. Two cases of unilateral labial edema occurred after laparoscopic presacral neurectomy and were associated with massive chylous ascites. One woman was cured by a second laparoscopy to repair the chylous leakage. In the other, vulvar edema subsided in 2 days and chyloperitoneum subsided spontaneously in 3 weeks. The mechanism of postlaparoscopic vulvar edema is believed to be similar to that of Conn's postparacentesis labial edema, in which the unhealed puncture tract permits ascites to travel through and accumulate in the labia majora.
