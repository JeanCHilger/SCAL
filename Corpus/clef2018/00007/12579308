Genome-wide cDNA microarray analysis of gene-expression profiles involved in ovarian endometriosis. Using a cDNA microarray consisting of 23,040 genes, we analyzed gene-expression profiles of ovarian endometrial cysts from 23 patients in order to identify genes involved in endometriosis. By comparing expression patterns between endometriotic tissues and corresponding eutopic endometria, we identified 15 genes that were commonly up-regulated in the endometrial cysts during both proliferative and secretory phases of the menstrual cycle, 42 that were up-regulated only in the proliferative phase, and 40 that were up-regulated only in the secretory phase. The up-regulated elements included genes encoding some HLA antigens, complement factors, ribosomal proteins, and TGFBI. On the other hand, 337 genes were commonly down-regulated throughout the menstrual cycle, 144 only in the proliferative phase, and 835 only in the secretory phase. The down-regulated elements included the tumor suppressor TP53, genes related to apoptosis such as GADD34, GADD45A, GADD45B and PIG11, and the gene encoding OVGP1, a protein involved in maintenance of early pregnancy. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR experiments supported the results of our microarray analysis. These data should provide useful information for finding candidate genes whose products might serve as molecular targets for diagnosis or treatment of endometriosis.
