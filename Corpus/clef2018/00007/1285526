Bladder endometriosis. Endometriosis is the ectopic location of the endometrium. It is quite unusual to find endometrium foci within the vesical cavity, this experience representing only 1-2% of all possible locations. This paper contributes one vesical endometriosis in a 35 year old woman endoscopically diagnosed because of a solid tumour with surface bluish bullae or cysts. We used Gestrima, in dosage of 2.5 mg twice weekly, as adjuvant treatment to endoscopic surgery with complete objective response.
