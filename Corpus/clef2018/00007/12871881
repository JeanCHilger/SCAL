Levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in serum of patients with endometriosis. Elevated concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been detected in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis. Furthermore, it was postulated that VEGF is involved in the development of endometriotic lesions. The present study is aimed at determining whether high levels of VEGF could also be found in the serum of patients with endometriosis.VEGF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serum from 131 subjects with surgically confirmed endometriosis and 146 controls with no clinical evidence of the disease or detectable endometriotic lesions at the time of surgical examination. Parameters such as demographics, personal habits, menstrual characteristics and clinical profile were collected from each subject included in this study.The mean VEGF levels were not significantly modulated in serum samples of cases compared with controls in a crude general linear model and in a model adjusted for possible confounders. VEGF serum levels did not correlate with the score, stage of endometriosis or the presence of benign gynaecological disorders. However, a correlation was found between circulating concentrations of VEGF and body mass index.Although VEGF seems to play a pivotal role locally in the implantation and development of endometriotic lesions, the disease is not associated with a significant modulation in the levels of circulating VEGF.
