Intrinsic endometriosis of the ureter. Clinical case. Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the cavity of the uterus. The urinary tract is rarely affected, only 1 to 11%. Bladder is the most frequent urinary localization while the ureteral involvement is rare. We report a case of intrinsic ureteral endometriosis in a woman with left hydronephrosis, lumbar pain and septic fever. Instrumental and laboratory investigations can hardly lead to a reliable diagnosis of ureteral endometriosis. A final diagnosis is feasible only by histologic examination, which obviously implies surgery.
