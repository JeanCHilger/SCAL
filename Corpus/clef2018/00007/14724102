Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and endostatin in peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis. To investigate the relationship of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endostatin with endometriosis.The levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and endostatin were measured using ELISA in 50 women with endometriosis (stage I-II26 cases and stage III-IV 24 cases) in comparison with 42 women without endometriosis.The VEGF, endostatin concentrations and VEGF/endostatin ratio in endometriosis group were significantly higher than the mean value in the control group (P<0.01). The VEGF and endostatin levels in stages III and IV were both significantly higher than those in stages I and II(397+/-81 pg/ml vs 315+/-64 pg/ml, 125+/-62 ng/ml vs 66+/-40 ng/ml, P<0.01). However, the VEGF/endostatin ratio was lower in the advanced stages. There was no significant difference between follicular phase and luteal phase except that the VEGF level in follicular phase was higher than that in luteal phases.Both VEGF and endostatin may play a role in the regulation of angiogenesis of endometriosis, and the balance of angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors may be critical to the development of endometriosis.
