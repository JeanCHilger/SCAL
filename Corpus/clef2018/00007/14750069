Ultrasound diagnosis of rare retrorectal tumors. The diagnosis of perirectal masses can be accomplished by computer tomography and magnet resonance imaging if the rectum is contrasted. The accuracy of these methods is > 90 %. But often the assessment of the exact borders with respect to the rectum wall and to the genitalia is difficult. Therefore transrectal 3D-ultrasound is of major importance in the preoperative staging and postoperative follow-up of rectum cancer and allows the diagnosis of pararectal findings using the ultrasound-guided, transrectal aspiration. By ultrasound-guided aspiration biopsy we detected five cases of pararectal and especially presacral diseases including one case of endometriosis. The diagnostic algorithm is described.
