Chronic administration of single weekly paclitaxel in heavily pretreated ovarian cancer patients. Ovarian cancer patients with paclitaxel-resistance have been reported to respond to a weekly schedule of the same drug. In this report, two cases with long progression free interval by weekly paclitaxel (T) are presented. Case 1. A 41-year-old Japanese woman, gravida 2, para 0, was referred to our hospital in September 16, 1998, because of abdominal mass accompanying large amount of ascites with elevated CA125 (8400 U/ml) and CA19-9 (770 U/ml). Exploratory laparotomy (tumor biopsy plus partial omentectomy) was performed September 21, 1998. After the surgery, the tumor was diagnosed as serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary (stage IV) and 6 cycles of treatment consisting of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and cisplatin (CAP) were performed. The CA 125 level (8400 U/ml) rapidly declined to 150 U/ml by this CAP therapy. After second cytoreductive surgery (SRS) (total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy), residual tumor was less than 2 cm. Although 7 cycles of CAP was added, ascites and elevation of CA 125 (5100 U/ml) were observed. Therefore, treatment with single weekly T was performed and CA 125 levels remained between 70-90 U/ml during 13 cycles of this therapy (progression free interval more than 1 year). Thereafter, she is alive with disease and followed-up. Case 2. A 48-year-old Japanese woman, gravida 3, para 2, was referred to our hospital in July 22, 1998, because of abdominal swelling and pain. Computing tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed large amount of ascite and pelvic mass (9 x 7 x 7 cm), and low density area (3 x 3 cm) suggesting metastasis in right lobe of liver. Serum CA 125 level elevated to 5100 U/ml. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and infracolic omentectomy were performed on August 5, 1998. The tumor was diagnosed as endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the ovary, stage IV and chemotherapy with CAP was initiated on September 5, 1998. After 6 cycles of CAP, SRS was performed. After SRS, 3 cycles of CAP were added and changed to weekly T because of damage of renal function. The CA 125 level returned within normal range during weekly T. Total 13 cycles of weekly T were performed and progression free interval was about 18 months. Thereafter, she received treatments with gamma knife and CAP for brain metastasis. She is alive without disease and followed-up. Side effects by weekly T were mild and tolerable despite of long term treatment. In addition, weekly T can be safely used in outpatient setting and even in patients with poor performance status (PS), and warrant long time to progression.
