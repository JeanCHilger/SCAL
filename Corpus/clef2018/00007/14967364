Peritoneal fluid concentrations of epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide-78 correlate with the severity of endometriosis. To assess the release of epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide-78 (ENA-78) into peritoneal fluid in women with and without endometriosis.Retrospective study.Nagoya City University Hospital.Surgery was scheduled in the proliferative or secretory phase of the menstrual cycle for 59 women with (n = 35) and without (n = 24) endometriosis.Peritoneal fluid samples were obtained at laparotomy or laparoscopy.The ENA-78 concentrations in the peritoneal fluid were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The concentrations of ENA-78 in the peritoneal fluid were markedly elevated in the endometriosis patients as compared with the controls, especially in women with severe stage disease.We conclude that ENA-78 is an important factor that may contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis, possibly promoting neovascularization.
