Fallopian tube malignancies: experience of Social Security Agency Aegean Maternity Hospital. The aim of the study was to determine the clinical characteristics and management of fallopian tube malignancies together with the results there unto that had been diagnosed and treated in our oncology department retrospectively. Twelve cases of fallopian tube malignancies, of a total of 2155 gynecologic malignancies (0.55%), that had been diagnosed in or referred to our hospital between January 1986 and December 2001 were evaluated retrospectively. Eight of 12 cases were diagnosed after surgical intervention in our department. Staging laparotomies were applied to all of the eight cases. Complementary surgeries of other four cases who were referred to our department were done according to the same principles of cytoreductive surgery. Staging of the cases was done according to Federation of International Gynecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO). Adjuvant chemotherapy was applied to all of the cases except two (10 cases, 83.3%). Second-look laparotomy (SLL) was applied to two of the cases. Mean age of the cases was 54.2 (range 35-72) years. Histopathology of the cases was as follows: serous adenocarcinoma in 10 cases (83.3%), endometrioid adenocarcinoma in one case (8.3%), and undifferentiated carcinoma in one case (8.3%). Adjuvant chemotherapy (PAC regimen to eight of the cases and PP regimen to two cases) was applied to 10 of the cases (83.3%). SLL was applied to two cases. Another case had died because of local recurrence at the 27th month of the follow-up. Mean follow-up period of the cases was 37.8 months (range 1-144 months). Fallopian tube malignancies are very rare malignancies. Diagnosis can be made generally peri- or postoperatively. More extensive clinical research must be performed in order to have definite etiologic, diagnostic, management modalities, and prognostic markers.
