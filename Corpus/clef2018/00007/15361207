The use of P53, PTEN, and C-erbB-2 to differentiate uterine serous papillary carcinoma from endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. Endometrial adenocarcinoma is the most common pelvic genital malignancy in the western world. The most common subtype of endometrial cancer is endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC), which has a relatively good prognosis. Uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USPC) is also a subtype of endometrial carcinoma. This is an aggressive carcinoma with the majority of patients presenting at stage 3-4 and has a worse prognosis stage for stage when compared with EEC. In addition, the treatment of USPC is more extensive than that of EEC, and therefore definitive diagnosis before surgery ensures the optimum management for the patient. This study aims to determine whether P53, C-erbB-2, and PTEN antibodies have a use in the diagnosis and distinction of these cancers. We created tissue microarrays for 35 cases of EEC and 25 cases of USPC, and then we assessed the immunohistochemical expression of P53, C-erbB-2, and PTEN. There was significantly greater expression of P53 in USPC than that in EEC. However, neither C-erbB-2 nor PTEN showed any significant difference in expression between the two carcinomas. P53 may have a role in the diagnosis of USPC, but neither C-erbB-2 nor PTEN would be useful as part of a diagnostic panel.
