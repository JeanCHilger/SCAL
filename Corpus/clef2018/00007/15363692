Endometriosis and infertility. Women with endometriosis typically present with pelvic pain, infertility or an adnexal mass. Surgery for persistent adnexal masses may be indicated to remove an endometrioma or other pelvic pathology. Surgical or medical therapy is efficacious for pelvic pain due to endometriosis, but treatment of endometriosis in the female partner of an infertile couple raises a number of complex clinical questions that do not have simple answers.
