Differential effects of interferon-alpha and -beta on the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor by eutopic and ectopic endometrial stromal cells. Interferon (IFN)-beta, not IFN-alpha, suppresses vascular endothelial growth factor secretion in endometriotic cyst stromal cells. It was suggested that IFN-beta may be more suitable than IFN-alpha as an anti-endometriotic agent.
