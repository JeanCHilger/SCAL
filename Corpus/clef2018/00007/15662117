Defining the extent of cables loss in endometrial cancer subtypes and its effectiveness as an inhibitor of cell proliferation in malignant endometrial cells in vitro and in vivo. Loss of Cables expression is associated with a high incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial adenocarcinoma in humans. The Cables mutant mouse develops endometrial hyperplasia and following exposure to chronic estrogen develops early endometrial adenocarcinoma. The objectives of the current study were to determine if: (1) loss of Cables expression occurred in high grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma, uterine serous and clear cell carcinoma as observed in endometrial hyperplasia and low grade endometrial adenocarcinoma (2) overexpression of Cables inhibited cell proliferation in endometrial cancer (EC) cells in vitro and in vivo
