Five cases of female pneumothorax with endometriosis on the blebs. A part of catamenial pneumothorax is associated with endometriosis. Several cases were reported where CA125 levels were high in blood or pleural effusion. A case of female pneumothorax, the bleb and diaphragm showed positive for CA125, was reported. Additionally in the 5 cases of 6 female pneumothorax, the blebs showed positive for CA125, CD30, progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor. Endometriosis on the blebs was found in 4 of 6 cases by hematoxylin-eosin staining and in 5 of 6 cases by immunostaining. It is suggested that endometriosis on blebs is an origin of female pneumothorax.
