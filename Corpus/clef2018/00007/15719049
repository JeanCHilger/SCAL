The role of biomarkers CK7, Vim and P53 in the development of subtypes of endometrial carcinoma. Analyzing the protein expression of biomarkers CK7, Vim, and P53 to investigate their possible pathogenic roles in the development of variant subtypes of endometrial carcinoma.Biomarkers CK7, Vim, and P53 were immunohistochemistry-stained among 131 endometrial carcinoma specimens including 93 endometroid, 8 adenoacanthoma, and 32 rare subtypes of adenosquamas carcinoma, clean cell carcinoma, and papillary carcinoma, which had been confirmed clinically and pathologically, and studied statistically with Fisher test and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) Test.Positive correlation was demonstrated among CK7, Vim, and P53 expression levels. The CK7 protein expression is increased, while the Vim and P53 are decreased in the subtype of endometrioid carcinoma. The clinical staging of endometriroid carcinoma is positively correlated with the expression of Vim. The positive rate of Vim and P53 is correlated with cytological differentiation of the carcinoma cells.Biomarkers CK7, Vim, and P53 are playing pathogenic roles, assuming as a mutual transcriptional modulator, and Vim but not P53 is likely the favorable prognostic factor, in the development of variant subtypes of endometrial carcinoma in addition to a evaluating the treatment.
