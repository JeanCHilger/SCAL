Correlative factors analysis of recurrence of endometriosis after conservative surgery. To determine the correlative factors with recurrence of endometriosis after conservative surgery.A cohort study was performed on 285 patients who had a minimum of 36 months of follow-up after conservative surgery for endometriosis. All patients underwent clinical interview, physical examination and ultrasonography. The factors measured included: age at surgery, age at onset of disease, gravidity, parity, tenderness nodule at cul-de-sac (yes/no), uterus mobility (movable/fixed), serum CA(125) level, type of operation (laparoscopy/laparotomy), history of operation for endometriosis (yes/no), side of endometrioma (left/right/bilateral), intraoperative revised classification American Fertility Society (r-AFS) scores, post-operative r-AFS scores, highest post-operative temperature, post-operative adjuvant therapy, post-operative gravidity and parity. The recurrent rate and its predictive factors were evaluated and the univariate, multivariate COX regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to determine the predictive factors for recurrence of endometriosis.The related factors and their odds ratio (OR) by univariate analysis were as follows: history of endometriosis surgery, 13.630 (P < 0.01) nodules with tenderness at cul-de-sac, 6.133 (P < 0.01)The risk factors for recurrence of endometriosis include a history of endometriosis surgery, bilateral endometrioma, left endometrioma, tenderness nodules at cul-de-sac, post-operative administration of clomiphene, post-operative r-AFS scores,whereas the protective factors include the post-operative gravidity, post-operative adjuvant therapy and age at surgery.
