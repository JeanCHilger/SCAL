Laparoscopic management of hepatic endometriosis: report of two cases and review of the literature. Hepatic endometriosis is rare. Only 15 cases have been reported in the literature. All 15 were treated by laparotomy. We report two additional cases of hepatic endometriosis managed for the first time laparoscopically. Endometriosis is a progressive disease especially in women of reproductive age. One of the differential diagnoses of liver endometriosis is malignancy. Currently, there are no reports in the literature regarding complications arising from the progression of hepatic endometriosis. However, this lack of evidence does not deny its existence.
