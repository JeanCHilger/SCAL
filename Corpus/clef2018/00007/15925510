Discovery of non-steroidal mifepristone mimetics: pyrazoline-based PR antagonists. Mifepristone is a non-selective antagonist of 3-oxosteroid receptors with both abortifacient and anti-endometriotic activities. Non-steroidal mimetics of mifepristone and progesterone are important templates for modulation of the progesterone receptor (PR). For our PR program, we sought an unexplored, synthetically accessible non-steroidal mimetic of mifepristone, suitable for parallel synthesis of analogues. Docking of compounds into a PR homology model identified 4-substituted pyrazolines, which, when synthesized and tested, exhibited functional antagonism of PR.
