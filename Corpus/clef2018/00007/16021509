Intratumoral heterogeneous expression of p53 correlates with p53 mutation, Ki-67, and cyclin A expression in endometrioid-type endometrial adenocarcinomas. To further elucidate the significance of p53 mutation in endometrial carcinoma, we investigated it in endometrioid-type endometrial carcinomas showing intratumoral heterogeneous p53 expression. In addition, we also examined the correlation of p53 mutation and cyclin A expression, because we previously reported a topological correlation between the expression of p53 and cyclin A. The p53 mutation in exons 5-8 in 54 cases of endometrial carcinoma showing immunohistochemical expression of p53 was examined using microdissected tissue DNAs. Of the 54 p53-positive endometrial carcinomas, 23 (43%) had p53 mutation with a tendency in histologically higher grade tumors. Ten of the 54 showed a heterogeneous p53 expression, and in 9 of the 10 cases, p53 mutation was present only in p53-positive sites, which were often found in histologically less differentiated areas with elevated Ki-67 in the same tumor. Cyclin A expression was topologically observed in p53-positive areas however, it was noted in both tumors with (12/23, 52%) and without (18/31, 58%) p53 mutation. These results suggest that p53 mutation is a late event and plays an important role in the acquisition of malignant potentials in endometrioid-type endometrial adenocarcinomas. Unexpectedly, accumulation of the p53 protein itself may be important in cyclin A overexpression.
