Fractalkine in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of fractalkine in the ascites and the association between fractalkine levels in the ascites and endometriosis.Peritoneal fluids and peripheral blood samples were obtained from patients undergoing laparoscopy for infertility work-up or laparoscopic cystectomy. Three samples of peritoneum were obtained from patients undergoing hysterectomy. Western blotting, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed.Fractalkine protein was detected in the ascites. Positive staining was confirmed in peritoneal surface cells and perivascular cells of the peritoneum. CX3CR1 positive cells were present in the cells in the peritoneal fluid. The fractalkine concentrations in the ascites of patients with endometriosis were lower than those without endometriosis. There was no significant difference between serum fractalkine levels in patients with and without endometriosis.The decreased level of fractalkine found in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis may contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
