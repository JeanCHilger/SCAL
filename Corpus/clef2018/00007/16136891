Study on the correlation of the cytokine secreted by the endometrium focus and the microenvironment of the fleument fluid. To investigate the correlation of endometriotic focus and peritoneal fluid as well as its effect on reproduction.Forty-three women with surgical treatment or laproscope with infertility are divided into endometriosis group (24 cases) and normal pelvic group (control group 19 cases) . The pathophysiology of patient' s peritoneal fluid, celiac macrophages and endometriotic cells are analyzed by chemotactic test on monocytes, dot blot hybridize, enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay and the level of cytoplasmic [Ca2+]i respectively. Meanwhile, the influence of peritoneal fluid and endometriotic cells to sperm motivity as well as the effects to rat embryo cleavage are evaluated.The monocyte moving distance induced by peritoneal fluid in endometriosis group vs. control is (87.2 +/- 9.4) m vs. (51.9 +/- 3.7) microm (P < 0.01). The count of celiac macrophages (1.47 +/- 0.87) x 10(6)/ml vs. (0.67 +/- 0.73) x 10(6)/ml (P < 0.01), The basic expression level of monocyte chamotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in endometriotic cells is (18.34 +/- 3.95) A. After exposured to IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, the OD of MCP-lmRNA is 56.84 +/- 3.21 A and 41.58 +/- 2.48 A respectively (P < 0.01 ).With the influence between endometriotic focus and microenvironment of peritoneal fluid, the level of cytokines expressed by celiac macrophages and endometriotic focus are enhanced, and it can interfere some process in reproduction.
