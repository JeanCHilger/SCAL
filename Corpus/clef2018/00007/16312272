Incidence of endometriosis in infertile women: clinical and laparoscopic characteristics. The incidence and symptomatology of endometriosis vary according to the different populations.To determine the incidence of endometriosis as well as the clinical and laparoscopic characteristics in infertile women with endometriosis.This study included 68 infertile patients with endometriosis diagnosed by laparoscopy in all of them we analyzed the demographic and clinical characteristics.In 68 out of 197 medical files that were analyzed, endometriosis was reported (34.5%). The average age was 30.3 +/- 3.9 years. Forty patients had primary infertility (58.8%) and 28 (41.29%) secondary infertility. In 34 patients endometriosis (50%) was mild, moderate in 16 (23.5%) and severe in 18 (26.5%). Only one endometriosic foci was found in 25% of the patients and multiple foci in 75% of them. The most common sites in which it was found were the uterosacral ligaments, Douglas pouch and the ovaries. In patients with primary infertility it predominated the medium-high socioeconomic level and in those with secondary infertility the low one. In severe endometriosis the predominant symptom was the moderate or severe dysmenorrhea, while in mild and moderate endometriosis was mild dysmenorrhea (p < 0.007). Six out of 16 patients with severe endometriosis had endometrioma.The endometriosis incidence in infertile women was similar to that reported in literature, as well as age of presentation. It was also observed a direct relationship between endometriosis severity and dysmenorrhea intensity.
