Endoscopic diagnosis and management of ureteral endometriosis. It is estimated that 1% of patients with endometriosis have involvement of the urinary tract, with the bladder being the most common location. Ureteral endometriosis is a rare entity, and the majority of cases are found at exploratory laparotomy for extensive involvement of the pelvic organs. Obstruction of the ureter may be caused by extrinsic or intrinsic disease, with the extrinsic form occurring four times as often. Progressive ureteral obstruction can be insidious in onset and ultimately lead to renal failure. Hormone therapy has had variable success, and open surgery has been the mainstay of treatment. Only one case of ureteral endometriosis, both intrinsic and extrinsic, diagnosed at ureteroscopy has been reported previously. We present a case of ureteral obstruction secondary to isolated intrinsic endometriosis diagnosed at ureteroscopy and treated endoscopically with holmium laser ablation and leuprolide therapy.
