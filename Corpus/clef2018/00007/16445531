Bilateral pleural endometriosis. The patient was a 40-year-old woman with a 1-year history of catamenial chest pain and a recent bilateral hemothorax. She underwent a left thoracotomy for surgical pleurodesis, and a pleural biopsy. Subsequently, she had a hysterectomy in conjunction with an oophorectomy. The pathologic investigation of the pleura revealed an endometrial implant. The postoperative course was uneventful with no recurrence of hemothorax and chest pain during the first 6 months and at the patient's follow-up. This is a very rare case of a patient with thoracic endometriosis presenting with bilateral hemothorax.
