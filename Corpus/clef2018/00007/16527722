Laparoscopic approach to an endometriotic vault fistula causing posthysterectomy "menstruation". Endometriosis is a commonly prevalent disease but can include rare complaints posing a challenge to surgical treatment. We describe an unreported cause of menstruation after hysterectomy, which was revealed as an endometriotic tubo-ovarian mass that fistulated into the vaginal vault. A 37-year-old woman experienced monthly vaginal bleeding after hysterectomy. At laparoscopy a tubo-ovarian endometriotic mass was revealed with a fistula into the vaginal vault. The mass was adherent to the left ureter and the sigmoid colon. Laparoscopic excision of the mass and fistula after ureterolysis and bowel dissection was performed. This case describes an unreported cause of posthysterectomy menstruation. The management outlines the optimal surgical management of laparoscopic techniques combined with vaginal access to achieve complete excision with minimal patient morbidity.
