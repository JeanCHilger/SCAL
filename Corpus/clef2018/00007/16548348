Study on mechanism of Quyujiedu method in treating endometriosis of stasis-toxic syndrome type. To observe the mechanism of Quyujiedu (QYJD, a method for removing stasis and detoxicating) in treating endometriosis of stasis-toxic syndrome type.Clinical study: Sixty patients were randomly divided into two groups, the treated group treated with QYJD and the control group treated with Danazol. The changes of clinical symptoms, physical signs, pregnancy rate, as well as levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and endometrial antibody (EMAb) in them before and after treatment were observed. Experimental study: Sixty rats were established into endometriosis model, and randomly divided into the QYJD treated group, the Danazol treated group for positive control and the untreated group for negative control to observe the expression of Bax.Clinical study showed that in the treated group and the control group, after treatment, dysmenorrhea score were 2.40 +/- 1.85 and 3.47 +/- 2.03, the menoxenia score 1.67 +/- 2.04 and 3.73 +/- 1.72 (P < 0.05), and the pregnancy rate 63.2% and 23.5% respectively, the difference between them was significant (all P < 0.05). Both of the two treatments can rectify immunity, reduce levels of IL-1 and IL-6, and lower the positive rate of EMAb. Experimental study showed that QYJD could improve the expression of Bax in ectopic endometrium, but could not affect the on-side expression of Bax in endometrium and muscle tissue.QYJD is effective in improving the stasis-toxic syndrome of endometriosis, its mechanism related with the regulation of the immune condition and the promotion of cell apoptosis in ectopic endometrium, indicating that QYJD is an effective remedy for endometriosis of stasis-toxic syndrome type.
