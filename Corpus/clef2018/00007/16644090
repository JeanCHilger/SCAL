Decreased lactoferrin levels in peritoneal fluid of women with minimal endometriosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate for the presence of lactoferrin (LTF) in peritoneal fluid (PF) of women with and without endometriosis.Seventy-eight women were studied, including 49 women with endometriosis and, as a reference group, 29 patients with functional follicle ovarian cysts.Lactoferrin levels were detectable in all peritoneal fluid samples. Women with minimal endometriosis had lower PF lactoferrin concentrations compared to both patients with high revised American Fertility Society classification scores and women with follicle ovarian cysts. No significant difference in the peritoneal LTF levels was found between patients with stage II endometriosis, stage III or IV endometriotic disease and women with functional cysts of ovaries.Owing to its antibacterial properties lactoferrin is probably an important defense factor in the peritoneal cavity, however its role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis remains enigmatic.
