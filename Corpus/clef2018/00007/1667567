CA 125 and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in cyst fluid, ascites and serum of patients with ovarian neoplasms. The levels of CA 125 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in tumour cyst fluid, ascites and serum of patients with epithelial ovarian neoplasms were estimated. In addition, the serum concentration of both antigens was evaluated 10 days after operation. Independently of histological type of ovarian tumour, CA 125 and CEA values were significantly higher in cyst and ascitic fluid than in corresponding patients' serum. The higher values of both markers were also found in malignant than benign ovarian cysts. CEA occurred at higher concentrations in mucinous carcinomas whereas CA 125 values were comparable both in mucinous and serous cyst fluid. The levels of these markers in cyst fluid did not correlate with the serum concentrations. The significant individual differences existed in the ability of tumour cells to produce and release both studied antigens. Post-operative CEA levels returned to normal more slow than CA 125 values.
