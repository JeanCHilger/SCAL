Genomic alterations in ectopic and eutopic endometria of women with endometriosis. Ectopic and eutopic endometria of women with endometriosis have been shown to contain genomic alterations. In this study, we sought to identify genomic alterations in both ectopic and eutopic endometria of 5 women with endometriosis and to examine whether the two tissues share any genomic alterations. We also attempted to classify tissue samples based on the alteration profiles.Laser capture microdissection was used to harvest epithelial cells. High-resolution comparative genomic hybridization microarrays were used to identify genomic alterations in eutopic and ectopic endometria from 5 women with endometriosis. The results were validated by real-time RT-PCR and loss of heterozygosity analysis.All 5 patients had genomic alterations in their eutopic and ectopic endometria. The ectopic and eutopic endometria shared a sizable portion of genomic alterations. Cluster analysis of the genomic alteration profile correctly and consistently classified tissue samples from the 5 patients into two groups: peritoneal implants and ovarian cysts.The correct classification of tissue samples into two groups suggests that these two subtypes of endometriosis may have distinct genomic alteration profiles and are thus distinct entities, as previously proposed. The shared alterations are likely the ones that harbor genes responsible for an increased propensity of endometrial debris to implant to the ectopic sites and for early events that lead to the establishment of lesions. Alternatively, these shared alterations may harbor genes that are dysregulated in both eutopic and ectopic endometria. The identified genomic alterations should help to zero in genes involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis in future studies.
