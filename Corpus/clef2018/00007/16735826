Progress with oocyte cryopreservation. This article reviews human oocyte cryopreservation, one of the most stimulating challenges of assisted reproduction technology. Since the first steps in assisted reproduction technology, researchers have pursued this goal, to greatly improve the management of infertility treatments. This present review depicts the present state of research and clinical applications of this methodology.Recent literature focuses on the possible mechanisms of oocyte damage caused by temperature and cryoprotectant injury and forecasts possible technological solutions. Several papers illustrate encouraging results in the increasing clinical application of this procedure.Findings give support to several indications of human female gamete cryostorage. Oocyte cryopreservation might replace embryo freezing. Egg freezing offers an alternative to women at risk of losing their reproductive function, caused by antineoplastic treatments, endometriosis, ovarian surgery or genetic premature ovarian failure. In addition, oocyte storage may contribute to an increase in in-vitro fertilization flexibility. Despite the early disappointing results, recent technical modifications have improved the clinical efficiency greatly, with the birth of several healthy children.
