Surgical scar endometriosis after Cesarean section: a case report. Cutaneous endometriosis is a rare condition.A 37-year-old woman came to our observation 3 years after Cesarean section for a nodule under the scar that became spontaneously painful during menstrual bleeding. Transabdominal ultrasound examination, serum CA125 determination and histopathological analysis of the nodule were performed. Ultrasound revealed the presence of an oval-shaped hypoechogenic neoformation, while the serum CA125 level was slightly increased, and a diagnosis of endometriosis was confirmed by the histopathological analysis of a surgical specimen.This is an interesting case of surgical scar endometriosis, and the etiopathogenetic mechanism of this location may be explained by a dissemination of endometrial tissue during the Cesarean section.
