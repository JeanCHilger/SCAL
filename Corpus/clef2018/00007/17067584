Long-term fracture risk among women with proven endometriosis. To determine whether women with pelvic endometriosis are at increased fracture risk.Historical cohort study.Population-based investigation using the data resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project.From Olmsted County, Minnesota, 987 women with endometriosis that was first surgically visualized or histologically proven in 1970-1989.None, observational study.Follow-up for fractures through complete inpatient and outpatient community medical records.In 17,408 person-years of follow-up, 256 women experienced 449 different fractures. The cumulative incidence after 20 years (30.8%) was not elevated relative to that expected (30.6%). The independent predictors of any fracture included age (hazard ratio [HR] per 10 years: 1.61 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-1.84]), corticosteroid use (HR: 2.78Despite reported adverse effects of treatment on bone density, there was no overall increase in long-term fracture risk in this unselected cohort of women with proven endometriosis.
