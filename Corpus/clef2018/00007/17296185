Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and ovarian endometriosis: correlation between VEGF serum levels, VEGF cellular expression, and pelvic pain. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) serum levels and VEGF and cellular expression were prospectively analyzed in 60 patients (group A consisted of asymptomatic patients or patients presenting mild dysmenorrhea 30 women comprised group B severe dysmenorrhea and/or chronic pelvic pain and/or dyspareunia) who underwent surgery for cystic ovarian endometriosis to asses whether a correlation exists among VEGF serum levels, VEGF cellular expression, and pelvic pain. No differences were found in VEGF serum levels and VEGF cellular expression between both groups. Therefore, we conclude that pain symptoms in ovarian endometriosis are not correlated with VEGF serum levels and VEGF cellular expression.
