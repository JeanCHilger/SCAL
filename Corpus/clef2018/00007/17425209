Ectopic lesions as potential pitfalls in fine needle aspiration cytology: a report of 3 cases derived from the thyroid, endometrium and breast. Ectopic lesions are rarely encountered. Those that are derived from thyroid, breast, endometrium and salivary glands present with palpable masses that can mimic malignancy. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a practical procedure for the differential diagnosis of such lesions but can reveal surprising images for a cytopathologist.Three cases of discrete, ectopic lesions at different locations occurred. Case 1 was a 27-year-old woman. Upon diagnosis of a submandibular mass with a diameter of 1 cm, FNAC was performed. The smears showed crowded thyroid follicular cells comprising papillary clusters. A cytologic diagnosis of papillary thyroid lesion was rendered, Histopathology revealed that this lesion was ectopic thyroid tissue with focal chronic thyroiditis. Case 2 was a 38-year-old woman who presented with a painful mass with a diameter of 2.5 cm in the abdominal wall. The patient had undergone cesarean section 3 years earlier. The case was diagnosed on FNAC as low grade malignancy in which an adenocarcinoma/mesenchymal tumor distinction could not be made. The pathologic examination revealed endometriosis. Case 3 was a 31-year old woman who presented with a palpable nodule in the axillary region with a diameter of 1 cm. The patient had given birth 1 month earlier and was nursing. An FNAC diagnosis of lactation ectopic breast tissue was made. The mass disappeared by the end of lactation.FNAC of ectopic lesions may prove to be a diagnostic pitfall for cytopathologists. A cytopathologist who encounters a cellularpicturefrom a lesion that is outside the normal anatomic location must use a cautious diagnostic approach. Unless there are clear findings, the cytopathologist must refrain from a diagnosis of malignancy.
