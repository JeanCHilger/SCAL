Clinical implication and frequency of the incidental finding of endometriosis during oocyte retrieval. Endometriosis is a clinical disease that is associated with poor outcomes in in vitro fertilization (IVF) programs with a decrease in oocyte retrieval, oocyte quality, implantation and pregnancy rates. When an endometrioma is diagnosed, it is indicated to remove endometrial cysts by laparoscopy or perform an aspiration before the cycle of IVF.To evaluate the effect of endometriosis diagnosed incidentally during oocyte retrieval on the IVF outcome, as well as to establish its frequency.Retrospective analysis of 1,000 files of patients who underwent to oocyte retrieval between January 2002 and March 2005, in the Centro Especializado para la Atenci6n de la Mujer in Mexico City. Of the total procedures tubal factor was the first indication for IVF and male factor was on second place. Only in seven patients of 1,000 oocyte retrievals was detected the presence of endometriosis fluid instead of folicular fluid.The prevalence of endometriosis diagnosed incidentally during oocyte retrieval was 0.7%, and the oocyte quality was 1.55 (regular). The fertilization rate for patients with endometriomas was 45% and the implantation and pregnancy rates were zero per cent while the patients without endometriomas the fertilization rate was 65% with an implantation rate of 18% and the pregnancy rate was 35%.Endometriosis is a disease that must be treated before an IVF cycle in stages III-IV and especially in presence of endometriomas because it could affect negatively IVF outcomes.
