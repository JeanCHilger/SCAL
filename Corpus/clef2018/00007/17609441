Uterine artery embolization for symptomatic adenomyosis with or without uterine leiomyomas with the use of calibrated tris-acryl gelatin microspheres: midterm clinical and MR imaging follow-up. To evaluate clinical and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging results after uterine artery embolization (UAE) in women with symptomatic adenomyosis with or without uterine leiomyomas.Thirty-eight women with symptomatic adenomyosis with or without uterine leiomyomas were treated with UAE with calibrated tris-acryl gelatin microspheres. Based on MR findings, women were categorized as having pure adenomyosis (group A n = 15), adenomyosis dominance with fibroid tumors (group BHeavy menstrual bleeding, pain, and bulk-related symptoms at last follow-up at a median of 16.5 months (range, 3-38 months) were compared with baseline symptoms. With follow-up MR imaging at a median of 12 months (range, 3-36 months), changes in uterine volume, leiomyoma volume, junctional zone thickness, and contrast enhancement of adenomyosis were assessed. After embolization, adenomyosis infarction could be depicted on contrast medium-enhanced MR in 44.1% of cases. Median reductions of uterine volume, fibroid tumor volume, and junctional zone thickness were 44.8%, 77.1%, and 23.9%, respectively. In group A, three patients needed additional surgery after UAE, in addition to two in group B and one in group C. In the remaining 32 patients, except for one patient in group C, all preexisting symptoms (eg, bleeding, pain, bulk-related symptoms) improved or resolved after UAE. Overall, 84.2% of women were satisfied with the results of UAE.In this study, midterm results (at a median of 16.5 months) showed that UAE in symptomatic adenomyosis with or without uterine leiomyomas is effective. Hysterectomy was avoided in the vast majority of patients. MR imaging showed reduction of uterine volume and junctional zone thickness.
