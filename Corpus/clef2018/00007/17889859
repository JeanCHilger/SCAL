Increased activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) in isolated peritoneal macrophages of patients with endometriosis. Endometriosis is characterized by pelvic inflammation that shows an increased number of activated peritoneal macrophages and their secreted products such as cytokines, growth factors, and angiogenic factors. Our results show that activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), a pro-inflammatory transcription factor, is statistically significantly increased in peritoneal macrophages from patients with endometriosis when compared with controls.
