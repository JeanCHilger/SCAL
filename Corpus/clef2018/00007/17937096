Long-term personalized GnRH agonist therapy without estrogen supplementation for recurrent endometriotic catamenial pneumothorax--case report. A patient with diaphragmatic endometriosis who showed immediate relapse following radical thoracoscopic surgery received personalized GnRH agonist (GnRHa) therapy. GnRHa depots were subcutaneously injected by modulating injection intervals according to serum estradiol and LH levels in order to maintain long-term amenorrhea without any adverse effects. A leuprolide acetate depot was injected 24 times for 34 months. Therefore, so far, 1.88 mg of leuprolide acetate depot have been injected every seven weeks to achieve a stable endocrine condition with 15-30 pg/ml serum estradiol, 3-10 IU/l serum LH, and 7-15 IU/lI serum FSH.
