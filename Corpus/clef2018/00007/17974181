Endometriosis and the role of the integrins in the pathogenesis of the endometriosis. The endometriosis is gynecological disease what is characterized with the presence of endometrial lesions are composed of endometrial epithelial and stromal cells outside of the uterus. There are many theories for the development of the disease endometriosis. The most widely accepted theory is the theory what is postulated the endometriosis is a result of retrograde menstruation. The essential stage in the process of development of endometrial lesions is the process of adhesion of endometrial cells on the peritoneal surface and on the organs, are situated in the peritoneal cavity. The adhesion molecules (integrins) have the most essential role in this first stage. The integrins are cell surface receptors with glycoprotein structure. They have part in process of adhesion of the endometrial cells to the proteins from EC matrix outside the uterus. The integrins have part like signal molecules in the processes of proliferation and invasion of endometrial implants. They are very essential molecules what influence the viability of endometrial implants as well as the angiogenesis in the new forming endometrial implants. Improvement of the studies, related to the roles of the integrins in the pathogenesis of endometriosis would be give new possibilities to search more effective methods for therapy of the endometriosis.
