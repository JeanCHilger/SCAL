Expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor in ovarian endometriotic cysts and their relationship with angiogenesis. To investigate the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in ovarian endometriotic cysts and assess their relation with angiogenesis.Experimental clinical study.University hospital.Fifty patients with ovarian endometriotic cysts.Surgical excision of 50 ovarian endometriotic cysts.Microvessel density and the expression of Cox-2 and VEGF were analyzed immunohistochemically.Cyclooxygenase-2 immunoreactivity was mainly cytoplasmic in glandular epithelial cells in all of the ovarian endometriotic cysts, with low expression in 12 cases (24%), moderate expression in 21 (42%), and high expression in 17 (34%). Vascular endothelial growth factor immunoreactivity was mainly cytoplasmic in stromal cells in 46 (92%) of the ovarian endometriotic cysts, with low expression in 12 cases (24%), moderate expression in 18 (36%), and high expression in 16 (32%). No immunoreactivity was present in 4 cases (8%). Both Cox-2 (r = 0.728) and VEGF (r = 0.670) were closely, statistically significantly related with microvessel density in ovarian endometriotic cysts. Cyclooxygenase-2 and VEGF also were highly statistically significantly correlated (r = 0.777) with each other.We observed Cox-2 expression mostly in glandular epithelial cells of ovarian endometriotic cysts, whereas VEGF expression was observed mainly in stromal cells. Cyclooxygenase-2 and VEGF were closely correlated with each other, and both of them appear to play a role in the angiogenesis of ovarian endometriosis.
