The G(-2518)A polymorphism of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and its serum and peritoneal fluid levels in Korean women with endometriosis. To investigate the associations between endometriosis and the G(-2518)A polymorphism of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and serum and peritoneal fluid MCP-1 levels in Korean women.The G(-2518)A polymorphism of MCP-1 was analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism in 105 women with and in 101 women without endometriosis. Serum and peritoneal fluid MCP-1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The genotype frequencies of the MCP-1 G (-2518)A polymorphism were GG 36.9%, AG 52.9%, and AA 10.2%. MCP-1 genotype frequencies and serum and peritoneal fluid MCP-1 levels were similar in those with or without endometriosis and were not dependent on disease stage. A significant correlation was found between serum and peritoneal fluid levels of MCP-1. However, no differences were found between MCP-1 genotypes in terms of serum and peritoneal fluid MCP-1 levels.Serum and peritoneal fluid MCP-1 levels and the G (-2518)A MCP-1 polymorphism were found not to be associated with endometriosis in Korean women.
