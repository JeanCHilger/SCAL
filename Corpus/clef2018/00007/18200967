Monocyte activity after stimulation by serum of women with endometriosis. Impairments of immune system play an important role in the development and pathogenesis of endometriosis. In affected women peritoneal macrophages are excessively activated, which is visible in an increased synthesis and release of macrophage-derived cytokines and growth factors. Monocytes are precursors of those cells in peripheral blood. The aim of the study was to evaluate the activity of monocyte from a healthy person, after stimulation by serum of women with endometriosis in cell culture conditions. The indicator of monocyte activity was the concentration of neopterin (NPT), produced by those cells.Twenty nine women with endometriosis (mean age: 28.7+/-4.5 years) were included into this study. Among them were 18 women with moderate endometriosis (I and II stages according to AFS) and 11 women with advanced stages of the disease (III and IV stages according to AFS). Reference group consisted of fifteen healthy women (mean age: 27.4+/-5.3 years), with excluded endometriosis and other pathological disorders within the pelvis. Monocytes used in the study were isolated from peripheral blood of a healthy male and serum of women with endometriosis and control group. Monocytes were cultured in attendance of 15% and 30% serum of studied women. The concentration of NPT in the supernatants of culture was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent ELISA assay.The serum of women with endometriosis causes an increased concentration of NPT in supernatants, when comparing with serum of healthy women (p<0. 0001). The highest concentration was observed after stimulation by serum of women with advanced endometriosis.Serum of women with endometriosis can have an effect on monocyte activity, which is displayed in the increased synthesis and secreted of NPT.
