Uterine artery embolisation for symptomatic adenomyosis--mid-term results. To evaluate the role of uterine artery embolisation (UAE) in the treatment of adenomyosis.27 women with symptomatic adenomyosis diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) underwent UAE between 1998 and 2004. Clinical evaluation using a standardised questionnaire was made at regular intervals after embolisation to assess patient outcome.The diagnosis of adenomyosis was confirmed histologically by transvaginal biopsy in 5 women. There were 14 women with associated uterine fibroids. Diffuse adenomyosis was identified in 18 women. A focal adenomyoma was present in another 8 women. In 1 patient adenomyosis was not classified. All patients except one underwent bilateral uterine artery embolisation. There was an initial favourable clinical response, with improvement of menorrhagia in 79% (13/16) of patients at 12 months. Follow-up data was available on a total of 14 patients at 2 and 3 years after embolisation. 45.5% (5/11) reported a deterioration in menorrhagia symptoms at 2 years.UAE for symptomatic adenomyosis is effective in the short-term but there is a high rate of recurrence of clinical symptoms 2 year following treatment.
