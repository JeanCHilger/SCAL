YAG laser contact therapy of ovarian endometriosis under laparoscopy. Thirty-six patients with ovarian endometriosis were treated with Nd:YAG laser contact irradiation under laparoscopic control. Indications for laparoscopy were infertility (n = 20) and dysmenorrhea (n = 16). The laparoscopic procedures so far undertaken in our clinic include: Aspiration of chocolate cyst, removal of ovarian endometriosis, adhesion-lysis, uterine nerve ablation, coagulation of peritoneal endometriosis and irrigation. No complications were seen. After undergoing this procedure, eight of 20 patients achieved pregnancy and 15 of 16 patients obtained pain relief. Serum CA125 levels were significantly decreased postoperatively. We confirmed that contact irradiation with a cone-shaped sapphire probe provides adequate incision and lysis at lower power levels, and that this method is an effective treatment for ovarian endometriosis.
