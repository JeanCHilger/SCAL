Women with undiagnosed colorectal adenocarcinomas presenting with ovarian metastases: clinicopathologic features and comparison with women having known colorectal adenocarcinomas and ovarian involvement. Recognition of an ovarian tumor as a metastasis from an undiagnosed primary gastrointestinal tract carcinoma can be difficult when specific symptoms referable to the primary tumor are lacking and the tumor simulates a primary ovarian neoplasm grossly and microscopically. Ovarian metastases of colorectal adenocarcinomas, in particular, continue to pose diagnostic challenges both clinically and pathologically. Clinicopathologic features of 20 cases of ovarian metastases from undiagnosed colorectal adenocarcinomas (U-CRAs) were compared with those of 22 cases having metastases from known colorectal adenocarcinomas (K-CRAs). Women with ovarian metastases from U-CRAs were significantly younger (mean age, 48 years median, 47 years) than those with ovarian metastases from K-CRAs (mean, 61 years
