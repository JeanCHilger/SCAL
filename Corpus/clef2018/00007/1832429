Prostaglandins in peritoneal fluid of women with minimal and mild endometriosis. Peritoneal fluid from 52 women with minimal and mild endometriosis was aspirated at laparoscopy and PGs were analyzed. Peritoneal lesions were classified into black, red and white lesions and peritoneal pockets, and were excised and pathological examination performed. Patients were classified into the black lesion group (n = 17) and the red lesion group (n = 35) according to the main colour of the lesions. 1. Endometrial gland and stroma were found in 78% of black lesions, 53% of red lesions, 60% of white lesions and 62% of peritoneal pockets. Infiltration of lymphocytes was found in 74% of black lesions, 83% of red lesions, 80% of white lesions and 77% of peritoneal pockets. 2. The fluid volume of the red lesions group was significantly higher than that of the control group (p less than 0.01). But the fluid volume of the black lesions group was insignificant as compared with that of the control group. 3. The PGE2 and PGF2 alpha concentrations in fluid from the red lesion group were significantly higher than not only the control group (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.05) but also the black lesion group (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05). Only the PGE2 concentration in fluid from the black lesion group was significantly higher than that of the control group (p less than 0.001). 4. In the red lesion group which had no infertility factors without endometriosis, 20 of 25 patients achieved pregnancy (80%) in a one-year follow up. This was significantly higher than in the black lesions group (44%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
