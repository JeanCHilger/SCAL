Investigation of tubal infertility by radionuclide migration. Investigation of the tubal factor in infertility is limited to an assessment of anatomical structure and tubal patency. No test of ascendant tubal function is currently available. The migration of radionuclide (99mTc-labelled human albumin microspheres) through the genital tract in 96 infertile women was compared with pelvic findings at laparoscopy and chromopertubation. The radionuclide test correlated with laparoscopy in the diagnosis of patency or blockage in 83 cases (86%). In nine patients, where 'blockage' was diagnosed on the radionuclide test but patency found at laparoscopy, a higher prevalence of pelvic abnormality was found, compared to the 78 patients where both tests demonstrated patency (P less than 0.02). The radionuclide test may facilitate detection of diseased but patent tubes and, as an adjunct to laparoscopy and chromopertubation, may provide useful information about tubal function.
