Serum CA-125 levels in the diagnosis and management of endometriosis. The value of CA-125 for the diagnosis and management of endometriosis (EN) was investigated by assaying the marker in the serum and peritoneal fluid (PF) from patients with the disease in comparison with control subjects. Of women who underwent 270 consecutive laparoscopies, 81 with various stages of EN (18 stage I, 13 stage II, 35 stage III and 15 stage IV) and 38 with normal pelvic findings were studied. CA-125 serum values increased progressively in relation to the severity of the disease. The levels in stages III and IV EN were significantly higher (P less than .01) than in stages I and II or control patients. The latter two groups did not differ from each other. High CA-125 PF values were found in all the patients investigated. Twenty-two patients with EN were treated with a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist for six months before second-look laparoscopy or laparotomy. CA-125 values decreased significantly after one month of medical treatment and remained unchanged during the course of therapy. No significant relationship was found in the outcome after therapy.
