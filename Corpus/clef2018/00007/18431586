Laparoscopy-assisted cystectomy for large adnexal cysts. To evaluate the feasibility and surgical outcome of laparoscopy-assisted surgery for large adnexal cysts.From January 1998 to October 2007, 46 women underwent laparoscopy-assisted surgery for large adnexal cysts whose maximum diameter were between 10 and 20 cm, radiologic and laboratory features suggestive of benign disease. All the patients had a pre-operative ultrasound with or without computed tomography and CA-125 assessment. Patients' demographics, clinical and ultrasound features, CA-125 values, surgical procedures, operative and post-operative complications, estimated amount of blood loss (EBL), operative time, conversion to laparotomy and the pathological findings were recorded.Fourty-six consecutive patients underwent laparoscopy-assisted surgery over 9 years. The mean and range of the patients' age and body mass index were 34.1 +/- 6.3 and (21-45) years and 27.4 +/- 5.9 and (22-40), respectively. In all the patients, except one with borderline ovarian tumor, laparoscopy-assisted surgery was successful. There were no operative or post-operative complications. The mean and range of the operative time, EBL and hospital stay were 48.4 +/- 7.3 and (35-65) min, 55.0 +/- 28.9 and (25-150) mL, 1.49 +/- 0.50 and (1-3) days, respectively. The mean and range of the extracorporeal cystectomy time were 10.2 +/- 2.7 and (8-14) min. The surgical procedures performed were: ovarian and paraovarian cystectomy (n = 45), unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic-paraaortic lymphadenectomy and omentectomy (n = 1). Pathologic findings included serous cystadenoma (n = 26), mucinous cystadenoma (n = 7), dermoid (n = 6), endometriosis (n = 6), and borderline ovarian tumor (n = 1).Laparoscopy-assisted surgery is feasible and safe for women with large benign adnexal cysts and result s in a short surgery time.
