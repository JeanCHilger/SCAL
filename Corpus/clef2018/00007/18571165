Effectiveness of ultrasound-guided aspiration and sclerotherapy with 95% ethanol for treatment of recurrent ovarian endometriomas. To evaluate the effectiveness of transvaginal ultrasound aspiration and ethanol sclerotherapy in patients with recurrent ovarian endometriomas.Retrospective study.Teaching hospital affiliated with Chang Gung University, Taipei.Patients (n = 108) with recurrent ovarian endometriomas >or=3 cm.Preoperative evaluation of previous pathology, midcycle serum CA-125 level, and color Doppler ultrasonography to exclude possibility of malignancies. After aspiration, sclerotherapy with 95% ethanol irrigation of the cystic cavity was performed (group 1, n = 78, 0-10 minutes of retention group 2, n = 30, ethanol left in situ [retention]).Ultrasonography was performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to determine persistence and size of cysts and the number of antral follicles. Pelvic pain score was also determined at those time points.The 1-year recurrence rate for group 2 patients was significantly lower than for group 1 patients (13.3% vs. 32.1%). Antral follicle count was increased and pain score was decreased in both groups to a similar level. No significant change in CA-125 was observed.Ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy with 95% ethanol is an effective therapy for ovarian endometriomas. Retention of ethanol is more effective than irrigation only.
