Effect of laparoscopic surgery on the immune function of patients with endometriosis. To investigate the effect of laparoscopic surgery on the immune function of patients with endometriosis.Blood samples were obtained from 36 patients undergoing laparoscopy for endometriosis before and 1 day and 3 days after the operation. Peripheral blood T-cell subsets CD3, CD4, and CD8 were determined with flow cytometry, the levels of IgM, IgG, IgA, Complement (C)3, C4, C-reactive protein and (CRP) were detected with turbidimetry, and the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).No significant variation were found in the T-cell subsets, IgM, IgA, C4 after the operation (P>0.05). The levels of IgG and C3 1 day after the operation were significantly lower than the preoperative levels (P<0.05) and nearly recovered the preoperative level 3 days after operation. Serum concentration of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CRP 1 day after the operation were significantly higher than the preoperative levels (P<0.01) and decreased 3 days after the operation.The immune function of patients with endometriosis is mildly affected by laparoscopic surgery and recover rapidly, which may be one of the reasons for quick recovery of patients after laparoscopy for endometriosis.
