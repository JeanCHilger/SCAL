Intestinal endometriosis: a case report. Endometriosis is seldom of interest to the general surgeon, since it is generally an exclusively gynaecological condition. Atypical locations, however, do fall within the domain of general surgery. Extra-gynaecological endometriosis denotes an ectopic localization of functional endometrial tissue, a finding whose incidence is increasing due to the increasingly widespread use of laparoscopic procedures in chronic abdominal pain and infertility. We report our experience with complete laparoscopic management of deep pelvic endometriosis with isolated bowel involvement. In those patients without a past history of this condition, extragonadal endometriosis is rarely diagnosed preoperatively because the disease may mimic other abdominal pathologies. An accurate diagnosis can be provided by laparoscopy and especially by an intraoperative histopathological examination. Operative laparoscopy is a safe and effective method for treating intestinal endometriosis, significantly improves the patient's quality of life, is followed by resolution of the gynaecological and digestive symptoms and can enhance fertility.
