Endometriosis of the caecum and ileo-caecal valve. A case report and review of the literature. Endometriosis is a non-cancerous disorder characterised by development of endometrial epithelium outside the uterus, in which involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is most common. The most frequent site is the rectosigmoid colon (72%), whereas the caecum is involved in 4% of cases. Endometriosis may present with abdominal pain, constipation, and sometimes intestinal bleeding. The treatment of the disease is surgical when medical therapy fails and in cases of surgical urgency. We report the case of a patient with bowel obstruction due endometriosis of the caecum and ileo-caecal valve in association with metrorrhagia. A segmentectomy of the right colon was performed. Since endometriosis is more frequent on the left side of the pelvis probably due to regurgitated endometrial cells, the case observed is not very frequent and is worth reporting.
