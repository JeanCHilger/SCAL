Epigastric pain relating to menses can be a symptom of bowel endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common affliction that may affect the intestinal tract. The objective of this case report was to describe an unusual clinical presentation of this form of the disease.The patient was a 35-year-old woman with epigastric pain that only occurred during menstruation, who had a history of bladder endometriosis. Endoscopy of the upper digestive tract showed normal results. Transvaginal ultrasound and nuclear magnetic resonance of the pelvis showed a lesion involving the ileocecal junction and appendix, measuring 30 x 22/x/13/mm, that was suggestive of endometriosis. The patient underwent laparoscopic resection of the bowel segment affected by the disease, followed by anastomosis of the ileum and ascending colon for immediate restoration of intestinal transit. Histological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of endometriosis.In young women, recurrent epigastric pain should be evaluated with regard to its relationship to menstruation, particularly if there is a history of endometriosis, since this may be a clinical sign that the disease is affecting the intestinal transit.
