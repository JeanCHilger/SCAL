Smooth muscle metaplasia and innervation in interstitium of endometriotic lesions related to pain. To investigate the pathogenesis of endometriotic pain.Retrospective nonrandomized immunohistochemical study.A university hospital, Department of Gynecology.Twenty human endometriotic specimens were selected from different lesions including ovarian endometrioma, peritoneal lesion, and deep infiltrating lesion. Premenopausal women with histologically diagnosed endometriosis were selected (mean age 39 years range, 25-53 years). The chief complaint was dysmenorrhea, dyschezia, and dyspareunia. A rat endometriosis model was induced in 10 SLC-Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old) by surgical autotransplantation of the uterus.Immunohistochemical staining of endometriotic specimens for alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and nerve growth factor (NGF) expression.Comparison of the immunoreactive staining of ASMA, NCAM, and NGF expression in human endometriosis and a rat endometriosis model.Morphological analysis revealed thick interstitium in both human and rat endometriotic lesions. The major components of fibrotic interstitium are smooth muscle cells, stained by anti-ASMA antibody, and nerve cells, stained by anti-NCAM antibody. Inflammatory cells are also present (e.g., macrophages and lymphocytes) as revealed by anti-NGF antibody staining.These results suggest that the contraction of smooth muscle cells and the hyperalgia derived from innervation in the interstitial area is related to pain in endometriosis.
