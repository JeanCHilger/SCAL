Proteomics technologies in endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common disorder that is associated with infertility and pelvic pain. Diagnosis is based on the visualization of endometriotic lesions during surgery as no reliable serum marker is currently available. The etiology of endometriosis is largely unknown. Over the last 20 years, several proteomics technologies have been used to research novel proteins with a potential etiological role in endometriosis, and to identify candidate serum markers for this condition. While some molecules identified by proteomics technologies may have a relevant role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, the research of potential serum markers for this condition is still far from any clinical application. This review summarizes the state of the art and potential applications of proteomics in endometriosis research.
