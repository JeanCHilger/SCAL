Folliculogenesis and ovulation in infertile women with mild endometriosis. Twenty-one infertile women with laparoscopically documented minimal-mild endometriosis (AFS score 2-10) were studied during 27 cycles (six women had two cycles each) to investigate follicular development and ovulation. Of the 27 cycles studies, 24 (89%) appeared to be endocrinologically normal and ovulatory. Luteinized unruptured follicle (LUF) occurred in only one cycle (4%). One further patient exhibited abnormal endocrinology with evidence of premature ovulation over two (8%) consecutive cycles. This study indicates that the majority of women with minimal-mild endometriosis have endocrinologically normal menstrual cycles and that luteinized unruptured follicles occur infrequently.
