MR imaging features of deep pelvic endometriosis: correlation with laparoscopy. Deep pelvic endometriosis is an invalidating disorder affecting the retrocervical region, rectosigmoid colon and urinary bladder generally requiring surgical management. MRI is the preoperative imaging modality of choice. The purpose of this paper is to describe the MR imaging features of deep pelvic endometriosis with laparoscopic correlation.Thirty-five patients with clinical suspicion of deep pelvic endometriosis underwent pelvic MRI. Results of MRI, including morphological and signal characteristics features of the lesions were compared to laparoscopic fidings.Laparoscopy detected lesions of deep pelvic endometriosis of the uterosacral ligaments (n=10), torus uterinum (n=9), rectosigmoid (n=11), Douglas pouch (n=9), recto-vaginal septum (n=6), bladder (n=4) and posterior vaginal cul-de-sac (n=2). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of MRI were assessed for each localization.MRI allows diagnosis of deep pelvic endometriosis of the bladder, rectosigmoid and Douglas pouch and with lower sensitivity for lesions of the uterosacral ligaments, posterior vaginal cul-de-sac and rectovaginal septum.
