The specific features of the expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin in adenomyosis. The expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium was studied in 40 patients with adenomyosis and 12 without this condition, by using an immunohistochemical test and enzyme immunoassay. There was increased expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium in adenomyosis. The cytoplasmic expression of beta-catenin was also revealed in the smooth muscle cells surrounding the foci of adenomyosis. The E-cadherin concentration measured by enzyme immunoassay was significantly higher in the endometrium and myometrium of patients with adenomyosis than in the controls. There was a higher expression of this protein with a longer duration of the disease. Thus, the formation of ectopic foci in adenomyosis may be argued to be unassociated with the decreased adhesion of epithelial cells. On the contrary, the authors documented the enhanced adhesion of epithelial cells in the ectopic foci, which was likely to be adaptive due to the altered microcirculation.
