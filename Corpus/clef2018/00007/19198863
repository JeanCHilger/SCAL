Synchronous diagnosis of multiple tumours in a postmenopausal woman. We report an unusual case of a postmenopausal woman that was diagnosed with multiple tumours derived from different embryogenic tissues. She presented with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. Clinical examination revealed a large pelvic mass, tender on palpation. Serum CA-125 level was elevated at 8,985 kU/l (normal range 0-35). A CT scan showed a malignant-appearing right ovarian mass with a peritoneal nodule, small amount of free fluid in the pelvis and evidence of a colonic intussusception. The patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-ophorectomy, partial omentectomy and right hemicolectomy with side-to-side anastomosis. Histopathology showed a Grade 3 endometrial adenocarcinoma. Both ovaries were completely replaced by partially necrotic poorly differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Small deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma were seen within the omentum. Sections from the retroperitoneal mass showed a low-grade liposarcoma. A large polypoid tumour within the right colon was a tubulo-villous adenoma.
