Papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum following endometrial cancer. Two cases of advanced papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum occurred after hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for endometrial carcinoma. Careful resectioning of the original ovarian specimens failed to demonstrate a previously undiagnosed ovarian malignancy. In both cases, CA 125 levels, which were being followed routinely because of the previous endometrial cancer, rose before the diagnosis of peritoneal carcinoma and corresponded closely to patient response to therapy.
