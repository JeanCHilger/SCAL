Analysis of the transforming growth factor beta1 gene -509 C/T polymorphism in patients with advanced-stage endometriosis. To investigate whether the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) gene -509 C/T polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to advanced-stage endometriosis.Case-control study.University department of obstetrics and gynecology.Women with advanced-stage endometriosis (n = 485) and without endometriosis (n = 352).Genotyping by real-time polymerase chain reaction using a Taqman assay.Genotype distribution and allele frequency of the -509 C/T polymorphism in the TGF-beta1 gene.The genotype distribution of the TGF-beta1 gene -509 C/T polymorphism in the endometriosis group was not different from that of the control group (CC/CT/TT rates were 29.3%/48.2%/22.5% and 27.3%/50.3%/22.4% for the endometriosis and control groups, respectively). Further subgroup analyses according to the stage of endometriosis or bilaterality of ovarian endometrioma also revealed no significant differences in the genotype distribution between each of the subgroups and the control group.These results suggest that the TGF-beta1 -509 C/T polymorphism may not be associated with an increased risk for advanced-stage endometriosis.
