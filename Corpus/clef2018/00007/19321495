Dendritic cell populations in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. Immune alterations may be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of endometriosis. Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen presenting cells that are highly involved in the initiation of the immune response. The aim of this study was to investigate DC populations in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis compared with controls.Hysterectomy samples were obtained from premenopausal women with (n = 33) and without (n = 28) endometriosis. In addition, paired peritoneal endometriotic lesions and uterine curettings were collected from 32 women with endometriosis. Specimen sections were stained immunohistochemically using antibodies for monoclonal mouse antibodies directed against human CD1a and CD83, which are specific for immature and mature DCs, respectively.The mean density of endometrial CD1a+ DCs in the basal layer was significantly increased in women with endometriosis compared with controls during the proliferative phase only (P = 0.001). There was a highly significant decrease in the density of endometrial CD83+ DCs in women with endometriosis compared with controls in both layers of the endometrium across all phases of the menstrual cycle (P = 0.001). The density of CD1a+ DCs was significantly increased in peritoneal endometriotic lesions (P = 0.003) and in the surrounding peritoneum (P = 0.001) compared with paired uterine curettings and peritoneum distant from the lesion.Both CD1a+ and CD83+ DC populations were altered in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis compared with controls. Alterations in these cells, which play a crucial role in the coordination of the immune response, may be involved in pain generation and the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
