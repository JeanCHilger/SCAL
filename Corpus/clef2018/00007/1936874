Value of the tumor markers CA 125, Ca 19-9, CA 15-3 and CEA in endometriosis. CA 125, CA 19-9, CA 15-3 and CEA were measured in 42 patients with histologically verified endometriosis, who had been treated for six months by the LHRH-analogue buserelin (900 mcg/d intranasally). Before therapy, for all of the markers tested the sensitivity was as follows: CA 125 49%, CA 19-9 19%, CA 15-3 19% and CEA 0%. Pretherapeutically the correlation coefficient between CA 125 and the AFS stages was r = 0.40, indicating no significant relation. Following therapy the correlation between the tested glycoproteins and the AFS stages was less indicative. Only CA 125 showed a significant decrease during treatment (p less than 0.05), which paralleled the therapeutic hypo-oestrogenism. According to our results measurement of CA 125, CA 19-9, CA 15-3 and CEA is not sufficient to replace surgical procedures of monitoring endometriosis. The significant reduction of CA 125 apparently represents loss of ovarian function rather than regression of the disease.
