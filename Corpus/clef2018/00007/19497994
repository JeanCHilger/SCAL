Disrupted cell cycle control in cultured endometrial cells from patients with endometriosis harboring the progesterone receptor polymorphism PROGINS. Presently, little is understood about how endometriosis is established or maintained, or how genetic factors can predispose women to the disease. Because of the crucial role that the progesterone receptor polymorphism PROGINS plays in predisposing women to the development of endometriosis, we hypothesized that this variant may influence critical steps during endometrial cell metabolism that are involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Eutopic endometria were collected from three sources: women with endometriosis who had a single PROGINS allele (from the progesterone receptor gene) women with endometriosis who had the wild-type progesterone receptor allele
