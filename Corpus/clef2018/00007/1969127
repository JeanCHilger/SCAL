Cisplatin nephrotoxicity: effects on fractional excretion of sodium and enzymuria. The effects (in five therapeutic cycles) of Cisplatin on urinary enzyme excretion (specific markers of tubular damage), fractional excretion of sodium, fractional reabsorption of phosphate, serum Creatinine and creatinine Clearance were assessed in 17 female patients with ovarian carcinoma. An immediate reduction of sodium fractional excretion was observed: this appears a more sensible Cisplatin-nephrotoxicity marker than serum Creatinine and creatinine Clearance. No significant variations were noted in fractional reabsorption of phosphate or urinary Lysozyme and Beta-2-microglobulin but there was a significant increase of other urinary enzymes, confirming the potential nephrotoxicity of DDP treatment.
