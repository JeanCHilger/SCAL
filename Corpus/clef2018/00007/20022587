Early menstrual characteristics associated with subsequent diagnosis of endometriosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between early menstrual characteristics, before symptom onset, and later diagnosis of endometriosis.This was a case-control study of 268 Australian women with surgically confirmed moderate-to-severe endometriosis (cases) and 244 women without endometriosis (controls). Early menstrual cycle characteristics, before age at symptom onset, were analyzed.Menarche after age 14 years was strongly and inversely associated with endometriosis (odds ratio, 0.3 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.6). A history of dysmenorrhea was associated with subsequent endometriosis (odds ratio, 2.6There is a decreased risk of endometriosis with late age at menarche and an increased risk in women who report an early history of dysmenorrhea.
