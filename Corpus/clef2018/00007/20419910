Neutral mucosubstances as a prognostic indicator in serous and endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary. A morphometrical analysis of saliva-periodic acid-Schiff stain. Forty-four serous and 17 endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary were classified on hematoxylin-eosin stained tissue sections using the criteria of World Health Organization (WHO). The amount of saliva-periodic acid-Schiff (SPAS) staining positivity, indicating presence of neutral mucosubstances, was quantitated morphometrically and compared with survival of the patients. The 5-year survival of patients who had SPAS positive serous carcinoma was 36% whereas that of patients with SPAS negative serous carcinomas was only 7%. Among the patients who had endometrioid carcinoma showing SPAS positivity over the median, the 5-year survival was 47%. All patients with SPAS positivity less than the median had died in 3 years after the diagnosis. The differences in survivals were statistically significant (P < 0.001). This study shows that neutral mucosubstances as quantitated morphometrically is a good prognostic indicator of serous and endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary.
