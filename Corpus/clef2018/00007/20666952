Genetic contribution of the interferon gamma dinucleotide-repeat polymorphism in South Indian women with endometriosis. To investigate whether the interferon-gamma (IFNG) gene dinucleotide (CA)-repeat polymorphism is responsible in part for genetic susceptibility to endometriosis in South Indian women.Following extraction of genomic DNA, genotyping of interferon-gamma CA-repeat polymorphism was performed using genescan technology.The global IFNG allele frequencies in all patients with endometriosis were significantly different from those in the control women (chi(2) = 37.062 6 degrees of freedomThese results suggest that the IFNG gene CA-repeat polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to endometriosis in South Indian women.
