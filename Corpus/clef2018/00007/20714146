PINCH protein expression in normal endometrium, atypical endometrial hyperplasia and endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. Particularly interesting new cysteine-histidine rich protein (PINCH), as an adapter protein of the LIM family for signal transduction in the integrin and growth factor pathway, is upregulated in the stroma of several common types of cancers and involved in promoting tumor progression. In the present study, we examined PINCH expression in normal endometrium, atypical endometrial hyperplasia and endometrioid carcinoma, and further studied the relationships of PINCH expression with clinicopathological variables in cancer patients.PINCH expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 23 normal endometrial samples, 18 atypical endometrial hyperplasias and 48 endometrioid endometrial carcinomas.The PINCH expression in the stroma of cancer (71%) was significantly increased compared to either normal endometrium (17%, p < 0.0001) or atypical hyperplasia (39%, p = 0.017), along with 9 cancers that had stronger PINCH expressions at the invasive margin of the cancers compared to the inner cancers. PINCH expression in cancer was higher in the patients with hypertension (p = 0.041) and estrogen exposure time >30 years (p = 0.021). On the other hand, PINCH expression was not related to menopausal status, gravid status, blood sugar/lipid, family background of cancer, histological grade, myometrial invasion, cervical involvement, lymph nodal metastases, growth pattern, estrogen and progestogen receptors (p > 0.05). conclusion: The results suggest that PINCH seems to play a role, presently unknown, in the tumorigenesis and development of endometrial cancer that merits further study.
