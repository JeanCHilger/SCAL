High frequency microsatellite instability has a prognostic value in endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma, but only in FIGO stage 1 cases. to analyze the prognostic value of microsatellite instability (MSI) in a population-based study of FIGO stage 1-4 endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas.survival analysis in 273 patients of MSI status and clinico-pathologic features. Using a highly sensitive pentaplex polymerase chain reaction to establish MSI status, cases were divided into microsatellite stable (MSS), MSI-low (MSI-L, 1 marker positive) and MSI-high (MSI-H, 2-5 markers positive).after 61 months median follow-up (1-209), 34 (12.5%) of the patients developed metastases but only 6.4% of the FIGO 1. MSI (especially as MSI-H vs. MSS/MSI-Lcombined) was prognostic in FIGO 1 but not in FIGO 2-4. The 5 and 10 year recurrence-free survival rates were 98% and 95% in the MSS/MSI-L vs. 85% and 73% in the MSI-H patients (p=0.005).MSI-H status assessed by pentaplex polymerase chain reaction is an indicator of poor prognosis in FIGO 1, but not in FIGO 2-4 endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas.
