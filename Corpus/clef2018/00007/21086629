The morphological and immunohiochemical features of foci of adenomyosis: in its concurrence with endometrial adenocarcinoma. The purpose of the investigation was to study the morphological variants and molecular changes of the endothelial component of adenomyosis (AM) concurrent with endometrial adenocarcinoma (EAC). Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to ApoCas, Cl 2, 3, and 5, Ki-7, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, E-cadherin, COX-2, EGFR, and VEGF were used as primary antibodies. The AM foci displayed the following types of epithelial changes: the epithelium corresponding to the proliferation stage epithelial hyperplasia with and without atypia
