Association between endometriosis and polymorphisms in insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and IGF-I receptor genes in Korean women. To evaluate the relationship between endometriosis and polymorphisms in insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and IGF-I receptor genes.In a case-control study, 128 women with endometriosis and 108 control women were recruited at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Seoul National University Hospital. Determinations of -969(CA) block, -603A>T, and -553T>C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s in the IGF-I gene, c.517C>T, c.540G>T and 820G>A SNPs in the IGF-II gene, and c.3129G>A SNP in the IGF-I receptor gene were performed to evaluate the prevalence of IGFs and IGF-I receptor genotypes or alleles.Among studied SNPs, the IGF-II 820G>A polymorphism was associated with endometriosis. Women with endometriosis were observed 1.99 times more frequently in the GG genotype of the IGF-II 820G>A polymorphism compared with non-GG genotype (95% confidence level: 1.18-3.35). The similar finding was observed only in early stage endometriosis (stages I and II).The IGF-II 820G>A polymorphism is a genetic factor which may be associated with the development of endometriosis in Korean women.
