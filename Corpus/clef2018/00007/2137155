Antigenic phenotype of the lymphocytic component of regional lymph nodes in patients with cervical cancer and its modulation by lentinan. Immunohistochemical study with various monoclonal antibodies to the mononuclear cell surface antigens was carried out on the regional lymph nodes in patients with cervical cancer to assess the augmentative effect of lentinan. Zero, 2, 4, or 6 mg of lentinan was administered i.v. one day prior to surgery to patients with cervical cancer (14 cases with FIGO stage 0 and 19 with FIGO stage Ib) and those with benign gynecologic tumors (8 cases with myoma uteri and 6 with ovarian tumor). Frozen sections of fresh pelvic lymph nodes obtained from these patients during surgery were stained by the ABC (avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex) method using several monoclonal antibodies to define the surface phenotype of mononuclear cells. The results were as follows: 1. Pelvic lymph nodes in patients with benign disease: In the absence of lentinan, lymphocytes stained with Leu 3a antibody were more numerous than those stained with Leu 2a, and both were observed mainly in the paracortical area (PC). The number of lymphocytes stained with Leu 4 antibody was practically equal to the sum of those stained with Leu 3a and Leu 2a. HLA-Dr positive lymphocytes were present in moderate numbers in PC and sinus. The above findings were not changed by the administration of lentinan. Cells stained with monoclonal antibodies including Leu 7, 11, M3, and IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) were very few or absent. 2. Pelvic lymph nodes in patients with cervical cancer receiving no lentinan: The findings obtained in these cases were much the same as those in patients with benign tumors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
