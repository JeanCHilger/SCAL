Abdominal wall endometrioma. To report the authors' experience with the clinical manifestations and surgical treatment of abdominal wall endometriomas.A retrospective analysis of patients operated for abdominal wall endometrioma was carried out, with emphasis on age, symptoms, previous cesarean, relation of symptoms with the menstrual cycle, physical examinations and additional surgical treatment, postoperative course and histopathological results of specimens.Fourteen patients were operated during the study period, aged between 28 and 40 years. The presence of a local mass and pain that worsened during menstruation were the main complaints. Ultrasound and Computerized Tomography examinations were important in the precise location of the disease. Surgical excision was wide, involving the tumor and affected tissues. The patients progressed satisfactorily and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of abdominal wall endometrioma in all cases.There was a clear relationship between cesarean section and abdominal wall endometrioma. Ultrasound studies and CT scans helped to plan the surgical approach, allowing resection of the tumor and all adjacent affected tissues.
