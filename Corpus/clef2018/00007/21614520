Identification of common mechanisms between endometriosis and ovarian cancer. To determine common molecular markers between endometriosis and ovarian cancer.Patients included women who underwent laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometriotic lesions (n = 7), healthy non-pregnant women with normal pelvises, who underwent excision of normal peritoneum (n = 7). Two epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell lines were also utilized. Expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), estrogen receptor (ER)-1α, progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), and aromatase was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR.Endometriosis and EOC cells manifested significantly higher mRNA levels of TGF-β1, COX-2, VEGF, ER-1α, AR, and aromatase, while they expressed significantly lower mRNA levels of PR.Increased TGF-β1, COX-2, VEGF, ER-1α, AR, and aromatase and decreased PR in endometriotic as well as EOC cells suggests a potential association between these two disease processes. This association is important, as it may reveal common mechanisms for both diseases.
