Effect of follicular fluid oxidative stress parameters on intracytoplasmic sperm injection outcome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between the follicular fluid (FF) reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and ROS-TAC score and pregnancy after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).A total of 138 consecutive women who had ICSI were included in this study. FF ROS and TAC were measured by enhanced chemiluminescence and colorimetric assay, respectively, and then the ROS-TAC score was calculated.Out of the 138 included patients, 42 (30%) achieved pregnancy after ICSI. Log ROS, TAC, and the ROS-TAC score were not significantly different across diagnoses. Pregnant cycles were associated with significantly lower ROS (P < 0.001), higher TAC (P < 0.001) and higher ROS-TAC scores (P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, there was a significant positive correlation between log ROS and the number of follicles on the day of HCG administration (correlation 0.20, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.39) as well as the number of oocytes retrieved (correlation 0.18, 0.001, 0.36) but not with TAC. Interestingly, in women with endometriosis, higher TAC levels and higher ROS-TAC scores were associated with a higher likelihood of finding normal oocytes (P = 0.005 and P = 0.002, respectively).Higher FF TAC, higher FF ROS-TAC scores and lower FF ROS levels are associated with pregnancy after ICSI. Oxidative stress parameters may be markers of metabolic activity within the follicle.
