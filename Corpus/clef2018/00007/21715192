Laparoscopic treatment of ovarian cysts in adolescents and young adults. To investigate the laparoscopic management of ovarian cysts in adolescents and young adults.A retrospective chart review study.Zekai Tahir Burak Women's Health Research and Education Hospital.A total of 282 females aged 25 years or younger underwent laparoscopic surgery for a presumed benign ovarian cyst. Patients were grouped as adolescents (ages 12-19, n = 79) or young adults (ages 20-25, n = 203).Surgical approach, operative findings and the correlation of intraoperative diagnosis with the definitive pathological reports.The mean age of the patients was 21.2 years. At laparoscopic surgery, 89 patients (31.6%) had endometriomas, 47 (16.7%) had dermoid cysts, and 37 (13.1%) had paraovarian cysts. Ninety-seven patients (34.4%) had simple ovarian cysts. Pathological reports revealed that young adults were more likely to have endometriomas (34.0% vs 7.6%, P < 0.01), but dermoid cysts and simple ovarian cysts were more frequent (20.3% vs 15.3%, P < 0.01 and 60.7% vs 40.9%, P < 0.01, respectively).in adolescents. Eleven of the cases (3.9%) were found to have mucinous cystadenomas and fourteen (5.0%) to have serous cystadenomas. Four cysts were malignant (1.4%). Cystectomy was performed in 205 cases (72.7%), fenestration of cyst wall was performed in 53 cases (18.8%), and aspiration was applied in 22 cases (7.8%). The types of operation were not significantly different among adolescents and young adults (P > 0.05). The operative diagnosis was highly correlated with the final pathological reports (kappa value= 0.901, P < 0.001). There were no operative and postoperative complications in our series.With a careful preoperative screening, the laparoscopic surgery of ovarian cyst is an efficient and safe treatment for adolescents and young adults.
