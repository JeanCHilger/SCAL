Establishment of an immortalized human endometrial stromal cell line with functional responses to ovarian stimuli. Studies on the mechanisms of decidualization and endometriosis are often hampered by lack of primary endometrial cells. To facilitate in vitro studies, we established a human endometrial stromal cell line, KC02-44D, immortalized with human telomerase reverse transcriptase. Upon exposure to ovarian stimuli, KC02-44D cells showed similar cytoskeletal marker or gene expression and biochemical phenotype to primary endometrial stromal cells. KC02-44D would be useful for studies of human endometrial function and its associated pathologies.
