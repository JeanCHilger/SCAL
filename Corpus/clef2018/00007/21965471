Prognostic importance of DNA ploidy and DNA index in stage I and II endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. We evaluated the prognostic importance of DNA ploidy in stage I and II endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC) of the endometrium with a focus on DNA index.High-resolution DNA ploidy analysis was carried out in tumor material from 937 consecutive patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I and II EAC of the endometrium.Patients with diploid (N = 728), aneuploid tumor with DNA index ≤ 1.20 (N = 118), aneuploid tumors with DNA index >1.20 (N = 39) and tetraploid tumor (N = 52) had 5-year recurrence rates 8%, 14%, 20% and 12%, respectively. Patients with aneuploid tumor with DNA index >1.20 had a poorer 5-year progression-free survival (67%) and overall survival (72%) compared with the patients with aneuploid tumor with DNA index ≤ 1.20 (81% and 89%, respectively). Aneuploid tumors with DNA index ≤ 1.20 relapsed mainly in the vagina and pelvis, whereas aneuploid tumors with DNA index >1.20 relapsed predominantly outside pelvis.The recurrence risk for the patients with aneuploid tumor is higher than the patients with diploid tumor in EAC of the endometrium. Based on DNA index with cut-off 1.20, aneuploid tumors can be separated into two subgroups with different recurrence pattern and survival.
