New serum biomarkers for detection of endometriosis using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This study used proteomic fingerprint technology, combining nano-sized magnetic beads with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), to screen for potential protein biomarkers for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Serum proteins  from 126 patients with endometriosis and 120 healthy controls were profiled and compared. Biomarker pattern software identified 46 discriminating mass-to-charge m/z ratio peaks that were related to endometriosis. The model constructed by the software, based on three of these peaks (m/z  5988.7, 7185.3 and 8929.8), generated excellent separation between the endometriosis and control groups. The sensitivity was 91.4% and the specificity 95.0%. Blind testing on a second series of serum samples from patients with endometriosis and healthy controls indicated a sensitivity of 89.3%  and a specificity of 90.0%. Biomarkers for endometriosis can be discovered in serum by MALDI-TOF-MS in combination with nano-sized magnetic beads. The pattern of combined markers provides a powerful and reliable diagnostic method for endometriosis, with high sensitivity and specificity.
