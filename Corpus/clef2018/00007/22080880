Cancer stem cell and embryonic development-associated molecules contribute to prognostic significance in ovarian cancer. Embryonic molecules and cancer stem cell signaling resemble each other, and they organize cancer modality. We hypothesized that similar immunohistochemical expressions between tumor spheroids and patients' samples compared with clinical relevance would give an important clue in patients' prognosis.Immunohistochemical expression of c-kit, Notch1, Jagged1, and Delta1 in 50 cases of primary ovarian tumors (10 endometrioid, 10 serous, 10 mucinous adenocarcinoma, 10 borderline serous, and 10 borderline mucinous tumors) and MDAH-2774 spheroids were investigated. Results were compared in both spheroids and tumor samples with morphologic parameters (histological grade) and clinical data (age, stage, tumor size, and metastasis).High c-kit and Notch1 immunoreactivity was shown in spheroids, but interestingly immunoreactivity of these molecules in tumor samples was different from patients' clinicopathological characteristics. In serous carcinoma, metastasis correlated with Notch1 immunoexpression in mucinous carcinoma, Jagged1 immunohistochemistry correlated with grade, stage, and metastasis of tumorNotch1, Jagged1, and Delta1 expressions might be useful markers for clinical prognosis of ovarian carcinomas and Notch pathway, one of the most intensively studied putative therapeutic targets, may be a useful marker for cancer. Consequently, Jagged1 could be a marker for tumor grades and Notch1 as a marker for metastases.
