Clinico-morphological characteristics of internal endometriosis of the uterine body after menopause. A study in 100 women with postmenopausal bleedings has identified internal endometriosis of the uterine corpus in 50 of them. The diagnosis was made on the basis of past history, hysteroscopy, ultrasound scanning, roentgenotelevision hysterosalpingography, histological examination of resected uterine and adnexal tissues. Thirty patients were operated on and found to have internal endometriosis of different locations and extent as well as nodular adenomyosis. Endometriosis was functionally progressive in 29 patients and regressive in 1 patient, as was confirmed with luminescence histological examination. Ovarian hyperplasia and/or luteinization of the theca interna, stromal hyperplasia, focal thecomatosis and granulosa cell tumour which were present in 56.7% of the patients accounted for active endometriosis. Duration of postmenopause did not influence the functional activity of internal endometriosis.
