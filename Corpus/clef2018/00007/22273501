Catamenial pneumothorax due to bilateral pulmonary endometriosis. Co-existence of catamenial pneumothorax and hemoptysis is rare. We present a case of catamenial pneumothorax due to bilateral pulmonary endometriosis in a 45-year-old woman. The patient presented with a 3-year history of intermittent productive cough with blood-tinged sputum, chronic  anemia, loss of appetite, and general weakness associated with menstruation. Three years prior to this presentation the patient had undergone a sigmoidectomy as treatment for endometriosis of the sigmoid colon with bleeding. Chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple  nodules in both lung parenchyma and recurrent pneumothorax. CT-guided biopsy revealed chronic inflammation of those pulmonary nodules, and laboratory studies disclosed elevated serum levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and CA 125. Thoracoscopic wedge resection of the  pulmonary nodules was performed, and histopathological examination of the resected nodules revealed endometriosis. At one-year follow-up there was no evidence of recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding or pneumothorax.
