Ovarian incidentaloma. Incidental adnexal masses occur with relatively high frequency in post-menopausal women, with a prevalence rate of 3.3-18% in asymptomatic patients. Unilocular, benign-appearing ovarian cysts represent the vast majority of abnormal findings at transvaginal ultrasonography. As many as 80% will resolve over a period of several months if persistent, unchanged, less than 10Â cm, and with normal CA-125 values, the likelihood of an invasive cancer is sufficiently low that observation should be offered. More recent investigations support the use of secondary imaging modalities such as MRI, which may help differentiate benign from malignant masses. Surgical management plays a key role when patients are symptomatic regardless of age, menopausal and have documented changes in cyst characteristics, experience elevations in tumor markers or have symptoms suggestive of a hormone-producing neoplasm. High level, evidence-based screening guidelines have yet to be developed.
