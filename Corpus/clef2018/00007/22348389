ACTN4 gene amplification and actinin-4 protein overexpression drive tumour development and histological progression in a high-grade subset of ovarian clear-cell adenocarcinomas.   Actinin-4, encoded by the ACTN4 gene located on chromosome 19q13.2, enhances cell motility by bundling the actin cytoskeleton. We assessed how ACTN4/actinin-4 alterations contribute to the tumorigenesis of ovarian clear-cell adenocarcinomas (CCAs).  Fluorescence in-situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that ACTN4 amplification (≥4 ACTN4 copies in ≥40% of cells) occurred in 27 (33%) of 81 CCAs and genomic gains of ACTN4 were associated strongly with immunohistochemical actinin-4 overexpression, poorly differentiated tumour histology and shorter patient survival (all P < 0.05). From the 27 ACTN4-amplified CCAs, 23 tumours with adjacent putative precursor lesions were selected and examined for ACTN4/actinin-4 alterations with respect to their intratumoral heterogeneity. In this selected cohort, none of the precursors lacking cytological atypia exhibited gains of ACTN4 or actinin-4 overexpression 50% of the atypical endometrioses and 75% of the borderline CCAFs showed low-level gains of ACTN4 and actinin-4 overexpression, respectively. In 12 of 23 ACTN4-amplified CCAs, intratumoral heterogeneity for ACTN4 alterations was documented in carcinomatous components  Accumulative genomic gains of ACTN4, causing actinin-4 protein overexpression, drive the development and progression of ovarian CCAs with high-grade histology.
