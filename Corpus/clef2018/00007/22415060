UbcH10 expression in benign, hyperplastic, and malignant endometrial curetted materials: a tissue microarray study. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of UbcH10 expression in the differential diagnosis of benign, hyperplastic, and malignant endometrial tissues and also the relationship of UbcH10 with the clinicopathologic parameters of malignant cases. A tissue microarray was performed for 81 endometrial curettage biopsies, which histological diagnosis had demonstrated to be 13 cases of proliferative endometrium, 7 cases of disordered proliferative endometrium, 5 cases of complex atypical hyperplasia, 24 cases of nonatypical hyperplasia, and 32 cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Expression of UbcH10 was assessed by immunohistochemistry. When groups were compared according to UbcH10 percentages and scores, a statistically significant difference was found only between the carcinoma group and the other groups, except the complex atypical hyperplasia group (P < .05). In the malignant group, UbcH10 percentages and scores were only significantly related to age. There was no significant association between UbcH10 expression and tumor grade and stage. Overexpression of UbcH10 may be a useful indicator of endometrial carcinoma. UbcH10 also deserves further evaluation in the detection of prognostic mean and also for its role in endometrial carcinogenesis.
