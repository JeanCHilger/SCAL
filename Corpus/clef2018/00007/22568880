Retrospective evaluation of tumor markers in ovarian mature cystic teratoma and ovarian endometrioma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between clinicopathological characteristics and serum levels of tumor markers in patients with ovarian endometrioma (OE) and ovarian mature cystic teratoma (MCT).Values of CA125, CA19-9, and sialyl Tn antigen (STN) were retrospectively investigated in 321 patients with OE. CA125, CA19-9, STN, and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) were examined in 435 patients with MCT.Mean values of CA125, CA19-9, and STN were 105.3 U/mL, 58.0 U/mL, and 31.1 U/mL in OE, while the values were 26.8 U/mL, 246.8 U/mL, and 24.7 U/mL in MCT. Abnormal elevation of CA125, CA19-9, and STN was observed in 53.3%, 38.9, and 13.5 of OE, and in 12.9, 50.6, and 4.6% of MCT, respectively. CA125 level was significantly higher in bilaterally occurring OE and premenopausal patients with MCT, while the value of CA19-9 was significantly higher in cases of bilaterally occurring MCT. Furthermore, the levels of CA125 and CA19-9 showed significant correlations with tumor diameter, while the levels of STN and SCC showed no significant correlations with tumor diameter. The highest CA125 level (9513 U/mL) was observed in OE and the highest CA19-9 level (25 590 U/mL) was observed in MCT.Although abnormal increases in the levels of CA125 and CA19-9 were often observed, the levels of STN were not influenced by clinicopathologic factors in OE and MCT. Further studies of the clinical usefulness of STN for detecting malignant tumors in OE and MCT are needed.
