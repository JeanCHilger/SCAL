Eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis does not exhibit neurotrophic properties. The role of neurotrophins in eutopic endometrium from endometriosis-patients was investigated in a prospective study using immunofluorescence-staining, Western blot and a neuronal growth assay. The nerve growth factor is expressed in primary endometrial cell culture from women with and without endometriosis. Western blot analysis of endometrial biopsies or uterine fluid from patients with and without endometriosis shows no difference in the neurotrophin expression. We could not find a difference between patients with and without endometriosis with regards to the neurite outgrowth of sensory ganglia when treated with conditioned cultured medium or uterine fluid. This result refutes the assumed neurotrophic properties of eutopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis.
