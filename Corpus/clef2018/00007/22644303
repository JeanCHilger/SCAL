pHH3 and survivin are co-expressed in high-risk endometrial cancer and are prognostic relevant. Phosphohistone-H3 (pHH3) is a promising reliable mitotic count biomarker. Our purpose was to study the relationship between the novel proliferation marker pHH3 and the established anti-apoptotic marker survivin and consider their prognostic relevance in endometrial cancer.A total of 106 patients with endometrial cancer (type I/endometrioid, n=81 type II carcinomas, n=18) and simple hyperplasia without atypia (n=7) were investigated. pHH3 and survivin expression were assessed using immunohistochemistry from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.A strong positive correlation was observed between pHH3 and survivin expression (P<0.0001). Patients with high-grade tumours and patients with type II carcinomas expressed significantly more pHH3 and survivin than low grade and endometrioid tumours (P<0.0001, P<0.0001, P<0.0001, and P<0.0001, respectively). In univariate survival analysis, overexpression of pHH3 and survivin were associated with increased recurrence and mortality (P<0.0001, P<0.0001, P<0.0001, and P<0.0001, respectively), in the multivariable Cox regression analyses both pHH3 and survivin could be identified as independent parameters for overall survival (P=0.004, and P=0.023, respectively).In endometrial cancer, pHH3 and survivin were strongly positive correlated and were both associated with type II and high-grade tumours. Increasing expression levels of pHH3 and survivin were associated with adverse prognostic factors.
