Chromosomal aberrations detected by chromogenic in situ hybridization in abdominal wall endometriosis after cesarean section. The goal of this study is to evaluate the chromosomal loss in abdominal wall endometriosis by chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH). Twenty-four cases of abdominal wall endometriosis that developed after cesarean section at the Korea University Medical Center between January 1997 and December 2006 were selected. CISH was performed in the sections of tissue microarray block using the Zymed CISH centromeric probes for chromosomes 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 17, and 18. Monosomy was defined when the percentage of the nuclei with a single dot was more than mean+3 SD of the respective probe in normal control endometrium. CISH study was possible in more than half of the endometriosis samples, except for chromosome 9, and was most successful for chromosome 17. The frequency of monosomy was high for chromosomes 9 (75.0%) and 17 (73.9%), moderate for chromosomes 10 (57.1%) and 18 (56.3%), and low for chromosomes 3 (12.5%), 7 (22.2%), 8 (10.5%), and 11 (10.5%). Monosomy for >2 and 3 chromosomes occurred in 66.7% and 42.9% of the cases, respectively. It is concluded that CISH method may be considered a useful laboratory technique in detecting chromosomal loss, and multiple chromosomal loss is involved in the formation of ectopic endometrium in abdominal wall endometriosis.
