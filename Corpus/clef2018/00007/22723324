The impact of excision of ovarian endometrioma on ovarian reserve: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Endometriomas are mainly treated surgically. However, there has been concern over the potential damaging effect of this surgery on ovarian reserve.The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the impact of surgery for endometriomas on ovarian reserve as determined by serum anti-m√ºllerian hormone (AMH).MEDLINE, PubMed, and Embase were searched electronically.All prospective cohort studies that analyzed changes of serum AMH concentrations after surgical treatment of endometriomas were eligible. Twenty-one studies were identified, of which eight were selected for meta-analysis.Two reviewers performed the data extraction independently.Pooled analysis of 237 patients showed a statistically significant decrease in serum AMH concentration after ovarian cystectomy (weighted mean difference -1.13 ng/ml 95% confidence interval -0.37 to -1.88), although heterogeneity was high. Sensitivity analysis for studies with a preoperative serum AMH level of 3.1 ng/ml or greater improved heterogeneity but also still showed a significant postoperative fall in serum AMH (weighted mean difference -1.52 ng/ml, 95% confidence interval -1.04 to -2).The results of this study suggest a negative impact of excision of endometriomas on ovarian reserve as evidenced by a significant postoperative fall in circulating AMH.
