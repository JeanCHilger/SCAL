Ureteral stenosis due to endometriosis. Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, with potential to undergo malignant transformation. We report the case of a 36-year-old patient with a clinical and imagistic diagnosis of left vaginal pouch and left parametrium tumor. The patient presented lumbar and pelvic pain, dysuria and polakyuria. Ultrasound revealed changes in the left kidney confirmed by the CT scan, which also revealed the presence of a tumor in the left parametrium infiltrating the bladder, juxtavesical ureter, uterus and cervix. Laboratory tests were within normal limits. Surgery consisted of interadnexal hysterectomy, proximal colpectomy, left distal ureterectomy with ureterocystoneostomy. Pathological examination established the final diagnosis of infiltrative deep endometriosis involving the urinary tract. In the case of a young fertile patient with gynecological symptoms and morphofunctional changes of the urinary system, urinary tract endometriosis should always be a diagnostic option.
