A panoramic view to relationships between reproductive failure and immunological factors. To examine the possible roles of various immunological factors in recurrent miscarriage and unexplained infertility.The synthesis and review of the relevant current literature in English language.Substantial evidence suggests that antiphospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, antisperm antibodies, antithyroid antibodies, anti-endometrial antibodies, antiovarian antibodies, anti-C trachomatis antibodies, cytokines, and immunological events in endometriosis and premature ovarian failure due to immunologic factors may contribute to reproductive failure including unexplained infertility and/or non-chromosomal recurrent miscarriage.Elimination or suppression of the immunological factors related with reproductive failure might occupy an important place in the treatment of unexplained infertility and non-chromosomal recurrent miscarriage.
