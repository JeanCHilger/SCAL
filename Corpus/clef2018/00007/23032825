Clinicopathological spectrum of 19 adenosarcomas of female genital tract, including uncommon clinical associations and immunohistochemical profile, reviewed at a single institution. Adenosarcomas of the female genital tract have been rarely documented as case series from our continent.Over a seven-year period, 19 adenosarcomas were critically reviewed.Nineteen tumors occurred in the age range of 21-65 years (mean: 43), in the endometrium (8), endometrium and cervix (4), cervix (4), and ovary (3). Four cases displayed coexisting leiomyomas two, adenomyosisDiverse clinicopathological spectrum was noted within adenosarcomas. Low-grade tumors were less aggressive than high-grade ones, with SO. Immunohistochemically, lower CD10 and ER/PR positivity was noted in high-grade tumors. Surgery formed the mainstay of treatment. Adjuvant treatment was offered in high-grade subtypes, including in tumors with SO.
