Plasma adipokines and endometriosis risk: a prospective nested case-control investigation from the Nurses' Health Study II. Do higher leptin levels and lower adiponectin levels predict subsequent development of endometriosis?Plasma leptin and adiponectin levels were not associated with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis when collected prior to disease diagnosis.Case-control studies have identified altered levels of the inflammatory adipokines leptin and adiponectin in women with endometriosis, but it remains unclear whether inflammation results in endometriosis or whether the presence of endometriosis creates an inflammatory state.Nested, matched, case-control study within the prospective Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II) cohort. Blood samples were collected between 1996 and 1999 from 29 611 female nurses within the cohort. Women who reported endometriosis before blood collection were excluded.Plasma leptin and adiponectin levels were assayed by ELISA. Three hundred and fifty cases of laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis were matched 1:2 with 694 controls of comparable race, age, infertility history, menopausal status and time of blood draw. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression models adjusting for matching factors and BMI.After adjusting for BMI, there were no statistically significant associations between endometriosis and leptin [RR = 1.2 95% CI = 0.7-2.0A limitation of this study is the inability to differentiate the time of endometriosis 'diagnosis' from the time of disease 'onset' due to the impossibility in identifying a precise time point at which the disease process was first initiated at a molecular or cellular level. Additional limitations include lack of information regarding stage of endometriosis and the possibility of asymptomatic disease in the control population.The mean age at diagnosis of endometriosis in the study population is 41.7, â‰ˆ 10 years older than the mean age of diagnosis in the general population. While this may limit the generalizability of the results, there is no reason to suspect that the association between adipokines and endometriosis risk should differ at a younger age of diagnosis in an adult population.
