The significance of Wilms Tumor Gene (WT1) and p53 expression in curettage specimens of patients with endometrial carcinomas. In this retrospective experimental study, we assessed the immunohistochemical expression of Wilms Tumor Gene (WT1) and p53 in endometrial biopsies of patients with endometrial cancer, and correlated their expression with the final pathological findings. Sixty-two patients with primary endometrial cancer who underwent surgical treatment were investigated. Immunohistochemical expression of Wilms Tumor Gene (WT1) and p53 was assessed in curettage specimens, and the final pathology reports from hysterectomy specimens were reviewed. The expression of these markers seems to play a role in curettage specimens as they correlate with the final tumor characteristics of hysterectomy specimens. Five out of sixty-two endometrial cancer specimens (8.1%) were WT1-positive, and 21 specimens (33.9%) were P53-positive. Positive expression of WT1 and P53 was significantly associated with the non-endometrioid type (p value of 0.019 and 0.005, respectively). Positive WT1 expression was significantly associated with high grade lesions, deep myometrial invasion, and advanced stage disease. Moreover, a statistically significant inverse relationship was observed between the positivity of WT1 and P53, and the positivity of ER and PR. We think that examination for WT1 and p53 in curettage specimens might help to predict the final pathological diagnosis in patients with endometrial cancer. This might be useful for the identification of high risk groups and, therefore, of candidates for more radical surgery.
