MRI findings of sciatic endometriosis. Endometriosis is a rare cause of sciatic mononeuropathy. We report a woman with cyclic, menstruation-related hip pain associated with right leg weakness and sensory loss. Examination and electrodiagnostic studies suggested sciatic nerve dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed abnormal signal consistent with endometriotic tissue in the region of the right sciatic nerve. The abnormal signal partially regressed after treatment of the endometriosis. This case further illustrates the utility of MRI in the assessment of rare pelvic disorders.
