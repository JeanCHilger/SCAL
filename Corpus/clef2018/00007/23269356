Expression of human β-defensin-2 in the eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues in patients with endometriosis. To investigate the expression of human β-defensin-2 (hBD-2) in the endometrium of patients with endometriosis (EMS) and explore the potential role of hBD-2 in the pathogenesis of EMS.Prospective controlled study.50 women including EMS patients undergoing laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy and non-EMS patients undergoing hysterectomy for uterine fibroids.Large university teaching hospital.Patients were divided into EMS and non-EMS groups. The gene expressions of hBD-2, interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the endometrial tissues of each group were detected with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and hBD-2 protein expression with immunohistochemical method.The gene expression levels of hBD-2, TNF-α, and IL-1β as well as the positive expression rate of hBD-2 protein in the ectopic endometrium of EMS patients were significantly higher than those in the eutopic endometrium of EMS and non-EMS patients (all P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that the gene expression levels of hBD-2 in the ectopic and eutopic endometrium of EMS patients were positively correlated with the gene expression levels of IL-1β and TNF-α (P < 0.01).High levels of hBD-2 gene and protein expressions in the ectopic endometrium of EMS patients may be an important contributor in the pathogenesis of EMS. TNF-α and IL-1β may promote the upregulation of hBD-2 expression.
