Is hysterectomy required during vaginal reconstructive pelvic surgery? About histopathological results. To evaluate the rate of pre-cancerous and cancerous endometrial lesions in hysterectomy during vaginal reconstructive pelvic surgery.In this retrospective and continuous study, a vaginal procedure including reconstructive pelvic surgery with vaginal mesh, hysterectomy and adnexectomy was performed in 152 patients between April 2001 and January 2006. An ultrasonography evaluation was done before surgery. A histopathological analysis of uterus, ovaries and tubes was also performed.In the analysis of 136 cases, precancerous and cancerous lesions have been diagnosed while ultrasonography or cervical smear were normal: 2 (1.4%) endocervical dysplasia, 1 (0.7%) cervical epidermoid carcinoma, 10 (7.35%) endometrial complex non-atypical hyperplasia, 7 (5.1%) endometrial atypical hyperplasia and 2 (1.4%) endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. There was not any cancerous lesions in tubes or ovaries. At 10months, mesh exposure was low at 2.9% (four cases).The important rate of cancerous and precancerous lesions raise the question of hysterectomy or hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy in case of uterine preservation during a vaginal reconstructive pelvic surgery.
