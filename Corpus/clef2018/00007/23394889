Conventional endometrioid adenocarcinomas of the endometrium recurring as clear cell tumors: comparative immunohistochemical analyses. Endometrial carcinomas are known to have the potential for recurrences that are distinctly discordant at the morphologic and immunophenotypic levels from their antecedent primary tumors. This report describes 3 patients with stage I, low or intermediate grade, conventional endometrioid carcinomas that recurred at the vaginal apex as notably clear cell-rich, higher grade, histotypically ambiguous neoplasms. Comparative immunohistochemical analyses were performed on all cases on both the original and the recurrent tumors using a panel of 8 biomarkers, including estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, vimentin, p53, p16, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1β, BAF250a (ARID1A), and stathmin or oncoprotein-18 (STMN1). Notable immunophenotypic differences (relative to the original tumor) in case 1 included the relative loss of vimentin and estrogen receptor and the acquisition of p53, p16, and STMN1 expression in the recurrence. In case 2, significant p16 and STMN1 expression were identified only in the recurrence. In case 3, there were no significant immunophenotypic differences between the original tumor and the recurrence. In all 3 cases, the recurrent and original tumors showed no significant differences in BAF250a, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1β, and progesterone receptor expression. In summary, our cases confirm that endometrioid carcinomas can recur as clear cell-rich tumors. The relative acquisition of STMN1 expression in 2 of the 3 recurrences and p53 overexpression in 1 of 3 recurrences suggests that this phenomenon represents a form of tumor evolution, and this may be a potential contributor to tumor progression in these patients.
