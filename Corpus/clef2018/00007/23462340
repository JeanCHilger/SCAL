Interest of laparoscopy in infertile couple with normal hysterosalpingography. The diagnostic laparoscopy has long been the key consideration in the export of female infertility. This place is being reconsidered, especially in the case of normal hysterosalpingogrophy (HSG), because of the advent of assisted reproductive technologies which are more efficient, and because of the improvement of medical imaging techniques which are more sensitive and specific. We wanted to clarify the place of the diagnostic laparoscopy in the balance of female infertility in normal HSG.It is a retrospective study on a series of 100 observations of infertile patients with a normal HSG and having a diagnostic laparoscopy in the department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Farhat Hached hospital in Sousse (Tunisia) from 1st January 1993 to 1st March 2003.The mean age was 32.3years the mean duration of infertility was 70.47months. Laparoscopy revealed pelvic abnormalities in 45% of cases, dominated by disease tubo-adhesions (23%), endometriosis was found in 6% of cases. These anomalies are considered major in 23% of cases and minor in 22% of cases. Conducting a surgical procedure in the same operating time (adhesiolysis, tubal plastic surgery, electrocoagulation of endometriosis implants) could improve the prognosis of fertility. Only 20 patients were followed among the 45 with pelvic abnormalities, seven pregnancies have been completed (35% of cases).Laparoscopy has improved the prognosis for the fertility of our patients by treating abnormalities involved in infertility. It is estimated that the prognosis can be improved by selecting patients with risk factors for pelvic abnormalities.
