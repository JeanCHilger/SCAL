Atypical polypoid adenomyoma mixed with endometrioid carcinoma: a case report. The following is a description of an extremely rare tumor of the uterus, malignant atypical polypoid adenomyoma (APA), admixed with well-differentiated endometroid carcinoma, in a 29-year-old patient previously treated for sterility in whom, due to the existence of a ten-millimeter sessile tumor on the uterine corpus, verified by transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS), a hysteroscopic resection of the anomaly was performed. The patient underwent all requisite examinations and was referred to the malignant diseases panel for an examination and a decision on further treatment. As the patient wished to preserve fertility, the authors decided to continue performing regular controls at intervals of two to three months. The first subsequent control called for a TVUS examination or one using another imaging method, with a multiple endometrial biopsy with curettage of the endocervix. The results of the first examination promised that fertility could be preserved. Therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in daily dosages of 200 to 500 mg was advised, which the patient intentionally did not take. A spontaneous desired pregnancy was verified following the first control.
