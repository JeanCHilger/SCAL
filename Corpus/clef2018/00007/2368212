The involvement of the urinary system organs in women suffering from genital endometriosis. The data on the complicated character of endometriosis treatment, in females with the involved urinary system in particular, were discussed. The reported incidence of the affected urinary system in females with endometriosis ranged from 1-2 to 18.5 per cent. Out of 57 patients followed up by the authors, the ureter involvement was diagnosed in 52.6 per cent. For timely diagnosis, the authors recommended the performance of urological examinations prior to the nonoperative treatment. In case of urodynamic disorders, surgical intervention was advised to be the first, its extent depending on affection patterns and the performance of the upper urinary tract. A 1-3-year follow-up evidenced normal renal and urodynamic functioning in operated-on patients.
