Deep endometriosis and bladder and detrusor functions in women without urinary symptoms: a pilot study through an unexplored world. To evaluate the impact of deep endometriosis (DE) on bladder function, focusing on detrusor pattern, in patients without preoperative urinary symptoms.Prospective study.Academic research center.A total of 25 asymptomatic patients: 12 patients with DE (group 1) and 13 patients with ovarian endometriosis (group 2, control group).Preoperative urodynamic evaluation.The impact of DE on urodynamic parameters.For the first time, a urodynamic diagnosis of detrusor overactivity was correlated with the presence of deep infiltrating endometriosis (group 1, 91.7% [11/12] vs. group 2, 7.7% [1/13]). All involuntary detrusor contractions were detected only during the filling phase. All cystometry parameters were found to be altered in group 1 and statistically different between the two groups. No pressure/flow study parameter significantly differed between the two groups, besides maximal detrusor pressure (46 cmH2O [33-79] vs. 29 cmH2O [15-40]), which was significantly higher in group 1. Therefore, all detrusor-related parameters are statistically different between the two groups. Postvoid residual does not reach a statistically significant difference.DE could significantly impair detrusor functions. A preoperative urodynamic evaluation allows the attainment of important functional information, even in asymptomatic patients.
