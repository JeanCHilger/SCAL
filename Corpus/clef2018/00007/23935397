Increased expression of pattern recognition receptors and nitric oxide synthase in patients with endometriosis. Endometriosis is characterized by repeated inflammatory changes and serious adhesions, inducing innate and adaptive immune responses within the abdominal cavity. To assess these immune responses, we evaluated the levels of expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR)-1, -2, -4, -5, and -9 nucleotide-binding oligomerization domains (NOD)-1 and -2The levels of TLRs, NODs, cytokines, and NOS mRNAs in peritoneal effusions were assessed by real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and IgG, IgA and IgM concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in 40 patients with and 40 without endometriosis. Findings from the two groups were compared.We observed expression of all pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), cytokines, and NOS mRNAs and Igs in the effusion fluid of patients with and without endometriosis. The levels of TLR-2 and -9 NOD-1 and -2PRRs, cytokines, and NOS, which act cooperatively in the innate immune response, are closely associated with endometriosis. Increased expression of TLR-2, TLR -9, NOD-1, NOD-2, and NOS mRNA in peritoneal fluid may be associated with endometriosis.
