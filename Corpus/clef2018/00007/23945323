Ureteral endometriosis treated by hormonal therapy : a case report. A 40-year-old woman visited our hospital with asymptomatic macroscopic hematuria. A nonpapillary ureteral tumor protruding from the left orifice was identified by cystoscopy. Computed tomography revealed left hydronephrosis due to the ureteral tumor. Transurethral resection for the ureteral tumor was performed and histopathological examination for the specimen revealed intrinsic type ureteral endometriosis. Administration of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist for 6 months markedly improved the hydronephrosis. The patient received hormonal therapy for 2 years in total. At present, there is no evidence of disease recurrence 6 months after the termination of hormonal therapy. To our knowledge, the present case was the 14th Japanese case with intrinsic type ureteral endometriosis reported in the literature.
