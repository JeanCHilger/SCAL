Anti-apoptotic activity in deep pelvic endometriosis. Since endometriosis is a proliferative disease we evaluated the presence of anti-apoptotic factor (Bcl-2) and pro-apoptotic factor (Bax) in deep pelvic endometriosis. A Cross-sectional observational study was performed at Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. Forty women aged 26 to 46 years with deep endometriosis were selected. They had not been clinically treated for at least 3 months prior to surgery and then underwent surgical laparoscopy to treat the disease. During the surgery, tissue was collected from the uterosacral ligaments and the rectosigmoid an endometrial biopsy was also performed as a control. All interventions were performed by the same surgeon. The specimens were sent for pathological and immunohistochemical analyses
