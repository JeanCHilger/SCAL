Synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary in young women: a Korean Gynecologic Oncology Group Study. Some authors have recommended the use of diagnostic laparoscopy as a pretreatment assessment step for conservative hormonal treatment in young women with endometrial cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of synchronous primary cancer of the endometrium and ovary in young women.The medical records of 3240 patients with endometrial cancer who underwent primary surgery between 1995 and 2010 were collected from 7 institutions and were retrospectively reviewed. Low-risk endometrial cancer was defined as tumors without myometrial invasion normal or benign-looking ovariesFifteen percent (471/3240) were younger than 40 years of age. The incidence of synchronous ovarian cancer in young women with endometrial cancer was 4.5% (21/471). In patients with low-risk endometrial cancer, synchronous cancers were not identified.The incidence of synchronous ovarian malignancies in young women with endometrial cancer was quiet low (4.5%), unlike previous studies have revealed (11-29%). Therefore, diagnostic laparoscopy is not mandatory in patients with low-risk early stage endometrial cancer selected for conservative treatment to confirm the absence of ovarian malignancy.
