Structural and molecular features of the endomyometrium in endometriosis and adenomyosis. BACKGROUND Adenomyosis and endometriosis were initially described as 'adenomyoma'. When the retrograde menstruation theory became widely accepted to explain the pathogenesis of endometriosis, since it does not explain adenomyosis, the two conditions came to be seen as distinct entities. However, emerging evidence suggests that both diseases may be linked to changes in the inner portion of the myometrium. In addition, similar anomalies were found in the eutopic endometrium of the two conditions and the debate has re-opened. A common origin for both adenomyosis and endometriosis would have relevance not only for understanding uterine function and pathophysiology, but also for clinical management and treatment. METHODS The Scopus and Medline databases were searched for all original articles published in English up to the end of 2012. Search terms included 'adenomyosis' 'endometriosis'
