The clinicopathologic significance of the loss of BAF250a (ARID1A) expression in endometrial carcinoma. AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes the BAF250a protein. Recent studies have shown the loss of ARID1A expression in several types of tumors. We aimed to investigate the clinical and pathologic role of BAF250a in endometrial carcinoma.We examined the expression of BAF250a and its correlation with the expression of p53, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, hypoxiainduciblefactor-1Î±, and vascular endothelial growth factor in normal and various malignant endometrial tissues.The expression of BAF250 was significantly down-regulated in endometrial carcinoma when compared with normal endometrial tissues. The loss of BAF250a expression was found in 25% of endometrial carcinoma samples but not in normal endometrial tissues, complex endometrial hyperplasia, and atypical endometrial hyperplasia samples. Subtypes of endometrial carcinoma, especially uterine endometrioid carcinoma and uterine clear cell carcinoma, had higher frequency of loss of BAF250a expression. In addition, the expression of BAF250a was positively correlated with estrogen receptor and negatively correlated with p53 in poorly differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma. Moreover, the expression of BAF250a was significantly associated with the differentiation status of endometrial carcinoma but not associated with clinical stage, the depth of myometrial invasion, lymph node metastasis, and overall survival of patients with endometrial carcinoma.Our data showed that loss of BAF250a is frequently found in high-grade endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas but not in other types of endometrial carcinoma. The loss of BAF250a expression does not have prognostic value for endometrial carcinoma.
