To evaluate cases of endometriosis of the abdominal wall to determine whether the diagnosis was anticipated preoperatively and whether or not the patient had undergone prior surgery.This was a retrospective review of records of patients undergoing surgical resection of abdominal wall endometriosis from 1996-2011.Nine cases were identified. For the 8 cases with a recorded preoperative diagnosis, the clinical diagnosis of endometriosis was recorded preoperatively in only 25% of cases. The most common preoperative diagnosis was neoplasia.Abdominal wall endometriosis remains a difficult diagnosis to make preoperatively.
