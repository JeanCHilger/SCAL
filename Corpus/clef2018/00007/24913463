Atorvastatin exerts anti-nociceptive activity and decreases serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor-α in a rat endometriosis model. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of atorvastatin in the treatment of experimental endometriosis.Endometriosis was induced in 24 female rats. 4 weeks after the procedure dimensions of the foci were recorded. Rats were divided into three groups: in Group 1 (n = 8), a daily dose of 10 mg/kg atorvastatin was given for 14 days. In the second group (n = 8), a single dose of 1 mg/kg leuprolide acetate was injected intraperitoneally. The rats in Group 3 (n = 8) were received 1 mg/kg i.p. 0.9 % NaCl. At the end of the treatment, laparotomy was performed, and the dimensions of the endometriotic foci were recorded. Biochemical, histopathological and immunohistochemical studies were performed and nociception was compared in groups.Atorvastatin treatment exhibited significant analgesic activity in hot plate model (P = 0.022). The serum hs-CRP and tumor necrosis TNF-α levels were similar between the Group 2 and Group 3 (P > 0.05) however atorvastatin caused significant decrease in both serum markers. The histological and immunohistochemical scores were also found to be markedly lower in Group 1 and Group 2 (P < 0.05).Atorvastatin treatment may have a therapeutic potential in the treatment of endometriosis through its anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive properties.
