Ovarian suppression induced with Buserelin or danazol in the management of endometriosis: a randomized, comparative study. The effectiveness of Buserelin (Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Somerville, NJ) (0.2 mg subcutaneously [SC] or 1.2 mg intranasally [IN] per day) and danazol (800 mg per day) in inducing ovarian suppression for the management of endometriosis was compared in a prospective randomized study. During 6 months of treatment, peripheral follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol concentrations were suppressed to a similar degree in both groups. Symptomatic improvement and laparoscopically assessed regression of endometriotic lesions also were comparable. After treatment, 8 of 18 infertile women treated with Buserelin and 5 of 8 treated with danazol conceived. General and hypoestrogenic side effects were similar in both groups, while androgenic and anabolic were more frequent with danazol. High density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol increased in the Buserelin and decreased in the danazol group. The study indicates that at the dose tested, buserelin and danazol induce a similar degree of ovarian suppression resulting in a comparable clinical improvement and regression of endometriotic lesions.
