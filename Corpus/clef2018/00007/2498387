Serum concentration and urinary excretion of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist buserelin in patients with endometriosis. We studied the pharmacokinetics of iv and intranasally administered buserelin, a LHRH agonist peptide, in 14 women with endometriosis. Serum and urinary buserelin concentrations were determined by specific RIA (buserelin antiserum AS-639). Intact buserelin and the metabolites in urine were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and measured by RIA. The mean serum buserelin concentrations were 101 +/- 33 (+/- SD) ng/mL 20 min and 1.12 +/- 0.12 ng/mL 360 min after its iv injection in 6 women, and the mean elimination half-life between 20 and 360 min was 51 min. In serum, intact buserelin was the main constituent (10 min, 90% 120 min, 74%
