Gastric endometriosis associated with transverse colon endometriosis: a case report of a very rare event. Gastric endometriosis is a very rare event. It enters in the differential diagnosis of cyclical or chronic epigastric pain, especially in the context of endometriotic patients. The diagnosis of a gastric submucosal mass requires further investigations to rule out the presence of malignancy or associated adenocarcinoma. Because of it can be associated with transverse colon endometriosis and/or diaphragmatic endometriosis, careful examination of the upper abdomen at laparoscopy should be emphasized. We report here a very rare case of gastric endometriosis associated with transverse colon endometriosis.
