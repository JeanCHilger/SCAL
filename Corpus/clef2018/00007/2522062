A randomized, prospective comparison of endocrine changes induced with intranasal leuprolide or danazol for treatment of endometriosis. A prospective, randomized trial compared hormonal changes induced with intranasal leuprolide 1.6 mg/day to danazol 800 mg/day for treatment of endometriosis. Both regimens induced anovulation and ovarian suppression in all subjects. Mean estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) levels were suppressed with both regimens, but were lower with leuprolide. There was no difference in cumulative follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, although at times during treatment mean levels of these hormones were lower with leuprolide. Higher P levels in the danazol group, most likely of adrenal origin, indicated a suppressive effect on adrenal steroidogenesis. Symptomatic improvement was significant in both groups. Laparoscopy after treatment also demonstrated a decrease in endometriosis scores in both groups. At 12 months after treatment, cumulative pregnancy and live birth rates were similar in both groups. Leuprolide offers an attractive alternative to danazol for the medical treatment of endometriosis.
