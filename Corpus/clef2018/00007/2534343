Serum CA-125 levels in women with endometriosis. Forty-two women with laparoscopically-confirmed pelvic endometriosis (assessed according to the American Fertility Society modified classification) had serum levels of the cell-surface antigen CA-125 measured before, during and after medical therapy with nafarelin acetate or danazol combined with follow-up laparoscopic surgery or laparotomy. Serum levels before treatment (39.3 [SE 6.6] U/ml) were elevated above accepted normal levels in many subjects, and these were highly significantly suppressed during medical therapy with both nafarlin and danazol (13.1 [SE 1.5] U/ml at 5 months) t = 3.198
