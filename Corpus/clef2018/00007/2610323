The natural cellular cytotoxicity of endometriosis patients. In the cytotoxic test, the level of natural cellular cytotoxicity (NCC) and activity of natural killers (NK) was determined in 16 patients with genital endometriosis and 36 healthy women in the time-course of a menstrual cycle. During the menstrual cycle, no substantial variations in NK activity were found in the healthy women and patients with endometriosis. There was a decrease in NCC only in patients with internal endometriosis, which correlated with severity of endocrine diseases.
