Diagnosis and treatment of digestive endometriosis. Excision of intestinal implants in association with ovarian conservative surgery appears to be a safe procedure in most cases of intestinal endometriosis. Newer surgical techniques (selective laser vaporisation of abnormal tissue), advances in medical therapy (danazol, LH-RH agonists) and earlier diagnosis before obstructive phenomena, might allow conservative medical or surgical management before the development of major complications.
