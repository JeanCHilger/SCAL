Female age, the length of involuntary infertility prior to investigation and fertility outcome. The objectives of this study were two-fold: firstly to determine whether female age exerts an influence on the fertility outcome of couples attending an infertility clinic, independent of demographic and clinical details and secondly to examine the relationship between the length of involuntary infertility prior to investigation and the subsequent chance of conception. Seven-hundred-and-thirty-one subjects whose partner did not have azoospermia were recruited to the study. Female age ranged from 20 to 46 (mean = 31.1). The range of involuntary infertility prior to investigation was 12-216 (mean = 62) months. One-hundred-and-twenty-four women conceived. The following variables achieved the 5% level of significance when a stepwise analysis was performed on all casesA study was conducted on 731 women to determine whether female age has an effect on couple infertility and to discover the relationship that may exist between the length of involuntary infertility prior to investigation and the chance of fertility after attending an infertility clinic.  The female age range was 20-46 years with a mean age of 31.1 the male age range was 21-69 with a mean age of 33.7.  The involuntary infertility range before attending an infertility clinic was 12-216 months.  Follow-up period range at the infertility clinic was 0-34 months.  The results of the study are as follows:  124 women conceived (16.8%)
