Catamenial hemoptysis caused by bronchopulmonary endometriosis. The thoracic localization of endometriosis may involve the pulmonary pleura and the diaphragm, or the bronchopulmonary parenchyma, according to mechanisms which appear to be quite different. The principal clinical manifestations express themselves depending on their localization, a pneumothorax in the first case and hemoptysis in the second. One clinical characteristic, however, applies to them all, a rhythm strictly related to periods. The current methods of visualization of the pleura enable a macroscopic diagnosis to occur in the former cases in 64% and the body scanner now localizes the second in all cases. Treatment by Danatrol is often strikingly effective in a few months, notably in the cases with parenchymal localization.
