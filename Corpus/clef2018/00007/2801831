Elevated serum levels of endometrial secretory protein PP14 in patients with advanced endometriosis. Suppression by treatment with danazol and high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate. The circulating concentration of endometrial protein PP14 varied during the menstrual cycle in patients with endometriosis. The highest levels were found on days 1 to 4 of the cycle (176 +/- 123 micrograms/L mean +/- SD), and the lowest on days 5 to 20 (44.1 +/- 29.7 micrograms/L). Rising levels were observed on days 21 to 30 (58.3 +/- 62.6 micrograms/L). On days 5 to 20 (i.e., during period of the lowest levels) patients with advanced endometriosis had higher PP14 levels (63.9 +/- 39.0 micrograms/L) than those with mild endometriosis (29.3 +/- 18.2 micrograms/L
