The use of bromocriptine in hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea in Singapore. Ninety-four women and seven men were treated with low dose bromocriptine for (a) hyperprolactinemia or (b) normoprolactinemia but with galactorrhea and a pituitary adenoma. All the pituitary adenomas became smaller or remained the same. Prolactin levels decreased with treatment and inappropriate galactorrhea improved in the 53 patients except for 7 where there was no change. Of the 41 women with premenstrual mastalgia 78% improved with treatment. Of the 74 women with ovulatory problems, a biphasic pattern was restored in 65 patients. Thirty-two patients out of the 92 trying to conceive achieved a pregnancy with an abortion rate of 12.5% and non-lethal congenital abnormality of 9.8% (2.1% in Singapore population). Fertility was restored in 3 hyperprolactinemic oligospermic males and improved libido was professed by most of the treated men. Side effects were present but were on the whole tolerable. Pregnancy rate was better in those with high levels of prolactin (greater than 1000 miU/l) than in those with hyperprolactinemia of between 500 and 1000 miU/l although this was not statistically significant chi 2 = 0.69. In the lower hyperprolactinemic range there was noticeable number of patients with endometriosis and increased luteinizing hormone (LH) levels.
