Local autoimmunity in mild endometriosis. Forty-four patients with and without mild endometriosis were tested for the presence in peritoneal fluid of autoantibodies against endometrial and ovarian antigens. Five patients with endometriosis and one patient in the control group had significantly elevated titers, and the mean of titers was similar in each group. These results suggest that local autoimmunity is not a likely phenomenon in patients with mild endometriosis.
