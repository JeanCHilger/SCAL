Diagnostic usefulness of stepwise discriminant analysis employing the values of CA125, TPA, IAP, CEA and ferritin in sera measured simultaneously for gynecological malignant neoplasms. The values for CA125, TPA, IAP, CEA, and ferritin in sera were measured simultaneously in 68 healthy nonpregnant females and 133 patients with various gynecological diseases, and examined by stepwise discriminant analysis. The usefulness and the limits for diagnosis of various gynecological diseases were investigated for each tumor marker. Also, the diagnostic usefulness of stepwise discriminant analysis employing the values for five tumor markers in sera was studied for gynecological malignancies compared with that of measuring serum CA125 alone. Because the mean values for CA125 in sera were increased specifically in the ovarian cancer patient group compared with those of other tumor markers in sera, the measurement of serum CA125 was considered to be more useful in diagnosing ovarian cancer than that of the other tumor markers. The mean values for CA125 in sera, however, were also increased more significantly in the groups of patients with endometriosis and normal pregnancies than in the group of healthy nonpregnant females (p less than 0.005). In the stepwise discriminant analysis employing the values for CA125 and four other tumor markers in sera, the diagnostic usefulness of each tumor marker was demonstrated in the early diagnosis, the differential diagnosis, and the determination of complete remission after several therapies for ovarian cancers.
