Estrogen and progesterone receptors in ovarian carcinoma. Estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors in 20 primary carcinomas of the ovary were studied by the customary DCC method. One of the receptors examined was found in 12 patients (60%) and both of them in 5 patients (25%). Serous types of tumour revealed a higher concentration of receptors than mucinous ones. The study of this kind is considered useful for the selection of patients in whom the adjuvant hormonal therapy could be applied.
