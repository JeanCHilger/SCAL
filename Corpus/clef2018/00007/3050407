The cervical cap. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved marketing of the Prentif cavity-rim cervical cap.  This contraceptive device is being distributed in the US and Canada by Cervical Cap Ltd, Los Gatos, California.  The Prentif cap is available in 4 sizes:  22, 25, 28, and 31 mm inside diameter, with a length of 1 1/4-1 1/2 inches.  In a multicenter trial involving 522 diaphragm users and 581 cap users followed for 2 years, the cap was 82.6% effective and the diaphragm was 83.3% effective in preventing pregnancy.  When pregnancies attributable to user failure were excluded, these rates were increased to 93.6% for the cap and 95.4% for the diaphragm.  4% of cap users compared with only 1.7% of diaphragm users in this study developed abnormal Pap smears after 3 months of use in addition, a higher proportion of cap users became infected with Gardnerella vaginalis and Monilia.  Theoretical hazards include toxic shock syndrome and endometriosis due to backflow of menstrual fluids.  Cap users are advised to undergo a Pap test after 3 months of use and discontinue cap use if the results are abnormal.  The cap should not be used during menstruation.  Although the cap can be left in place for up to 48 hours, its position should be checked before and after each episode of intercourse.  The cervical cap requires less spermicide than the diaphragm and is not as messy.  In addition, it can be left in the vagina twice as long as the diaphragm, without additional spermicide.  Since the cap is smaller than the diaphragm and does not cover the vaginal wall, some women find intercourse more pleasurable with this device.
