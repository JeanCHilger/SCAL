Inhibitory effect of prolactin secretion by luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist (buserelin). The LH RH agonist Buserelin was continuously administered through the nose over an extended period to 5 patients with endometriosis at daily doses ranging between 300 micrograms and 1,200 micrograms. The clinical findings and endocrinological dynamics, with emphasis on PRL secretion function, were investigated and the findings below were obtained. The clinical findings showed Buserelin to be effective against endometriosis. The administration of Buserelin markedly inhibited the secretion of LH and FSH under LH-RH loading. The administration of Buserelin markedly inhibited the secretion of PRL and the degree of inhibition appeared to be dependent on the dose and duration of Buserelin administration. No correlation between E2 and PRL was observed during Buserelin administration. The findings suggest that Buserelin inhibits PRL secretion by direct CNS activity, not indirectly through inhibition of E2 production.
