Initial results in the treatment of endometriosis with the LH-RH analog buserelin. Twenty-six women, most of them with advanced endometriosis (Stage III according to Acosta), were treated for six months with the LH-RH agonist Buserelin. After initially increased liberation both of the gonadotropins as well as of the sexual steroids there was consecutive inhibition of gonadal function, especially after inhibition of FSH secretion. Within two to four weeks estradiol production was completely and lastingly suppressed in 21 of the 26 women. In three women it lasted for three months and in two women estradiol again rose up to three times during the period of observation. Correspondingly, 22 of the women suffered from hot flushes as early as within the first two months. Twenty of the 26 women became completely free of symptoms within four to six weeks, and a clear regression of the pain was recorded in another four. In two women the complaints persisted without change. Withdrawal bleeding of short duration occurred simultaneously with the intermittent increases in estradiol levels however, this bleeding usually caused little or no pain. Eleven of the 19 endometrium biopsies performed during therapy revealed a dormant endometrium, and only in one case was proliferated endomedium found, in the third month of treatment, in a stage of transition to hyperplasia. The remaining seven biopsies were insufficient for assessment. In seven women with advanced endometriosis, laparotomies were performed after drug treatment. Histologic study of the endometriosis tissue thus obtained revealed, except in the two nonresponders, cicatrized tissue with atrophic glands and severely reduced stroma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
