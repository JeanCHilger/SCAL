Clinical experiences in the treatment of endometriosis with the LH-RH analog buserelin with special reference to the post-therapy course. The current therapy study with 50 patients showed that a reversible down regulation of the ovaries is possible. Particularly in cases with severe endometriosis a rapid release of pain can usually be achieved. Further development of the disease could be prevented and in two third of the cases even a partial reduction of tumor size. Within 12 weeks after the therapy the cycle is normally stabilized. But in about 70% of the patients the typical complaints of endometriosis were recurrent. The advantage of this treatment is the high acceptance of the patients in comparison to steroid medication. In long term administration it is mandatory to control bone and lipid metabolism.
