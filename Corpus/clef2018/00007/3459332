Endometriosis of the rectovaginal septum. Diagnosis by fine needle aspiration cytology. The cytologic picture seen in two cases of rectovaginal endometriosis diagnosed by fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is presented in detail. The cell pattern differed considerably from that previously described in fluid specimens and more closely resembled the exfoliation observed in direct endometrial samples. No previous report appears to exist on the diagnosis of rectovaginal endometriosis by FNA.
