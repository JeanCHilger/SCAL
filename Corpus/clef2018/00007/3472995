Expression of CA 125 in adenomyosis. To investigate the histogenic and cytogenic localization of CA 125 in patients with adenomyosis, sections from 8 adenomyosis cases were expressed with monoclonal anti-CA 125 antibodies. Consequently, CA 125 proved to be present on the glandular epithelium localized in muscle layers of adenomyosis.
