Peritoneal fluid volume, estrogen, progesterone, prostaglandin, and epidermal growth factor concentrations in patients with and without endometriosis. Elevated prostaglandin (PG) levels in peritoneal fluid have been implicated as playing a role in infertility associated with endometriosis. This study was designed to measure peritoneal fluid levels of PG and other hormones that may influence PG release. Specific hormones measured included PGF2 alpha, PGE2, TxB2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, estrogen, progesterone, and epidermal growth factor. Peritoneal fluid volume and levels of estrogen, progesterone, and epidermal growth factor were significantly (P less than .05) increased during the secretory, as opposed to the proliferative, phase in both groups of patients, but no significant differences in these parameters were found between patients with and without endometriosis during either the proliferative or secretory phases. Although PG levels did not vary during the menstrual cycle in either group of patients, all four prostanoids were present in significantly (P less than .05) higher concentrations in patients with endometriosis as compared with patients without endometriosis. Furthermore, increased PG levels in patients with endometriosis appear to be due primarily to an increase in PG levels during the secretory phase of the cycle.
