Immobilization of spermatozoa by peritoneal fluid in sterile women. Preliminary results. Peritoneal fluid from sterile women where the state of the pelvis is changed by endometriosis, inflammation, infection, and in certain cases where it appears normal laparoscopically, can immobilise spermatozoa in minutes or hours. This toxicity against male gametes could be an explanation of the mechanism for such sterility. The tubes and the ovaries are bathed in this liquid in the periovulatory phase when they are largest in size. If these first observations are confirmed fully many theoretical, practical and therapeutic implications must follow.
