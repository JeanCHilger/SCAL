alpha-1-Antitrypsin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, actin, and myosin in uterine sarcomas. Fourteen cases of mixed m√ºllerian tumour (MMT) of the endometrium, six stromal sarcomas, five uterine leiomyosarcomas, and five leiomyomas were examined, using an immunoperoxidase technique, for the presence of alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (A1ACT), actin, and myosin. In addition, six cases of endometrial adenocarcinoma were examined for the presence of A1AT and A1ACT. Eleven MMT were positive for A1AT and 13 for A1ACT. All stromal sarcomas, four adenocarcinomas, four leiomyomas, and three leiomyosarcomas were positive for both. All leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas were positive for myosin as were seven. MMT and three stromal sarcomas. Four leiomyomas, four leiomyosarcomas, six MMT, and three stromal sarcomas were positive for actin. These findings are related to those in the normal uterus and their practical and theoretical significance discussed.
