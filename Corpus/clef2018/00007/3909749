Ultrasonography and computed tomography in adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder. Ultrasonography and computed tomography were performed in 4 patients with adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder of segmental or diffuse type. Cholecystectomy was performed in all cases, and the diagnosis of adenomyomatosis was confirmed histopathologically. Ultrasonography revealed diffuse or segmental thickening of the gallbladder wall with small intramural diverticula. Small stones were also found. The characteristic findings of adenomyomatosis at computed tomography were soft tissue density masses in the gallbladder fossa, associated with a well-delineated, distinct tumor-free space between the mass and the liver, and with small intramural diverticula and calcified stones within the mass. Ultrasonography and computed tomography demonstrate a characteristic appearance of adenomyomatosis.
