Cytosolic estradiol and progesterone receptors of normal and pathologic Fallopian tubes. The study of tubal cytosol receptors for estradiol and progesterone shows that they are (in comparison with normal tubes) less in number in post-infection cases (proximal or distal) and increased in number in proximal endometriotic lesions. These variations are only significant for the progesterone receptors. These results are compared with those in the literature, and their implications, concerning hormone treatments used together with microsurgical tubo-plasties, are discussed.
