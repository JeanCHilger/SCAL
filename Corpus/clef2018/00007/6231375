Correlations between laparoscopic and hysteroscopic findings in 497 women with otherwise unexplained infertility. Laparoscopy and hysteroscopy were undertaken simultaneously in 497 women presenting with otherwise unexplained infertility. Of them, 285 complained of primary infertility and 212 of secondary infertility. Laparoscopic evidence of pelvic inflammatory disease in the absence of endometriosis was noted in 103 patients with primary and in 108 women with secondary infertility. Lesions were noted on hysteroscopy in both groups as well as in 34% of women with normal laparoscopic examinations. No specific dependency could be demonstrated between any laparoscopically detected lesion and hysteroscopically detected lesion. A significant dependency was demonstrated only between a history of secondary infertility and uterine adhesions (chi 2 = 12.03, 1 df, p less than 0.01). While the combined endoscopic findings did not demonstrate any dependency, the findings of this study demonstrate the importance of hysteroscopy in assessing all patients with infertility, especially those with secondary infertility.
