Endocrine effects of danazol in the treatment of endometriosis. The effects of danazol therapy on circulating gonadotrophins, oestradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) binding capacity have been studied in eight patients with endometriosis. There was a significant rise in luteinizing hormone (LH) in the first week of treatment with a fall in oestradiol levels. There was a marked fall in SHBG in the first week which continued up to 4 weeks. It is concluded that danazol is not 'anti-gonadotrophic' as frequently claimed and that its therapeutic actions, side effects and the endocrine changes could be explained by an effect on SHBG production. The rationale of its use in other conditions requires reconsideration.
