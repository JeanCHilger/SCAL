Establishment and characterization of ovarian endometrioid carcinoma cell line. Ascitic fluid was obtained from a patient with ovarian endometrioid carcinoma. The cells obtained from the fluid were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 15% fetal calf serum at 37 degrees C under humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air. Epithelial colonies grew rapidly in the primary culture and we were able to remove them from the dish without contamination of fibroblastic cells. In the subculturing process, the cells were allowed to proliferate for over 2 years, developing 40 transfer generations. The morphology, chromosomes, and hormonal responses of the ensuing cell line were then documented.
