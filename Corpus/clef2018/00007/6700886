Endometriosis with ascites. Endometriosis associated with massive ascites is an unusual combination unknown to most practicing gynecologists. Only 11 cases have been reported since this entity was first described by Brews in 1954. The authors report an additional case recently encountered at the Bethesda Naval Hospital. A review of the literature and tabular comparison of similarities among patients are presented. The possible etiologic mechanisms of the ascites are explored and recommendations for diagnosis and appropriate management are provided.
