"Medical oophorectomy" using a long-acting GNRH agonist--a possible new approach to the treatment of endometriosis. Five women with endometriosis were given a daily dose of a potent long-acting GnRH agonist, D-Trp6-Pro9-Net-LHRH (GnRH-A) for 28 days in an attempt to suppress ovarian estrogen secretion. The mean level of estradiol (E2) during sampling over 24 hours decreased (P less than 0.01) from 62 +/- 11 to 10 +/- 1 pg/ml at the end of treatment. Mean concentrations of androstenedione, testosterone, estrone and E2 on day 28 of therapy were similar to those measured in oophorectomized women. The level of FSH was decreased (P less than 0.001) during GnRH-a, whereas that of LH was significantly (P less than 0.001) increased, suggesting differing intracellular control mechanisms for release of the two gonadotropins. Desensitization of the pituitary was demonstrated at the end of treatment by a complete lack of acute response of FSH or LH to the daily dose of GnRH-a. "Medical oophorectomy" provides a new approach to the treatment of endometriosis.
