Method for study and histological evaluation of the uterus (author's transl). The technique of examination and sampling of a cone biopsy or hysterectomy specimen fulfils precise criteria which make it possible to make or confirm a diagnosis and to evaluate prognosis on the basis of complete excision or the state of spread of the lesion. Routinely cone specimen is examined in at least six sections from the anterior lip and at least six from the posterior lip. The uterus must be weighed, measured, oriented, opened in the frontal plane and specimens taken with precise topographical identification, examination of the fresh specimen and of small but multiple and selected specimens is recommended.
