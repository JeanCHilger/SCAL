Disseminated adenomyomas of the abdominal and pelvic cavities: a case report. A case report of disseminated adenomyomas of the abdominal and pelvic cavities is presented. Although the pathogenesis of these benign tumors is still unresolved, the authors postulate that they develop from the differentiation into smooth muscle of a multi-potential cell that arises from endometrial stromal cells in an area of preexisting endometriosis. Based on the authors' experience, when multiple leiomyomas are found in the peritoneal cavity, it is wise to make serial sections to determine whether endometrial tissue is present. The clinician must be alert to the fact that on gross examination adenomyomas can mimic metastatic carcinoma. Differentiation is made only through histologic examination. In addition, since adenosarcoma arising from adenomyoma is a documented occurrence, careful examination of histologic sections of adenomyomas is essential to avoid making the wrong diagnosis.
