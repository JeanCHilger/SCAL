Autotransplantation of spleen tissue after traumatic spleen rupture (traumatic splenosis). A report of 4 cases. Report on 4 cases of traumatic splenosis (autotransplantation of splenic tissues) which were diagnosed 1 to 15 years after traumatic spleen rupture in childhood or adolescence. In 3 of the 4 cases traumatic splenosis was detected casually, the other case was misinterpreted during laparoscopy as endometriosis. Histologically the autotransplants reveal functional red and white splenic pulp. This may be significant for hematologic diseases. Although clinical signs are often lacking or noncharacteristic, knowledge of traumatic splenosis is important for surgeons, internists (laparoscopy!), gynecologists, and pathologists, because splenic autotransplantants are often misinterpreted as accessory spleens, hemangiomas, endometriosis or peritoneal metastases of melanoma.
