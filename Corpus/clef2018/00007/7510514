Primary squamous cell carcinomas of the endometrium. Clinico-pathologic data and histogenetic classification. Primary squamous cell carcinomas of the endometrium are rare tumours. We have studied 7 primary and 2 secondary squamous cell carcinomas immunohistochemically with anti-all-cytokeratin (KL 1), anti-CEA and anti-vimentin. The non-keratinizing carcinomas and the non-keratinizing component of the keratinizing carcinomas showed a strong expression of vimentin. Contrary to this, the keratinizing parts were strongly positive with anti-CEA. Additionally, some cases showed a direct transformation of the (dysplastic) glandular endometrial epithelium into neoplastic squamous cells. These findings suggest that the primary squamous cell carcinoma of the endometrium is the result of a bidirectional differentiation of pluripotent endometrial precursor cells. Like in other non-endometrioid adenocarcinomas, such metaplasias develop from pluripotent MÃ¼llerian epithelium. They show various differentiations, perhaps endocervical determination with keratinization and positive reaction against CEA or primitive endometrioid with squamous cell appearance, positive anti-vimentin reaction and non-keratinization.
