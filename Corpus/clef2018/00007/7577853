Histological impact of medical therapy--clinical implications. The medium- and long-term effects of gestrinone and danazol on the endometrium were examined in 36 patients with endometriosis. Endometrial biopsies were taken from each patient before treatment and after 3 and 6 months of treatment with 600 mg danazol daily (n = 17) or with 2.5 mg gestrinone twice weekly (n = 19). Endometrial samples were analysed by light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. At 3 months' treatment the endometria of patients treated with danazol appeared more atrophic than those of the women treated with gestrinone some cell organelle involution was evident in all patients. After 6 months of treatment a marked atrophy was observed in patients of both treatment groups. A complete involution of cytoplasmic organelles with cytoplasmic collapse and a shift of nucleoplasmic ratio in favour of the nucleus occurred in patients treated with danazol
