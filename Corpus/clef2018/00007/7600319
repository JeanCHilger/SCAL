Personal characteristics as risk factors of endometriosis. 203 patients with pelvic endometriosis, all Beijing resident, were collected from the Peking Union Medical College Hospital and the Beijing Obstetrical and Gynecological Hospital. The diagnosis of endometriosis was confirmed by pathological examination of surgical specimens in 186 patients and by aspiration of chocolate substance under laparoscopy in 17. Two population controls, age matched +/- 1 year, were randomly selected for each patient from the same residential area, after careful pelvic examinations and ultrasonographies. A questionnaire for any possible risk factors to endometriosis was developed and with this questionnaire a face to face interview for each subject was carried out by the trained interviewers. All interviews were tape recorded and calculated in a AST 386 computer. The continuous logistic regression for matched sites was used to obtain a maximum likelihood point and to control the potential confounding effects of selected variables. Relative risk (RR) substituted for odds ratio together with the 95% confidence intervals was estimated. All the results were adjusted for the variables of the model including some relevant factors of menstruation, pregnancy and contraception. An increased risk for endometriosis was found to be related to women who had a higher level of education. Even it was adjusted for age of first marriage and pregnancy, gravidity, parity, contraception and all other variables of the model, the relative risk was 1.84 for endometriosis. Therefore, it is the education level itself that plays a true role in development of endometriosis. Although there was a trend in risk for endometriosis in height, it was statistically insignificant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
