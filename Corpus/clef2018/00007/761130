Grey-scale ultrasonography for assessment of gynecologic pelvic masses. In a retrospective study the grey-scale ultrasonographic appearance of pelvic masses was correlated with the surgical findings in 93 patients. Of the masses found at the time of laparotomy 95% had been detected preoperatively. In most instances useful information about size, consistency and location of the mass was provided by ultrasonography. Certain pathologic entities produce a characteristic sonographic appearance, but there is a wide overlap for others. Data obtained by history-taking and physical examination must be integrated with the sonographic findings for a correct diagnosis.
