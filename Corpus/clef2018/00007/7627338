Hormonal serum profiles and follicular development after intramuscular and pulsatile intravenous administration of human menopausal gonadotrophin. A study was performed to compare, in a randomized way, the effect of pulsatile intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (im) human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) administration on hormonal serum profiles and follicular development in in vitro fertilization (IVF). Fourteen IVF patients participated in the study, aged between 20 and 40 years, with a normal endocrine profile, no hormonal medication used for at least 3 months previously, no endometriosis, both ovaries present and a normal male factor. Seven patients were treated with im hMG at a daily dose of 150 IU and seven patients with pulsatile i.v. hMG at a daily dose of 112.5 IU, in both cases in combination with buserelin. Ultrasonography was performed every other day during the stimulation phase and blood samples were collected once daily up to five times a day during the entire IVF cycle. Serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, 17 beta-oestradiol, progesterone and human chorionic gonadotrophin were determined. There were no differences in hormonal profiles between the two groups. The numbers of retrieved oocytes, fertilization rates and mean embryo quality were identical in this study, as was follicular growth. In conclusion, in the present randomized study no differences were observed in hormonal levels or follicular development after im and pulsatile i.v. hMG treatment.
