Carcinoembryonic antigen isotypes in tissue sections and loose cyst fluid cells of ovarian neoplasms. The aim of this study was to establish whether different subsets of ovarian neoplasms express a restricted isotype of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) which can be detected in solid tumors and detached cells. Sixty-one cases of mucinous, serous, endometrioid, and Krukenberg tumors were studied by immunohistochemistry using two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), commercial anti-CEA and D14 with a higher specificity for colorectal adenocarcinomas. The results with both antibodies showed a considerable degree of heterogeneity between cases of nonserous tumors, with a more restrictive pattern observed with the D14 MAb. The proportion of immunostained cells was comparable in tumors and fluids.
