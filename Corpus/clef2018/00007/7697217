Immunohistochemical analysis of p53 protein and 72 kDa heat shock protein (HSP72) expression in ovarian carcinomas. Correlation with clinicopathology and sex steroid receptor status. Mutations of the tumour suppressor p53 gene have been reported in a variety of human malignant tumours, and are frequently associated with overexpression of p53 protein. To examine the significance of p53 gene alteration in malignant epithelial tumours of the ovary, we studied the immunohistochemical reactivity with a monoclonal antibody against p53 (PAb 1801) in 6 ovarian tumours of low malignant potential (LMP) and 32 ovarian carcinomas. The existence of any correlation of p53 overexpression with the clinicopathological features and with the immunohistochemical expression of 72 kDa heat shock protein (HSP72) and sex steroid receptors (oestrogen receptors ER, progesterone receptors
