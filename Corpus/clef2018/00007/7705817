Genetic alterations on chromosome 17 distinguish different types of epithelial ovarian tumors. Epithelial tumors of the ovary are the most common ovarian tumors of adult women. They exist in several different histological patterns and exhibit varying degrees of aggressiveness. Molecular genetic studies in epithelial ovarian cancer have shown that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for regions of chromosome 17 is a common event, probably reflecting the inactivation of one or more tumor suppressor genes present on this chromosome. We examined 87 sporadic epithelial ovarian tumors of different grade and histological type at 16 loci on this chromosome and found that 35% of them showed LOH for chromosome 17. Of these, 84% showed LOH for all informative markers, suggesting that loss of the entire chromosome 17 homologue may have occurred. Interestingly, chromosome 17 loss was observed frequently in serous tumors (49%), was less common in endometrioid tumors (15%), and was rare in mucinous tumors (4%) (P = .01 and P = .0002, respectively). Our findings support the concept that the histological subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer may be the result of different molecular genetic events.
