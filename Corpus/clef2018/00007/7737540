Endometriosis in clinical materials from the years 1981-1990. In the group of 213 women with diagnosed endometriosis, after the histological analysis of the samples obtained during surgical procedure the following factors have been determined: the character and frequency of complaints, prevalence of the disease depending on the age of patients, it's localisation, coexistence with the neoplasms of the genital tract, indications for the surgical treatment and it's type. Taking into account the difficulties in diagnosing endometriosis, it's occurrence in young women and the possibility of malignant transformation along with the coexistence with malignant neoplasms of genital tract, we are convinced that the surgical intervention should be undertaken in order to achieve the better cure rate as well as to improve the accuracy of diagnosis.
