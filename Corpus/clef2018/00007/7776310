Sciatic nerve endometriosis treated with a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist. A case report. Sciatic nerve endometriosis was previously treated primarily with surgery. Most commonly hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy have been used however, two reports also describe successful conservative surgery with resection of the endometriosis from the sciatic nerve. Only one case of sciatic nerve endometriosis has been reported to have responded to medical management. This report details the rapid and complete resolution of sciatica secondary to endometriosis after medical treatment with the gonadotropin releasing hormone analog leuprolide acetate for depot suspension.
