Danazol suspension injected into the uterine cervix of patients with adenomyosis and myoma. Preliminary study. We investigated the effect of local injections of danazol suspension (DZS) into the uterine cervix. In the cervix, danazol (DZ) reached high concentrations 1 and 4-6 h after injection then it decreased. In the endometrium, the DZ level reached a peak 1 h after injection, and then declined. On the other hand, the DZ concentration tended to increase with time after injection in ovarian tissue and it remained at a relatively constant level for more than 2 days. During treatment with DZS, various subjective symptoms and clinical findings gradually improved from the 4th week after the start of injection onward. Moreover, an improvement of subjective symptoms was observed in all the patients by the 24th week.
