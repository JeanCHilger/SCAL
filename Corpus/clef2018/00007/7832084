Application of whole layer core biopsy of bladder wall to paravesical tumor. We have reported the usefulness of percutaneous or transurethral whole layer core biopsy (WLCB) of bladder wall for staging of invasive bladder cancer. We have applied WLCB to 3 cases of paravesical tumor with good results. The first case was in a 3-year-old boy suspected of retrovesical sarcoma. Percutaneous WLCB revealed an inflammatory tumor of the Douglas cavity which was probably caused by perforation of appendix. The tumor disappeared by antibiotics alone. The second case was in a 37-year-old female with retrovesical tumor suspected to be ovarial cancer because of the high value of CA19-9 and CA125. Transurethral WLCB showed invasion of endometriosis to bladder muscle layer. The third case was in a 75-year-old female diagnosed by transurethral WLCB as sigmoid colon cancer invading until the deep bladder muscle layer. Cold cup punch biopsy was not informative in these 3 cases. Percutaneous or transurethral WLCB is safe and easy to perform, and is a technique recommended for diagnosis of pathology and bladder invasion of paravesical tumor.
