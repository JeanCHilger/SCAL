Expression of integrin adhesion molecules in endometrium and endometriosis. To compare the expression of cell adhesion molecules by endometrium and endometriosis.A comparative study of integrin expression, determined immunohistochemically, in eutopic and ectopic endometrium biopsied synchronously from patients with endometriosis diagnosed at laparoscopy or laparotomy.University Departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and Pathology, Southampton Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Newcastle upon Tyne.Eighteen paired samples of endometria and endometriosis.A wide distribution of collagen-laminin receptor proteins was demonstrated. alpha 1 integrin expression was limited to secretory endometrium. beta 3 expression was only demonstrated on proliferative endometrium.Expressions of the integrin proteins differed between the various elements of the endometrium. Cyclical changes in integrin expression also were demonstrated. No difference in cell adhesion molecule expression was seen when comparing endometrial and endometriosis samples.
