Transforming growth factor-beta activity is increased in peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis. To investigate the presence of transforming growth factor-beta in peritoneal fluid of women with and without endometriosis.Fifty-two peritoneal fluid samples, obtained during laparoscopies performed for tubal ligation (n = 10), infertility (n = 38), or pain (n = 4), were examined for the presence of transforming growth factor-beta using the Mv1Lu cell growth inhibition assay. At laparoscopy, 26 women had endometriosis. The other 26 women had no endometriosis 16 of them had infertility, and ten who had no pelvic pathology at tubal sterilization served as fertile controls.The concentration of transforming growth factor-beta was increased in the peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis (11.4 +/- 3.3 ng/mL) compared to both the fertile control group without endometriosis (1.1 +/- 0.29 ng/mL) and the infertile control group without endometriosis (3.6 +/- 1.4 ng/mL). Twenty-five of the 52 women (48%) demonstrated levels of transforming growth factor-beta higher than 2 ng/mL. Patients with endometriosis were significantly more likely to have elevated concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta than were women without endometriosis (16 of 26, 61.5%, versus nine of 26, 34.6%).These findings demonstrate the presence of transforming growth factor-beta in peritoneal fluid. Elevated levels in women with endometriosis could be important in the pathophysiology of this disease.
