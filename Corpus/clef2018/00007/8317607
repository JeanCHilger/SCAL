Minimal-deviation endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. A report of five cases of a distinctive neoplasm that may be misinterpreted as benign. We describe five cervical adenocarcinomas with unusual, deceptively benign histological features that occurred in women 34 to 42 years of age and caused problems in interpretation. The tumors were incidental findings in hysterectomy or cone-biopsy specimens in four patients the fifth patient was investigated because abnormal glandular cells were found on a Papanicolaou smear. One patient had been exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol. The cervix is known to have been abnormal on gross evaluation in only one case. Microscopic examination disclosed a deceptively benign-appearing proliferation of glands and cysts for the most part unassociated with a stromal reaction. Cilia were present in four neoplasms and apical snouts in three. Features that indicated the neoplastic nature of the glandular proliferation in these cases, to varying extents in individual cases, included the number of glands and their distribution, the shapes of the glands, their presence deep in the cervical wall, the focal presence of a stromal reaction, and moderate cytologic atypicality with occasional mitotic figures. None of the tumors is known to have recurred or metastasized. In our opinion, these distinctive neoplasms represent minimal-deviation endometrioid adenocarcinomas of the cervix.
