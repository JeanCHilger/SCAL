Endometriosis and luteal phase defect. It has been reported that there exists a correlation between endometriosis and the luteal phase defect (LPD) as one of the determinants in infertility. In some theories, the hampered maturation of the corpus luteum is believed to be caused by the reduction of LH receptors, increase in prolactin, prostaglandin and macrophages in endometriosis. The purpose of this clinical study is to prove the hypothesis that there exists a significant correlation between endometriosis and the luteal phase defects in infertility. The samples were taken at random from 150 women with infertile marriages on whom ovulation was assumed to have occurred, from January 1981 to December 1985. The assumption that there might have occurred ovulation is determined through the observation of their basal body temperature (BBT) chart. Endometrium biopsies to diagnose the LPD were taken at the end of their luteal phase. A laparoscopy examination to diagnose the pelvic endometriosis was done in the following cycle. Of 84 patients with endometriosis, 44 (55.4%) had luteal phase defects, while the remaining 40 (47.6%) patients had no luteal phase defects. Of the 66 patients without endometriosis, 27 (40.9%) had luteal phase defects, while the remaining 39 (59.1%) did not have luteal phase defects. These differences were not significant (p > 0.05). In summary, this clinical study fails to show the existence of significant correlation between endometriosis and the luteal phase defect.
