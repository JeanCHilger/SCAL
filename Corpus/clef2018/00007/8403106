Morphology, immunohistochemistry and differential diagnosis of 70 cases of adenocarcinoma of uterine cervix. Seventy cases of cervical adenocarcinoma were classified into five types, namely: mucinous adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mixed adenosquamous carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinoma and clear cell carcinoma. According to the morphological features, the results of mucin and immunohistochemical stainings, the histogenesis of cervical endometrioid adenocarcinoma and the differential diagnosis between cervical adenocarcinoma and endometrioid adenocarcinoma are discussed. The significance of vimentin staining for the differential diagnosis is also evaluated.
