Heparin-sepharose binding growth factors in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. To characterize and to purify the growth substances for mouse embryo fibroblasts (NIH/3T3) and endometrial-like cells of the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis.A pool of 102 mL of peritoneal fluid (PF) collected from 24 women with laparoscopic evidence of endometriosis was dialyzed and thereafter chromatographed onto carboxymethyl (CM)-sepharose, heparin-sepharose, cartridges of C18 silica, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (reverse-phase HPLC). Mitogenic activity throughout various steps of chromatography was monitored by the increase of the (3H)-thymidine incorporation into NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and enzymatically isolated epithelial cells of rabbit endometrium.Peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis contained mitogen(s) for NIH/3T3 fibroblasts that were retained on and eluted from CM-sepharose, heparin-sepharose, cartridges of C18 silica, and reverse-phase HPLC columns performed sequentially. Mitogenic material purified 2,500-fold exerted bioactivity on NIH/3T3 and the enzymatically isolated epithelial cells from rabbit endometrium.Peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis contains heparin-binding growth factors that can be purified by sequential chromatography on CM-sepharose, heparin-sepharose, and reverse-phase HPLC columns. The presence in the PF of potent mitogens for fibroblasts and endometrium-derived epithelial cells could play an important role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
