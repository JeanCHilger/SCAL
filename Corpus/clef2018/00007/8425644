Pregnancy after medical therapy of adenomyosis with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. A patient with long-standing secondary infertility was explored for myomectomy, at which time severe adenomyosis was found. A 6-month course of nafarelin acetate resulted in resolution of dysmenorrhea and uterine enlargement. The patient conceived quickly. Although the patient spontaneously aborted, this report presents the first in which medical therapy of adenomyosis is associated with successful treatment of infertility.
