Umbilical endometriosis. A case report. Umbilical endometriosis is a rare site of the disease. The authors report a case of umbilical endometriosis only. Umbilical involvement is estimated at 0.5 to 1% of all site of the disease. This is a disorder affecting women of childbearing age, with a mean age of about 40. Medical treatment by progestogens or Danazol is inconstantly and partially effective regarding umbilical endometriosis. Surgical excision remains the only effective treatment: omphalectomy with wide removal of the tumor and reconstruction of an umbilicus. Surgery enables histologic study and, in the presence of suggestive symptomatology, search for and treatment of other genital sites.
