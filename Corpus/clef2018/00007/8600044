Expression of epidermal growth factor family proteins and epidermal growth factor receptor in human endometrium. The biological significance of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related proteins in the development and progression of endometrioid endometrial carcinoma was studied. Expression of EGF-related proteins including EGF, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), cripto (CR), amphiregulin (AR), and EGF receptor (EGFR) were immunohistochemically examined. Results were then correlated with clinicopathologic findings and steroid receptor status in 12 specimens with normal endometrium, 13 with endometrial hyperplasia, and 40 with endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. EGFR, EGF, TGF-alpha, and CR immunoreactivities were observed in 58.3%, 66.7%, 91.6%, and 66.7% of normal endometrial specimens 100%, 15.4%, 100%, and 30.8% of endometrial hyperplasia specimens
