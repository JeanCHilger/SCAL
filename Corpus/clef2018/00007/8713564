Extrinsic ureteral endometriosis: diagnostic laparoscopic contribution. A case of extrinsic ureteral endometriosis diagnosed with laparoscopy is described. Endometriosis, a common disease in premenopausal women, should be considered in differential diagnosis in patients with ureteral obstruction. Usually, the diagnosis of ureteral involvement is made at surgery. Laparoscopy is, therefore, an important diagnostic aid in women with distal ureteral obstruction not attributable to calculous.
