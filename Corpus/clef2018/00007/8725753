Use of optical catheters for diagnostic office laparoscopy. To evaluate several small optical catheters (1.8-mm outer diameter) developed to allow access to the pelvic cavity for laparoscopic diagnosis in the operating room and in an office setting.Thirty-six procedures are reported, 20 performed in the operating room so that proper placement could be monitored and ensured, and the findings were compared with those obtained with a standard, 10-mm laparoscope. The remaining 16 procedures were performed in an office setting. The patients were women who were candidates for second-look laparoscopy, had pelvic pain and no physical findings, or were evaluated for possible tubal anastomosis.The small, rigid catheter, with its excellent optics, provided a clear view of the pelvis without the need for general anesthesia and associated costs. The procedure was performed easily and successfully with a local anesthetic and with minimal discomfort for the patient.
