Diagnostic methods in endometriosis. The overall accuracy of preoperative diagnosis is approximately 20% with a range of 4-83%. We investigated 100 women at the age between 27-61 years, operated with histologically proven endometriosis and we made an attempt to analyse some of the diagnostic methods. Abrasio probatoria was made in 17 of the operated women prior to operation. The hystological result from the abrasive material was not indicative for the presence of endometriosis. Ultrasound examination was made on 24 operated women with endometriosis, but no one diagnosed endometriosis despite the description by many authors of characteristic ultrasound picture of endometriosis. Hysterosalpingography was made in 3 women with the endometriosis but despite the specific x-ray picture for endometriosis they were not diagnosed correctly. These data support the opinion of some authors that these diagnostic methods are not specific for endometriosis.
