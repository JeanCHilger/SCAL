Soluble CD46 (membrane cofactor protein, MCP) in human reproductive tract fluids. CD46 (membrane cofactor protein, MCP) is a cell surface complement regulatory protein which may have an additional role in human sperm-egg interaction. A soluble form (sCD46) has also been detected in a number of biological fluids, most notably seminal plasma. The present study has employed a monoclonal antibody-based ELISA to assay sCD46 in reproductive tract fluids in normal and pathological conditions. Large amounts of sCD46 were detected in seminal plasma of both fertile and infertile men (combined mean, 4859 ng/ml). Vasectomized men had lower levels (mean, 2421 ng/ml), indicating contributory sources both before and after the vas deferens ligation site. Pre-colostrum also contained relatively high quantities (mean, 445 ng/ml), whereas breast milk (mean, 117 ng/ml), peritoneal fluid (mean, 154 ng/ml) and follicular fluid (mean, 107 ng/ml), as well as uterine (mean, 208 ng/ml), umbilical (mean, 166 ng/ml) and peripheral (mean, 206 ng/ml) blood plasma, had sCD46 levels within a comparable range. Amniotic fluid had low sCD46 concentrations (mean, 22 ng/ml). In endometriosis, peritoneal fluid levels of sCD46 were significantly raised (mean, 199 mg/ml). These results indicate distinctive fluid compartmentalisation of sCD46 consistent with a biological function in human reproductive tract fluids.
