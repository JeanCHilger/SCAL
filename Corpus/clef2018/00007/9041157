A strong prognostic variable in endometrial carcinoma: flow cytometric S-phase fraction. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of flow cytometric S-phase fraction as a prognostic factor in patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma.The study included 80 patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma of endometrioid type who were followed regularly between 1984-1995 in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine in Istanbul, Turkey. The method employed for the flow cytometric analysis was modified from Hedley et al.The S-phase fraction was identified as the most significant variable associated with death from endometrial carcinoma of endometrioid type by the Cox proportional hazards model. The risk of death was significantly higher in patients with S-phase values greater than 20%. Aneuploidy and DNA indexes were also significant prognostic variables.The S-phase fraction is considered to be a significant prognostic variable in identifying those patients with endometrial carcinoma who have a poor prognosis. The authors believe that S-phase fraction distinguishes those patients who may benefit from additional treatment approaches.
