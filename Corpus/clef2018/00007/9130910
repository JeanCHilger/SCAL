Müllerian-inhibiting substance in follicular fluid and serum: a comparison of patients with tubal factor infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome, and endometriosis. To determine Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS) levels in follicular fluid (FF) and sera of IVF patients.Prospective study.Fertility center.Sixty-six patients: 20 with tubal factor infertility, 17 with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and 29 with endometriosis.All patients underwent ovarian stimulation with hMG and/or FSH, as well as oocyte retrieval for IVF.Follicular fluid and serum MIS levels and oocyte fertilization rates.Levels of MIS in FF and sera of PCOS patients were significantly higher than those in tubal factor patients: 7.01 +/- 1.52 versus 1.65 +/- 0.23 ng/mL (mean +/- SE) and 2.97 +/- 0.52 versus 0.92 +/- 0.19 ng/mL, respectively. In endometriosis patients, follicular fluid and serum MIS levels were not significantly different from those in tubal factor patients. In PCOS patients, the percentage of immature oocytes retrieved (17.9% +/- 5.0%) was significantly higher compared with tubal factor (1.5% +/- 1.0%) and endometriosis (9.2% +/- 2.3%) patients. The percentage of oocytes fertilize was significantly lower in PCOS patients (30.2% +/- 5.3%) compared with tubal factor (62.2% +/- 5.5%) and endometriosis (37.5% +/- 5.7%) patients.Women with PCOS had higher serum and follicular fluid MIS levels, a higher percentage of immature oocytes, and lower fertilization rates than women with endometriosis or pelvic adhesions.
