Differential expression of IGF-I and IGF-II in eutopic and ectopic endometria of women with endometriosis and in women without endometriosis. Factors regulating the development, growth, and differentiation of endometrial cells of endometriotic lesions are poorly understood. To investigate the paracrine-autocrine regulation of ectopic endometrial cell growth, the expression of IGF-I and IGF-II were studied.Tissue specimens of eutopic and ectopic endometria were obtained from eight patients with endometriosis at laparoscopy and from the endometria of 14 women without endometriosis as controls. They were tested for the expression of IGF-I and IGF-II by immunohistochemical analysis.Immunohistochemical study for IGF-I in controls showed a more intense staining during the proliferative phase both in stromal and epithelial cells. In eutopic endometria of women with endometriosis a reduction in the staining was observed, whereas in epithelial cells of fibrotic peritoneal adhesions an intense immunostaining for IGF-I was observed. Immunohistochemical study of IGF-II in controls showed a more intense staining during secretory phase both in stromal and epithelial cells. In eutopic endometria of women with endometriosis, a reduction in the staining was observed, whereas in epithelial cells of fibrotic peritoneal adhesions an intense immunostaining for IGF-I was observed. Immunohistochemical study of IGF-II in controls showed a more intense staining during secretory phase both in stromal and epithelial cells. In eutopic endometria of women with endometriosis, a reduction in the staining was observed, whereas in epithelial cells of ovarian lesions and fibrotic peritoneal adhesions, no immunostaining for IGF-II was observed.In endometriosis there is an alteration of mechanisms regulating cell proliferation and differentiation.
