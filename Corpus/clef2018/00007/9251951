Local immune response in infertile patients with minimal endometriosis. To evaluate the role of local immunity in women with minimal endometriosis.Uterine endometrium and endometrial implants were obtained simultaneously from 30 infertile women with minimal endometriosis and examined immunohistochemically using antibodies of T cell, B cell, macrophage, Langerhans cell, immunoglobulin (Ig)G, and complement (C) 3d. Serum IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, antinuclear antibody and anti-DNA antibody were also examined in 24 of the women. Data from uterine endometrium and serum were compared with 10 fertile women without endometriosis as a control.Microscopic examination revealed that the endometrial implants were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 13) showed lymphocytic infiltration in the endometrial implants and group 2 (n = 17) showed no or slight lymphocytic infiltration. The endometrial implants of group 1 showed significantly more dense T-cell infiltration than those of group 2. Other types of infiltrating cells and deposits of IgG and C3d revealed no significant differences between groups 1 and 2. The immunohistochemical examination of the uterine endometrium and the serum data revealed no significant differences among all three groups. Cumulative pregnancy rates showed no significant difference between groups 1 and 2.The difference of local immune response in endometrial implants did not affect systemic immunity.
