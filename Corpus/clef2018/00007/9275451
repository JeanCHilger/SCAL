The value of serum CA125 assays in the diagnosis of uterine adenomyosis. To investigate the value of serum CA125 assays in the diagnosis of uterine adenomyosis.Fifty-five consecutive patients with uterine-adenomyosis and twenty with leiomyoma of uterus, diagnosed by surgery and pathology were studied. The blood samples were taken one day before operation. Twenty normal healthy women were served as controls. CA125 levels were determined by radioimmunoassay method.The median (M) CA125 levels (Ql-Qu) for patients with adenomyosis, leiomyoma and normal controls were 102.1 (56.3-182.1)kU/L, 34.6 (33.7-43.8)kU/L and 33.1 (32.7-33.8)kU/L respectively. The differences among the three groups were all significant (P < 0.01). The CA125 positive rates (CA125 > 50kU/L) for the above three groups were 80.0%, 10.0% and 5.0% respectively. Patients with adenomyosis had a higher CA125 positive rate than those with leiomyoma or normal controls (P < 0.001). For patients with adenomyosis the CA125 levels were positively correlated with uterine size (r = 0.33, P < 0.05). The adenomyosis patients treating with sex hormone preparations were found to have lower CA125 levels in comparison with non-users (P < 0.05). The mean CA125 level measured in sixteen patients decreased significantly one week postoperation.Serum CA125 assay is of great assistance to the diagnosis of uterine adenomyosis as well as to the differential diagnosis between adenomyosis and leiomyoma of uterus.
