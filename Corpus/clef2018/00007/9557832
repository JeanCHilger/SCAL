The role of transvaginal ultrasonography in the detection of pelvic pathologies in the infertility workup. To assess the efficiency of transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) in the screening of pelvic pathologies in the initial workup of infertile women, we carried out a prospective comparison of sonographic diagnosis with laparoscopic and pathological findings. Between February 1994 and April 1995, 133 premenopausal non-pregnant women underwent TVUS on the day before laparoscopy. The efficiency of TVUS in detecting pelvic pathologies was 90.2% with a sensitivity of 86.2%, a specificity of 97.8% and positive and negative predictive values of 98.6 and 78.8% respectively. If the six false-negative cases with a histological diagnosis of minimal endometriosis were defined as 'normal pelvis', sensitivity and specificity could be corrected to 92.5 and 98.6% respectively. Endometriomas were diagnosed by TVUS with an efficiency of 96.4%, with a sensitivity and a specificity of 90 and 96.7 % and with positive and negative predictive values of 75 and 99.1% respectively. The sensitivity of vaginal sonographic characterization of pelvic adhesions was 61.1% with a specificity and positive predictive value of 98.2 and 84.6%. The negative predictive value of TVUS was 94.1%. These data suggest that it is not possible to characterize pelvic adhesions, especially filmy adhesions, with acceptable accuracy. However, in the initial workup of infertile women, if the patient is young, if both hysterosalpingography and TVUS are negative, laparoscopy could be postponed. In couples with severe male factor infertility and for whom in-vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection is the treatment of choice, laparoscopy might be avoided where the TVUS is negative.
