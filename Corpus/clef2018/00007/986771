Cellular hypersensitivity in patients with adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. Cellular hypersensitivity was studied in patients with adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with the use of dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) skin tests and inhibition of leukocyte migration by homologous and autologous tumor antigen. Inhibition of leukocyte migration by homologous endometrial carcinoma antigen was found in two of five patients with adenomatous hyperplasia and eight of 11 patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma. A comparable degree of inhibition was found with autologous antigen. DNCB skin reactions were found to be strongly positive in patients with adenomatous hyperplasia, and a lesser degree of reactivity was observed in patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma. No correlation was found between leukocyte migration tests and DNCB reactions, and no correlation was observed between these tests and the age of the patient, clinical stage of disease, or histologic grade of the tumor.
