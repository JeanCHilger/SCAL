Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and hepatocyte growth factor in human endometriosis: original investigation and a review of literature. Defects in the cell-mediated immune system may play a role in the pathogenesis or progression of pelvic endometriosis. Possible mediators include macrophages, interleukins-1 and -6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. More recent work points to the involvement of adhesion molecules and growth factors. To clarify the pathogenesis of endometriosis, we compared the characteristics of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (soluble ICAM-1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in women with and without endometriosis. We found that, in patients with endometriosis, the concentrations of soluble ICAM-1 in peritoneal fluid increased and interfered with the activity of natural killer cells. We also found that HGF secretion was significantly increased in cultured endometrial stromal cells, and that HGF stimulated the proliferation and migration of, and morphogenic changes in, endometrial epithelial cells. HGF and ICAM-1 play important roles in the initiation and regulation of endometriotic lesions on the microenvironment level. The increased secretion of HGF by eutopic endometrial stromal cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis, whereas the increased levels of soluble ICAM-1 may impair natural killer cell activity and accelerate the progression of the disease.
