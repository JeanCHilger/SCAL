Cytotoxic activity of NK cells in the presence of the peritoneal fluid fro women with unexplained infertility and with endometriosis related infertility. We examined peritoneal fluid obtained during laparoscopy in the aspect of its influence on cytotoxic activity of NK cells. We showed significant suppression of this activity in women with unexplained infertility. The suppression of NK activity was also present in women fertile and infertile both, with severe endometriosis. These results may indicate the immunological disorders in unexplained infertility and in endometriosis-related infertility.
