Color and power doppler ultrasonographic measurement of the uterine blood flow in subfertile women with unstimulated cycles. We have assessed the usefulness of color and power Doppler velocimetry in uterine and radial arteries in a group of subfertile women who were referred for infertility treatment. The study group comprised of 44 women monitored at 7-10th, 11-14th and 15-18th day of unstimulated cycle. The control group comprised of 14 women who were monitored for the intrauterine insemination due to male factor and who had normal pelvis on laparoscopy and ovulatory cycles. Following study groups were evaluated: 11 women with endometriosis, 10 women with tubal factor, 12 patients with anovulatory cycles and 11 women with unexplained infertility. We have found a significant increase in uterine artery PI in early luteal phase of the cycle in women with endometriosis, with tubal factor and with unexplained infertility. Elevated uterine artery PI was also found in women with anovulatory cycles between 7th and 10th day of the study. Using power Doppler sonography we were able to detect subendometrial blood flow in 92% of control women and in 75% to 91% of patients in other studied groups. Significant increase in radial artery PI was found between 15th and 18th day of cycle in women with unexplained infertility and with anovulatory cycles. The present results suggest that increased impedance to blood flow may be regarded as possible cause of infertility. Larger studies with comparison to conception rates are needed to validate clinically this hypothesis.
