Results of diagnostic pelviscopy in cases of chronic recurrent pelvic disease. During the last two years we have performed diagnostic pelviscopy in 90 patients suffering from a syndrome of chronic repeated pelvic disease. In 44 patients extragenital endometriosis was diagnosed as the causing factor. In 15 cases we found wide-spread adhesions in the region of the lower pelvis after preceeding laparotomies. Only in 12 patients pelvic-alterations caused by chronic inflammatory processes of the adnexa with peritubal adhesions were discovered. As these results show extragenital endometriosis represents in far more cases as generally believed the cause of gynecological pains. We want to give special emphasis to the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.
