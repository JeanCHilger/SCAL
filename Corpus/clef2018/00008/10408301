Endometriosis of the urinary bladder. Although every seventh or eighth case of endometriosis is found to have urinary involvement, this type of endometriosis is still rarely recognized. The symptoms are not specific and are frequently suggestive of a neoplastic process. On the basis of our two cases of histopathologically two types of endometriosis as well as literature review the practical significance of endometriosis in urology is described. In each patient who previously underwent a gynaecological or surgical procedure in the abdominal cavity, endometriosis of the bladder is likely to occur. This possibility should not be ruled out, otherwise it could lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.
