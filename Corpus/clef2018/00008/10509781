Hysteroscopic myometrial biopsy in unexplained abnormal uterine bleeding. To define the value of hysteroscopic myometrial biopsy in unexplained abnormal uterine bleeding not responding to hormonal treatment and to compare two hysteroscopic biopsy techniques.A prospective cross-sectional comparative study.Gynecologic Endoscopy Unit, Assiut University Hospital, Egypt.It comprised 99 patients with abnormal uterine bleeding who underwent transvaginal ultrasonography, endometrial biopsy and diagnostic hysteroscopy, which revealed no local lesions.Operative hysteroscopy was performed for 62 of them (group A). Hysteroscopic myometrial biopsies were taken using rigid biopsy forceps and the resectoscope successively guided by the previous ultrasonography of the myometrium. Thirty-seven patients (group B) underwent total abdominal hysterectomy followed by multiple full-thickness myometrial biopsies of the specimens.Pathologic myometrium was diagnosed in 12 (19%), 27 (43%) and 21 (56.5%) biopsies taken with the rigid biopsy forceps and the resectoscope (group A) and full-thickness biopsies (group B) respectively. Thirty biopsies (48%) taken with the rigid biopsy forceps were inadequate for proper histopathologic assessment while thermal effect was excessive in only four biopsies (6%) taken with the resectoscope. Honeycomb sonographic appearance was specific in prediction of adenomyosis.Resectoscopic myometrial biopsy can explain the cause of persistent abnormal uterine bleeding in about 43% of cases. Myometrial biopsy using the rigid biopsy forceps is inadequate and is not recommended.
