Allelotyping defines minimal imbalance at chromosomal region 17q25 in non-serous epithelial ovarian cancers. Allelic deletions of multiple chromosome 17q loci in sporadic ovarian cancer of epithelial origin suggest that inactivation of tumor suppressor gene(s) in these regions may be important for ovarian tumorigenesis. To further define the pattern of allelic imbalance in epithelial ovarian tumors of different histologies, a PCR-based assay was used to assess loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of polymorphic markers representative of TP53, BRCA1, NME1 and GH1, and region 17q23-25. LOH was observed for at least one marker in 68% of malignant tumors (n=60) and in 18% tumors of borderline malignancy (n=11), but not in benign tumors (n=5). The highest frequency of LOH in malignant tumors (64%) was observed with D17S801 on 17q25. Ten of 39 malignant ovarian tumors displaying LOH of at least one 17q marker, displayed a LOH pattern enabling the determination of a minimal region of overlapping deletion defined by D17S795 and D17S801. One borderline tumor also displayed an interstitial LOH pattern that overlapped this 17q25 minimal region of deletion. The histologies of malignant tumors displaying a pattern indicative of interstitial 17q deletions were of the endometrioid, clear cell and mucinous epithelial types. As the minimal region of overlap defined by these tumors overlap regions deleted in malignant tumors of all histologic types, and in a tumor of borderline malignancy, the 17q25-tumor suppressor may be implicated in the development of all types of epithelial ovarian tumors.
