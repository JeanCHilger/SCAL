Expression of leptin receptor in human endometrium and fluctuation during the menstrual cycle. Leptin is secreted by adipocytes and regulates appetite through interaction with hypothalamic leptin receptors (OB-R). Accumulated evidence shows that leptin is involved in the stimulation of reproductive functions and that local expression of leptin and OB-R in the ovary, oocyte, embryo, and placenta plays a role in early development. To investigate the role of leptin in implantation, we examined the expression of OB-R and leptin in the human endometrium. Northern and Western blot analyses and RT-PCR showed that the long form of OB-R (OB-R(L)) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein were expressed. In contrast, leptin mRNA or protein was not detected. All of the splice variants of OB-R (OB-R(T)) and OB-R(L) transcripts were expressed in 90% and 84% of the cases, respectively. OB-R mRNA expression peaked in the early secretory phase. Decidual tissue of early gestation also expressed OB-R(T) and OB-R(L). Their incidence and abundance were comparable among endometria with benign uterine diseases and disease-free endometria and were not related to a body mass index within the normal range. The present results indicate that OB-R, but not leptin, is expressed in the human endometrium.
