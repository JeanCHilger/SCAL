Secretion of inhibin B during ovarian stimulation is decreased in infertile women with endometriosis. To determine the levels and pattern of inhibin B secretion during ovarian stimulation in patients with endometriosis and to evaluate the correlation between inhibin B levels and variables of follicular and oocyte development.Retrospective cohort study.IVF center.Women with endometriosis (n = 20) and tubal factor (n = 10) as the only cause of infertility.Inhibin B levels were measured during gonadotropin stimulation on day 1, days 8-11, day of hCG administration, and oocyte retrieval.Patterns and levels of inhibin B secretion were compared in the two groups. Other variables analyzed were age, days of gonadotropin stimulation and total ampules used, oocytes retrieved, and the fertilization and pregnancy rate.Inhibin B levels and number of oocytes retrieved were significantly lower in patients with endometriosis than in the control group. Two patterns of inhibin B secretion were noted: It peaked in the midfollicular phase or on the day of hCG administration. In contrast, E2 levels peaked on the day of hCG administration. Inhibin B in the midfollicular phase in both groups correlated positively with number of oocytes retrieved. In addition, E2 and inhibin B levels in the midfollicular phase correlated positively.Decreased inhibin B secretion in patients with endometriosis suggests impaired granulosa cell function. Inhibin B may serve as an alternate marker to assess follicular development or to predict the number of oocytes retrieved.
