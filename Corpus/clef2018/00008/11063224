MRI facilitated a diagnosis of endometriosis of the rectum. A 51-year-old pre-menopausal Japanese woman suffering from chronic lower abdominal pain was referred to our hospital. A barium enema showed a stenotic lesion in the recto-sigmoid region, and a pelvic computed axial tomography (CAT) scan revealed a thickened rectal wall. A colonoscopic examination showed the rectum to be constrictive, but the mucosa appeared to be intact. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with T1 high-intensity revealed a cystic lesion in the thickened wall of the rectum, which led us to suspect possible bowel endometriosis. Part of the biopsy specimen showed endometrial epithelium within the interstitial layer of histologically normal mucosa finally, endometriosis of the rectum was diagnosed. The patient became asymptomatic after the initiation of hormonal treatment and later experienced spontaneous menopause. MRI was effective for diagnosis and the patient did not undergo unnecessary laparotomy. Although bowel endometriosis is generally diagnosed by means of resected specimens, in our patient, diagnosis was made using MRI and biopsy, and hormonal therapy had an effective role as a bridge to menopause.
