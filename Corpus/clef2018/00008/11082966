Antiphospholipid autoantibodies in women treated for infertility. To evaluate an occurrence of selected antiphospholipid antibodies (APL) in infertility women.An enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) has been used to determine a titre of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA). APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) and PT (prothrombin time) measurements and direct commercial assay have been also used to study occurrence of LAC (lupus anticoagulant antibodies). The group of 268 observed women has been divided into five subgroups according to the cause of infertility: I-endometriosis, II-tubal occlusion caused by others diseases than endometriosis, III-occurrence of antisperm antibodies (ASA), IV-polycystic ovariorum syndrome (PCOS) and V-unexplained etiology. Results have been compared to 44 healthy controls.Occurrence of ACA has been found statistically more often in patients suffering from infertility than in controls (17.9% vs 4.5%, p < 0.05). Moreover ACA have been statistically more often observed in patients with endometriosis (21 from 44, 47.7%). ACA were more common in patients with other cause of infertility (except PCOS) compared to controls, though statistically this was not significant. Frequency of ACA was also more common than LAC (17.9% vs 13.6%). Compared to controls LAC tests were more often positive in infertile women with endometriosis (I), tubal occlusion (II) and with the occurrence of antisperm antibodies (III) but results were not statistically significant.Antiphospholipid antibodies are observed more often in patients suffering from infertility compared to women with a regular fertility. This suggests a role of APL in etiology of infertility. The occurrence of anticardiolipin antibodies in almost every second woman suffering from endometriosis suggests existing of autoimmunologic disturbances in this disease.
