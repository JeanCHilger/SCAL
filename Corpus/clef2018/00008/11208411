Diagnosis and treatment of sigmoidal endometriosis--a case report. Intestinal endometriosis is a rare but clinically significant complication. The most commonly involved sites are the rectosigmoid (up to 73%) and rectovaginal septum (13%). A case of a 53-year-old woman with intestinal endometriosis located in the sigmoid colon is presented with symptoms of pelvic pain and rectal bleeding. The diagnosis was established by means of colonoscopy which was performed 3 times before laparotomy. Bowel resection and pathologic study are necessary to relieve the symptoms and avoid neglecting a malignant tumor or other lesions. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged after 13 days.
