Expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in peritoneal endometriotic cells. It is well known that the number of peritoneal macrophages is increased in patients with pelvic endometriosis. We measured the concentration of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the peritoneal fluid of women with and without endometriosis. The expression of MCP-1 in pelvic endometriotic lesions obtained from the peritoneum was also examined using immunohistochemistry and nonradioactive in situ hybridization. The mean concentration of MCP-1 in the peritoneal fluid was significantly higher in the patients with endometriosis (P<0.05). The most significant elevation, compared with non-endometriosis patients, was found in stage I of the disease (P<0.05). However, no statistically significant difference was found among endometriosis stages I, II, III, and IV. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that MCP-1-positive cells were localized in the glandular epithelium of the endometriotic lesions and in the stromal macrophages distributed in those lesions, but normal peritoneal cells were negative. The in situ hybridization method demonstrated expression of MCP-1 mRNA on the endometriotic glandular epithelium and stromal macrophages. These findings suggest that MCP-1 may be involved in the histogenesis and early development of peritoneal endometriosis.
