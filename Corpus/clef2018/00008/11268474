Serum tetranectin and CA125 in endometrial adenocarcinoma. CA125 and tetranectin (TN) are prognostic markers in ovarian cancer. This study examines the values of these markers in endometrial cancer.TN and CA125 were determined preoperatively in 99 patients with primary endometrioid adenocarcinoma and evaluated in relation to tumor grade, stage and cancer survival.The CA125 levels correlated significantly with tumor stage. Dichotomized according to a cut-off level of 35 U/ml, CA125 significantly correlated with cancer death. Multivariate regression analysis of cancer survival time showed that CA125 > 35 U/ml was not an independent factor when stage was introduced. TN levels were within the normal range in all patients and did not show any association with tumor grade, stage or survival.The study confirmed the role of CA125 as a prognostic factor in endometrial cancer and may be of aid in pointing out patients at high risk, whereas tetranectin did not show any prognostic effect.
