Regulation of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in uterine endometrial cells of patients with and without endometriosis. To determine whether alterations in the secretion and regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors are present in uterine endometrial cells from endometriosis patients.In an in vitro study, uterine endometrial cells from 19 regularly cycling women with and 32 without endometriosis were treated with diethyl stilbestrol, promegestone (R5020), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha). Culture supernatants were assayed for MMPs 1, 2, 3, and 9, and for tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) by ELISA.MMP-3 was secreted in high concentrations, moderate concentrations were seen for MMP-1 and MMP-2, and very low concentrations for MMP-9. Substantially more TIMP-1 than TIMP-2 was secreted. MMP-1 and MMP-3 were uniformly attenuated by R5020, while MMP-2 was not influenced by hormone treatment. MMP-3 was upregulated by TNF-alpha in all samples while IL-1 only increased secretion in cells from endometriosis patients.The upregulation of MMP-3 by IL-1 may contribute to an increased invasiveness of uterine endometrial fragments in endometriosis patients.
