The expression of the receptors of estrogen, progesterone, epidermal growth factor and growth hormone in uterine adenomyosis and a comparative study after treatment with androgen. To investigate the pathogenesis of adenomyosis and its immunopathological study after treatment with androgen.Estrogen receptor (ER), progestoren receptor (PR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and growth hormone (GH) were determined by immunohistochemical SABC method in 30 cases of adenomyosis (group I) and another 24 cases of adenomyosis accompanying leiomyoma (group II) ER, PR were determined with the same methods in 24 cases of adenomyosis who had been treated with methyltestosterone before operation (group III).(1) Both the eutopic and ectopic endometrium in group I showed ER, PR, EGFR, GH positive. The positive expression rate had no significant differences (P > 0.05). The strong positive rate of ER, PR in the eutopic endometrium were significantly higher than that in the ectopic (P < 0.05). (2) ER, PR, EGFR, GH in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium in group I and group II all showed positive but no significant differences (P > 0.05). (3) Both ER and PR showed positive in group I, II and group III. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05). (4) Among the 24 cases treated with androgen, the positive and strong positive rate of ER and PR in both eutopic and ectopic endometrium of 11 cases proved effective were higher than that of 13 ineffective cases and there were significant and striking differences (P < 0.05, < 0.01).ER, PR, EGFR, GH all expressed in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium. They played important roles in promoting the development of adenomyosis.
