Cytokine profiles in autologous peritoneal fluid and peripheral blood of women with deep and superficial endometriosis. In a preliminary study the hypothesis was tested that cytokine profiles in peripheral blood were higher in women with deep infiltrating endometriosis and cytokine profiles in peritoneal fluid were higher in women with superficial endometriosis. Thirteen women of reproductive age having laparoscopy for infertility (n=9), pain (n=3) or combined pain and infertility (n=1). Peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid were obtained and analyzed for Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Transforming Growth Factor-betal (TGFbeta1), and Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). No significant cytokine differences were observed in either peritoneal fluid or peripheral blood between IL-6, TGFbeta1, IFNgamma, TNF-alpha and IL-10 of women with superficial endometriosis (n=7) and women with deeply infiltrating endometriosis (n=6). The results of this preliminary study do not show significant differences in peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid cytokine levels between women with deep infiltrating endometriosis compared to women with superficial disease. Future studies with increased sample size are required to either confirm or refute these preliminary findings.
