Chronic pelvic pain in women. A condition difficult to diagnose--more than 70 different diagnoses can be considered. Chronic pelvic pain, CPP, with a prevalence of about 15 percent of the female population between 18 and 50 years, has vast psychosocial and economic consequences. The cause(s) are often elusive despite invasive procedures including laparoscopy. There is a connection between CPP and abuse in childhood, sexual as well as non-sexual. Usually the woman initially seeks a gynecologist, who should have some knowledge also of lesser known causes of CPP such as pelvic congestion and nerve entrapments. A multidisciplinary approach can offer more possibilities to reach a plausible diagnosis and adequate treatment.
