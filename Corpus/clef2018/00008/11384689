Hysterectomy in Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. To examine the indications and surgical morbidity for women veterans who underwent hysterectomies in Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAs).Data on hysterectomies performed in VAs from 1991 to 1997 were abstracted from a surgical quality improvement program.Records of 1722 women who had hysterectomies in VAs over 6 years were examined. Women were predominately white (62%) and their average age was 42.5 years. Operations included abdominal (74%), vaginal (22%), and laparoscopic-assisted (4%) methods. The most common indications for surgery included uterine leiomyomas (31%), abnormal uterine bleeding (14%), and endometriosis (11%). Indications differed by race (P <.01) nonwhite women were most likely to have surgery for leiomyoma (51%), whereas white women had hysterectomies for leiomyomas (19%), abnormal bleeding (15%), endometriosis (13%), and genital prolapse (11%). The mean postoperative stay was significantly longer for abdominal hysterectomies (4.51 days) than either vaginal or laparoscopic-assisted hysterectomies (2.92 and 2.21 days, respectivelyWomen who underwent hysterectomies in VAs had low complication rates, comparable to hysterectomy complication rates in the United States generally.
