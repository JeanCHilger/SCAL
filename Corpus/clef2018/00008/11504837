Prognostic relevance of hMLH1, hMSH2, and BAX protein expression in endometrial carcinoma. Endometrial carcinoma is the most common gynecologic malignancy in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. A role of mismatch repair genes, like hMLH1 and hMSH2 in their pathogenesis, has been suggested. Loss of their function leads to the accumulation of replication errors (mutator phenotype), which are responsible for further mutations in genes with microsatellite sequences in their coding region, such as Bax. We analyzed the expression of hMLH1, hMSH2, and Bax genes in 89 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded endometrial carcinomas. The immunostains were scored with regard to percentage of positive tumor cells (0%, <10%, 10 to 50%, >50%), and relative staining intensity (1+, 2+, 3+). The staining results were correlated with clinicopathologic features and survival. Loss of hMSH2 expression (0% positive cells) was observed in 1.1% (1/89) of the tumors loss of hMLH1 was seen in 12.4% (11/89) of the cases, particularly in endometrioid tumors with mucinous differentation (5/11
