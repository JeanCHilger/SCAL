DNA microarray analysis of gene expression markers of endometriosis. To use DNA microarray technology to examine differential gene expression in uterine endometrium versus endometriosis implants.Pilot study.Volunteers in an academic research environment.Premenopausal women scheduled for surgery for suspected endometriosis.Surgical excision of endometriosis tissue and uterine endometrial biopsy.Gene expression.The expression of eight genes from a total of 4,133 genes on the DNA microarray was increased in endometriosis implants compared with uterine endometrium. The eight genes were beta-actin, alpha-2 actin, vimentin, 40S ribosomal protein S23, Ig-lambda light chain, Ig germline H chain G-E-A region gamma-2 constant region gene, major histocompatibility complex class 1,C, and complement component 1 S subcomponent.The data demonstrate that the DNA microarray is an effective tool for the identification of differentially expressed genes between uterine and ectopic endometrium further study of the genes identified herein will expand our understanding of the nature of endometriosis and assist in the eventual development of new treatments for endometriosis.
