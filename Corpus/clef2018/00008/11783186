Clinical observation on treatment of endometriosis by tonifying qi and promoting blood circulation to remove stasis and purgation principle. To explore the therapeutic mechanism of endometriosis by the treatment of Yiqi Huoxue Huayu Tongfu Principle (YQHXHYTFP, tonifying Qi and promoting blood circulation to remove stasis and purgation therapy) with Neiyi 1+ pill.Forty-five cases with endometriosis were divided randomly into TCM group (30 cases, treated with Neiyi 1+ pill) and the control group (15 cases, treated with tamoxifen). The activity of natural killer cell of peripheral blood, T lymphocyte subsets, secreting interleukin-II and the EmAb were determined.Endometriosis is associated with immunologic disturbance. After treatment, the activity of NK cells and the count of T-suppressor cells were significantly increased (P < 0.01), the count of T-helper cells, the secretion of interleukin-II and TH/TS ratio were significantly reduced (P < 0.01). Over 50% of the cases whose EmAb was positive eventually turned to negative. The effective rate of this therapy was 90%. There was no significant difference between TCM group and the control group.YQHXHYTF therapy could modulate the immunologic disturbance in women with endometriosis, improve the clinical symptoms and signs obviously. It is a safe and effective therapy.
