Polyp of the fallopian tube. The case of a 34-year-old woman who had a radical hysterectomy for stage 1 b squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and in whom an epithelial polyp was identified in the left fallopian tube is presented. The case is unusual in that the polyp developed in the absence of any evidence of tubal damage as demonstrated by a history of endometriosis or tubal sterilisation.
