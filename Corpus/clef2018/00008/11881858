Management of endometriosis and its impact on infertility. Endometriosis is defined as the presence of tissue, histologically similar to endometrium, in any other site but that of uterine cavity. Transplantation of endometrial tissue that comes as a retrograde menstrual flow is the most accepted possible theory. Endometriosis is associated with marked subfertility, but the mechanism of causation of infertility is poorly understood unless it has caused very definite anatomical distortion of internal genitalia. Management of infertility in endometriosis is discussed in detail.
