Genetic contribution of the interleukin-10 promoter polymorphism in endometriosis susceptibility. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an important immunomodulatory cytokine. The aim of this study was to investigate whether polymorphisms of the IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms may be responsible in part for genetic susceptibility to endometriosis.Polymorphisms at position -1082 and -592 in the IL-10 promoter region were determined in 196 patients with endometriosis and 160 fertile healthy women by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).There were no statistically significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of IL-10 promoter polymorphism between the endometriosis and control groups. However, when subgrouped according to clinical features, the frequencies of the -592*CC genotype and -592*C allele were significantly increased in patients with autoantibodies to carbonic anhydrase II (anti-CA II ab) compared with controls.IL-10 promoter polymorphisms were associated with the production of anti-CA II ab in patients with endometriosis, suggesting a role in the genetic susceptibility for endometriosis.
