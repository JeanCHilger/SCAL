Extrapelvic endometriosis presenting as unusual swellings of the buttock and thigh. We present the first case of extrapelvic endometriosis (EPE) presenting as combined swellings of the thigh and buttock in a 28-year-old nulliparous woman. The diagnosis was aided by the history of cyclical symptoms, needle aspirate, ultrasonography and computed tomography scan and was confirmed by histological analysis of the excised specimens. Of note, laparoscopy showed the pelvis to be free of gross disease. Surgical excision combined with hormonal suppression therapy proved adequate treatment in preventing recurrence as well as the complications of wound implantation.
