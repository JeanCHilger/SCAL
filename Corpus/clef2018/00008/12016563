Recurrent sanguineous and mucous diarrhea and spasms in a 46-year-old woman--manifestation of endometriosis in the colon sigmoideum. Intestinal endometriosis is the most frequent extragenital manifestation of this disease. Sometimes patients even present with acute bowel obstruction. We report on a 46-year-old woman complaining about recurrent sanguineous and mucous diarrhea and spasms for several years. Colonoscopy showed a stenosis in the sigmoid colon without macroscopically visible alterations of the mucosa. Computertomography, ultrasound and barium contrast enema did not provide us with further information about the origin of the stenosis. Biopsies out of the mucosa at the stenosis showed typical endometriosis tissue. After starting a conservative therapy with GnRH-agonist gosereline the patient became completely free of symptoms. The coincidence of endometriosis and M. Crohn has to be taken into consideration. Therapy planning should include a close co-operation with gynaecologists and surgeons to transfer the patient to surgical intervention when needed.
