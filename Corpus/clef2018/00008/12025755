Scar endometrioma: awareness and prevention. This article presents two cases of abdominal wall endometrioma. Endometrioma develops after surgery due to transportation and subsequent implantation of endometrial cells. Abdominal wall endometrioma can cause pain, anxiety, and morbidity. Therefore implementation of preventative measures during surgery is paramount to avoid extraneous surgery and hospital expenses. Diagnoses are rarely established prior to surgery, but surgeons often suspect the syndrome in women who have a history of a mass associated with cyclical pain. Radiological examination is useful to exclude hernia and metastatic malignancy, and to delineate the extent of the mass. Wide excision of endometrioma is usually curative.
