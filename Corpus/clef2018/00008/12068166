Immunohistochemical staining in the distinction between primary endometrial and endocervical adenocarcinomas: another viewpoint. Several studies have reported on the use of antibodies to monoclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and vimentin (VIM) to distinguish between adenocarcinomas of endometrial (EM) and endocervical (EC) origin, with variably enthusiastic results. It is still unclear whether site of origin or pathway of differentiation (endometrioid [em] versus mucinous [m]) is more important in predicting immunohistochemical differences. In the present study, paraffin blocks from adenocarcinomas of known origin were retrieved and immunostained with monoclonal antibodies to VIM and CEA, as well as cytokeratins (CK) 4, 18, and 20, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR). Positivity was scored on a scale from 0 to 12, with emphasis on the pattern of differentiation (tumors with mixed patterns received separate scores for the em and m foci). Mean CEA scores for emEM (n = 27), mEM (17), mEC (10), and emEC (6) were 0.4, 0.9, 5.1, and 1.2, respectively. VIM scores were 6.9, 1.3, 0, 4.4 ER, 5.7, 4.2, 0, 1.6
