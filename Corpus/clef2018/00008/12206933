Two kinds of endometrial neoplasia arising from different origins in the uterine corpus: comparison of p53 expression and sex steroid receptor status. This study presents a case of endometrial clear cell adenocarcinoma complicated by complex atypical glandular hyperplasia surrounded by adenomyosis in the uterine myometrium. The former was immuno-negative for estrogen receptor (ER) and positive for p53, whereas both of the latter were immuno-positive for ER and negative for p53. Therefore, there were two kinds of neoplasia arising from different origins in the uterine corpus.
