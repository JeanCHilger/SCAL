Contraceptive and therapeutic applications of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues. In recent years, the concept of developing LHRH agonist to stimulate fertility has been completed changed.  It was discovered that repeated agonist administration not only exiles to restore pituitary function in hypogonadotrophin patients, but also leads to inhibition of normal gonadal function.  The ability of long term agonist treatment to cause suppression of pituitary and gonadal function can be utilized for contraception.  Using LHRH as a contraceptive has its limitations, but clinical studies have not shown serious side effects.  LHRH could be a possible alternative form of contraception for breast-feeding and post- partum amenorrheic women as against steroids.  Using LHRH agonist in the treatment of endometriosis, excessive menstrual bleeding, and uterine fibroid has shown encouraging prospects.  Long term use of LHRH agonist by males could produce contraceptive effects and it may also be used for treatment of prostate cancer.  In the near future,  LHRH could be developed into male or female contraceptives.  Nasal spray may not be an appropriate medium of administration in developing countries, whereas implants could be a possible alternative.  Further research is needed on the its side effects as a contraceptive, and their solutions.
