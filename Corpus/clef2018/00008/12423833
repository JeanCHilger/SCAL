Metastatic endocervical adenocarcinoma presenting as a virilizing ovarian mass during pregnancy. We report a case of metastatic endocervical adenocarcinoma that presented as a virilizing ovarian mass in a young pregnant woman and simulated a primary ovarian endometrioid tumor.A 34-year-old woman underwent cesarean delivery and right salpingo-oophorectomy at 34 weeks' gestation for a 32-cm androgen-producing ovarian mass. The ovarian tumor, initially interpreted as a primary ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, was demonstrated to represent metastatic endocervical endometrioid adenocarcinoma based on detection of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16) deoxyribonucleic acid in the tumor by in situ hybridization. The hysterectomy specimen demonstrated an endocervical adenocarcinoma associated with adenocarcinoma in situ that also contained HPV-16.Human papillomavirus is considered an etiological agent in the development of endocervical adenocarcinomas, having been demonstrated in greater than 90% of tumors. In contrast, recent studies have concluded that HPV is unlikely to play an etiological role in ovarian neoplasia. The demonstration of HPV-16 in both the endocervical and ovarian carcinomas in this patient supports the interpretation that the ovarian tumor is a metastasis.
