Minimally invasive exploration of the female reproductive tract in infertility. Classically, invasive and non-invasive tests are performed to evaluate the causes of infertility. Transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (THL) allows the exploration of the pelvic structures with a mini-endoscope, using a vaginal needle-guided trocar introduction technique and saline as a distension medium. A first study on 349 patients demonstrated the feasibility of the procedure and gave a high patient satisfaction. Access to the pouch of Douglas was achieved in 330 patients (94.5%) under local anaesthesia and in an ambulatory environment. The mean pain score measured on a visual analogue scale of 10 was 2.7, comparable to the score of mini-hysteroscopy only and significantly lower than the scores of hysterosalpingography with either metal cannula or balloon catheter. A total of 96% of the patients agreed to repeat the procedure under the same circumstances if required. The diagnostic accuracy of the technique was demonstrated in a prospective study, in which two independent endoscopists explored 10 patients with both THL and standard laparoscopy. The inter-observer agreement for ovarian adhesions was 75% for standard laparoscopy and 90% for THL. In addition, in patients with mild endometriosis, more peri-ovarian adhesions were detected with THL than with standard laparoscopy. A multinational survey to evaluate the risk and outcome of bowel injury during THL registered 24 (0.65%) cases in 3667 procedures. In all cases, the diagnosis was made immediately and the treatment was conservative without complications.
