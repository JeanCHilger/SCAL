The pathology department. The evolution of the Laboratory of Pathology at Erasmus Hospital is directly related to the morphological diagnosis integration in the medico-surgical organization of the Hospital. Such integration is based on the creation of links between the Laboratory of Pathology and the clinical departments and necessitates permanent adaptations to new complementary technology. Immunohistochemical methods were gradually included in the surgical morphological diagnosis. Currently, new markers from molecular biology are needed to obtain accurate pathological diagnosis. We observe an increasing hyperspecialization of the morphological classification with complete integration of such biological markers leading to the necessity of carrying out collegial diagnosis. The development of the telepathology technology permits international collegial diagnosis. According to its central position the Laboratory of Pathology plays an important part in the development of the clinical and fundamental research. The research subjects of the Laboratory of Pathology concern diagnostic and prognostic evaluation in colic cancers, sarcomas, brain tumors and HPV related tumors endometriosis.
