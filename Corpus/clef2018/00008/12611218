Urinary endometrioma. To analyze the series of cases of endometriosis with urologic involvement reported in our country.We found a total of 26 cases of endometriosis including our case, 15 affected bladder and 11 ureter. Independently of ureteral or bladder location, the treatment performed varied, from transurethral resection and laser to cystectomy in cases involving bladder, from segmental ureterectomy with ureteral reimplantation to nephrectomy in ureteral cases.Surgery is the definitive solution for urinary tract endometriomas. The definitive treatment of endometriosis must be done by gynecologists, by means of hormonal and surgical treatment depending on age, severity and location of the lesions, patient's wishes for future pregnancies, and tolerance to hormone therapy.
