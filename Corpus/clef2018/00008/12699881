Polymorphism of the interleukin-1beta gene and endometriosis. Experimental data indicate that interleukin (IL)-1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. We determined the genotype and the allele frequencies of the IL1B exon 5 polymorphism and the corresponding IL-1beta serum levels in women with endometriosis.We genotyped 92 women with surgically and histologically confirmed endometriosis and 69 controls without history of endometriosis. Both groups were of middle European genetic background for the IL1B exon 5 polymorphism (at position +3954). Genotyping was performed by pyrosequencing. IL-1beta serum levels were analyzed by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Allele frequencies in women with endometriosis and controls were 76.6% and 76.8%, respectively, for the E1 allele (wild type) and 23.4% and 23.2%, respectively, for the E2 allele (polymorphic) (odds ratio 1.01 P > .99). The investigated polymorphism of the IL-1beta gene was not correlated with IL-1beta serum levels.We did not find an association between the IL1B exon 5 polymorphism, endometriosis, or increased serum IL-1beta levels.
