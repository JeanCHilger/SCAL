Adolescent endometriosis. Endometriosis is a cause of chronic, pelvic pain in adolescents. Lack of response to NSAIDS and OCPs should prompt further investigation and subsequent treatment. The goal of therapy is to minimize pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea primarily through long-term, medical therapy. Surgical intervention is principally indicated to establish a diagnosis. The poor response to surgical therapy negates the need for repetitive or radical surgery. Much patience and care should be directed toward these patients to provide them with an understanding of their disease and to help enhance the quality of their life.
