Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor and PTEN protein expression in endometrial carcinoma. Correlation with bax and bcl-2 expression, microsatellite instability status, and outcome. We immunohistochemically analyzed 89 endometrial carcinomas for insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) expression. Results were compared with clinicopathologic factors, bcl-2 and bax expression, microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and prognosis. Increased expression of IGF-IR and bcl-2 (> 50% cells) was seen in 60 cases (67%) and 15 cases (17%), respectively loss of PTEN was seen in 13 cases (15%) and of bax in 11 cases (12%). No significant correlation was observed between the proteins or with clinicopathologic factors. Loss of PTEN was more frequent in MSI-positive tumors (4/10 [40%]) than in negative tumors (9/79 [11%]
