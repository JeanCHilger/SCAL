Determination of HGF concentration in serum and peritoneal fluid in women with endometriosis. Scatter factor (hepatocyte growth factor, SF/HGF) is a multifunctional polypeptide growth factor that plays an important role in tumor proliferation, angiogenesis and invasiveness. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of HGF in endometriosis and their relationship. Peritoneal fluid and serum samples of 126 women of reproductive age receiving laparoscopy (72 with endometriosis and 54 without endometriosis) were obtained and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to measure HGF concentrations. The results revealed that the concentrations of HGF were significantly elevated in women with endometriosis stages I/II and III/IV as compared with HGF level in the control group (peritoneal fluid levels of 0.337+/-0.065, 0.458+/-0.160, 0.915+/-0.113, P<0.001 serum level of 0.335+/-0.663, 0.456+/-0.151, 0.907+/-0.170, P<0.001 respectively). A positive correlation was found between peritoneal fluid and serum levels of HGF, which varied little with phases of the menstrual cycle. Comparisons of the women in the same menstrual cycle between the three groups revealed that increased levels of HGF in patients with advanced endometriosis were not attributed to the cycle phase. Our results indicated that the degree of endometriosis was positively correlated with HGF concentration in peritoneal fluid and serum. Therefore, the detection of serum HGF concentration may be useful in classifying endometriosis, and may also help in selecting the optimal treatment methods.
