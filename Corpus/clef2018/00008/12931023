Alteration of G2 cell cycle regulators occurs during carcinogenesis of the endometrium. In this study, we examined the alteration of the G2 pathway in endometrial hyperplasia (EH) and endometrioid-type endometrial cancer (EC), and analyzed the relationship between the G2 pathway status and the p53 pathway status.A total of 103 cases (proliferative phase of the endometrium: 20, EH: 22, and endometrioid-type EC: 61 (I: 39, II: 5, III: 15, recurrence: 2)) were included in this study. We examined the ATM, chk2, CDC25C, cdc2, and cyclin B1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. In 55 cases (EH: 15 EC: 40), we analyzed CHK2 mutations by RT-PCR-SSCP.There were no CHK2 mutations in endometrial disease. Elevated or reduced expression rates of ATM, chk2, CDC25C, cdc2 and cyclin B1 were 4.5% (1/22), 0%, 0%, 0% and 4.5% (1/22) in EH and 3.3% (2/61), 4.9% (3/61), 13.1% (8/61), 9.8% (6/61) and 9.8% (6/61) in EC. Alteration of the G2 pathway was higher in EC (32.8% 20/61) than in EH (9.1%Alteration of the G2 pathway is thought to occur during carcinogenesis of the endometrium.
