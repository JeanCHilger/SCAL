Flow cytometric analysis of cellular DNA content in epithelial ovarian cancer. Tumor DNA content (ploidy) was determined by flow-cytometry (FCM) on tissue from 32 epithelial ovarian cancer patients. Staining for DNA analysis was achieved with Propidium Iodide. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were used as reference diploid cell population. Of the 32 patients, 26 (81.3%) had tumors which were aneuploid, whereas 6 (18.7%) were diploid. DNA aneuploid cell lines were found in 100% of serous adenocarcinoma, in 57% of mucinous adenocarcinoma, in 67% of endometrial adenocarcinoma, in 88% of clear cell carcinoma and in 75% of undifferentiated carcinoma. The DNA ploidy abnormalities differed in each histologic characteristic of epithelial ovarian cancer.
