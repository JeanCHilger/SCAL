Primary ovarian small cell carcinoma of pulmonary type. A clinicopathologic, immunohistologic, and flow cytometric analysis of 11 cases. Eleven primary ovarian tumors that resembled small cell carcinoma of the lung are reported. They occurred in women 28-85 (mean 59) years of age, most of whom presented with abdominal swelling. Six of the tumors were unilateral and five bilateral seven had spread beyond the ovary. The tumors ranged from 4.5 to 26 (mean 13.5) cm in greatest dimension and were mostly solid, with a variable minor cystic component. Microscopic examination showed small to medium-sized round to spindle-shaped cells with scanty cytoplasm, hyperchromatic nuclei, and inconspicuous nucleoli growing in sheets, closely packed nests, and occasionally islands and trabeculae. A component of endometrioid carcinoma was present in four tumors, another tumor showed squamous differentiation, another contained a cyst lined by atypical mucinous cells, and two others were associated with a Brenner tumor. Argyrophil granules were present focally in two of six tumors appropriately stained. Immunohistochemical staining was performed in nine cases: in six there was staining of the small cell component for keratin, in five for epithelial membrane antigen, in seven for neuron-specific enolase, in two for chromogranin, and in one for Leu-7. Vimentin staining was not observed. Flow cytometry was performed on eight tumors: five were aneuploid and three diploid. Five of seven patients with long-term follow-up died of, or with, disease at 1-13 (mean 8) months, one died after an unknown interval, and one was alive at 7.5 years. Two other patients had recurrent or residual disease at 6 and 8 months.
