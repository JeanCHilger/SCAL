Changes in T-cell regulation of responses to self antigens in women with pelvic endometriosis. To study autoimmune aspects of endometriosis.Lymphoblast transformation and hemolytic plaque formation were used to assess specific T- and B-cell activity against endometrial antigens.Military teaching hospital.Ninety-four healthy women of reproductive age undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy as part of an evaluation for infertility or chronic pelvalgia were accordingly grouped into those with normal pelvic peritoneum (20), mild endometriosis (50), and severe endometriosis (24).The study assessed the proliferative and humoral responses of lymphocytes from women with and without endometriosis to endometrial antigens and quantified the number of B-cell precursors, T-helper cells, and T-suppressor cells to these antigens.Unfractionated endometrial antigens were similarly blastogenic for lymphocytes from women with and without endometriosis. Despite equivalent numbers of B-cell precursors to these antigens, antiendometrial antibody responsiveness appears to have increased in women with mild endometriosis because of a decrease in T-suppressor cell activity and declined in women with severe endometriosis because of a further drop in T-suppressor cell activity and an increase in T-helper cell activity, as compared with women without endometriosis.Taken together, these experiments support the possibility that pelvic endometriosis may result from a break in specific T-cell tolerance rather than nonspecific polyclonal activation of responder lymphocytes.
