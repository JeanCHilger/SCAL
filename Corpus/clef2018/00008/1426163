Chlamydial genital infections and laparoscopic findings in infertile women. Several studies have shown that previous chlamydial genital infection, reflected by serological markers, is strongly associated with tubal damage leading to tubal infertility. In 105 women undergoing laparoscopy, multiple samples were collected from the lower (urethra and cervix) and upper (endometrium, peritoneal fluid, tubal lumen) genital tract, in order to isolate Chlamydia trachomatis in cell culture. Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from at least one site in 13 (30.9%) of 42 infertile women with tubal infertility, in 5 (12.1%) of 41 women with unexplained infertility, in 1 of 4 women affected by acute salpingitis and in 1 (5.5%) of 18 women with endometriosis or uterine malformations. The latter group was the control group. Thirteen (65%) of the 20 positive women harboured Chlamydia trachomatis in their upper genital tract alone and 16 women were positive in one or both tubes. Only one of the positive women showed laparoscopic signs of acute pelvic infection. Four of the 5 positive women with unexplained infertility harboured Chlamydia trachomatis in the tubal lumen. This study confirms that chlamydial infection is strongly associated with tubal damage. It suggests that cervical cultures are inadequate for excluding a tubal infection and that chlamydial colonization of the tubal mucosa is possible in the absence of symptoms and laparoscopic signs of active infection.
