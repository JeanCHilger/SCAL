Effects of estradiol and tamoxifen on proliferation of human breast cancer cells and human endometrial cells. The effects of estradiol and tamoxifen on the proliferation of estrogen receptor positive cells and the relationship between the tamoxifen tolerance and cell origin were investigated. The tissues of human endometrium and breast cancer were randomly selected following dissection for primary cell culture. After the breast cancer cells and endometrial cells were treated with 1 x 10(-8) mol/L estradiol and/or 1 x 10(-6) tamoxifen, 3H-labelled thymine nucleotide was used to trace the kinetics of cell proliferation. There was no significant difference in the inhibition on the human endometrial cells between tamoxifen-treated group (6.3%) and control group (6.4%), but tamoxifen could significantly inhibit the proliferation of the human breast cancer cells (45.84%) as compared with control group (52.72%). Moreover, tamoxifen could significantly stimulate the proliferation of tamoxifen resistant breast cancer cells (9.64%) as compared with control group (6.32%). Estradiol could significantly stimulate the proliferation of all the three kinds of cells as compare with control group. The combined use of estradiol and tamoxifen could inhibit the proliferation of the endometrial cells and breast cancer cells as compared with estradiol used alone, but on the tamoxifen resistant breast cancer cells, they could more significantly stimulate the proliferation than E2. It was concluded that E2 could stimulate the proliferation of these three kinds of cells. However, the inhibitive effects of tamoxifen on the proliferation of these cells were dependent on the estradiol.
