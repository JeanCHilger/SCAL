Altered expression of interleukin-18 in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. Peritoneal fluid (PF) inflammatory factors may participate in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The aim of this study was to investigate PF interleukin (IL)-18 levels in women with and without endometriosis.Controlled clinical study.Women undergoing laparoscopy at a university hospital.Fifty women with previously untreated endometriosis, 8 women on GnRH agonists for endometriosis, and 18 control women with normal pelvic anatomy who were undergoing tubal ligation.Peritoneal fluid IL-18 levels as measured by ELISA.Peritoneal fluid IL-18 levels.Peritoneal fluid IL-18 levels were significantly higher in women with previously untreated endometriosis (mean +/- SEM, 91.1 +/- 6.5 pg/mL) than in control women (59.4 +/- 2.0 pg/mL). Interestingly, women with superficial (100.0 +/- 10.2 pg/mL) and deep peritoneal implants (94.0 +/- 10.8 pg/mL) had significantly higher PF IL-18 levels than did women with endometriomas (57.8 +/- 1.8 pg/mL). Similarly, women with stage I-II endometriosis (97.3 +/- 8.0 pg/mL), but not women with stage III-IV endometriosis (74.9 +/- 9.9 pg/mL), had significantly higher PF IL-18 levels than did control women. Peritoneal fluid IL-18 levels were significantly higher in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase but did not discriminate between women with pelvic pain or infertility.Peritoneal fluid IL-18 is elevated in women with peritoneal, minimal- to mild-stage endometriosis.
