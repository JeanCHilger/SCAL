Diagnosing infertility in a district general hospital: a case-note and cost analysis. This study aimed to observe diagnostic work-up and cost evaluation of infertile couples to identify opportunities for improvement. One hundred and seventy-four new referrals to the gynaecology clinic in a District General Hospital during 1996 and 1997 provided the cohort for analysis. Data from case notes were transferred on to data collection sheets. Data were inputted into SPSS for analysis. Primary infertility accounted for 62% of couples. One hundred and forty-two couples (81.6%) had a definitive diagnosis, and the analyses relate to these couples only. There was no single investigation performed on the whole cohort studied. Semen analysis was undertaken in 80.3% of the couples couples with suspected male infertility were over four times more likely to have had more than two semen tests (P = 0.0005)
