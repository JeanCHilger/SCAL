Obstetric outcome in women with endometriosis--a matched case-control study. Immunological deficiencies, altered angiogenic activity, infiltrative potential and growth factors are plausible factors behind endometriosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether endometriosis interferes with the course or outcome of pregnancy.In this matched case-control study, we analyzed obstetric outcome among 137 women with endometriosis and 137 controls matched as regards IVF procedures and parity who gave singleton births at Kuopio University Hospital between January 1994 and December 2000. In affected women, the diagnosis was histologically verified, whereas the controls were eligible for the study only if they had undergone laparoscopy/tomy in connection with tubal sterilization, or infertility unrelated to endometriosis.No statistically significant differences were detected in reproductive risk factors in women with endometriosis, with the exception of mean maternal age (31.2 years in the cases vs. 34 years in the controls). The mean birth weight (+/-SD) among those delivering at term (>37 completed weeks) was 3,600 (+/-542) g in the control group and 3,547 (+/-456) g in the study group. Placental weight was comparable in both groups. Overall pregnancy characteristics and pregnancy outcome measures were similar in women affected by endometriosis when compared with the control group.Any potential negative effect of endometriosis on obstetric outcome was undetectable.
