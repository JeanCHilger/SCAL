Pseudo-obstruction chronic disease, lymphoid hyperplasia of the gastrointestinal tract and intestinal endometriosis. Nodular lymphoid hyperplasia of the gastrointestinal tract associated to endometriosis is an uncommon cause of chronic pseudo-obstruction and malabsortion. The case of a 32-year-old woman who suffered from this syndrome for one a half years is described. Diagnosis was achieved by laparotomy, which disclosed swelling and inflammation of the 30 cm terminal yeyunal portion. Removal of the involved intestine and side-to-side anastomosis were performed. The pathological findings were: follicular lymphoid hyperplasia with mucosal ulcers an fissures inflammatory pseudo-polyps, chronic deep enteritis and areas of endometriosis. A favourable outcome followed surgery.
