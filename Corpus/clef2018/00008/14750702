Increased production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha by peritoneal fluid mononuclear cells induced by 60-kDa heat shock protein in women with minimal to mild endometriosis. We sought to examine the role of Hsp60, a 60-kDa stress-responsive protein (hsp60) with potent immunostimulatory properties, in the pathophysiology of endometriosis. We investigated the response of peritoneal fluid mononuclear cells (PFMCs) to hsp60 to identify differences in PFMCs between women with and without endometriosis.PFMCs from women with or without endometriosis were incubated with hsp60 in vitro. The release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The rapid secretion of TNF-alpha was observed following the exposure of PFMCs to hsp60. PFMCs from women with minimal to mild endometriosis produced greater amounts of TNF-alpha in response to hsp60 stimulation than levels seen in cells from women without endometriosis.Hsp60 may play a role in the activation of peritoneal immunity in patients with minimal to mild endometriosis.
