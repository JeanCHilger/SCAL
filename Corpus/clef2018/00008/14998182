Implications of the diagnosis of endometriosis on the success of infertility treatment. Endometriosis is a clinically very heterogeneous disorder and its implications on the resolution of infertility are not clear.Clinical data of 783 consecutive infertile couples were retrospectively analyzed in three groups: A--with minimal/mild endometriosis: B--with moderate/severe endometriosis C--without endometriosis. Subgroups of groups A and C with unexplained infertility were also compared.Endometriosis was found in 349 patients (44.6%)--263 in group A and 86 in group B. Group C comprised 434 patients. Overall pregnancy rates were 57.0% for group A, 48.8% for B and 55.8% for C (not statistically different). Of couples in groups A, B, C, respectively, 39.2%, 51.1% and 39.2% needed IVF (B vs C - p = 0.042 B vs A - p = 0.059). Of couples in group A 45.6% that underwent IVF achieved a pregnancy by this techniqueThe diagnosis of endometriosis had no influence on the successful resolution of infertility although moderate/severe endometriosis was related to a greater need for IVF. Couples with unexplained infertility had similar pregnancy rates either in the presence or in the absence of minimal/mild endometriosis.
