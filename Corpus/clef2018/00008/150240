Effect of synthetic progestogens on endometrial cancer. Cytochemical criteria. 1) Well-differentiated carcinomas of the endometrium contain acid mucins with carboxyl or, more rarely, sulphated radicals. The latter are found in certain hypersecretory papillary tumours. 2) The neoplastic cells are surrounded by a border rich in acid muco-substances, including sialic acid. This pericellular film is unaffected by progestogens. 3) With progestogen therapy, there is a marked increase in the secretion of muco-substances in sensitive malignant cells. There is also more glycogen in the cytoplasm. No qualitative change in secretion may be demonstrated. 4) The intracytoplasmic accumulation of glycogen and mucopolysaccharide material is inversely proportional to the mitiotic index.
