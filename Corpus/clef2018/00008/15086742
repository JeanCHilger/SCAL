Complete remission of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma associated with hyperamylasemia and liver metastasis treated by paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy: a case report. Complete remission in the case of a 45-year-old woman with ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma associated with hyperamylasemia and liver metastasis is described. Ultrasound examination and CT scan revealed several large solid and cystic intra-abdominal tumors and a metastatic liver tumor. The serum amylase was 600 micro/l (normal value: 60-200 micro/l), and electrophoresis identified isoamylases of the salivary type. A total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed for invasive carcinoma of the left ovary. The histology of the left ovary showed endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemically, the adenocarcinoma cells were diffusely and strongly positive for amylase. The patient received six courses of paclitaxel and carboplatin combination chemotherapy. Two years later, the patient is alive and well, without evidence of disease. The prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer metastatic to the liver is uniformly poor. This represents the first report of complete remission of such a patient in the literature.
