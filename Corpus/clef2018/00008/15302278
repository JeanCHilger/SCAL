Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist inhibits estrone sulfatase expression of cystic endometriosis in the ovary. To clarify the inhibitory effect of GnRH agonist on estrone (E(1)) sulfatase expression.Retrospective immunohistochemical study.The Jikei University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.Thirty-three women who had undergone cystectomy of the ovary or oophorectomy and were proved histopathologically to have cystic endometriosis in the ovary.Fifteen of the 33 patients were treated with GnRH agonists monthly for 2-6 months before surgery. The other 18 patients did not receive any hormonal therapy. Tissue sections were immunostained with an anti-E(1) sulfatase monoclonal antibody (KM1049) originating from human placenta.Microscopic evaluation to assess the presence and localization of E(1) sulfatase and to describe any variations in its expression with or without treatment with GnRH agonist.Immunostaining showed that E(1) sulfatase was localized only on the glandular epithelial cells of cystic endometriosis in the ovary. The immunostaining with anti-E(1) sulfatase proved that GnRH agonist inhibited E(1) sulfatase expression in the cystic endometriosis in the ovary.Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist inhibits E(1) sulfatase expression in cystic endometriosis in the ovary.
