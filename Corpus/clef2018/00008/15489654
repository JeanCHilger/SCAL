The use of cytokeratin 7 and EMA in differentiating ovarian yolk sac tumors from endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas. Yolk sac tumors (YSTs) have a variety of morphologic patterns, some of which can resemble either endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC) or clear cell carcinoma (CCC). Immunohistochemical staining for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is usually only focal and thus is not always helpful in the diagnosis of YST, and pancytokeratin (CK) is expressed by all three tumors. We studied a battery of immunohistochemical markers with specific attention to the utility of cytokeratin 7 (CK7) in differentiating YST from EAC and CCC. A total of 46 ovarian tumors were retrieved for this study: 16 YST, 19 EAC, and 11 CCC. The three groups were analyzed for the expression of CK7, AFP, Leu-M1 (CD15), EMA, and WT1 by immunohistochemistry. In addition, CK and c-kit (CD117) were studied in the YSTs. All of the YSTs tested (100%) were positive for CK. CK7 was considered negative in all 16 YST cases (100%), although a few tumor cells (1%-2%) stained in 4 cases. In contrast, 17 of 19 EACs and all 11 CCCs had diffuse 3+ to 4+ positivity for CK7 the two other EACs showed 2+ positivity for CK7 (40% and 30% of the tumors). AFP was positive in 12 of 15 YSTs (80%), but was generally focal with 1+ staining in 10 cases (67%)
