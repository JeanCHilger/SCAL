Protein expression profiling of endometriosis: validation of 2-mm tissue microarrays. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) are useful tools for studying protein expression in endometriosis. Tissue microarray analyses of immunohistochemical profiles of estrogen receptor-alpha and P receptor corroborate previously published results from the use of conventional immunohistochemistry, thus validating TMA use in endometriosis.
