Cytokines and endometriosis. Abnormal expression of cytokines is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.In 63 women with various stages of endometriosis preoperative levels of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, BVEGF, b-FGF, of TNF RI and TNF RII were analysed employing ELISA tests (R&D kits).In the sera of endometriosis patients significantly augmented levels of IL-6 and of b-FGF were detected as well as a trend for elevated IL-8 levels.Elevated serum levels of cytokines may show poor correspondence to the localized pathological process. Endometriosis would find a stricter reflection in cytokine levels in fluids or tissues of the pelvis minor.
