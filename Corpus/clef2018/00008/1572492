Three-dimensional architectures of peritoneal endometriosis. To elucidate some biological characteristics of peritoneal endometriosis.A recently advanced stereographic computer technology was applied for the investigation of the three-dimensional (3-D) architectures of peritoneal endometriosis.University Hospital of Gynecology.Biopsies were taken from 42 women with peritoneal endometriosis. Twenty-six of them were in the luteal phase. Seventeen of them received Zoladex (ICI, Cambridge, United Kingdom) for 12 weeks before biopsy.Two different main types could be identified according to the presence or absence of ramifications. The apparently multifocal occurrence (in 2-D) of glandular epithelium was not confirmed by the 3-D study that showed that all epithelial glands are interconnected by luminal structures in each peritoneal lesion. Stereometric study suggests a stronger effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy on the stroma than on the epithelium.The study evaluated the 3-D architectures of peritoneal endometriosis and identified two principal types of peritoneal endometriosis.
