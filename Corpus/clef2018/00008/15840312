Effect of gestrinone on the lipid metabolic parameters and bone mineral density in patients with endometriosis. To observe the change of lipid metabolic parameters, sex hormone and bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with endometriosis before and after oral administration of gestrinone.Fifty-six patients with endometriosis, aged from 20 to 45, were treated with gestrinone 2.5 mg two times a week for 6 months one week after operation. Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), ApoA(1), ApoB, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), E(2) and BMD were determined before taking gestrinone, after taking for 6 months and withdrawal for 6 months.After administration of gestrinone for 6 months, serum HDL-C and ApoA(1) decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Serum LDL-C and ApoB increased significantly (P < 0.05). Serum E(2) and BMD decreased evidently. Serum TG, TC, FSH and LH were not changed evidently. After withdrawal of gestrinone for 6 months, serum parameters restored to levels before taking gestrinone except BMD.Gestrinone can decrease serum E(2) and BMD in patients with endometriosis, which may not be good for lipid metabolism. It is not advisable to take gestrinone for long term.
