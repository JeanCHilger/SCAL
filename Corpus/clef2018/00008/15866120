Vitamin D binding protein in endometriosis. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is a powerful method for identifying post-translationally modified molecules in biological fluids. We examined the presence and expression of vitamin D binding protein (DBP) in the peritoneal fluid (PF) and plasma (PL) of women with endometriosis.PL and PF samples were obtained from 36 women with untreated mild endometriosis (revised classification of the American Fertility Society [rAFS] stage I-II), 52 women with untreated severe endometriosis (rAFS stage III-IV), 17 women with endometriosis treated with the oral contraceptive (OC), and 40 controls (infertility, n = 23 tubal sterilization, n = 12The expression of one DBP isoform (DBPE) in the PF of patients with untreated endometriosis was significantly lower than in the control group (P <.05). The levels of PF DBPE in patients with endometriosis using OC were significantly higher than in women with untreated endometriosis (P <.05). No significant difference was observed in PL DBPE expression between women with and without endometriosis, while it was significantly increased in patients with endometriosis using OC (P <.05). DBP expression was not correlated with the stage of endometriosis (rAFS classification) or the phase of the menstrual cycle.The decreased level of DBPE in the PF but not in PL of women with untreated endometriosis suggests that this molecule may be relevant in the pathogenesis of this disease.
