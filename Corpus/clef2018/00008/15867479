VEGF and its receptors (flt-1 and KDR/flk-1) as prognostic indicators in endometrial carcinoma. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is associated with increased angiogenesis and aggressive tumour growth. We investigated the expression and clinical significance of VEGF and its receptors, flt-1 and KDR/flk-1, in patients with uterine endometrial carcinoma. The series consisted of 115 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma patients with FIGO stage I-IV. Additionally, samples from 3 patients with adenoacanthoma and 12 patients with poor prognostic variants of endometrial carcinoma were examined. Immunohistochemical assessment was classified as negative or positive based on staining intensity. The median follow-up time of patients with endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma was 87 months. In endometrioid endometrial carcinomas, the positive immunostaining rate was 39% for VEGF, 65% for flt-1 and 68% for KDR/flk-1. There was a significant correlation between VEGF and both its receptors. Furthermore, this receptor expression was correlated between the two types of receptors. VEGF-, flt-1- and KDR/flk-1-positive immunostainings were not related to poor prognosis. We conclude that VEGF, flt-1 and KDR/flk-1 expressions are not useful prognostic markers for overall survival in patients with endometrioid endometrial carcinoma.
