Vascular endothelial growth factor gene +405 C/G polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to advanced stage endometriosis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to play a pivotal role in the development of endometriosis. This study was performed to investigate whether the VEGF gene 5'-untranslated region polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to advanced stage endometriosis.This study comprised 215 women with advanced stage endometriosis, 219 control women without endometriosis, and 70 fertile women. Following extraction of genomic DNA, genotyping of the -460 C/T and +405 C/G polymorphisms of the VEGF gene were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis.The distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies of the -460 C/T polymorphism in the endometriosis group did not differ from those in the control group and the fertile women group. However, genotype distribution of the +405 C/G polymorphism was significantly different between patients with and without endometriosis (P = 0.01) and between patients with endometriosis and the fertile women (P = 0.02). Patients with endometriosis showed a higher incidence of the +405 CC genotype compared with the controls and the fertile women (P = 0.007 and 0.016 respectively).These findings suggest that the VEGF +405 C/G polymorphism may be associated with the risk of advanced stage endometriosis in the Korean population.
