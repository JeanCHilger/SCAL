Peritoneal fluid concentrations of interleukin-17 correlate with the severity of endometriosis and infertility of this disorder. This prospective study aimed to determine whether patients with endometriosis are having different level of interlukin-17 (IL-17) in peritoneal fluid when compared with patients without endometriosis. The patients with minimal/mild endometriosis had a significantly higher level of IL-17 in peritoneal fluid compared with those with moderate/severe endometriosis or without endometriosis. The concentration of IL-17 in peritoneal fluid was significantly higher when endometriosis and infertility coexist. However, the concentration of IL-17 in peritoneal fluid did not correlate with the phase of the menstrual cycle in the patients with or without endometriosis. Our study suggested that IL-17 might play an important role in the pathogenesis of early endometriosis and endometriosis-associated infertility.
