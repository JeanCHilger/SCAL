High expression of skp2 correlates with poor prognosis in endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Skp2 interacts with the degradation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. This study aimed to investigate the correlation of skp2 expression with the expression of p27 and other cell cycle regulators, and clinicopathological parameters in endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma.Tissue samples of 136 endometrioid adenocarcinomas, in addition to 20 endometrial hyperplasias and 20 normal endometria, were immunohistochemically stained for skp2. The expression was represented as a labeling index (LI), which indicates the percentage of positive nuclei.Skp2 staining was localized in the nuclei of the glandular cells of the proliferative phase endometrium, and endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma cells. Skp2 expression was increased significantly in those of higher histological grade. The high level of skp2 expression was significantly correlated with the presence of lymph node metastasis and lymph-vascular space involvement. The LI of skp2 in endometrial carcinoma was significantly correlated with that of p27, Ki-67, cdk2, cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, p53 and PTEN. The high level of skp2 expression (LI> or =20%) was significantly correlated with the patients' poor survival.The skp2 level might have increased due to p27 accumulation and may be a good indicator of proliferative activity and poor prognosis.
