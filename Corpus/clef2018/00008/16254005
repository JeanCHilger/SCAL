Differential regulation of interleukins IL-13 and IL-15 by ovarian steroids, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta in human endometrial epithelial and stromal cells. Based on the endometrial spatial and temporal expression of interleukins (ILs) IL-13 and IL-15 during the normal menstrual cycle, we hypothesized that ovarian steroids and non-steroidal factors regulate their expression in a cell-specific manner. To test this hypothesis and determine IL-13/IL-15 actions, we used endometrial epithelial (EEC) and stromal (ESC) cells isolated and cultured under defined conditions. We confirmed the expression of IL-13 and IL-15 in these cells and further demonstrated that 17beta estradiol (E2), medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and their combination differentially regulated their mRNA expression and protein production in a time- and cell-specific manner (P < 0.05). We also showed that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha 10 and 25 ng/ml) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta
