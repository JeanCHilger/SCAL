Polymorphisms in the promoter regions of the matrix metalloproteinases-7, -9 and the risk of endometriosis and adenomyosis in China. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may contribute to the development of endometriosis. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the polymorphisms in the promoters of MMP-7 (181A/G) and MMP-9 (1562C/T) on the risk of occurrence of endometriosis and adenomyosis. We genotyped 219 patients (143 women with endometriosis, 76 women with adenomyosis) and 160 control women in North China. There was a significant difference in frequency of the MMP-7 genotype between endometriosis and controls (P = 0.01) and also between adenomyosis and controls (P = 0.01). The frequency of the G allele in two groups of patients (7.3 and 7.9%) was significantly higher than in the controls (2.8%) (P = 0.01 and 0.01, respectively). Compared to the A/A genotype, the genotype with the -181G allele showed a significantly increased susceptibility to both diseases, with adjusted odds ratio of 2.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.17-5.87] for endometriosis and 3.14 (95% CI = 1.26-7.81) for adenomyosis. However, the overall genotype and allelotype distribution of the MMP-9 in the two case groups were not different from that of controls. We conclude that MMP-7-181A/G polymorphism has a potential to be a susceptibility factor for endometriosis and adenomyosis while MMP-9-1562C/T polymorphism may not provide a useful marker to predict susceptibility to endometriosis and adenomyosis, at least in women from North China.
