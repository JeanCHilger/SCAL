Post-caesarean incisional hernia or scar endometrioma? Scar endometrioma is an uncommon condition following caesarean section. It presents as a lump on the caesarean scar and can often be painful. Endometrioma is referred to the general surgeon as an incisional hernia. We present six such patients referred to the general surgical department by either the general practitioner or the gynaecologist. Scar endometrioma is believed to arise due to implantation of endometrial tissue during caesarean section. Cyclical pain, as in endometriosis, is characteristic but uncommon. Local wide excision remains the treatment of choice.
