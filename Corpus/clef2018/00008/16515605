Immunohistochemical characterization of endocervical papillary serous carcinoma. Endocervical adenocarcinomas are rare and aggressive neoplasms. Papillary serous endocervical adenocarcinomas are the rarest form of endocervical adenocarcinomas. This tumor exhibits morphologic similarities to its counterparts commonly seen in the endometrium, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and peritoneum, which are known to have an aggressive behavior. Because of the rarity of this tumor, little is known about its immunophenotyping. In this study, we included ten cases of papillary serous carcinomas arising from the uterine cervix (PSCC) diagnosed in the absence of a primary endometrial malignancy. We studied their immunohistochemical profile, using a panel of antibodies against Ki67, bcl-2, p53, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and CD10, and compared them to 20 consecutive cases of cervical adenocarcinoma of conventional cell subtypes (CAC) (15 mucinous, 3 adenosquamous, and 2 endometrioid). Immunostaining was recorded semiquantitatively. Patients with PSCC ranged in age from 27 to 79 years (mean = 51.6 +/- 19.1), while the conventional cell subtypes control group were 28-90 years old (mean = 47.5 +/- 16.9). Only p53 and CEA immunostaining significantly correlated with the PSCC morphology (P= 0.001 and P= 0.016, respectively) as shown by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Statistics (Modified Ridit Scores). PSCC is a distinctive immunophenotypic subtype of endocervical adenocarcinoma with significantly higher p53 and lower CEA reactivity than other more common histologic subtypes.
