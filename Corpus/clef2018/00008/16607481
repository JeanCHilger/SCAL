Pregnancy-induced vesical decidualized endometriosis simulating a bladder tumor. Vesical endometriosis accounts for approximately 1% of all discovered cases of endometriosis. We report the first case of a 36-year-old woman with pregnancy-associated decidual changes within bladder endometriosis that are clinically presented as a rapidly growing bladder tumor. Cystoscopy, with subsequent cold cup biopsy and fulguration, revealed a solitary, red-brown, nodular lesion, which turned to be a decidualized endometriosis of the urinary bladder. Delivery and postdelivery follow-up was uneventful and no recurrence was diagnosed.
