The value of preoperative platelet count in the prediction of cervical involvement and poor prognostic variables in patients with endometrial carcinoma. To evaluate the relationship between preoperative platelet counts and prognostic factors extensively, among endometrial cancer patients, especially with respect to cervical involvement.One-hundred fifty-five patients with endometrial carcinoma, who underwent surgery as the initial treatment consisting peritoneal cytology, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, systematic pelvic-paraaortic lymphadenectomy, and omentectomy were retrospectively analyzed.There were no differences with respect to age, histological type (endometrioid vs. non-endometrioid), depth of myometrial invasion, peritoneal cytology, LVSI, and lymphatic metastasis. However, advanced stage (stages III and IV), poorly differentiated tumor grade (grade 3), the presence of cervical and adnexal involvements were associated with significantly higher median preoperative platelet counts. Accepting 325.000/microl platelet count as a threshold value, multivariate analysis revealed cervical involvement (P=0.008 OR=1.84, 95% CI:1.17-2.89) and presence of high grade histology (P=0.014Higher preoperative platelet counts, even in conditions with normal range (150.000-400.000/microl), may reflect poor prognostic factors such as cervical involvement and high grade among patients with endometrial carcinoma. Also, the higher platelet count should be taken into consideration for the necessity of radical hysterectomy.
