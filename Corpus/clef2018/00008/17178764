Interleukin-10 gene promoter polymorphisms and their protein production in peritoneal fluid in patients with endometriosis. Although associations of interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene promoter polymorphisms and their protein production with endometriosis risk have been reported, the correlations remain controversial. The objective of this study was to determine IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms at -1082, -819 and -592 sites and their protein production in peritoneal fluid (PF) in patients with and without endometriosis. IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms at -1082 site were detected by amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR and that at -819 and -592 sites was genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-PCR. Protein levels of IL-10 in PF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There were no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms at position -1082 between the endometriosis and the control groups. However, the frequency of -819 or -592 C alleles was significantly increased in patients with endometriosis compared with controls. The protein levels of IL-10 in PF were statistically higher in the endometriosis group than in the control group. Moreover, the polymorphisms at -1082, -819 and -592 sites were associated with protein levels of IL-10 in PF in the endometriosis group while in the control group only the polymorphisms at position -1082 correlated with protein levels. Increased frequency of -819 or -592 C allele and increased protein production of IL-10 in PF in patients with endometriosis compared with controls and correlations of polymorphisms at -819 and -592 sites with protein levels of IL-10 in PF in patients with endometriosis may suggest that polymorphisms at -819 and -592 sites and their protein production are associated with endometriosis risk.
