Differential flow cytometric detection of intracellular cytokines in peripheral and peritoneal mononuclear cells of women with endometriosis. The pathogenesis of endometriosis is related to functional changes in CD3+ and CD14+ cells observed both at the local and systemic level. Here we investigated whether, and if so, how the body compartment influences cytokine expression in stimulated peritoneal and peripheral CD3+ and CD14+ cells of women with endometriosis.Isolated peripheral blood (PB) and peritoneal fluid (PF) mononuclear cells from women with endometriosis were cultured under non-adherent conditions and stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 6h to induce intracellular cytokine synthesis of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-8 by CD3+ cells or with LPS for 9h to produce TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, and IL-8 by CD14+ cells.The percentages of positive CD3+ cells stained for TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma were significantly higher and those stained for IL-8 were significantly lower in PF compared with PB, this being independent of the stage of endometriosis. In contrast, the percentages of CD14+ cells producing TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, and IL-8 were significantly higher in PB than PF of women with endometriosis.Monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes derived from the peripheral and peritoneal compartments of women with endometriosis differentially respond to stimulated cytokine synthesis induction. However, it is difficult to state whether the observed phenomenon is more related to body compartment influence per se or to the presence of endometriosis.
