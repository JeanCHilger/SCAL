Drug Insight: clinical use of agonists and antagonists of luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone. This article reviews the clinical uses of agonists and antagonists of luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), also known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone. In particular, the state of the art treatment of breast, ovarian and prostate cancer, reproductive disorders, uterine leiomyoma, endometriosis and benign prostatic hypertrophy is reported. Clinical applications of LHRH agonists are based on gradual downregulation of pituitary receptors for LHRH, which leads to inhibition of the secretion of gonadotropins and sex steroids. LHRH antagonists immediately block pituitary LHRH receptors and, therefore, achieve rapid therapeutic effects. LHRH agonists and antagonists can be used to treat uterine leiomyoma and endometriosis furthermore, both types of LHRH analogs are used to block the secretion of endogenous gonadotropins in ovarian-stimulation programs for assisted reproduction. The preferred primary treatment of patients with advanced, androgen-dependent prostate cancer is based on the periodic administration of depot preparations of LHRH agonists
