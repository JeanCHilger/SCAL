Accuracy of preoperative endometrial sampling for the detection of high-grade endometrial tumors. This study was undertaken to evaluate the ability of preoperative endometrial sampling to accurately diagnose high-grade endometrial tumors.Three hundred sixty endometrial cancer patients had preoperative endometrial sampling and hysterectomy specimens that underwent pathologic review at a single institution from 1995 to 2005. The sensitivity of Pipelle and curettage to diagnose high-grade endometrial tumors (grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, serous carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, clear cell carcinoma) was determined. Agreement between preoperative and hysterectomy diagnoses was measured by the Kappa statistic.Sensitivity of Pipelle and curettage was 93.8% and 97% in patients with low-grade cancer and 99.2% and 100% in patients with high-grade cancer. Good agreement was observed between the preoperative and the hysterectomy histologic diagnoses (Kappa = 0.69), and between the preoperative and hysterectomy tumor grade (Kappa=0.78).Preoperative endometrial sampling with Pipelle or curettage is sensitive and accurate for the diagnosis of high-grade endometrial tumors, including tumors with nonendometrioid histology.
