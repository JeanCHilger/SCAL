Efficacy of office diagnostic hysterofibroscopy. To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of hysterofibroscopy as an office diagnostic tool.Prospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification 3.PA-3.QZ).Private university hospital as a tertiary referral medical center.All the patients referred to the hospital for diagnostic hysterofibroscopy were enrolled in this study, irrespective of their indications, from January 2002 through December 2004.All diagnostic hysterofibroscopy procedures were performed on an outpatient basis and without analgesics or anesthetic.Feasibility of hysterofibroscopic diagnosis was evaluated by: (1) the ability of the hysterofibroscope to pass through the cervical canal (2) the quality of vision in the uterine cavityHysterofibroscopy is feasible for the investigation of the uterine cavity in an outpatient setting without anesthesia with acceptable reliability, although some confusion may occur when differentiating between endometrial polyps and submucosal myoma. Postprocedural complications were mostly attributed to vigorous dilation of the cervix.
