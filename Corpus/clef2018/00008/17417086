Magnetic resonance imaging of adnexal masses. Adnexal masses are common in women of all ages. A range of physiological and benign ovarian conditions that develop in women, especially in the reproductive age, and adnexal malignancies can be evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Management of women with adnexal masses is frequently guided by imaging findings therefore, precise characterization of adnexal pathology should be performed whenever possible. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in characterization of adnexal masses that are not completely evaluated by ultrasound because it can provide additional information on soft tissue composition of adnexal masses based on specific tissue relaxation times and allows multiplanar imaging at large field of view to define the origin and extent of pelvic pathology. The patients most likely to benefit from MRI are pregnant women and those who are premenopausal and have masses that have complex features on ultrasound but do not have raised cancer antigen 125 tumor marker levels. The overlap in imaging appearance among different cell type malignancies makes it difficult to predict exact histology based on MRI appearance
