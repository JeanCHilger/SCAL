Characterization of WNT7A expression in human endometrium and endometriotic lesions. To characterize the expression of WNT7A in human eutopic and ectopic endometrium.Experimental study using real-time polymerase chain reaction, laser microdissection, in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence.University-based laboratory.Patients with and without endometriosis undergoing surgery for benign indications.None.Relative expression values compared with housekeeping genes using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Detection of positive cells by immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization.In endometriosis, statistically significant higher WNT7A mRNA expression was observed compared with eutopic endometrium. Expression of WNT7A was found in the luminal and glandular epithelial cells as well as stroma cells in endometrium and endometriosis by immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction of laser microdissected tissue.The results of the present study suggest that WNT7A plays a role in the pathophysiology of endometriosis.
