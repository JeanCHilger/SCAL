Rectovaginal endometriosis -- a frequently missed diagnosis. To assess the proportion of women found to have rectovaginal endometriosis who underwent a previous laparoscopy with negative findings, a 5-year retrospective observational study was carried out at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff UK, from 2001 to 2005. A total of 61 cases with potential symptoms of rectovaginal endometriosis who underwent laparoscopy were identified. Rectovaginal endometriosis was identified in 16 of these cases. Previous laparoscopy was carried out in 33 of these 61 cases. In the group of women found to have rectovaginal endometriosis, 14 cases of rectovaginal endometriosis were not identified by pre-referral laparoscopy. This study supports the anecdotal idea that rectovaginal endometriosis is an often missed diagnosis at the time of laparoscopy. Diagnostic laparoscopy by generalist gynaecologists frequently fails to diagnose rectovaginal endometriosis. The routine use of rectal probes at laparoscopy is recommended to increase diagnostic accuracy.
