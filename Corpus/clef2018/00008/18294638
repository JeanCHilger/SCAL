Focal adhesion kinase expression in ovarian endometriosis. To investigate whether focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is expressed in endometriotic ovarian tissue.We collected tissue samples from the ovaries of 41 women with ovarian endometriosis and from the endometrium of 20 healthy women undergoing surgery for benign indications. FAK expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.Immunoreactive staining for FAK was present in the cytoplasm of epithelial and stromal cells in the 2 groups, but FAK expression was significantly higher in ovarian endometriotic tissue than in normal endometrium (P<0.01). FAK expression in ovarian endometriotic tissue was correlated with disease stage, pelvic pain level, and mean diameter of endometriotic cysts (P<0.05).FAK might contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of endometriosis.
