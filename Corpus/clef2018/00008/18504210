Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in nude mouse models of human endometriosis. To investigate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in eutopic and ectopic endometrium of in nude mice models of endometriosis and understand the role of VEGF in the development of endometriosis.Nude mouse models of endometriosis were established by subcutaneous implantation and abdominal injection of human endometrium xenograft from patients with endometriosis. The morphology of the foci was observed microscopically, and VEGF expression was measured with immunohistochemistry.Models of endometriosis were successfully established in 8 of the 10 mice receiving subcutaneous xenograft implantation and in 7 of the 10 mice with abdominal graft injection. Increased VEGF expression was observed in the ectopic endometrium in these models.VEGF expression is increased in the ectopic endometrium of the nude mouse models, and this animal model may facilitate future studies of angiogenesis and antiangiogenesis therapy.
