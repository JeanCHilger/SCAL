Pathology of the fallopian tube. Tubal carcinoma and serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary are remarkably similar in biologic characteristics and tumor markers, which suggests that the management for tubal carcinoma would be based on that for ovarian carcinoma. The cases with rare histologic features, including endometrioid carcinoma, mixed m√ºllerian tumor, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma have been reported. In the genesis of tubal pregnancy, microscopic evidence of silent inflammation has attracted special interest recently. With the development of sophisticated diagnostic tests and the progress of medical management, it has become possible to treat unruptured tubal pregnancies by pharmacologic approaches, laparoscopy, or transvaginal sonographic control. This review briefly outlines the conspicuous pathologic and etiologic features of neoplasms, ectopic pregnancy, and abnormality of the fallopian tube, and discusses some recent observations regarding these disorders.
