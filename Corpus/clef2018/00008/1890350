Flow cytometric DNA analysis of uterine endometrial carcinoma. The DNA content in individual cells from 40 cases of histopathologically normal endometria, 15 of endometrial hyperplasia and 68 of endometrial adenocarcinoma was measured by flow cytometry. An aneuploid cell population was found in 50% of malignant endometria, but in the remaining endometrial carcinomas, the flow cytometrical findings showed no difference from those of benign tissue. Aneuploidy was more common (77.8%) in poorly differentiated tumors than in highly differentiated tumors (35.5%). Two and more aneuploid cell populations were found in 8 cases of 34. The DNA indices of aneuploid tumors were classified into 3 groups: hyperdiploidy, low hyperdiploidy (DNA index range: 1.04-1.2) and high hyperdiploidy (DNA index range: More than 1.2). The proportion of tumors with a high DNA index tended to increase as tumors became less differentiated. In normal endometria the fraction of cells with DNA content corresponding to the s-phase (s-fraction) was 8 +/- 3% on average in the proliferative phase. In well differentiated diploid tumors the s-fraction was 12 +/- 6%, but in moderately and poorly differentiated tumors it was higher (16.0% and 19.0%).
