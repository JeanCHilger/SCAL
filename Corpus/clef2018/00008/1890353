Endosalpingosis in the pelvic peritoneum and pelvic lymph nodes. The pelvic peritoneum with macroscopic findings characteristic of endometriosis was biopsied in 18 cases at conservative surgery for endometriosis and examined. Pelvic lymph nodes removed in 76 cases at radical surgery for uterine cervical, corpus cancer or ovarian cancer patients were examined. In 3 of the 18 cases, endosalpingiosis was encountered in the pelvic peritoneum. In 2 of these 3 cases combined lesions of endometriosis and endosalpingiosis were observed. On the other hand, in 4 of the 76 patients with gynecological malignancies, benign glandular inclusions were found in pelvic lymph nodes. In 3 of these 4 patients, there was endosalpingiosis, and another there was endometriosis. Endosalpingiosis is an interesting lesion offering some clues to the histogenesis of endometriosis, and important in the differential diagnosis of malignant tumors.
