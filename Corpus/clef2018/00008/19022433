Two novel serum biomarkers for endometriosis screened by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and their change after laparoscopic removal of endometriosis. To explore novel endometriosis serum biomarkers by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS).First, we aimed to discover the potential biomarkers of endometriosis by SELDI-TOF-MS. Second, blinded test was performed to characterize the effectiveness of the model by examining the sensitivity and specificity. Third, 29 postoperative patients with endometriosis were recruited to monitor the change of potential biomarkers after laparoscopic surgery.Collaborative investigation in an academic research environment.Fifty-nine patients with endometriosis, 31 patients without endometriosis, and 30 healthy volunteers.Blood serum of endometriosis and control group patients.Protein expression.Two endometriosis-specific proteins were found in the preliminary screening study. Furthermore, the blinded test was performed and showed a sensitivity of 86.67% and a specificity of 96.77% of the markers for detecting endometriosis, which are significantly higher than those of CA-125 for distinguishing patients with endometriosis from patients without endometriosis. After surgery, the levels of these biomarker proteins decreased to levels comparable with those of patients without endometriosis.We discovered the potential biomarkers of endometriosis and set up a diagnostic model with a sensitivity of 86.67% and a specificity of 96.77%, which is significantly higher than that of CA-125 for detecting endometriosis, The levels of these proteins decreased to levels comparable with those of patients without endometriosis.
