Fine-needle cytology of metastatic endometrioid neoplasms: experience with eight cases. Despite the frequency of endometrioid malignancies, few articles in the literature are found concerning their cytopathologic presentation on fine-needle cytology samples. This report describes the cytomorphological findings in eight cases of recurrent or metastatic endometrioid neoplasms on fine-needle cytology samples obtained from various body sites. The cytological findings in metastatic or recurrent endometrioid carcinomas could be classified into five main patterns (i.e.: endometrioid, adeno-squamous, villo-glandular, clear cell, and papillary-serous), in analogy to histology. It is the authors' feeling that an adequate knowledge of the cytopathological features of this group of neoplasms may be important in favoring an early detection of their relapses or metastases and may contribute to save diagnostic time and more invasive procedures to the patients.
