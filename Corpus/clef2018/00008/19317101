Umbilical endometriosis. Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. Involvement of the umbilical region is rare. We present the case of a woman with ovarian endometriosis associated with extragenital umbilical endometriosis. The umbilical lesion was completely removed. We take the opportunity of this case to give a short survey with consideration to histopathological and therapeutic aspects as well as possible differential diagnostics.
