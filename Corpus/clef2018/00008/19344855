Adolescent endometriosis. The presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus, typically in the pelvis, is known as endometriosis. An adolescent with this diagnosis usually presents with chronic pelvic pain, and she and her family are anxious for an explanation of her symptoms.

An outline of the disease and the issues surrounding its diagnosis and management in adolescents is the focus of this article.
