Aberrant gene expression profile in a mouse model of endometriosis mirrors that observed in women. To define the altered gene expression profile of endometriotic lesions in a mouse model of surgically induced endometriosis.Autologous experimental mouse model.Medical school department.Adult C57Bl6 mice.Endometriosis was surgically induced by autotransplantation of uterine tissue to the intestinal mesentery. Endometriotic lesions and eutopic uteri were recovered at 3 or 29 days after induction.Altered gene expression was measured in the endometriotic lesion relative to the eutopic uterus by genome-wide complementary DNA microarray analysis and was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for six genes. Relevant categories of altered genes were identified using gene ontology analysis to determine groups of genes enriched for altered expression.The expression of 479 and 114 genes was altered in the endometriotic lesion compared with the eutopic uterus at 3 or 29 days after induction, respectively. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that genes associated with the extracellular matrix, cell adhesions, immune function, cell growth, and angiogenesis were altered in the endometriotic lesion compared with the eutopic uterus.According to gene expression analysis, the mouse model of surgically induced endometriosis is a good model for studying the pathophysiology and treatment of endometriosis.
