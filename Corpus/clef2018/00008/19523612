Comparative analysis of the spindle and chromosome configurations of in vitro-matured oocytes from patients with endometriosis and from control subjects: a pilot study. Preliminary data from a prospective controlled study did not demonstrate an increased percentage of meiotic abnormalities for in vitro-matured oocytes obtained from stimulated cycles of endometriosis and control patients. However, the tendency toward a higher proportion of telophase I in apparently matured oocytes observed in endometriosis patients suggests an impairment or delay of the completion of meiosis I which requires further evaluation.
