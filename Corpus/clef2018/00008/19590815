Endometriosis of the groin hernia sac: report of a case and review of the literature. Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of histological normal endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. It occurs in up to 15% of menstruating women and often goes undetected. Some cases of soft-tissue involvement have been reported, particularly in the skin and subjacent tissues of surgical scars. However, we came cross a 42-year-old female patient with millimetric focal lesions in a groin hernia sac. A case report and a review of the literature are presented. Although definitive diagnosis still requires biopsy, the patient's cyclic symptoms and history of previous uterine surgery should suggest the correct diagnosis.
