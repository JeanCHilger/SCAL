CAM26, CAM29 and mucin-like carcinoma associated antigen in epithelial ovarian cancer. The levels of CA125 (reference values [RVs] 35 U/mL and 65 U/mL), CA15.3 (RV = 32 U/mL), Mucin-like carcinoma associated antigen (MCA RV = 15 U/mL), CAM26 (RV = 75 U/mL) and CAM29 (RV = 15 U/mL) were preoperatively assayed in blood samples drawn from 42 patients with ovarian carcinoma and 101 patients with benign ovarian pathology undergoing laparotomy at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics of the University of Pisa. With 65 U/mL as RV, CA125 had a sensitivity (SE) of 80.9% and a specificity (SP) of 89.1% for ovarian carcinoma
