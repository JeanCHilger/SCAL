Voiding dysfunction in women undergoing laparoscopic treatment for moderate to severe endometriosis. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the incidence and the surgical factors determining the development of postoperative voiding dysfunction following this surgery. The presence of rectovaginal dissection was significantly associated with the development of voiding dysfunction, and we suggest vigilance among practitioners about the possibility of the development of voiding dysfunction in this group of women.
