Increased expression of glutathione by estradiol, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin 1-beta in endometrial stromal cells. The intracellular antioxidant system, based on glutathione (GSH), plays a key role in endometrial detoxification reactions and has been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis endometriosis. This study was designed to evaluate whether estradiol (E(2)) and proinflammatory cytokines have any effects on expression of glutathione in endometrial stromal cells (ESCs).Glutathione levels were measured utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography following in vitro culture and treatment of ESCs with estradiol, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta).The GSH level in E(2) (10(-8) m) treatment group was significantly higher than in the control group at 48 h (P < 0.05). In vitro treatment of ESCs with TNF-alpha 10 ng/mL as well as E(2) (10(-8) m) plus TNF-alpha 10 ng/mL for 48 hr also led to a significant increase in GSH level (P < 0.05 P < 0.05, respectively). Both IL-1beta 10 ng/mL and E(2) (10(-8) m) plus IL-1beta 10 ng/mL for 48 hr increased GSH level significantly (P < 0.05These findings might suggest that increased production of estradiol and proinflammatory cytokines in the peritoneal cavity possibly leads to the establishment of endometriosis through increased level of GSH.
