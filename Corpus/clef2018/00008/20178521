Mysteries of endometriosis pain: Chien-Tien Hsu Memorial Lecture 2009. The more that one looks at the condition endometriosis, the more one realises that it is a unique and complex condition exhibiting a bizarre range of deviations from normal endometrial and myometrial physiology, and presenting with a challenging range of pain-related symptoms. The changing nature of the pain is not well defined, and the molecular mechanisms leading to pain generation are far from clear. Recent research has begun to reveal some of these links between expression of unusual molecules in the eutopic endometrium and ectopic lesions, microanatomical changes in the pelvic nervous system, neuronal dysfunction and the later development of neuropathic pain. A better understanding of these mechanisms will undoubtedly lead to improved use of current medical and surgical treatments, and to the development of novel treatments in the future.
