Endometriosis following cesarean section: ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. We present three cases of endometriosis developing in the abdominal wall following cesarean section. The patients were examined by Doppler ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The object is to describe the US and MRI findings of the lesion and evaluate their role in the diagnosis and management. In our opinion, a single procedure is sufficient in evaluating the lesion and in reaching the diagnosis.
