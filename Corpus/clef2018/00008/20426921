Laparoscopic approach in acute bowel obstruction due to ileal endometriosis: case report. Endometriosis affects 10-20% of fertile women, and in 3-37% of them it extends to the bowel. Its location, in the ileal tract of the bowel, usually the end-part, is only the 7% and the occurrence of intestinal obstruction is no more than 0.15% of patients affected by endometriosis. We present a case of acute bowel obstruction due to ileal endometriosis in a 39 years woman, diagnosed and treated by laparoscopic approach.
