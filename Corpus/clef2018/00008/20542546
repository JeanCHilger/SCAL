MicroRNA signatures differentiate uterine cancer tumor subtypes. Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic malignancy. Type I EC has a favorable prognosis, while type II ECs account for half of all treatment failures. Little knowledge of the biological differences is available to predict EC outcomes besides their pathological distinctions. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a family of non-translated RNAs important in regulating oncogenic pathways. Mis-expression patterns of miRNAs in EC, as well as differences in miRNA expression patterns between the subtypes of EC, has not been previously evaluated. Our purpose was to identify miRNA profiles of EC subtypes, and to identify miRNAs associated with these subtypes to ultimately understand the different biological behavior between these subtypes.Ninety-five fresh/frozen and paraffin-embedded samples of endometrial type I and II cancer, carcinosarcomas and benign endometrial samples were collected. MiRNA expression profiles were evaluated by microarray analysis. Statistical analysis was performed.Distinct miRNA signatures in tumor versus normal samples and in endometrioid vs. uterine papillary serous carcinomas exist. Additionally, carcinosarcomas have a unique miRNA signature from either the type I or II epithelial tumors.We hypothesize that further understanding the miRNAs that separate these subtypes of EC will lead to biological insights into the different behavior of these tumors.
