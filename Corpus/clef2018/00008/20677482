Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced cyclooxygenase-2 overexpression in eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis by stromal cell culture through nuclear factor-kappaB activation. To investigate the role of NF-kappaB during the induction of COX-2 by TNF-alpha in the eutopic endometrium of women with and without endometriosis using stromal cell culture.Experimental study in cultured stromal cells of the eutopic endometrium of women with and without endometriosis in the presence of TNF-alpha.Within 5-20 minutes of stimulation with TNF-alpha, p-IkappaB was clearly observed in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis and in that of women without endometriosis. COX-2 protein was significantly induced by treatment with TNF-alpha in both eutopic endometrial stromal cells of women with and without endometriosis (p < 0.05), but the degree of induction was significantly increased in eutopic endometrial stromal cells of women with endometriosis than those of women without endometriosis (p < 0.05).Overexpression of COX-2 by TNF-alpha in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis may play a critical role in such pathophysiologic processes as endometriosis formation.
