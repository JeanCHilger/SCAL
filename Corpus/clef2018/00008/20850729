Aberrant expression of the pluripotency marker SOX-2 in endometriosis. Expression of the pluripotency factors SOX-2, OCT-4, KLF-4, and NANOG was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence microscopy in the endometrium, myometrium, and endometriotic tissue of 36 patients. Aberrant expression of SOX-2 may indicate a stem cell origin of endometriosis, whereas the presence of all progenitor markers in endometrial tissue marks the endometrium as a potential source for induced pluripotent stem cell generation.
