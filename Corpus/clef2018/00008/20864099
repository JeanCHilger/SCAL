Effects of prostaglandin E2 and vascular endothelial growth factor on sperm might lead to endometriosis-associated infertility. Significantly higher levels of prostaglandin E2 and vascular endothelial growth factor were associated with the severity of endometriosis. In this study, pathologic concentrations of prostaglandin E2 and vascular endothelial growth factor found in endometriotic women significantly inhibited sperm motility, acrosome reaction, and sperm-oocyte interaction, which might result in endometriosis-associated subfertility/infertility.
