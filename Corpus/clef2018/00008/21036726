Isomorph expression of BAG-1 gene, ER and PR in endometrial cancer. BAG-1 isomorphs are regulating proteins with antiapoptotic action in endometrium. ERa and PRA isomorphs seem to have an important role in endometrial cancer.We investigated the expression of BAG-1, ERa and PRA isomorphs in endometrioid adenocarcinoma and we correlated them with clinicopathological findings of the tumor. Fresh endometrial tissues were obtained from 33 patients with endometrial carcinoma and 191 paraffin-embedded tissues were analyzed by real-time PCR and immunochemistry for BAG-1, ER and PR.BAG-1 protein is expressed in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Grade 3 tumors were considered to have the highest intensity. Only 4 out of 79 samples showed intense expression of ERa, while 37 samples out of 72 samples strongly expressed PRA.BAG-1 nuclear isomorph appeared more frequently in grade 2 tumors than in grade 1 and 3 tumors, and the cytoplasmatic isomorph was expressed more strongly than the nuclear one.
