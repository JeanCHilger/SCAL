Endometrial clear cell adenocarcinoma diagnosed by endometrial cytological examination: two cases report. In contrast to endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (EA), endometrial clear cell adenocarcinoma (ECCA) is rare and shows a clinically aggressive potential, resulting in a poor prognosis. Therefore, the early diagnosis of ECCA is crucial for the treatment of patients bearing the tumor. Here, we report two cases of ECCA diagnosed by cytological examination. Case 1 was a 67-year-old female, while case 2 was a 68-year-old female. In both cases, tumors of the corpus uteri were identified, and they were diagnosed as ECCA on cytological examination with specimens derived from endometrial brushing. The diagnosis was confirmed by the histological examination of the surgical specimens.
