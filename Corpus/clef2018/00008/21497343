Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in peritoneal fluid samples identifies differential protein regulation in patients suffering from peritoneal or ovarian endometriosis. Endometriosis is determined by local and systemic proinflammatory dysregulation and therefore differential protein expression in peritoneal fluid (PF). Of highest interest is lesion formation and the establishment and persistence of endometriosis. In this study we analyzed well-characterized PF samples of patients with ovarian or peritoneal endometriosis and compared them to control samples. We found 11 proteins differentially regulated, of which some might play a key role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
