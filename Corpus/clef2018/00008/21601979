Effectiveness of the association micronized N-Palmitoylethanolamine (PEA)-transpolydatin in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain related to endometriosis after laparoscopic assessment: a pilot study. Aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the association between N-Palmitoylethanolamine and transpolydatin in the management of chronic pelvic pain related to EMS.This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 61 subjects, submitted to a first line laparoscopic conservative surgery, who were randomized into 3 groups receiving: group A (n=21) the association N-Palmitoylethanolamine-transpolydatin 400 mg + 40 mg twice a day for 3 months group B (n=20) the placebo for 3 monthsA marked decrease in dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia and pelvic pain was observed in all groups, and the association between N-Palmitoylethanolamine and transpolydatin resulted to be more effective than placebo (P<.001). Additionally, the treatment with Celecoxib resulted in a decrease in pelvic pain more effective either than the association N-Palmitoylethanolamine and transpolydatin or placebo.These preliminary results show that the association between micronized N-Palmitoylethanolamine and transpolydatin is effective in the management of pelvic pain related to endometriosis after laparoscopy. Additionally, this association seems to be safe, shows an optimal control of pain and can be used in patients who are unable to receive other therapies.
