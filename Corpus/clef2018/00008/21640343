Endometrial Indian hedgehog expression is decreased in women with endometriosis. Nuclear and cytoplasmic endometrial expression of Indian hedgehog increased from the late proliferative to mid and late secretory phases in 26 healthy volunteers compared with 30 women with endometriosis. The abnormal expression of Indian hedgehog protein in women with endometriosis suggests a resistance to P action.
