Scientific investigation of endometriosis among adolescents. The scientific literature on endometriosis specific to the adolescent population is limited, and the existing data are retrospective and descriptive in nature. It is possible that the disease has a different pathophysiology in adolescents, but little epidemiologic or molecular data exist to support or refute this speculation. In addition, the limited literature does not yet confirm that intervening in the adolescent population prevents long-term sequelae such as pain and infertility as adults. Case-control and cohort studies to identify risk factors, as well as prospective observational and intervention studies to assess treatment outcome, are required to further knowledge about endometriosis in the adolescent population. The scientific literature on endometriosis specific to the adolescent population is limited, and the existing data are retrospective and descriptive in nature. This review summarizes studies that have been done to date and suggests areas for future investigation.
