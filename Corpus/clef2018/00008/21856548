Markers of adult endometriosis detectable in adolescence. Endometriosis, a disease of young females that is possibly a devastating ailment requiring surgery, appears to be associated with certain features encountered in adolescence. First among these symptoms is the history of severe and lasting dysmenorrhea at the time of adolescence and the need to use oral contraceptives (OCs) for alleviating dysmenorrhea that failed to respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Further awareness about existing associations between certain symptoms experienced at adolescence and the later development of endometriosis is important. Indeed, the possibility of diagnosing endometriosis earlier when suggested by clinical history could lead to less extensive surgery and thus, less damage. Experimental verification of this insight, however, is needed before the concept that early diagnosis means lesser destructive surgery can be ascertained.
