Expression and relationship of Ezh2, Runx3 and caspase-3 in endometrial adenocarcinoma. To investigate the role of the expression of Ezh2, Runx3 and caspase-3 proteins and their correlation in the pathogenesis of endometrial carcinoma.Expression of Ezh2, Runx3 and caspase-3 proteins was examined by tissue microarray technique and immunohistochemistry (SP method) in 72 cases of endometrial adenocarcinomas, 60 endometrial hyperplasia and 30 normal endometrial tissues.The positive expression rates of Ezh2, Runx3 and caspase-3 proteins in endometrial adenocarcinomas were 83.3% (60/72), 26.4% (19/72) and 33.3% (24/72), respectively. The positive rate of Ezh2 protein in endometrial carcinomas was higher than that in normal endometrium and endometrial hyperplasia (16.7%, 33.3%, 63.3%P < 0.05). However, the positive rate of Runx3 in endometrial carcinomas was lower than that in normal endometrium and endometrial hyperplasia (80.0%, 56.7%Abnormal expression of Ezh2, Runx3 and caspase-3 proteins is associated with the development and progression of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Combined analysis of Ezh2, Runx3 and caspase-3 may offer prognostic information for patients with endometrial cancer.
