Co-expression of bone morphogenetic protein 6 with estrogen receptor a in endometriosis. Bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP-6) has decisive role in controlling multiple organogenetic processes, as well as modulating cell differentiation and proliferation. Considering those pleiotropic effects, we focused on determining expression of that multifunctional growth factor in ectopic endometriotic tissues.In this prospective study, 85 consecutive women with endometriosis were included. All patients underwent gynecological operations due to endometriosis associated problems and tissue specimens were collected from ectopic endometriotic lesions. Immunohistochemical staining of paraffin sections for both BMP-6 and estrogen receptors a (ERa) was performed in all 85 cases using an avidin-biotin-peroxidase procedure.Ectopic endometrium showed intense cytoplastic immunoreactivity to BMP-6 in both epithelium and stroma. In addition, we have demonstrated that BMP-6 expression is highly associated with strong expression of ERa.The availability of BMP-6 in the ectopic endometrium may be at least partly involved in the mechanisms of attachment, survival and expansion of endometriosis. Moreover, the statistically significant correlation in expression of BMP-6 and ERa demonstrated in this study may be associated with the development of rich in estrogen microenvironment, but requires further investigation. In conclusion, this is the first study in our knowledge demonstrating strong expression of BMP-6 in endometriosis.
