Correlation between laparoscopic and histopathologic diagnosis of endometriosis. To review the histopathologic diagnosis of biopsies taken following visualization of endometriosis at laparoscopy and to correlate visual with microscopic diagnoses.A retrospective review was undertaken of medical charts with a diagnosis of endometriosis at Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya, between January 2001 and October 2010. Eligibility included visual diagnosis of endometriosis at laparoscopy, with a clear record of site, size, morphology, and number of lesions. The histopathologic diagnosis of the biopsies sampled was sought. Correlation was undertaken using Îº statistics for diagnostic variability.Of the 204 relevant records, 152 (74.5%) met the eligibility criteria from these cases, 239 specimens were submitted for histology. The most common symptom was chronic pelvic pain (108 [71.1%]). Most biopsies were obtained from the ovary and posterior cul-de-sac. Histopathologic diagnosis was confirmed in (152 [63.8%]) specimens and correlated with Asian race, multiparity, and chronic pelvic pain. Neither the site of the lesion nor the stage of disease influenced the histopathologic diagnosis.Laparoscopic visualization of endometriosis does not always correlate with histopathologic diagnosis several other lesions may mimic endometriosis on histopathologic examination.
