Unusual manifestation of endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising from subserosal cystic adenomyosis of the uterus: emphasis on MRI and positron emission tomography CT findings. There are several reports of adenocarcinoma developing within adenomyosis of the uterus, but imaging features of MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT, have not been published. Herein we report a rare case of endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising from subserosal cystic adenomyosis to emphasise the unusual growth features, as well as the imaging findings of the tumour on MRI and PET-CT.
