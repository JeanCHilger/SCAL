Change in health-related quality of life and change in clinical symptoms after uterine artery embolization in patients with symptomatic adenomyosis uteri - evaluation using a standardized questionnaire. To evaluate the clinical response of uterine artery embolization (UAE) in women with symptomatic uterine adenomyosis by comparing health-related quality of life and symptom severity before and after UAE using a standardized questionnaire.This longitudinal study at two time points included 17 patients with a median age of 47.1 years with symptomatic uterine adenomyosis (n = 7 pure adenomyosis n = 10 with concomitant fibroids). The diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria. Data on health-related quality of life and severity of symptoms before and after UAE were obtained by the standardized "Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life" (UFS-QOL) questionnaire and correlated in the following. Treatment failure was defined as the need for a second invasive procedure because of recurrent symptoms or persistent symptoms after UAE.The median interval between the evaluation of the UFS-QOL questionnaire before and after UAE was 46.0 months. 70.6 % (12/17 95 % confidence interval 44.0 % â€Š- 88.6 %) of the patients had therapy response with a significant improvement of health-related quality of life and clinical symptoms (p-value = 0.002). The therapy failure rate was 29.4 % (5/17UAE to treat symptomatic adenomyosis uteri can significantly improve the health-related quality of life and clinical symptoms. However, therapy failure is possible in up to one-third of patients.
