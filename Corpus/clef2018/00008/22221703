HMGA gene rearrangement is a recurrent somatic alteration in polypoid endometriosis. The pathogenesis of endometriosis is unclear, and several genetic, endocrine, immune, and environmental agents have been evaluated with no putative causative factors identified. Here, we show somatic genetic alterations involving HMGA1 (6p21) and HMGA2 (12q15) in 3 cases of polypoid endometriosis. The lesions involved the small bowel mesentery and perirectal soft tissue in 1 case and the posterior vaginal fornix and sigmoid colon serosa in 2 other cases, respectively. All had a polypoid configuration with cystically dilated irregular glands and fibrotic stroma, containing thick-walled vessels. Conventional cytogenetic analysis of 1 case showed 46,XX,t(512)(q13
