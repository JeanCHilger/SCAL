Pre-sampling ultrasound evaluation and assessment of the tissue yield during sampling improves the diagnostic reliability of office endometrial biopsy. We evaluated the implementation of a strict procedure for endometrium biopsy, including pre-sampling ultrasound examination and assessment of the tissue yield during sampling, in 257 consecutive women with abnormal bleeding. The tissue yield was assessed during sampling and scored from 1 to 4. The median endometrial thickness as measured by ultrasound was 5.0 mm, 5.1 mm, 10.0 mm and 18.7 mm for a tissue yield score of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The median endometrial thickness at ultrasound and the median tissue yield score was 18.3 mm and score 4 in the endometrial cancer cases, compared with 3.9 mm and score 1, and 14.8 mm and score 3 in the case of endometrial atrophy and hyperplasia, respectively and 11.5 mm and score 2 in endometrial polyp cases. Overall, 12 cancers were diagnosed. No endometrial cancer was diagnosed during follow-up (median 447 days). A strict office endometrial biopsy procedure contributes to the diagnostic reliability for intracavitary pathology.
