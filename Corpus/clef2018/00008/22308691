Research of therapeutical effect and immunologic mechanism of Jiawei Foshou San on model rats of endometriosis. To explore the effect and mechanism of Jiawei Foshou San on the accretion ectopic endometrium of rats.Endometriosis model was established by surgical implant of endometrial tissue which belongs to its body in rats. Jiawei Foshou San was administrated to the model rats. Twenty-eight days later, the length of ectopic endometrium was measured by vernier caliper, the spleen was weighed by electronic balance, the content of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in blood serum and peritoneal fluid was detected by ELISA test, the expression of interleukin (IL)-8 in ectopic endometrium was detected by immunohistochemical method, the expression of NF-kappaB p65 protein and inhibitory KBalpha (IkappaBalpha) protein in ectopic endometrium were analyzed by western blot.Jiawei Foshou San 0.045, 0.09, 0.18 g x kg(-1) group reduced the volume of ectopic endometrium. Jiawei Foshou San 0.18 g x kg(-1) group raised the spleen exponent of model rats. Jiawei Foshou San 0.09, 0.18 g x kg(-1) group decreased the content of TNF-alpha in blood serum and peritoneal fluid, and the content of IL-8 in ectopic endometrium was also decreased. Jiawei Foshou San can decrease the expression of NF-KB p65 and increase the expression of IkappaBalpha in ectopic endometrium.Jiawei Foshou San can inhibit the accretion of endometriosis implants of rats, and its mechanism might be associated with improving the environment of body.
