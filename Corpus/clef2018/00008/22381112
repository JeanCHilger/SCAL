Acute renal failure induced by disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in a patient with adenomyosis. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is most frequently associated with obstetric catastrophes, metastatic malignancy, massive trauma and bacterial sepsis, but relatively rarely related to benign tumors. We report on disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in a patient with significant adenomyosis and menometrorrhagia. An extremely rare case, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy developed in this benign case and was successfully treated with a hysterectomy and blood product transfusions.
