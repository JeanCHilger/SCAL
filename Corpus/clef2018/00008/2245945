Serum and peritoneal fluid CA-125 levels in early stage endometriosis. Serum and peritoneal fluid (PF) CA-125 levels were assayed using the immunoradiometric assay in 17 women with minimal endometriosis and 21 control women at the time of laparoscopy. Serum levels of CA-125 were not significantly higher in women with minimal endometriosis. Minimal endometriosis was diagnosed with a 70.6% rate of sensitivity and a 71.4% rate of specificity with 16 U/ml as the upper limit of normal. PF CA-125 levels were significantly higher than serum levels but showed no significant difference between control and endometriosis patients.
