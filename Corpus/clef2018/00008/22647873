Role of reproductive surgery in the era of assisted reproductive technology. Reproductive surgery could be divided into surgery as a primary treatment for infertility, surgery to enhance in-vitro fertilisation outcome, and surgery for fertility preservation. A shift has occurred away from surgery as a primary treatment of infertility to surgery playing a crucial part in enhancing in-vitro fertilisation outcome and for fertility preservation. A normal uterine cavity is a prerequisite for implantation, and hysteroscopic correction of intrauterine pathology, including polypectomy, myomectomy and metroplasty, increases the chances of having a successful pregnancy. Management of hydrosalpinx before in-vitro fertilisation treatment by laparoscopic salpingectomy or proximal tubal occlusion increases the in-vitro fertilisation delivery rate. Finally, surgery plays an important role in preservation of fertility. This includes laparoscopic ovarian transposition, ovarian tissue removal for cryopreservation and ovarian transplantation.
