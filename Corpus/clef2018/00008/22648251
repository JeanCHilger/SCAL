Increased expression of importin13 in endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma. Importin13 (IPO13) is a novel potential marker of corneal epithelial progenitor cells. We investigated the expression and localization of IPO13 in endometrial, endometriotic and endometrial carcinoma tissue.IPO13 expression in endometrial, endometriotic and endometrial carcinoma tissue was examined by immunohistochemistry, qPCR and Western blot.Immunohistochemistry studies showed that IPO13 protein was expressed mainly in cytoplasm of glandular epithelial cell and stromal cells. The rate of importin13-positive cells in proliferative phase endometrium was higher (by about 6-fold) than that in secretory endometrium (P<0.05) and the rate of importin13-positive cells in endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma was higher than that in normal secretory phase endometrial tissues (by about 4- and 9-fold, respectively). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed co-localization of IPO13 with CD34, CD45, c-kit, telomerase, CD90 and CD146. QPCR revealed significantly increased IPO13 mRNA in endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma versus secretory phase endometrium (by about 2- and 10-fold, respectively). Western blot analysis showed that IPO13 protein is enhanced in endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma versus secretory phase endometrium (p<0.05).These results demonstrate an increased expression of IPO13 in endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma, which could be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma IPO13 can serve as an endometrial progenitor/stem cell marker.
