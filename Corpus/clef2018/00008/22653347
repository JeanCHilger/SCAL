Low-grade, low-stage endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma: a clinicopathologic analysis of 324 cases focusing on frequency and pattern of myoinvasion. Patients with low-stage, low-grade endometrial adenocarcinomas have a favorable prognosis however, a subset has a risk of recurrence and death. We were interested in evaluating patterns of myometrial invasion and correlating them with clinical outcome to potentially identify patients at increased risk. A total of 324 cases of low-stage Grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma were reviewed to identify those with myoinvasion. The myoinvasive cases were classified on the basis of the pattern of invasion: infiltrating glands, microcystic elongated and fragmented (MELF
