Clear-cell carcinoma of the abdominal wall after cesarean delivery. Clear-cell carcinoma transformed from an abdominal wall scar is extremely rare there are only 22 cases reported in literature. Here we report a case of a patient with clear-cell carcinoma of the abdominal wall after cesarean delivery and review the relevant literature.A 49-year-old woman presented with a chief complaint of progressively growing mass of cesarean scar and periodic pain with menstruation for 25 years. Wide surgical resection with clear margins was performed. Clear-cell carcinoma was demonstrated by pathologic examination. The patient underwent six cycles of adjutant chemotherapy postoperatively. The patient remains clinically free of recurrence 8 months after treatment.Comprehensive treatment consisting of radical surgery combined with adjuvant therapy should be considered for this uncommon condition.
