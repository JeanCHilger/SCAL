Effect of antiangiogenic treatment on peritoneal endometriosis-associated nerve fibers. To investigate the effect of antiangiogenic treatment on experimental endometriotic lesion nerve fibers.Heterologous mouse model of endometriosis.University Institute IVI, University Hospital La Fe.Ovariectomized nude mice (n = 16) receiving human endometrial fragments from oocyte donors (n = 4).Endometrium fragments stuck in the peritoneum of 5-week-old female nude mice treated with vehicle (n = 8) and antiangiogenic agent cabergoline (n = 8 Cb(2,) 0.05 mg/kg/day) for 14 days.Immunofluorescence analysis of von-Willebrand factor (vWF) and vascular smooth muscle cells (Î±SMA) for evaluating the number of immature blood vessels (IBV) and microvascular density (MVD) immunochemical analysis of protein-gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) to assess nerve fibers density (NFD), and blue toluidine staining to confirm presence of mast cells and macrophages in endometriotic lesions.All the results were quantified by morphometric techniques. The IBV, NFD, and number of macrophages and mast cells were statistically significantly decreased in the Cb2-treated group when compared with controls.Antiangiogenic treatment statistically significantly diminishes new blood vessel formation after macrophage, mast cell, and nerve fiber reduction, providing a rationale to test antiangiogenic agents as a novel therapeutic approach to severe pelvic pain associated with human peritoneal endometriosis.
