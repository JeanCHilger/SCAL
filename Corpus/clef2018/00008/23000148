Uterine papillary serous cancer: a review of the literature. Uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) represents a distinct subtype of endometrial cancer. UPSC is less common than endometrioid carcinoma (ECC) but accounts for a disproportionate number of uterine cancer related deaths. This article critically reviews the literature pertinent to the pathology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, management, and outcome of patients with UPSC.MEDLINE was searched for all research articles published in English between January 1, 1967-January 1, 2012 which reported on patients diagnosed with UPSC. Given the rarity of this tumor, studies were not limited by design or number of reported patients.UPSC represents a histologically aggressive subtype of endometrial cancer. It commonly presents with extra uterine disease involvement which can be identified by comprehensive surgical staging. Optimal cytoreduction and systemic platinum/taxane-based adjuvant therapy appear to confer a survival advantage.UPSC is a biologically distinct entity, different from ECC. Future studies should explore the role of targeted therapies in the management of UPSC.
