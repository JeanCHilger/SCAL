Prognostic impact of EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal-transition)-related protein expression in endometrial cancer. The epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) is an important step in the invasion and metastasis of cancer. A critical molecular feature of this process is the downregulation of E-cadherin expression, which is mainly controlled by Snail-related zinc-finger transcription factors (Snail and Slug). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of EMT-related protein (E-cadherin, Snail and Slug) expression in endometrial cancer.An immunohistochemical analysis was conducted using tissue microarray samples of 354 primary tumors and 30 metastases of endometrial carcinomas, and the relationship between protein expression, clinicopathological features and outcomes were investigated.Reduced E-cadherin was seen in 39.8% of primary tumors. Reduced E-cadherin was seen in 19.5%, 40.8% and 72.7% of G₁, G₂ and G₃ endometrioid adenocarcinomas, respectively. The nuclear expression of Snail and Slug were positive in 16.9% and 3.7% of primary tumors, respectively. EMT status, which was represented by both reduced E-cadherin and nuclear expression of Snail, was significantly associated with histological type, FIGO stage, myometrial invasion, positive peritoneal cytology and patient survival (p < 0.01). There was no difference in the rates of EMT status between the primary tumors and metastases. A multivariate analysis showed that EMT-positive status was a significant predictor for both the progression-free survival and overall survival (p < 0.01).These data indicate that EMT status has a prognostic impact in endometrial cancer. Therefore, the clarification and control of EMT signaling is a promising molecular targeting therapy in endometrial cancer.
