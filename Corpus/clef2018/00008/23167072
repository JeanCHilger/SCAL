Endometriosis: an essential differential diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain. In the context of chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis plays a significant role due to its frequency and its effects on the quality of women's lives. It affects 3-10% of women of reproductive age. The clinical signs are part from chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, urinary and digestive symptoms as well as infertility. The clinical signs and symptoms may vary and the clinical examination may be difficult to interpret for a physician who is not familiar with the condition. This explains the fact that it takes more time to make the diagnosis of endometriosis. Delay of diagnosis, multiple consultations and complex surgical procedures implicate physical and psychological suffering for the patient with serious complications. For all these reasons, the differential diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain in women should include endometriosis.
