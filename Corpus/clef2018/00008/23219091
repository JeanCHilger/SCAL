Elevated immunoreactivity of RANTES and CCR1 correlate with the severity of stages and dysmenorrhea in women with deep infiltrating endometriosis. Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is typically characterized by multifocal locations. It has been shown that CCR1, combined highly with RANTES, contributes to the enhanced recruitment of inflammatory cells at endometriotic sites. As an estrogen-dependent disorder, estrogen receptors are also crucial to the growth of endometriotic tissues. In this study we report the immunohistochemical analysis of RANTES, CCR1, ER-α and ER-β in 48 histological lesions prepared from women with DIE undergoing surgery. Immunohistochemical analysis of RANTES, CCR1, ER-α and ER-β was conducted at different sites of DIE lesions. RANTES was immunolocalized in the cytoplasm and CCR1 in cytomembranes of endometriotic cells. ER-α and ER-β extensively immunostained the nuclei of endometrial glandular, and stromal cells. Immunoreactivity in DIE lesions, similar to the widespread ERs, showed higher expression of RANTES and CCR1 in three types of DIE lesions. There was a significant correlation, independent of cyclic changes, between the expression of RANTES/CCR1 and DIE lesions. RANTES/CCR1 increased significantly according to the severity of dysmenorrhea. RANTES and CCR1 together may provide a potential biomarker for DIE-related pain and inflammatory response in endometriotic lesions of patients with DIE.
