Clinical analysis of ovarian epithelial carcinoma with coexisting pelvic endometriosis. To explore the differences between women with endometriosis associated ovarian cancer and typical epithelial ovarian cancer.The medical charts of total 226 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer treated at Peking Union Medical College Hospital between March 2011 and March 2012 were reviewed. Histology evaluation determined endometriosis associated ovarian cancer (n = 17) or non-endometriosis associated ovarian cancer (n = 209).Compared with non-endometriosis associated ovarian cancer, patients with endometriosis associated ovarian cancer were proved: (1) to be younger and more likely to be premenopausal at diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer (P = .03 and .005, respectively) (2) to have lower preoperative serum level of Ca125 (mean: 122.9 vs 1377.5 U/mL, P < .001) and more likely to display normal Ca125 level (P < .001)As such, patients with endometriosis associated ovarian cancer differ from non-endomertiosis associated ovarian cancer in many of their critical clinical and biologic characteristics.
