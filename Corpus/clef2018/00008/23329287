Expression of neurotrophic and inflammatory mediators in rectosigmoid endometriosis. To evaluate the expression of neurotrophic (NGF, NPY and VIP) and pro-inflammatory (TNF-α) mediators in the rectum and sigmoid fragments compromised by endometriosis.Twenty-four patients were selected to undergo surgical treatment of endometriosis of the rectum and sigmoid colon with a segmental resection technique, followed by end-to-end anastomosis with a circular stapler from January 2005 to December 2007. The study included premenopausal women who underwent surgical treatment for deep endometriosis infiltrating the rectum with involvement of the rectum and sigmoid, reaching the level of the muscle layer, submucosa or mucosa. Twenty-four rectum and sigmoid fragments with histologically confirmed endometriosis, one from each of the 24 selected patients, were used for the study group. For the control group, we used a fragment of the distal resection margin called anastomosis ring from each of the 24 patients enrolled in the study. Samples were grouped into Tissue Micro Array (TMA) blocks and subjected to immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), nerve growth factor (NGF), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and P vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), followed by semiquantitative analysis of immunostaining by reading the relative optical density (OD).There was higher optical density relative to TNF-α immunostaining and NGF in the study group (samples with intestinal endometriosis), DO=0.01, for the two proteins, respectively (p<0.05), compared to controls without endometriosis. There was no statistically significant difference in the optical density of immunostaining of NPY and VIP.We identified increased immunostaining of TNF-α antibodies and fragments of NGF in the rectum and sigmoid compromised by endometriosis compared to disease-free controls. We did not identify any statistical difference in immunostaining of NPY and VIP proteins.
