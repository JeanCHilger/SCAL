A comparison of the usefulness of serum measurements of CA 125, CA 50 and TATI in patients with malignant and benign gynecological pathology. CA 125, CA 50 and Tumor Associated Trypsin Inhibitor (TATI) levels were assayed in blood samples drawn at diagnosis from 149 patients with malignant or benign gynecological pathology. CA 125 serum levels greater than 35 U/ml and 65 U/ml were respectively found in 34/38 (89.5%) and in 33/38 (86.8%) patients with ovarian carcinoma, in 17/61 (27.9%) and in 6/61 (9.8%) with benign ovarian pathology, in 6/30 (20.0%) and in 1/30 (3.3%) with cervical carcinoma, in 6/20 (30.0%) and in 6/20 (30.0%) with endometrial carcinoma. TATI serum levels greater than 22 ng/ml were observed in 17/38 (44.7%) patients with ovarian carcinoma, in 3/61 (4.9%) with benign ovarian pathology, in 1/30 (3.3%) with cervical carcinoma and in 3/20 (15.0%) with endometrial carcinoma. CA 50 serum levels greater than 20 U/ml were found in 11/38 (28.9%) patients with ovarian carcinoma, in 19/61 (31.1%) with benign ovarian pathology, in 7/30 (23.3%) with cervical carcinoma and in 6/20 (30%) with endometrial carcinoma. This study confirmed that CA 125 is the most reliable marker for ovarian carcinoma however TATI could have a role in the diagnostic evaluation of adnexal masses, because of its very good specificity, CA 125 and CA 50, but not TATI, could be of some benefit in the management of endometrial and cervical carcinoma.
