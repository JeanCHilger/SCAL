HOXA-11 mediated dysregulation of matrix remodeling during implantation window in women with endometriosis. To investigate the Homeobox genes HOXA-10 and HOXA-11 mediated endometrial molecular defects during implantation window in endometriosis-associated infertility cases.Endometrial biopsies were obtained during implantation window from 31 infertile women with endometriosis (age < 35 years) and 26 age and BMI-matched infertile women without endometriosis were included in the study for comparison purposes. Endometrial expression of HOXA-10 and HOXA-11 genes, MMP-2, -9, α(v)β(3) integrin, leukemia inhibitory factor and surface characteristics including average roughness and topology were assessed.A significantly lower expression of HOXA-10 and HOXA-11 were observed in endometriotic women compared to non-endometriotic controls. Further, a significantly higher endometrial expression of MMP-2 and -9 were observed in women with endometriosis when compared with controls. Interestingly, endometrial surface were observed to be grossly affected in terms of average roughness and topology in women with endometriosis compared to controls.The findings suggest that aberrant expression of HOXA-10 and -11 genes adversely affects endometrial remodelling and expression of receptivity markers.
