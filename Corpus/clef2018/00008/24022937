Research advances on the role of mast cells in pelvic pain of endometriosis. Endometriosis (EMs) is a common gynecologic disease that affects women's physical and mental health seriously. The pathogenesis is still unknown and the mechanism of endometriosis-associated pain remains unclear. Mast cells (MC) are known to be multifunctional players in the immune system. Recent studies have shown that nerve fibers in EMs lesions can release neural peptides such as nerve growth factor and substance P to induce MC degranulating and releasing histamine, proteases, cytokines, chemokines etc., which contributes to the development of pain and hyperalgesia in patients with endometriosis.
