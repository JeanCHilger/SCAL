Clinical case of the month. Rare case of ureteral endometriosis nine years after hysterectomy. Ureteral endometriosis is a rare entity, especially when it occurs in the postmenopausal period. In certain circumstances, this severe disease can cause obstruction, leading to ureterohydronephrosis and, finally, to a progressive and often silent loss of renal function. The symptomatology is variable and non specific, making preoperative diagnosis difficult. The treatment is mainly surgical. Its aim is the relief of obstruction to preserve the renal function. We report the case of a 39 year old patient, hysterectomised for endometriosis nine years earlier, who developed a recurrence demonstrated by ureteral endometriosis and revealed by ureterohydronephrosis. Robot-assisted laparoscopic ureterolysis allowed a complete resection of the lesion and resolved the obstruction. No recurrence of ureterohydronephrosis was found at the fifth and ninth postoperative month ultrasonographic controls.
