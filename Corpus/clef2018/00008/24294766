Endoscopic diagnostics of colorectal endometriosis. The purpose of the study is to explore and systematize the endoscopic features of colorectal endometriosis and to evaluate the role of colonoscopy in its diagnosis.Were analyzed 320 diagnostic colonoscopies performed during the period from March 2011 till November 2012 in patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of "infiltrative form of external endometriosis".Among all the identified cases of intestinal endometriosis (n = 67) pathological process was localized more often in the upper section of the rectum ampullar - 38 (56.7%), less often were revealed lesions of lower ampullar section of rectum and anal canal in 5 (7.4%). In 6 (8.9%) cases were detected multifocal lesions of the intestine. Authentic signs of colorectal endometriosis were detected in lesions of the mucous membrane. These include: polypoid growths above the endometriosis lesion (15 (22.4%)), endometrioid heterotopias in the colon mucosa (7 (10.4%)), the presence of ulceration of the mucous membrane in the projection of endometriosis (4 (5.9%)) geoidal mucosa (3 (4.5%)). Colorectal endometriosis can be systematized according to the following endoscopic criteria: localization of the pathological focus, growth, the presence of mucosal lesions.
