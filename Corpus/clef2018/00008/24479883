Micro-RNAs and ovarian cancer: the state of art and perspectives of clinical research. Dysregulation of microRNA (mi-RNA) expression plays a major role in the development and progression of most human malignancies. Members of the miR-200 family, miR-182, miR-214 and miR-221 are frequently up-regulated, whereas miR-100, let-7i, miR-199a, miR-125b, mir-145 and miR-335 are often down-regulated in ovarian cancer compared with normal ovarian tissue. Most mi-RNA signatures are overlapping in different tumor histotypes but some mi-RNAs seem to be histotype specific. For instance, the endometrioid type shares with the serous and clear cell types the up-regulation of miR-200 family members, but also presents over-expression of miR-21, miR-202 and miR-205. Clear cell carcinoma has a significantly higher expression of miR-30a and miR-30a*, whereas mucinous histotype has elevated levels of miR-192/194. In vitro and in vivo investigations have shown that several mi-RNAs can modulate the sensitivity of ovarian cancer to platinum and taxane, and clinical studies have suggested that mi-RNA profiling may predict the outcome of patients with this malignancy. Some mi-RNAs could be used as biomarkers to identify patients that might benefit from the addition of molecularly targeted agents (i.e. anti-angiogenic agents, MET inhibitors and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors) to standard chemotherapy. Moreover, mi-RNAs could represent potential targets for the development of novel therapies.
