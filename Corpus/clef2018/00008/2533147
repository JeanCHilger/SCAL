Zoladex versus danazol in the treatment of pelvic endometriosis: effects on plasma lipid risk factors. Plasma lipid risk markers for coronary heart disease (CHD) are influenced by sex steroid concentrations. Therapies that alter sex hormone levels have the potential to affect CHD risk. Zoladex had no effect on plasma lipids, but increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) subfraction 3, a lipoprotein of uncertain clinical significance. Danazol increased low density lipoprotein and decreased HDL concentrations to give a lipid profile associated with increased risk of CHD.
