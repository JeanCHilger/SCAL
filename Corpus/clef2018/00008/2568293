An immunohistochemical study of neuroendocrine cells in gynecologic tumors. Various gynecologic tumors with argyrophilia were studied immunohistochemically for chromogranin using two antibodies, antichromogranin and antineuroendocrine. Of seven small cell carcinomas of the cervix, four were immunoreactive with antichromogranin and seven with antineuroendocrine. Argyrophil cells of six cervical adenocarcinomas were all immunoractive with both antibodies. Type I argyrophil cells of 20 endometrial carcinomas were likewise stained positively. However, of the 30 endometrial carcinomas with type II argyrophil cells, 19 showed positive immunoreactivity for chromogranin and 22 for neuroendocrine. Of the ovarian tumors tested, argyrophil cells of 11 mucinous tumors, three carcinoid tumors, and the pancreatic tissue of a malignant mixed germ cell tumor were all chromogranin- and neuroendocrine-immunoreactive. Type I argyrophil cells of five endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary were also immunoreactive with both antibodies. Of the 13 endometrioid carcinomas with type II argyrophil cells, only four showed positive immunoreactivity for chromogranin and only five for neuroendocrine. In conclusion, both antichromogranin and antineuroendocrine detect the specific neuroendocrine markers in close association with argyrophilia in gynecologic tumors, the latter being more sensitive for small cell carcinoma of the cervix, and for type II argyrophil cells in adenocarcinoma of the endometrium and endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary.
