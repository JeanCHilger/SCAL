Immunologic aspects of endometriosis. The paper presents modern views on immunological conditioning of endometriosis. It seems that lowered cellular response, intensified humoral response and increased activation of peritoneal macrophages play an important role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Immunological research may lead to pharmacological causal treatment of endometriosis considering abnormal function of the immunological system. The paper also discusses the importance of the first biochemical marker of endometriosis--antigen CA-125--in the diagnostics and monitoring the disease.
