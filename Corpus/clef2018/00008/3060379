Danazol but not gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists suppresses autoantibodies in endometriosis. The effect of treatment with danazol (n = 10) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a) (n = 10) on autoantibody (AA) production (IgG, IgM and, IgA to 6 phospholipids, 5 histones, and 4 polynucleotides) in endometriosis was evaluated blindly in a longitudinal, prospective, randomized study. Clinical improvement, ovarian suppression, and resolution of endometriosis were comparable in both groups. Approximately 50% of patients had significant AA abnormalities initially. During treatment with danazol but not GnRH-a, AA gradually decreased in concentration and in number/patient. Total immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgM, and IgA) also decreased only in the danazol group. This study indicates that danazol, but not GnRH-a, lowers abnormal AA associated with endometriosis.
