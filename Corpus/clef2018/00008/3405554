The prognostic importance of steroid receptors in endometrial carcinoma. Three hundred forty-nine cases of primary endometrial carcinoma (endometrioid, adenosquamous, and clear-cell) were studied to investigate the relative prognostic importance of age, menopausal status, stage, histology, myometrial invasion, and estrogen and progesterone receptor content. Excluding menopausal status, all of these variables had a significant relationship to overall survival in a univariate analysis. Using a Cox multivariate regression analysis, stage, age, and an estrogen receptor value of more than 70 fmol/mg protein, combined with a progesterone receptor value of more than 30 fmol/mg protein, were independently associated with survival. The results demonstrate that for maximum prognostic information, both estrogen and progesterone content of tumors should be measured. Maximum prognostic information is obtained by using cutoff levels that are much higher than those traditionally accepted. This has particular relevance for patient stratification in clinical trials investigating receptor information and response to adjuvant or therapeutic treatment.
