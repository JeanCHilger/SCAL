Tumor markers in gynecologic diseases. The tumor markers CA 125, CEA, and CA 153 were measured in the serum of patients with malignant and benign gynecologic diseases. In 90% of 76 serous and endometrioid ovarian carcinomas CA 125 values were elevated (greater than 35 U/ml). In cases with primary tumors the concentrations usually exceeded 500 U/ml. CA 125 levels were also elevated in over 80% of the cases of non-epithelial ovarian malignomas and ovarian metastases. There was also in increase in markers in carcinomas not involving the ovary, as well as in benign ovarian tumors and endometrioses. Observations of the course in cases of ovarian carcinoma showed that this marker was a sensitive indicator of the clinical condition. CA 153 was found to be over the limit of 25 U/ml in 40% of 68 patients with breast cancer. The proportion of elevated values was considerably lower (28%) than in the recurrences (72%). In 72% of the cases CA 153 and CEA were correspondingly elevated or normal, while in 16% only CA 153 was elevated. The results indicate the importance of the markers, above all in aftercare of tumor cases.
