Sonographic evaluation of the adnexa during early pregnancy. Of 3,918 obstetric patients who underwent scanning during the first 20 weeks of gestation, 94 had sonolucent adnexal masses identified. These represented predominantly the corpus luteum of pregnancy. The incidence of such a mass significantly declined after the tenth gestational week. This pattern of degeneration is physiologic and represents the normal course of events for the ovary in the first half of pregnancy. Characteristics of these masses and indications for operative intervention are discussed. The obstetric outcome for eight patients who underwent surgical treatment was uncomplicated. Guidelines for management of significant adnexal masses in pregnancy is similar to that of the nonpregnant state.
