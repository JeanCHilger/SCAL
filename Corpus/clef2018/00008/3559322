Immunohistochemical localization of estradiol in malignant epithelial tumors of the ovary. Granulosa cell tumors derived from sexcord-stromal cells are thought to be generally estrogen producing neoplasms. However recent reports show that these common epithelial tumors, adenocarcinomas and Brenner tumors, are capable of estrogen activity. We have studied the production of estrogen in common epithelial malignant tumors of the ovary. Two cases of serous cystadeno-carcinomas, five cases of mucinous cystadeno-carcinomas and two cases of endometrioid carcinomas were examined for the presence of estradiol using an indirect immunoperoxidase method. The results were as follows: In all tumors, one case of serous cystadeno-carcinoma, four cases of mucinous cystadeno-carcinomas and one case of endometrioid carcinoma had a positive immunoperoxidase reaction. The incidence of positive reaction showed that mucinous cystadeno-carcinomas were more numerous than others. In positive cases, estradiol localization was recognized in the epithelial cell of mucinous tumors to various degrees, but there was no estradiol localization in admixed goblet like cells. In serous tumors and endometrioid carcinomas also estradiol localization was seen in the cytoplasm. Stromal cells tended to be more weakly positive than epithelial cells. No estradiol localization was detected in any of the spindle cells or fibrinous connective tissues. These results suggest that some common epithelial malignant tumors of the ovary have estrogen activity and estradiol is produced not only in stromal cells but also in epithelial cells.
