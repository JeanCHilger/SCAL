Endometrial estradiol and progesterone receptors in patients with luteal phase defects and endometriosis. Endometrial cytosol estrogen receptors (ERs) and progesterone receptors (PgRs) were quantitated in postovulatory endometrial biopsy samples of patients with luteal phase defect (LPD), those with endometriosis, and normal control subjects. Serum levels of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P), obtained on the day of the biopsy, were also measured. No significant differences among endometrial ER, PgR, serum E2, and P levels were detected between the patients with endometriosis and normal control subjects. Although ER concentrations in the luteal defect group did not differ from those of control subjects, the PgR levels in day 20 to 23 endometrium were significantly higher. Mean serum E2 and P levels in the group with luteal insufficiency were significantly lower than those of the control subjects. Our data suggest that in patients with LPD the increase in PgR levels during the midluteal days is compatible with a relative deficiency of P secretion by the corpus luteum.
