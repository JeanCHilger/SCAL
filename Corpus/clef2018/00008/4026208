Ureteral endometriosis. Apropos of a bilateral form. A case of bilateral ureteral endometriosis is reported. The patient presented, on one side, with endometriosis externa, associated with slight renal injury, and, on the other, with adenomyosis leading to uretero-ureteral invagination, and an associated severe renal impairment. A review of the reported cases and pathogenic theories is followed by a discussion of the diagnostic and therapeutic problems raised by ureteral endometriosis. The difficulty of establishing a correct diagnosis and the risk of damage to renal function often lead to surgical removal of the ureteral lesion.
