Laparoscopy: advances and advantages. The first 135 laparoscopic cases at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in San Francisco are described.  Laproscopy was usually performed for evaluative purposes.  The techniques involved are presented in detail.  The indications for laparoscopy were infertility (75), pelvic mass (22), pelvic pain(20), tubal sterilization (14), second look at treated ovarian carcinoma (2), and determination of etiology of ascites (2).  No major complications occurred.  74 of the 75 infertility patients were discharged within 1 day of the procedure.  In 21 infertility patients thought to have no pathologic intrapelvic involvement, laparoscopy showed substantial pelvic disease in 11(52%), endometriosis in 6 (29%), and multiple pelvic adhesions in 5 (23%).  Improved visualization of the fallopian tube is a major advantage of laparoscopic investigation.
