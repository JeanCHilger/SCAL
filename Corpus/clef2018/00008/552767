Nodular salpingitis and tubal endometriosis. II. Diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Nodular salpingitis and tubal endometriosis are dystrophic disorders (salpingioses) the clinical importance of which is mainly due to their interference with female fertility. We have studied 42 cases of women operated for tubal sterility, viz. 23 cases of nodular salpingitis (NS), 17 of endometriosis (EM) and two cases in which both lesions were present. Pre-operative x-ray and celioscopic exploration was performed in order to assess the severity of the lesions and the outlook after tubal plastic surgery. X-ray examination reveals the diverticular nature of these lesions. Both diseases may be localized in any of the tubal segments. The postoperative prognosis depends on early surgery, site of the lesion and its nature.
