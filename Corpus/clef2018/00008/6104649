Danazol: endocrine and endometrial effects. The mechanisms of action of danazol are unknown and the alteration of normal human endocrine values during danazol therapy is controversial. Twenty patients were given 200-800 mg of danazol daily. Control and treatment blood serum samples were obtained with serial endometrial biopsies and basal body temperatures. LH-FSH basal levels, prolactin, TSH, TBG, thyroxine, cortisol, and androstenedione were not changed by either dosage or duration of danazol therapy. Estrone and estradiol serum levels were modestly decreased and were not dose-dependent. There were significant dose related increases in serum testosterone and DHEA-S. Endometrial atrophy occurred at all dose levels.
