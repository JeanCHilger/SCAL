Sarcoma of the uterine body. This work is a retrospective study of the sarcomas of the uterus which were treated at the Oscar Lambret centre in the last ten years. The difficulty in diagnosing sarcomas of the uterus by the histologist can be appreciated when it is realised that classification of uterine sarcoma is complex. It is not possible to give any statistical interpretation of what is found because of the relative rarity of the cases (about 3% of all cancers of the body of the uterus). The clinical, radiological and histological aspects have been studied. Prognosis is very bad. This means that the type of pathological anatomy that has been found determines the treatment.
