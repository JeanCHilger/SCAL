Antigonadotropin (danazol) in the treatment of endometriosis. Evaluation of posttreatment fertility and three-year follow-up data. Ninety-nine women who completed danazol treatment for endometriosis proved by operation were re-evaluated clinically an average of 37 months later. The recurrence of symptoms was reported by 39 per cent and pelvic findings suggestive of endometriosis were noted in 33 per cent. An average time interval between the end of treatment and the recurrence was 15 months for the entire group. However, 31 women who conceived subsequent to treatment had a much lower recurrence rate of the disease (15 per cent) and a much longer average time until the recurrence (31 months). Of 84 infertile women who desired pregnancy after treatment, 39 conceived, for a pregnancy rate of 46.4 per cent. However, when patients with absolute sterility due to other causes were excluded, the corrected pregnancy rate was 72.2 per cent. The majority of conceptions (23) occurred within the first six months after discontinuation of danazol and a total of 30 occurred within the first year. Four second- and third-trimester intrauterine fetal deaths were observed among women who conceived within the first three cycles after discontinuation of the drug.
