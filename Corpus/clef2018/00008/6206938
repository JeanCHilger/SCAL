Argyrophil cells in the endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary. Of 42 endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary examined with Grimelius staining, 19 tumors were found to have argyrophil cells. Argyrophil cells were subgrouped into two types according to the distribution of the argyrophil granules. Type I cells contained argyrophil granules in the basal part of the cytoplasm, and were found in four tumors. Type II cells contained argyrophil granules mainly in the apical portion or throughout the whole cytoplasm, and were found in 14 tumors. Both type I and II cells were found in different areas of one tumor. In type II cells, the distribution of argyrophil granules was similar to that of mucins, and the apical argyrophilia was diminished in varying degrees in some tumors after diastase digestion. The distribution of argyrophil granules paralleled that of secretory granules identified by electron microscopy in the representative tumors of each type. In the immunohistochemical study, somatostatin was found in a tumor with both types of argyrophil cells. Somatostatin-containing cells generally corresponded to type I cells, but were less numerous than argyrophil cells.
