Müllerian adenosarcoma of the uterus: a report of 5 cases. The clinicopathologic features of 4 cases of Müllerian adenosarcoma of the uterine body and 1 of the cervix are reported. They showed the characteristic pattern of benign epithelial growth within sarcomatous stroma. In the cervical tumor, malignant heterologous stromal cells were also present. All the patients are alive and well, confirming the good prognosis of this neoplasm. The authors think that the presence of a malignant heterologous component probably does not imply a worse prognosis.
