Pregnancy rate after diagnostic curettage in the evaluation of infertility. The Authors present a series of 200 infertile women, who underwent a diagnostic curettage as part of the evaluation of infertility. 18.6 per cent of the patients became pregnant after this procedure after correction for other causes of infertility. Most of the pregnancies were achieved within four cycles after the curettage. From this study, it seems that the removal of a pathological endometrium is not followed by pregnancy. To utilize the therapeutic potential of a diagnostic curettage in infertile women, it is suggested that regularly menstruating women with no history or clinical findings suggestive of tubal disease or endometriosis and without pathological lesions of the endometrium, should wait at least four cycles before the next invasive procedure (HSG or laparoscopy) is performed.
