Non-specificity of symptoms related to adenomyosis. A prospective comparative survey. A total of 212 patients coming for removal of the uterus due to a benign condition were interviewed by the first author before operation. Of these patients 28 had adenomyosis, while 157 had neither adenomyosis nor external endometriosis these two groups were compared with respect to duration of menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, urinary symptoms and sacral and lower abdominal pain. There were no inter-group differences in the frequencies of these symptoms. It is concluded that although patients with adenomyosis have many symptoms, none specific to adenomyosis can be found.
