Danazol: endocrine pharmacology and therapeutic applications. The options for the medical management of endometriosis have been expanded by the introduction of the synthetic steroid, danazol. The results of large clinical studies suggest that danazol treatment produces significant improvement in the symptoms, signs, and laparoscopic findings of endometriosis. The original studies of the pharmacology of danazol concluded that danazol was a strong antigonadotrophin with mild androgenic effects and no other hormonal properties. Recent studies which emphasize the molecular pharmacology of danazol suggest that this steroid has direct effects on hypothalamic-pituitary function, multiple classes of steroid receptors, gonadal steroidogenesis, and endogenous steroid metabolism. These studies demonstrate that: (1) danazol prevents the midcycle surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (2) danazol does not significantly suppress basal LH or FSH in gonadally intact human beings
