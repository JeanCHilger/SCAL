Biological markers and ovarian carcinomas: galactosyltransferase, CA 125, isoenzymes of amylase and alkaline phosphatase. We present a comparative study of several biological markers (galactosyltransferase, CA 125, isoenzymes of amylase and alkaline phosphatase) with a view to ovarian carcinoma follow-up. Serum samples were obtained from a population of 75 patients under clinical observation. After a minimum 18-months period, we assessed the prognostic value of the markers. No marker permits the detection of discrete, evolving carcinomas. CA 125 is the marker that gives the best results, particularly in terms of sensitivity. Galactosyltransferase has a lower sensitivity except in the case of endometrioid carcinomas. Simultaneous analysis with CA 125 and galactosyltransferase results in no decisive improvement, other than greater precision in unfavourable prognoses. Isoenzymes of amylase and alkaline phosphatase are of no interest in the follow-up of such carcinomas.
