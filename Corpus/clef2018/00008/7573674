Malignant mesonephric neoplasms of the uterine cervix. A report of eight cases, including four with a malignant spindle cell component. Eight mesonephric adenocarcinomas of the uterine cervix, four of which had a malignant spindle-cell component, occurred in women aged 34 to 71 (median 43, mean 54.5) years, bringing to 14 the number of cervical mesonephric carcinomas in the literature. The tumors with a malignant spindle-cell component ("malignant mesonephric mixed tumors") are, with one possible exception, the first reported examples at this site. The patients, almost all of whom presented with vaginal bleeding, underwent hysterectomy five also had a pelvic lymph node dissection. The tumors were all stage IB, although microscopic lymph node metastases were found in two cases. Gross examination revealed an invasive cervical mass in each case. On microscopic examination, seven tumors were adjacent to mesonephric hyperplasia, which in five cases was florid and focally atypical
