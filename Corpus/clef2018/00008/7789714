Vaginal hemorrhage after hysterectomy. We report on two cases of vaginal bleeding after hysterectomy. These patients suffered from cyclical therapy resistant vaginal bleeding and complaint in the lower abdomen. The final diagnosis and therapy of a vaginal cuff endometriosis made it possible to eliminate the persistent clinical symptoms. These cases show the need for a discussion on the necessity of a special operative procedure in case of endometriosis genitalis interna and externa.
