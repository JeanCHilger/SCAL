Abdominal pain in women attending a genitourinary medicine clinic: who has PID? Eighty-one women who presented to a genitourinary medicine clinic with mild to moderate acute or chronic abdominal pain were studied in order to compare the clinical features of those who had pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and those who did not. The diagnosis was made by laparoscopy, and PID was detected in 14%, adhesions in 11% and endometriosis in 16%. Women with PID were clinically indistinguishable from women with other diagnoses or no obvious cause.
