Correlation of serum, urinary and salivary CA 125 levels in patients with adnexal masses. A prospective study was made of 105 consecutive patients admitted to one department of obstetrics and gynaecology for surgery for adnexal masses. The objective was to investigate if CA 125 level is measurable in the urine or saliva and to correlate these measurements with serum CA 125 level in patients presenting with adnexal masses. The final diagnosis and grouping of patients for analysis were based on histopathological examination of the adnexal masses. Serum, urine and salivary samples were collected simultaneously from all patients on the morning before surgery. CA 125 levels in each sample were determined in duplicate using Abbott CA 125-E1A monoclonal test kits (Abbott Laboratories, USA). The mean inter-assay variability was 10%. CA 125 was detectable in the serum, urine and saliva from all the patients and the concentration was highest in the saliva and lowest in urine. There were no discernible differences in the distributions of salivary CA 125 concentrations between patients with ovarian malignancies and those with benign ovarian cysts. In contrast, both serum and urinary CA 125 levels were significantly higher in the ovarian cancer group. There was no correlation in CA 125 concentrations between serum and urine, or between serum and saliva. For detection of ovarian malignancies, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for serum CA 125 measurement (> or = 35 U/mL) were 88.9%, 79.2%, 27.6% and 98.7 respectively. The corresponding figures for urinary CA 125 measurement (> or = 10 U/mL) were 88.9%, 66.7%, 19.5% and 98.4% respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
