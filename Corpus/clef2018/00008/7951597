The role of GnRH agonists in the endoscopic treatment of endometriosis and fibromyomas. Uterine myomas and endometriosis are benign pathologies frequently encountered in women. Myomas are often associated with infertility and/or menorrhagia particularly if they are sub-mucosal. Endometriosis is diagnosed in more than 35% of infertile patients. These two common pathologies are oestrogen-dependent and the administration of a GnRH agonist has been proposed as a non-surgical approach to the treatment of myomas and endometriosis. GnRH agonists cannot, however, be considered as definitive medical therapy because most myomas and endometriotic cysts return to their initial size within 4 months following the cessation of treatment. Moreover, because of the menopausal-like state that they induce, GnRH agonists provoke bone demineralization and for this reason, their long-term use is not recommended. These agents should, therefore, be considered as an adjuvant preoperative therapy. The aim is, above all, to achieve a preoperative reduction of tumour size, thus facilitating the endoscopic surgery: either hysteroscopic resection in the case of sub-mucosal myomas, or vaporization of ovarian cysts in the case of cystic endometriotic lesions.
