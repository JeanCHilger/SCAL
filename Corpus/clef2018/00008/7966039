CA-125 in peritoneal fluid from patients with nonmalignant gynecologic disorders. To assess the diagnostic value of measuring CA-125 levels in peritoneal fluid from women with nonmalignant gynecologic disorders, we determined CA-125 levels in peritoneal fluid and in serum collected simultaneously from 46 women undergoing gynecologic surgery. Patients with benign ovarian disease, non-ovarian gynecologic pathology and severe endometriosis had, on average, higher CA-125 levels in peritoneal fluid than did patients with a normal pelvis and those with mild endometriosis. There was no obvious correlation between peritoneal fluid and serum levels of CA-125. Our data show that (1) measurement of serum CA-125 levels is not useful for distinguishing between different benign gynecologic disorders, and (2) levels of CA-125 in peritoneal fluid in benign gynecologic disorders are comparable to the reported lower range of levels observed in women with intraperitoneal malignancies.
