Management of endometriosis in the infertile patient. Infertility has a 30-40% incidence in women with endometriosis.  However, conservative surgical procedures can result in pregnancy for 40-90% of these patients.  The pregnancy rate is influenced by 5 factors:  1) extent of the disease, 2) age, 3) history of previous surgery for endometriosis, 4) duration of infertility before surgery, and 5) length of postsurgical follow-up.  The factor responsible for infertility among women with endometriosis is believed to be an inadequacy of the tubo-ovarian motility secondary to fibrosis and scarring, which results in imperfect ovum acceptance by the fimbriae.  Therapy encompasses 4 approaches:  1) prophylaxis, 2) observation and analgesia, 3) suppression of ovulation, and 4) surgical treatment.  Pregnancy is suggested as the optimal prophylactic treatment for endometriosis since the symptoms and signs regress during gestation and for varying periods thereafter.  This regression is probably due to a combination of anovulation and amenorrhea caused by adenohypophyseal suppression.  It may also be due to a transformation of functioning endometriotic tissue into decidua by increasing levels of chorionic estrogen and progesterone.  If pregnancy is not desired, anovulation can be secured by the administration of sex hormones.  Pseudopregnancy for 6 months, induced by norgestrel plus ethinyl estradiol or norethynodrel plus mestranol, can lead to pregnancy in 50% of patients whose only abnormality is surface ovarian endometriosis within 1 year of cessation of therapy.  Short periods of pseudopregnancy are also advocated after conservative surgery if all areas of endometriosis cannot be excised.  40-50% of these patients can expect to become pregnant within 24 months.  The incidence of postoperative tubo-ovarian adhesions may be diminished by use of dexamethasone and promethazine.
