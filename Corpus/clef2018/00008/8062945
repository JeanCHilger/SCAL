The actions of estradiol and epidermal growth factor in endometrial and endometriotic stroma in vitro. To compare the effects of E2 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on DNA and protein synthesis in endometrial and endometriotic stromal cell culture.Measurement of DNA and protein synthesis in cell cultures by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of radioactively labeled macromolecules.Tissue samples collected in operating theaters were processed in the cell culture laboratory.Samples of endometrium and endometriosis were collected synchronously at laparotomy.Stromal cells were isolated from tissue samples. Cultures of endometrial and endometriotic stromal cells were treated with 0.272 ng/mL (1 nmol/L) E2 or 10 ng/mL (1.6 nmol/L) EGF.3H-Thymidine and 3H-leucine incorporation were used to assess DNA and protein synthesis respectively in cell cultures.There was no response to 0.272 ng/mL (1 nmol/L) E2 with respect to DNA or protein synthesis in either endometrial or endometriotic stromal cells, whereas 10 ng/mL (1.6 nmol/L) EGF significantly stimulated DNA and protein synthesis in both cell types. The effect of EGF was significantly greater in endometrial stroma than in endometriotic stroma.There are differences in the stimulation of 3H-thymidine incorporation by 10 ng/mL (1.6 nmol/L) EGF in endometrial and endometriotic stromal cells in vitro.
