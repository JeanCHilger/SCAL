Scanning electron microscopic and immunohistochemical studies of pelvic endometriosis. The pathogenesis of pelvic endometriosis has been studied by using scanning electron and light microscopy, observing the surface structure of bluish lesions obtained from 26 patients during laparotomy. Paraffin sections included another 17 tissue samples of endometriosis, based on immunohistochemical responses to epithelial membrane antigen, keratin and vimentin. Ultrastructurally, the surface epithelial cells could not be detected in 13 out of 17 pelvic peritoneal endometriosis samples. In one case in which the surface peritoneal cells were seen histologically to dip into the subperitoneal stroma, many surface peritoneal infoldings were observed, and ciliated cells were detected at the edge of these infoldings. Ovarian endometriosis was composed of three types of cells, none of which had any cilia. These findings were observed in continuity with adjacent normal mesothelial cells. No characteristic structure of the endometrial surface was observed for the bluish lesion, but the gland surface of endometriosis located in the subperitoneal stroma initially had ciliated cells. The immunoreactions in both the columnar mesothelial cells with surface peritoneal infoldings and the glands of endometriotic tissues were similar to those of normal endometrial glands, but different from those of normal mesothelial cells. Pelvic endometriosis might originate by a process of metaplasia from the pelvic peritoneum.
