Value of phase-shift gradient-echo MR imaging in the differentiation of pelvic lesions with high signal intensity at T1-weighted imaging. To assess the value of phase-shift gradient-echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with the fast low-angle shot (FLASH) technique in the differentiation of hemorrhagic tumors and teratomas.T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo imaging and phase-shift MR imaging were performed in 60 patients. On T1-weighted images, the signal intensity of lesions was compared with that of intraperitoneal fat. Findings at MR imaging were compared with the surgical findings. The diagnostic performance of each pulse sequence was analyzed with receiver operating characteristic curves.Sixty high-signal-intensity lesions were identified in 45 patients at T1-weighted imaging. Hemorrhagic lesions and teratomas had similar signal intensities on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Lesions were detected more decisively with FLASH imaging than with T1- and T2-weighted imaging.Phase-shift gradient-echo imaging is a readily available method for the differential diagnosis of lesions with high signal intensity at T1-weighted MR imaging.
