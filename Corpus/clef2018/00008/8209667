The role of humoral immunity in endometriosis. In many ways endometriosis represents yet another form of unexplained infertility. The disease is clearly associated with a decrease in fecundity and while in advanced stages of the condition this infertility can be attributed to tubal factors, in mild stages of the disease the cause for the decrease in fertility is unknown. As in unexplained infertility, we have suggested that the impairment in fertility is due to autoantibody abnormalities. Endometriosis patients exhibit the same immunologic profile as previously described in women with unexplained infertility and repeated pregnancy loss. In fact, endometriosis is not only characterized by unexplained infertility but also by repeated and excessive pregnancy wastage. Its clinical presentation mimics that of an autoimmune disease, raising the question whether endometriosis is, in fact, an autoimmune disease. Endometriosis demonstrates immunologic abnormalities not only in respect to autoreactivity. Abnormalities in immune function have been widely reported in reference to almost any lymphocyte and macrophage function and, once again, the similarity to findings in patients with unexplained infertility is blatant. Abnormalities can be found in peripheral blood and especially prominently in peritoneal fluid. Treatment of immunologic abnormalities, and especially of autoantibody abnormalities, restores a level of fertility in endometriosis patients. It has also been demonstrated, in an animal model, that non-specific immune modulation may improve fertility.
