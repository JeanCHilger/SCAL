Immunohistochemical analysis of p53 protein over-expression in endometrial carcinomas: inverse correlation with sex steroid receptor status. Mutations of the tumour suppressor p53 gene have been reported in a variety of human malignant tumours, and are frequently associated with over-expression of p53 protein. To examine the significance of p53 gene alteration in endometrial carcinomas, we studied the immunohistochemical reactivity with a monoclonal antibody against p53 (PAb 1801) in 30 endometrial carcinomas as well as in 64 normal endometria. The presence or absence of correlation of p53 over-expression with the clinicopathological features and with the immunohistochemical expression of sex steroid receptors (oestrogen receptors ER, progesterone receptors
