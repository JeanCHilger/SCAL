Contraception and endometriosis. Contraception in women with endometriosis is unusual. In case of mild asymptomatic endometriosis all contraceptive methods may be used except predominant estrogenic action pills. In case of severe endometriosis if score is upon 70 or adhesion score upon 50 the patients are generally infertile. Contraception is not necessary. If scores are lower, medical treatment of endometriosis insure the contraception during the first six months. Afterwards an hydroxyprogesterone derivative pill such as cyproterone acetate, or a norpregnan derivative pill, or a combined estrogen progestogen pill, with predominant progestogen action (norgestrienon), or a monophasic pill containing norethisteron, or in case of metabolic diseases a pill containing gestoden, must be prescribed three out of four weeks. In case of adenomyosis, vaginal contraception is better. Perhaps in the next future, the new progestogen sterilant will be the best.
