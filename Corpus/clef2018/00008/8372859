Myometrial biopsy in the diagnosis of adenomyosis uteri. Automatic cutting needle sampling was used for diagnosis of adenomyosis uteri. The purpose of this study was the establishment of myometrial biopsy as a clinically applicable method.Sensitivity and specificity of myometrial biopsy in diagnosis of uterine adenomyosis was estimated by examining 680 biopsy specimens from 68 surgically removed uteri. In 34 patients with clinical symptoms of adenomyosis uteri 70 myometrial biopsies were performed during laparoscopy, and vaginal ultrasonographically guided myometrial biopsy was performed in six patients (14 specimens) without complications. Prevention of myometrial bleeding was achieved by prophylactic injection of ornipressin into the biopsy cannula.The sensitivity of a single myometrial sample for diagnosing adenomyosis uteri ranged from 8% to 18.7% specificity was 100%.Our results may encourage further investigation on the clinical use of myometrial biopsy.
