Inflammatory reaction in endometriotic tissue: an immunohistochemical study. A panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for macrophage subtypes appearing in early (27E10), down-regulatory (RM3/1) and late (25F9) stages of inflammation had been applied to 20 endometriotic implants of 14 women. Of those patients 9 were in the follicular phase of the cycle, two on danazol, one on LHRH-analogue (buserelin) and another two on oral contraceptives. Beside the macrophage subsets, antibodies against T4, T8 lymphocytes as well as proliferating cells (EN7/44 and Ki67) were examined. In all specimens immunologically competent cells could be detected to a varying degree and within the same implant different stages of inflammation were discernible. Endometriosis presented with signs of early inflammation indicated by 27E10+ macrophages and CD4+ lymphocytes (15 specimens) and with down-regulatory, late inflammatory reactions as shown by RM3/1+, 25F9+ macrophages and CD8+ lymphocytes (19 biopsies). Additionally, in 14 specimens cells of the EN7/44+ and Ki67+ type was detected. These preliminary results showed no significant correlation to either extension of endometriotic implants or adhesions or concomitant therapy and clearly indicate, that there is an immunological dynamic process within the lesion itself in addition to that one of the peritoneal fluid.
