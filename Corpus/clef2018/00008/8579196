Antihormones and laparoscopy in the combined treatment of disseminated forms of genital endometriosis externa. A total of 100 patients with disseminated forms of external genital endometriosis were administered multiple-modality treatment including surgery and antihormone therapy. Twenty patients with the same diagnosis were controls and subjected to surgery alone. The results of treatment assessed on the basis of analysis of the clinical course of the disease, status of the menstrual and generative functions, drug effects on the central nervous system, hormonal status, and target organs (mammary glands and osseous tissue) evidence good potentialities of laparoscopy and high efficacy of subsequent therapy with antihormones in the treatment of patients with grave forms of endometriosis.
