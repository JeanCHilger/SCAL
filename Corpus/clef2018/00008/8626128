p53 overexpression and bcl-2 persistence in endometrial carcinoma: comparison of papillary serous and endometrioid subtypes. Forty-two cases, including 21 uterine papillary serous carcinomas (UPSC) and 21 age-, nuclear-grade-, and clinical-stage-matched uterine endometrioid carcinomas (UEC), were studied immunohistochemically for p53 and bcl-2 in archival paraffin-embedded tissue. Compared to UEC (28.6% positive), UPSC (71.4% positive) had a significantly higher frequency of p53 overexpression (P = 0.005) furthermore, in a clinical-stage-matched fashion, a higher frequency of p53 overexpression was found in early-stage cases (P = 0.032), but not in late-stage cases. In a nuclear-grade-matched comparison, no statistical difference in p53 overexpression was identified between the two subtypes, although UPSC had stronger p53 immunoreactivity than UEC. Of UPSC, no difference in p53 overexpression was detected between tumors of early and late stages
