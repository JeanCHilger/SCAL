Interleukin-6 and soluble interleukin-6 receptor in peritoneal fluid and serum of patients with endometriosis. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble Interleukin-6-receptor (sIL-6R) concentrations were investigated in patients with endometriosis and other benign gynecologic diseases.During laparoscopy or laparotomy peritoneal fluid and serum were collected from 29 patients with endometriosis, 31 patients with benign ovarian masses and 4 patients with chronic inflammation or adhesions. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations were determined by Elisa-technique.Patients with endometriosis stage IV revealed slightly higher IL-6 concentrations in peritoneal fluid when compared to patients with stage I to II disease and ovarian masses/ chronic inflammation. IL-6 serum concentrations were higher in case of stage I and II when compared to stage III and IV and ovarian masses/chronic inflammation. Patients with endometriosis revealed significantly higher sIL-6 receptor concentrations in peritoneal fluid and serum as compared to patients with ovarian cysts and chronic inflammation.IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor may be considered to be involved in endometriosis. However, the patho-physiologic mechanism must be the subject of further investigation.
