Endometrioid adenoma (polypoid endometriosis) of the omentum maius. Endometrioid adenoma (polypoid endometriosis) of the omentum maius in an 89-year old female is reported. The tumor measured 1 cm in diameter and consisted of resting or weakly proliferating, partially macrocystic endometrial glands, encapsulated by delicate fibrous connective tissue. Immunohistochemically, glandular and stromal cells expressed estrogen receptor strongly, progesterone receptor weakly and CA 125 only weakly in a few glands. This is another, but rare example of the capacity of the omentum maius to develop tumors of the MÃ¼llerian variety.
