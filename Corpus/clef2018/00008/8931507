Infertile women with and without endometriosis: a case control study of luteal phase and other infertility conditions. To assess the relationship in infertile women between endometriosis and luteal phase defects and other infertility conditions.University Medical School.Case-control study.One hundred and seventy-four infertile women with endometriosis and 174 infertile women without endometriosis, all of them studied by laparoscopy. The inclusion criteria were failure of six cycles of ovulation stimulation or abnormal preliminary study (abnormal pelvic physical, hysterosalpingographic or ultrasound findings).The frequency of out-of-phase biopsies (16.1% vs 16.7%) as well as other endometrial abnormalities were similar in endometriosis associated infertility (EAI) and in non-endometriosis infertility (NEI). Mean progesterone and prolactin levels, as well as the proportion of abnormal progesterone levels (37.4% vs 44.3%) and of hyperprolactinemia (12.9% vs 13.2%) were similar in EAI and NEI. The frequency of uterine myomas was similar in both groups. Sperm characteristics were not better in EAI than in NEI. Higher endometriosis stages were not associated with a higher frequency of the aforementioned conditions.Luteal phase defects, sperm abnormalities and myomas are no more common in EAI than in NEI or in advanced stages of endometriosis.
