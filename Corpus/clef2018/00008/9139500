Differential diagnosis of cystic adnexa processes. A comparison of the value of sonography, puncture cytology and color and biochemical biopsy analysis with histology. The histological diagnoses of 109 cystic adnexal masses were compared with the results of ultrasound examination, color, cytology and biochemical analyses of cystic fluid. In cases with suspicious results by ultrasound examination most of the malignant tumors but only a small number of benign cystic masses were found. Macroscopic and cytologic examinations gave no further informations. By biochemical analyses functional cysts could be detected with 86% of sensitivity and 100% of specificity by a combination of estradiol, progesterone and Ca 12-5. Endometrioma and malignant tumors could be separated from other adnexal masses (specificity 95%, sensitivity 100%) with a combination of Tag 72-4 and CASA.
