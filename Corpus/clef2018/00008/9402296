The impact of endometriosis in couples undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection because of male infertility. To assess the impact of endometriosis on intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) outcome, we have retrospectively evaluated 980 ICSI cycles, comparing the results of women with and without endometriosis. A total of 101 cycles was identified in which various degrees of endometriosis were involved, and in the remaining 879 cycles, male infertility was the only cause of infertility. Ejaculated spermatozoa were microinjected in all cycles. There was a significant reduction (P = 0.004) in the number of oocytes retrieved from women with endometriosis as compared to those without endometriosis. However, there were no significant differences in either fertilization or pregnancy and implantation rates between women with or without endometriosis. We conclude that the presence of endometriosis in patients undergoing ICSI because of severe male infertility does not affect fertilization, pregnancy and implantation rates, although significantly fewer oocytes are retrieved from patients with endometriosis.
