Immunohistochemical detection of cyclin A with reference to p53 expression in endometrial endometrioid carcinomas. Cyclins are essential proteins in cell cycle control, and their deranged expression has been reported to be associated with malignant transformation. Involvement of cyclins in the development of endometrioid carcinomas of the endometrium was studied immunohistochemically using antibodies against both cyclin A and tumor suppressor gene product p53, and their expression was compared with that of Ki-67 antigen. Sixty-two cases of endometrial endometrioid carcinoma and 20 cases of normal endometrium (10 proliferative and 10 secretory phase) were examined. Of the 62 endometrioid carcinomas, atrophic endometrium and hyperplasia were found adjacent to the cancers in 30 and 19 cases respectively. Cyclin A was expressed in < 1% of the glandular cells of normal endometrium in the proliferative phase and in hyperplasia, but was negligible in normal secretory phase and atrophic endometrium. p53 was almost always negative in normal endometrium and hyperplasia. Of the 62 endometrioid carcinomas, 12 tumors (19.4%) overexpressed cyclin A and 21 tumors (33.8%) overexpressed p53 (positive cells > 1%). Cyclin A and p53 were more frequently expressed in poorly differentiated tumors than in well differentiated tumors (cyclin A, p = 0.002 p53, p = 0.016). In addition, cyclin A-positive cells were topographically related to those cells positive for p53 as well as Ki-67. In conclusion, the abnormal expression of cyclin A and p53 is associated with high-grade endometrial endometrioid carcinomas.
