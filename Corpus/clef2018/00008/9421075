Prognostic value of p53 and K-ras-2 topographic genotyping in endometrial carcinoma: a clinicopathologic and molecular comparison. The predictive value of p53 and K-ras-2 mutational genotyping in determining tumor aggressiveness and survival in patients with endometrial carcinoma (EC) was retrospectively evaluated using a molecular genotyping approach on fixative treated tissue specimens. Two groups of patients with EC were selected based upon length of survival. Group A consisted of 14 patients that died within 3 years of initial diagnosis and treatment (mean survival of 1.1 years). Group B consisted of 18 patients that survived beyond 3 years (mean survival of 4.7 years). Clinicopathologic features including clinical stage, histologic type, and combined nuclear and architectural grade of each tumor were statistically analyzed with respect to oncogene/tumor suppressor gene alterations. The majority of carcinomas in group A were serous (57%), stage III or IV (93%), and high combined grade (93%). Group B consisted mostly of endometrioid (89%) and low-grade carcinomas (83%) 56.1% were stage III or IV. K-ras-2 point alterations were found in 2 (14%) and 4 (22%) patients from group A and B respectively
