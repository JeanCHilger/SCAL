Cell proliferation-associated proteins in endometrial carcinomas, including papillary serous and endometrioid subtypes. Cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) and cyclins regulate the progression of cells through the cell cycle and can be overexpressed in human cancers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical profile of these proliferation-associated proteins and correlate the results with clinicopathologic parameters of endometrial carcinomas. Archival tissue sections from 91 endometrial carcinomas were immunostained using monoclonal antibodies against p34CDC2 cdk, cyclins A and B1, p120, Ki-67, and PCNA. Immunoreactivity was semiquantitatively assessed and the results correlated with pathologic features and survival. Of the 91 endometrial carcinomas, 74 were endometrioid (17 villoglandular, 57 of usual type) and 17 were papillary serous carcinomas. The positivity rates for the different proteins in papillary serous and endometrioid tumors, respectively, were as follows: p34CDC2, 24% and 23% cyclin A, 71% and 64%
