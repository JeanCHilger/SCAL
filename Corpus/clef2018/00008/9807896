Cystic carcinoma of the prostate. Echographic diagnosis. To analyze the incidence of cystic cancer in our series of patients with prostatic cancer diagnosed by US-guided transrectal prostate biopsy and to describe the clinical and ultrasound features.Of 497 cases of prostatic cancer diagnosed by US-guided transrectal biopsy, 369 (74%) showed a hypoechoic nodule, 15 (3%) had a hyperechoic nodule, 17 (3%) showed a mixed echogenicity, 3 (0.6%) had a cystic lesion and 96 (19%) were isoechoic. The 3 patients with cystic cancer of the prostate are analyzed.In these three cases ultrasound showed a large, weakly echogenic, prostatic cystic lesion with mammillated margins. Punction-aspiration of the cyst yielded 20 and 7 cc of bloody liquid. The prostate was biopsied. Pathological analysis showed a typical prostatic adenocarcinoma in cases one and three small areas of endometriod carcinoma were found in case two. The cytological analyses and cultures of the cystic liquid were negative in all three cases. Complementary studies were doneIn our series, cystic carcinoma of the prostate accounts for 1% of prostate carcinomas. Punction-aspiration is advocated for prostatic cystic lesions with irregular margins. Bloody or dark cystic liquid warrants a prostate biopsy including cyst wall.
