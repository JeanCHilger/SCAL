The concentration of exfoliative adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and E-Selectin) in serum and peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. It is commonly known that retrograde transport of exfoliative fragments of endometrium to peritoneal cavity during the menstruation is an important factor of the ethiopathogenesis of endometriosis. The mechanism of inplantation of endometrial cells to peritoneal sites still remains unclear. Adhesions molecules are suggested to take part in this process. In our study we tried to establish the concentration of the adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and E-Selectin) in the sera and peritoneal fluids of women with endometriosis in comparison to the control group. These concentrations were significantly higher in the sera of all patients. We did not find any significant differences between two examined groups although further studies should be carried out.
