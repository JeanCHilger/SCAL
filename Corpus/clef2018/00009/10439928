Current drug therapy recommendations for the treatment of endometriosis. The principal symptoms and signs of endometriosis are tissue lesions and pelvic pain. These occur to varying degrees, with a chronic pattern and a tendency for deterioration with time. Patients with endometriosis often also have fertility problems, but the relationship between this and the signs and symptoms of the disease is inconsequent the basic pathophysiology is not exactly known. Although an immunological defect resulting in an inflammatory reaction around discharged menstrual debris in the pelvic cavity has been shown, no treatments based on this process are available. Estrogen often plays an important role in the progression of lesions and pain. Therefore, the aim of treatment usually has been to downregulate the ovaries and/or given antiestrogenic drugs as an alternative to surgical removal. As complete downregulation of the ovaries and hypoestrogenaemia does not seem to be crucial, achievement of amenorrhoea seems to be sufficient. This means that women may continue to have circulating estrogen levels so that severe hypoestrogenic adverse effects such as bone demineralisation, dry vagina, psychiatric symptoms or anabolic/androgenic effects of gestagens can be avoided. However, as both symptoms and the dependence of hormones may vary between and within women, the treatment needs to be individualised. There are a number of available treatments for endometriosis on the market and it is important for the doctor to know how to reach the therapeutic window of these treatments for each woman. It is also important to inform the patient about the different possibilities so that the treatment with the least impact on her quality of life can be chosen. When the therapeutic window has been identified, the treatment may then either be continued for a long period of time or be repeated when needed.
