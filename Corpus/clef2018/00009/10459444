Evaluation of combined endoscopic and pharmaceutical management of endometriosis during adolescence. Laparoscopy is the most frequent surgical approach in gynecologic patients with acute or chronic pelvic pain. The symptomatology is frequently related to a specific gynecological pathology such as endometriosis or associated adhesive disease. During an eight year period, January 1990 to December 1997, 26 patients (aged 16-20 years) with endometriosis were diagnosed endoscopically and managed pharmaceutically in our clinic. The disease was evaluated and staged according to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. The disease was evaluated as first stage in 16 patients (61.6%), as second stage in eight patients (30.8%), as third stage in one patient (3.8%) and as fourth stage in one patient (3.8%). Patients underwent adhesiolysis and management according to their laparoscopic findings. Postoperative pharmaceutical treatment (Danazol, GnRH analogues, Oral Contraceptives) was given. Patients were followed for the evaluation of the treatment. The efficacy of the combination of endoscopic and pharmaceutical management of the disease is discussed.
