Evaluation of cystic ovarian lesions using apparent diffusion coefficient calculated from reordered turboflash MR images. Reordered snapshot fast low-angle shot images with, and without, diffusion-perfusion gradients were used for the evaluation of contents of cystic ovarian lesions. Sonographically detected 51 cystic ovarian lesions (13 endometrial cysts, 17 ovarian cysts, 7 serous cystadenomas, 6 mucinous cystadenomas, 8 malignant cystic ovarian tumors) were studied. T1- and T2-weighted images, reordered snapshot fast low-angle shot images with and without diffusion-perfusion gradients (b = 106 and 0 s/mm2, respectively) were obtained. Using these images, apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were calculated in the cystic contents of these lesions. Endometrial cysts and malignant cystic ovarian tumors showed lower ADC values than ovarian cysts, serous cystadenomas and mucinous cystadenomas (p < 0.02). There was no distinct ADC difference among ovarian cysts, serous cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenomas (p > 0.2). In conclusion, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is possible to be useful to evaluate cystic contents of ovarian lesions.
