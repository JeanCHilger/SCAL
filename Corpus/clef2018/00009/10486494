The gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist leuprolide acetate induces apoptosis and suppresses cell proliferative activity in rectovaginal endometriosis. A gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, leuprolide acetate, was administered every 4 weeks for treatment of rectovaginal endometriosis. Degrees of apoptosis (percentage of in situ deoxyribonucleic acid 3'-end-labeled cells) and cell proliferative activity (percentage of cells with immunostaining for proliferating cell protein Ki-67) were examined in endometriotic glands of biopsy specimens taken before and during gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist induced apoptosis and suppressed cell proliferative activity in endometriotic glands.
