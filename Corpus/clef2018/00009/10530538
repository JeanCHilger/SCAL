ED echocardiography for peripartum cardiomyopathy. Although peripartum cardiomyopathy is uncommon, emergency physicians should be knowledgeable of it because of its high morbidity and mortality. Emergency physicians should be alert to the fact that the clinical presentation of peripartum cardiomyopathy is nonspecific. Its clinical manifestations are found in other medical conditions that can present in the late prepartum or postpartum patient. We present a case of peripartum cardiomyopathy that illustrates how its nonspecific respiratory signs and symptoms led to an initial diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The case also highlights the need for echocardiography in the evaluation of peripartum cardiomyopathy. We discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of peripartum cardiomyopathy.
