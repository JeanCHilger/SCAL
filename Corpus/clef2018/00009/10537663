Evaluation of Lovelace Health Systems chronic pelvic pain protocol. Although laparoscopy has been considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis, it often fails to detect the disease and provide lasting pain relief. Motivated by concerns for patient well-being, treatment efficacy, and cost containment, Lovelace Health Systems of Albuquerque, New Mexico, turned to the Lovelace Chronic Pelvic Pain Protocol, based on a chronic pelvic pain algorithm used to identify potential candidates for therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonist). Since the protocol's introduction in January 1997, empiric therapy with GnRH agonist has proved beneficial to patients, physicians, and healthcare system budgets.
