Anti-progesterones. Antiprogestins are a promising class of therapeutic agents in the field of reproductive health. Mifepristone (exRU486) remains the leading compound of this class and is the only one presently used in clinical practice. Beyond the main action of antiprogestins on human pregnancy, these compounds may prove useful in the treatment of uterine leiomyomas and endometriosis, and for contraception. IN CANCEROLOGY: Rare tumors such as meningiomas or leiomyoarcomas expressing progesterone receptors may be successfully treated with these antihormones. MAIN INDICATIONS: The main characteristics of the different antiprogestins discovered so far are addressed and the key results from the large clinical studies conducted with mifepristone are described here for indications where the product is approved for clinical use: medical termination of pregnancy during the first trimester, cervical dilatation prior to surgical termination of pregnancy, preparation for prostaglandin action in the therapeutic termination of pregnancy beyond the first trimester, labor induction in case of foetal death in utero.
