Materno-fetal platelet allo-immunization revealed by in utero intracerebral fetal hemorrhage: proposed management for the next pregnancy. Materno-fetal platelet allo-immunization causes fetal or neonatal thrombocytopenia and sometimes severe intracerebral bleeding. The HPA-1s antigen is most generally implicated. This accident can occur during the first pregnancy with a major risk of severe recurrence during the next pregnancy. These women require specific care in a specialized center although no consensus has been reached on management of second pregnancies. Proposed treatments include immunoglobulins and/or corticosteroids, fetal blood puncture and unique or iterative platelet transfusions.
