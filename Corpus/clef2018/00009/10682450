Alteration of peritoneal lymphocyte transformation and its interleukin-2 release in patients with infertility and endometriosis. To study the relationship between alteration of peritoneal lymphocyte transformation activity, its interleukin-2 (IL-2) release and infertility associated with endometriosis.Peritoneal fluid was collected from 15 infertile patients with endometriosis (endometriosis group) and 13 normal fertile women (control group). Lymphocyte transformation activity were determined in peritoneal fluid by morphometry. IL-2 contents were determined in peritoneal fluid and supernatants of cultured pelvic lymphocytes by biological method.Lymphocyte transformation activity reinforced (P < 0.001) and IL-2 contents increased in peritoneal fluid and supernatant of cultured pelvic lymphocyte in the endometriosis group than those in the control group (P < 0.01, P < 0.001 respectively). There is significant positive correlation between lymphocyte transformation rate and IL-2 activity of cultured supernatant in endometriosis group (P < 0.001).The increase of IL-2 content in the samples of endometriosis may play an important role in infertility with endometriosis.
