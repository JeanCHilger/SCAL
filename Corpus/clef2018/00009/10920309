Increase in serum leptin concentrations among women with endometriosis during danazol and leuprolide depot treatments. This study was undertaken to evaluate serum leptin concentrations in women with endometriosis during treatment with danazol and with leuprolide depot.Twenty patients aged 18 to 42 years with regular menses and documented pelvic endometriosis were recruited from a university hospital setting. Treatment was 200 mg danazol 3 times daily for 6 months or 3.75 mg leuprolide depot every 28 days for 6 months. Serum leptin concentrations were measured before, during, and after treatment. A single blood sample was taken from each of 10 control women without endometriosis for comparison. Serum leptin level was measured with a radioimmunoassay kit with human leptin, and analysis of variance and paired t tests were used for statistical analysis.Serum leptin levels were almost the same among women with endometriosis as in the control group. Leptin levels were higher among women with endometriosis during treatment with danazol and leuprolide(P <.001). Three months after treatment, leptin values remained moderately higher than before treatment.Danazol and leuprolide increased serum leptin levels. The mechanism of leptin increase is unclear. Further studies are needed to determine whether an adipogonadal axis exists.
