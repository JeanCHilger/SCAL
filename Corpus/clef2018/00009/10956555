Increased concentrations of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) is a potent inhibitor of human leukocyte elastase. We investigated whether SLPI was present in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis and to clarify the role of SLPI in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Western blot analyses revealed that SLPI protein was detected as a 12 kDa band in peritoneal fluid. The peritoneal fluid concentrations of SLPI, elastase and interleukin-6 were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). SLPI concentrations and the SLPI/elastase ratio in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis were higher than in samples from women without endometriosis. There was no significant correlation between concentrations of SLPI and interleukin-6 in the peritoneal fluid. Immunohistochemistry using an anti-SLPI polyclonal antibody revealed positive staining in peritoneal macrophages, but not lymphocytes. The present findings suggest that SLPI found in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis may contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis.
