Concentration of interleukin-12 in the peritoneal fluid is not influenced by the presence of endometriosis, its stage or the phase of the menstrual cycle. IL-12 is a key immunomodulatory cytokine. Its presence or concentration in peritoneal fluid is not related to the presence of endometriosis or the stage of the disease. A study was carried out to gain insight into the role of IL-12 in the development and maintenance of endometriosis in relation to menstrual cycle.A prospective study recruiting 64 consecutive women undergoing laparoscopic surgery for benign gynecological indications. Peritoneal fluid was obtained during laparoscopy. Concentration of IL-12 was measured and correlated to the presence of endometriosis, its stage and the phase of the menstrual cycle.Peritoneal fluid concentrations of IL-12 showed no correlation with the presence of endometriosis, the AFS stage of the disease or the phase of the menstrual cycle.IL-12 is a normal constituent of peritoneal fluid in around one third of the population tested and is not involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis at any stage of the disease or the phase of the menstrual cycle.
