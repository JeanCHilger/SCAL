Imaging of benign ovarian tumors. A positive diagnosis of benign ovarian tumor indicates a laparoscopic approach or a conservative treatment. Benign ovarian tumors are often easy to recognize with non ionizing modalities such as US and MRI. The most common benign ovarian tumors are: mature teratomas including dermoid cysts, tumors in the fibro-thecal group including fibromas and thecomas, benign serous and mucinous tumors (cystadenomas). Apart from ovarian tumors, endometriomas are more commonly extra ovarian, but may involve the ovarian stroma.
