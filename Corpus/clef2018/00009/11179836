K-ras exon 2 point mutations in human endometrial cancer. In the present study, we screened for the K-ras exon 2 point mutations in a group of 87 gynecological neoplasms (82 endometrial carcinomas, four carcinomas of the uterine cervix and one uterine carcinosarcoma) using the non-isotopic PCR-SSCP-direct sequencing techniques. Direct sequencing analysis revealed CAA-->CAC (Gln-->His) K-ras codon 61 point mutations in two (2.4%) of the 82 endometrial carcinomas mentioned above. These two cases were endometrial endometrioid carcinomas at an early clinical stage of disease (stage IB and IC due to FIGO). Those endometrial carcinomas that showed K-ras exon 2 point mutations revealed a strong positivity for heterogeneous nuclear retinoblastoma protein staining none of these, however, have had the K-ras codon 12 point mutation. In addition, there were no K-ras gene point mutations in three endometrial carcinomas lacking the Rb protein immunohistochemically. None of the cervical carcinomas tested had K-ras gene point mutations, whereas one carcinosarcoma harbored K-ras codon 61 point mutation (CAA-->CAC). In conclusion, our data support the view that K-ras exon 2 point mutations are rare events in human endometrial cancer. Rb and K-ras gene abnormalities may occur independently of each other during endometrial carcinogenesis in humans.
