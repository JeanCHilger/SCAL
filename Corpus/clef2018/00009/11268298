Medical and surgical therapies for pain associated with endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common condition for which a number of treatments have been proposed. Medical treatments are based on the hormonal responsiveness of endometriosis implants. These therapies include progestins (with or without estrogens), androgens, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs. Surgical treatments may include hysterectomy with oophorectomy or organ-sparing surgery involving ablation or resection of visible lesions of endometriosis and restoration of pelvic anatomy. There are no studies that directly compare the effectiveness or adverse effects of medical therapy and surgical therapy. Studies on medical therapy compare different treatments with placebo or with other active treatments. Hormone-based therapies for endometriosis show 80%-100% effectiveness in relief of pelvic pain over a 6-month course of therapy. Serious adverse outcomes after medical therapy are unusual. Studies on surgical therapy are largely anecdotal, with noncomparative reports on a variety of surgical methods. A few comparative surgical studies have been reported. Because of the noncomparative nature of many of the surgical studies, the use of combinations of surgical procedures and techniques in the reported studies, and the reporting of results from surgeons with an unusually high level of technical skill, the gynecological practitioner has little basis in the literature for assessing the optimum surgical approach. Surgical complications are believed to be underreported and may be related to how aggressive a surgical procedure is undertaken.
