Development of cancer of the corpus uteri against a background of adenomatosis. An attempt was made to differentiate various types of development of corpus uteri adenomatosis in the clinico-morphological aspect. Three forms of adenomatosis were differentiated: focal, diffuse and malignant adenomatosis. Studies of curetting specimens from the uterine body revealed adenomatosis in 3.4% of cases. Malignant adenoma of the corpus uteri was defined by the author as a malignantly transformed adenomatosis. Mos frequently adenomatosis developed at the age of 35-55 years, its transition to "adenomatous cancer" was noted in 30-40% of cases and more often in females aged 55-77 years.
