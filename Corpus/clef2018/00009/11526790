Evaluation of the generation of interleukin-10 by peripheral blood lymphocytes in women with endometriosis. The aim of study was the evaluation of generating the IL-10 by peripheral blood lymphocytes in women with endometriosis according to the stage of of the disease. Cytokine was estimated by immunoenzymatic method Elisa. The generation of IL-10 by peripheral blood lymphocytes was lower in patients with all stages of endometriosis than in control group. Decreased IL-10 generating observed in our study was not statistically significant, but it may correlate with disorders of immunological cell response. It may also play a role in a development and progression of endometriosis.
