VEGF concentration in peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis. The theory of Sampson that endometrial cells and fragments desquamated during the menstrual period are transported through fallopian tubes into the peritoneal cavity where they implant, proliferate and develop into endometriotic lesions is generally accepted. There is increasing evidence that immunological mechanisms play a role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of endometriosis. Excessive endometrial angiogenesis is proposed as an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Evidence is reviewed for the hypothesis that the endometrium of women with endometriosis has an increased capacity to proliferate, implant and grow in the peritoneal cavity. From the known angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has emerged as a pivotally important regulator of normal angiogenesis and pathological neovascularization. In present study we evaluated the concentrations of VEGF in peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis and showed no correlation between AFS score and VEGF concentration in peritoneal and in ovarian endometriosis. Above results do not confirm former observations indicating the role of VEGF in endometriosis pathogenesis.
