Expression, production, and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-6 by granulosa cells is comparable in women with and without endometriosis. To investigate the production and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and protein by granulosa luteal cells (GCs) in vivo and in vitro in women with and without endometriosis.Prospective study.A private, university-affiliated assisted reproduction unit and a university center.Women with severe endometriosis (n = 6) or without the disease (n = 14) after laparoscopy, undergoing in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection and embryo transfer.GCs were obtained from each aspirate.Intracellular and secreted protein, as well as mRNA for both VEGF and IL-6 in GCs.The expression of VEGF and IL-6 mRNAs in vivo and in vitro was similar in both groups. Also, GCs from patients with endometriosis produced and secreted equal amounts of these proteins compared with controls without the disease, either in freshly isolated cells or in 24-hour cultures.The GC function in terms of VEGF and IL-6 production does not seem to be altered in patients with endometriosis in comparison with those without this condition.
