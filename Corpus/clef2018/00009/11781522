CD10 is a marker for normal and neoplastic endometrial stromal cells. Using the immunohistochemical technique, we investigated the expression of CD10 in normal female genital tissues, chorionic villi and decidua of early gestation, endometriotic lesions, and uterine mesenchymal tumors. The cytoplasm of normal endometrial stromal cells was consistently positive for CD10. During early gestation, decidualized endometrial stromal cells were negative or only focally positive for CD10, whereas nondecidualized stromal cells were diffusely positive. Syncytiotrophoblast was positive for CD10 on the apical surface, whereas chorionic mesenchymal cells were diffusely positive within the cytoplasm. Cytotrophoblast and intermediate trophoblast were negative for CD10. Groups of stromal cells surrounding cervical glands were often positive for CD10. Myometrium, endometrial and cervical glands, cervical squamous epithelia, and tubal epithelia and stroma exhibited no reactivity for CD10. In endometriosis and adenomyosis, ectopic endometrial stromal cells were usually positive for CD10. Endometrial stromal tumors, including undifferentiated uterine sarcomas, mostly showed diffuse immunoreactivity for CD10. Leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas were negative or focally (< 5% of cells staining) positive (8/12 leiomyomas and 4/8 leiomyosarcomas) for CD10, except for 1 myxoid leiomyosarcoma that showed CD10 staining in the myxoid areas. These data suggest that diffuse CD10 staining is characteristic of normal and neoplastic endometrial stromal cells, unless they are decidualized.
