Epithelioid endometrial and endometrioid stromal tumors: a report of four cases emphasizing their distinction from epithelioid smooth muscle tumors and other oxyphilic uterine and extrauterine tumors. Three endometrial and one extrauterine endometrioid stromal tumors (three sarcomas and one stromal nodule) with a prominent component of epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm are described. The patients were 39, 48, 56 and 86 years of age. The endometrial sarcomas were described grossly as an ill-defined tan nodule and "ragged and papillary," respectively, and had the typical infiltrative pattern of low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. The stromal nodule was a 13-cm, well circumscribed, yellow, fleshy mass. The extrauterine tumor was probably primary in the sigmoid colon. Oval to polygonal epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm accounted for 50% to 90% of the tumor cells. The cytoplasm was granular in one case. None of the tumors contained cells with a rhabdoid appearance. Nuclear and other features did not differ from those of usual endometrial-endometrioid stromal tumors except in one case in which there was greater nuclear pleomorphism. There was strong diffuse cytoplasmic immunoreactivity of all four tumors for vimentin and for CD10 in three of three tumors tested, as well as extensive and moderate reactivity for NK1/C3 and focal weak reactivity for CD68 in two of three tumors tested. Muscle actin positivity was very focal to extensive and weak to strong in all three tumors tested, mainly in the epithelioid areas alpha-smooth muscle actin was focally to extensively positive in the epithelioid areas of two of three tumors tested
