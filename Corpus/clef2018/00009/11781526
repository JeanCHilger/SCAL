Primary peritoneal mullerian adenosarcoma with sarcomatous overgrowth associated with endometriosis: a case report. We report a primary peritoneal mullerian adenosarcoma with sarcomatous overgrowth associated with endometriosis in a 50-year-old female. The tumor formed multiple peritoneal masses occupying the pelvis and subdiaphragmatic space. Histologically, the tumor was composed of benign-appearing mullerian glands surrounded by a sarcomatous stroma. In addition, one perisplenic mass was largely devoid of the epithelial component and was of higher grade than the remaining lesions. Multiple foci of endometriosis were associated with the pelvic masses. To our knowledge, primary peritoneal mullerian adenosarcoma with sarcomatous overgrowth associated with endometriosis has not been previously reported.
