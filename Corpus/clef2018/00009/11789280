Clinical study on endometrial ovarian cyst treated by integrated laparoscopy and Chinese herbal medicine. To investigate a new method of integrated laparoscopy with Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in treating endometrial ovarian cyst.One hundred and fifty-two patients with endometrial ovarian cyst were randomly treated with three therapies: Integrated laparoscopy with CHM (combination group), CHM (TCM group) and Danazol (WM group). To compare the clinical efficacy and side-effects of the three groups and to elucidate the therapeutic mechanism by detecting the serum CA125 reproductive endocrine hormone, plasma PGF1 alpha, PGE2 etc.The shrinking rate and disappearance rate of the cysts, and markedly effective rate of combination group were obviously higher than those of TCM group and WM group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The pregnancy rate of combination group was also higher than that of WM group (P < 0.05). Few side-effects were the most prominent advantage for combination group and TCM group. After treatment, the plasma PGF1 alpha lowered remarkably, serum p.o. increased and CA125 reduced obviously (P < 0.01, P < 0.05).The integrated laparoscopy and CHM combination therapy is a new method in treating endometrial ovarian cyst with significant efficacy, minimal adverse effect and maximal preservation of reproductive function.
