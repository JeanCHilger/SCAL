New molecular tumor markers for endometrial cancer. Although the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics officially changed the classification system of endometrial cancer from a clinically staged to a surgically staged disease in 1988, optimal management of patients with endometrial cancer is still controversial. Gynecologists happen to experience that patients with tumors that are identical in grade and stage often have significantly different clinical outcomes or responses to therapy. In order to identify an objective biological factor correlating with tumor aggressiveness, many tumor markers have been investigated. So far, CA125 is one of the most reliable tumor marker for adenocarcinoma of the uterus and frequently used in a clinical setting. Recently, with the advent of molecular biological techniques, many genes and regions of the genome related to endometrial cancer have been identified. We undertook a genome-wide screening to detect genetic changes by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) in primary endometrioid cancers, since CGH analysis provides comprehensive information concerning relative chromosomal losses and gains in tumors by a single hybridization. In this paper, the usefulness of serum tumor markers and the new promising molecular tumor markers for endometrial cancer are discussed.
