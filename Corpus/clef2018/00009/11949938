Clinical aspects of endometriosis. Endometriosis is one of the most commonly encountered gynecologic diseases requiring medical and/or surgical therapy. It is a leading cause of hysterectomy in the United States and has significant associated morbidity. The most frequent symptoms of genital tract endometriosis are dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility. Endometriosis occurs in the pelvis, most commonly the ovaries and the dependent areas covered with peritoneum. Diagnosis requires surgical intervention and is usually made by laparoscopy. In women being evaluated for pelvic pain, the diagnosis of endometriosis is made frequently (40-60%) and varies with the population being studied. Infertility and endometriosis have long been associated. Although women with infertility may have pelvic pain, subfertility (20-30%) can be the only presenting symptom. In asymptomatic women, the diagnosis of endometriosis ranges from 2% to 22% of reproductive-age women. Its true incidence and natural history remain to be clarified. Endometriosis is a significant public health issue because of the large number of women it affects and the significant morbidity associated with this disease.
