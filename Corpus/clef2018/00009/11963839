Expression of soluble adhesion molecules in sera of women with stage III and IV endometriosis. To determine the effect of stage III and IV endometriosis on serum concentration of soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin.Sera from women with laparoscopically proven stage III and IV endometriosis were analyzed for the presence of soluble ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Concentrations of these molecules were compared with those of laparoscopically proven disease-free controls.When compared with controls, women with stage III and IV endometriosis had higher serum concentrations of soluble VCAM-1, lower serum concentration of soluble ICAM-1, and no difference in serum concentration of soluble E-selectin.Significant aberrations in levels of circulating adhesion molecules were found in women with stage III and IV endometriosis. These findings might shed light on the pathogenesis of endometriosis and be useful in the development of biochemical markers for disease stage.
