Radiologic diagnosis of thrombosis of renal veins (author's transl). Recent literature shows thrombosis of renal veins to be more common than so far assumed. When it is suspected clinically, angiographic examination is essential since conventional and nuclear-medical examinations give only uncharacteristic results. Causes and clinical findings are outlined and two cases reported. The follow-up of the second case shows that in spite of progressive renal vein thrombosis renal function may be maintained if good collaterals develop.
