Diagnosis and imaging of adenomyotic disease of the retroperitoneal space. This manuscript discusses the diagnosis and imaging of adenomyotic disease of the retroperitoneal space, a pathology that we have defined as retroperitoneal adenomyotic disease (RAD). By prospective analysis, comparing barium enema, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal ultrasonography, we distinguished three types of retroperitoneal adenomyotic lesions. The most frequently encountered types were posterior vaginal fornix lesions, followed by hourglass-shaped or diabolo-like lesions, and then by rectovaginal septum lesions. This anatomical classification based on clinical examination and imaging will allow us in the future to define the most appropriate treatment for each entity.
