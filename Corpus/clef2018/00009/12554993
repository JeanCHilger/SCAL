High frequency of endometrial polyps in endometriosis. To evaluate the effectiveness of hysteroscopy and the frequency of endometrial polyps in women with endometriosis.Retrospective clinical study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Infertility unit at a university-affiliated hospital.One hundred eighty-three infertile women, 92 with endometriosis and 91 controls without the disease.Laparoscopy and scoring of endometriosis according to the American Fertility Society classification, and confirmation of endometrial polyps by pathologic examination.There was no significant difference between groups with regard to age, mean duration of infertility, and frequency of primary or secondary infertility. Endometrial polyps were found in 43 women (46.7%) with endometriosis and in 15 controls (16.5%, p = 0.0000). Their frequency did not differ significantly according to stage of endometriosis.We strongly recommend hysteroscopy if endometriosis is detected in a woman undergoing evaluation for infertility, even if hysterosalpingography and transvaginal ultrasonography do not suggest endometrial polyps.
