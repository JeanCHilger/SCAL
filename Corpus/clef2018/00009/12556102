p53 expression in tissue adjacent to endometrial carcinoma. Since several investigations did not demonstrate the presence of altered p53 in endometrial hyperplasias, it has been concluded that these alterations constitute a relatively late event in endometrial carcinoma. The aim of the present study was to assess the presence of p53 in the tissue adjacent to endometrial carcinoma in attempt to elucidate the relationship between these tissues.New slides were prepared from paraffin-embeded tissue blocks of 49 endometrial endometrioid carcinoma hysterectomy specimens so that in each case tumor tissue and adjacent uninvolved endometrium were represented. Immunohistochemical staining for p53 detection was then performed.In 43 of the 49 hysterectomy specimens evaluated, the tissue adjacent to the endometrial carcinoma was non hyperplastic and in six it was hyperplastic. Positive immunohistochemical staining was found in 22 (44.9%) of endometrial carcinomas and in eight (16.3%) of the adjacent tissues. A statistically significant higher percentage of hyperplastic adjacent tissues than non-hyperplastic adjacent tissues were immunohistochemically p53 positive (50.0% vs 11.3% p = 0.047).Our findings may indicate that p53 alterations are not necessarily a late event in endometrial endometrioid carcinogenesis. Since a large proportion of tissues adjacent to endometrial carcinoma do not show p53 alterations, other early cellular events may also play a role.
