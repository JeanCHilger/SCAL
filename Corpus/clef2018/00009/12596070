Pulmonary metastases from a low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma confirmed by chromosome aberration and fluorescence in-situ hybridization approaches: a case of recurrence 13 years after hysterectomy. Pulmonary metastasis from low-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESSs) occasionally are found after long, disease-free periods, mostly as incidental histological or radiological discoveries. We describe a case of low-grade ESS presenting as nodular pulmonary metastases finally diagnosed by estrogen-receptor staining, cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses, and perusal of the histology of hysterectomy material. An abnormal nodule in the lung field was discovered by means of chest X-ray of a 47-year-old woman. She had been disease free for 13 years after hysterectomy for an alleged leiomyoma. A computed tomographic scan revealed nodules, with fluctuation in size over the 2-year period, in both lungs. Finally the lesion in the left lung was resected, and pulmonary endometriosis was suspected because of the lack of stromal cell nuclear atypia and positive immunohistochemical reactions for estrogen and progesterone receptors. However, a characteristic karyotype was identified cytogenetically: 46, XX, t(717)(p15
