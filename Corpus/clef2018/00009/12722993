Accuracy of laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis. Laparoscopy is the standard method to visually identify endometriotic lesions under magnification within and outside the minor pelvis. The aim of this study was to analyze the accuracy of laparoscopic visualization in diagnosing the various endometriotic sites as confirmed histologically.Presumed endometriotic sites were observed in 164 patients operated on under the clinical suspicion of endometriosis. Targeted biopsies were performed for histologic corroboration, comparing the laparoscopic findings and diagnosis to the histological results.The histological reports of the biopsies confirmed the presence of endometriosis in 138 patients (84.1%), but in 26 patients (15.9%), no evidence of endometriosis was observed. 100% of "red" lesions, 92% of "black" lesions, and 31% of "white" lesions turned out to be endometriosis. Of the 264 various suspected endometriotic sites observed, 142 (53.8%) were confirmed histologically. The most accurate diagnosis was in lesions on the parietal peritoneum of the pelvis, confirmed in 9/9 cases (100%) the ovarian fossa, confirmed in 8/12 cases (66.7%)Endometriosis has a multiple appearance, and the lesions may be confused with nonendometriotic lesions. It is clear that a nonhistology-based diagnosis may lead to unnecessary prolonged medical treatment and operations and may delay the proper treatment measures from being applied. Therefore, a meticulous histological confirmation should still be the first step in the laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment of suspected endometriosis.
