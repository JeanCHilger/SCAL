Endometriosis of the large intestine. Two cases of large intestine endometriosis are presented. The disease was diagnosed during histological examination of samples taken during surgery. Clinically one case was diagnosed as Crohn's disease, while the second as cancer of the large intestine. The authors suggest, that an extent of surgery for, tumours of the large intestine should be carefully planned, specially if the tissue specimen was not examined histologically earlier.
