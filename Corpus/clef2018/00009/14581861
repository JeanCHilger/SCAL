Alcohol sclerosis of endometriomas after ultrasound-guided aspiration. We investigate the possibility to use ultrasound-guided aspiration and alcohol sclerosis in patients with endometrioma.Ten patients with endometriotic ovarian cysts, mean diameter <70 mm, CA125 <35 UI, persistence of cyst after medical therapy and refusal of surgical therapy have been studied. The patients were submitted to ultrasound-guided aspiration of endometriomas. Fifty per cent of aspirated fluid was replaced with pure ethanol, which was left in situ for 10 to 20 minutes. No medical therapy was employed after aspiration and ethanol treatment.In 9 patients no recurrence was observed at ultrasound after 21.2+/-6.62 months of follow-up. In 1 case only, after 6 months, a recurrence of the endometrioma in the same site was observed.Ultrasound-guided alcoholic sclerotherapy of the endometriotic ovarian cysts is effective and safe. We speculate that this procedure could be indicated in patients refusing standard surgical therapy.
