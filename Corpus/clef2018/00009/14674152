Innate immunity participation in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a serious clinical problem among the women treated because of gynecological reasons. The frequency of its occurrence is estimated for 10-15% of all women at reproductive age.This study evaluates the chosen phenomenons participating in innate immunity and their role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.42 patients aged 22 to 39 years old treated in Surgical Gynecology Department of Polish Mother Health Centre Research Institute were the study group. Comparative group consisted of 22 age-matched women with no clinical complains. We evaluated production of reactive oxygen intermediates by peripheral blood neutrophils in both groups of women (both spontaneous and stimulated with fMLP) using the chemiluminescence test. We used neutrophils, both resting and previously preactivated with TNF-alpha. The activity of C3 and C4 complement components and total antioxidant status were also measured.Showed that the chemiluminescence values were higher in patients with endometriosis than in comparative group. Preactivation of neutrophils with the use of TNF-alpha was significantly weakened. Both C3 and C4 complement components revealed higher activity in women with endometriosis as compared to those without this disease. Total antioxidant status values were significantly lower in patients with endometriosis than in women from the comparative group.Innate immunity may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis due to changes in its components activity that are observed in the course of this disease.
