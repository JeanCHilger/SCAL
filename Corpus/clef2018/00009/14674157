Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma levels in peritoneal fluid of infertile women. Changes in the peritoneal fluid environment have been implicated in the pathogenesis of endometriosis as well as in the decrease of fertility. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) play a critical role in the generation of the immune response, leading to the enhanced proinflammatory cytokines and free radicals production.59 women were studied, including 24 patients with unexplained infertility, 10 infertile women with endometriosis (Io or IIo rAFS), 11 patients with PCOS and 14 patients with tubal occlusion. TNF alpha and IFN gamma concentrations were measured in the PF using commercially available ELISA kits.Peritoneal fluid IFN gamma concentrations did not differ significantly between the studied groups. TNF alpha levels were significantly (p = 0.02) higher in the PF of endometriotic patients compared to women with tubal infertility. The positive correlation (R = 0.83 p < 0.01) has been found between TNF alpha and IFN gamma levels.Increased PF TNF alpha levels observed in patients with endometriosis may play a role in activation of peritoneal macrophages. Positive correlation between TNF alpha and IFN gamma suggests their synergistic stimulatory effect on the immunocompetent PF cells.
