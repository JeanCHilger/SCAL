The effect of a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue as first-line management in cyclical pelvic pain. One of the most common gynaecological causes of chronic pelvic pain is endometriosis. A lack of correlation between laparoscopic findings and pelvic pain has been reported. As endometriotic lesions are under hormonal influence, the effects of the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues cause shrinkage of the deposits, reducing symptoms caused by them. We carried out a longitudinal, interventional pilot study, examining the effect of leuprorelin acetate 3.75 mg (Prostap SR, Wyeth) on pelvic pain prospectively. Preliminary data shows a decrease in pain scores from before to after treatment which is statistically significant (P<0.0001) as well as a general improvement in other symptoms. Laparoscopy showed that symptom intensity is not always related to severity of endometriosis and the worst symptoms may not necessarily be due to pathology. Therefore, it is beneficial to treat women with CPP with GnRH analogues as first-line management to relieve painful symptoms, avoid surgical risks and save money.
