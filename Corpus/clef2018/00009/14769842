Cytological features of cervical smears in serous adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. Serous adenocarcinoma (SAC) of the endometrium has a poor prognosis compared with that of typical endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC). The objective of this study was to determine whether SAC can be distinguished from EAC preoperatively by cervical or endometrial cytology.Cervical smears and endometrial smears obtained from 128 patients with endometrial carcinoma were reviewed. Histological types included 117 cases of EAC and 11 cases of SAC. The positive rates of cervical smears and those of endometrial smears in SAC and EAC cases were compared. Papillary clusters and bare nuclei of malignant cells in positive cervical smears were also investigated for their diagnostic significance in discriminating between EAC and SAC.The positive rate of cervical smears in SAC was significantly higher than that in EAC (72.7 vs 27.4%, P < 0.05). Among cases with positive cervical smears, there were significantly more cases with papillary clusters and/or bare nuclei in cases of SAC than in cases of EAC.When endometrial carcinoma is clinically suspected and a cervical smear is positive, the predominance of either papillary clusters or features of bare nuclei of malignant cells in the smear may indicate the presence of SAC.
