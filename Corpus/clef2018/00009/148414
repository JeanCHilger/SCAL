The future of non-invasive medical imaging. A variety of new non-invasive imaging techniques are now at the physicians' disposal for patients' management. However, the place of each new imaging modality within the general diagnostic armamentarium is far from established. Not only comparative assessments of these are needed but also pre-defined strategies for use are required for an intelligent approach to a difficult medical problem. The increasing cost of medicine and the decreasing resources available for development enhance the necessity for such an approach. This paper offers an initial solution to the problem.
