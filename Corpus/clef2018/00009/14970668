Indices of oxidative stress in eutopic and ectopic endometria of women with endometriosis. This study was designed to determine the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase and some of the lipid peroxidation indices (malondialdehyde and total sulfhydryl groups) in eutopic and ectopic endometria of patients with endometriosis. Ectopic endometrial tissues (ovarian cysts n = 22) were obtained laparoscopically during the preovulatory period. Statistical analyses were made using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The levels of malondialdehyde and total sulfhydryl groups were similar in the eutopic and ectopic endometria, whereas the superoxide dismutase activity was found to be significantly higher in the latter (1,893 +/- 780 vs. 3,512 +/- 1,502 U/g protein
