New medical treatments for endometriosis. The medical treatment of endometriosis has long centered upon producing a hypoestrogenic environment by producing pituitary suppression or a progestin-dominant environment. However, as more is uncovered regarding the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of this disease, more targeted therapies can be developed. Current research has focused upon medications designed to attack specific aspects of the development and maintenance of endometriosis. These include progesterone receptor modulators, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists, aromatase inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, pentoxifylline (and other general immune modulators), and estrogen receptor beta agonists. It is hoped that this new wave of medications will improve the response to medical therapy for this disorder.
