Expression of hepatocyte growth factor and its receptor c-met gene in the endometrium of women with endometriosis. To study the role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor (c-Met) in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry method was used to examine HGF mRNA and protein expression in eutopic and ectopic endometrium obtained from 54 women in reproductive age with endometriosis confirmed by laparoscopy and histological examination (including 28 cases of stages I/II and 26 of stages III/IV) and from the endometrium of 24 healthy fertile women.In patients with endometriosis, the positivity rate of HGF/c-Met expression was similar in the eutopic and ectopic endometria, but the number of positive cells and expression intensity were much higher in ectopic endometrium. The positive expression rate varied little between the proliferative and secretory stages of the endometrium. Compare with the healthy controls, patients with endometriosis of stages I/II and III/IV had significantly elevated positivity rate of HGF and c-Met expressions in either eutopic and ectopic endometrium, but without significant difference between the two patient groups (P<0.01). The rate of strong c-Met protein expression was significantly higher in III/IV endometriosis than in the controls, without statistical difference between other groups.The expressions of HGF and c-met gene are correlated with the pathogenesis of endometriosis, which is preceded by eventful changes in the biological behavior of the eutopic endometrium.
