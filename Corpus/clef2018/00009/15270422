Ureteral endometriosis: an unusual case of a pelvic mass arising in the ureter and involving the rectum and uterine cervix. The case of a 41-year-old woman with a pelvic mass arising in the left ureter is reported. The diagnosis of endometriosis was made on transperineal biopsy exclusively. After unsuccessful treatment with LH-RH analogues, the patient underwent ureteral resection and ureteroneocystostomy. At six months' follow-up, she is asymptomatic with no evidence of hydronephrosis.
