Endometriosis of the abdominal wall (authors' experience). Endometriosis is a very common gynecological disease, although the abdominal wall localization is a rare clinical problem in the everyday practice and this explains the incomplete reports in literature and the difficulty of a standard treatment. The authors report four cases of abdominal wall endometriosis, underlining how the surgical therapy represents the golden standard of decisive treatment, thanks also to prosthetic reconstruction techniques who allow more radical demolitions. On the contrary, the medical treatment should be reserved to selected cases such as especially the less symptomatic umbilical primitive diseases.
