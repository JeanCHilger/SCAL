Reversible menopause induced by the GnRH analogue buserelin: effects on lipoprotein metabolism. GnRH agonists can induce a reversible pharmacological menopause and can be used to treat endometriosis, a fairly common gynaecological problem which responds well to oestrogen deprivation. Premature menopause is associated with adverse lipid changes and an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Therefore we set out to investigate changes in lipoprotein metabolism in a group of premenopausal women being treated with the GnRH analogue buserelin for active endometriosis. We monitored lipoprotein levels, high density lipoprotein subfractions and apolipoproteins AI, AII and B during a 12-month course of treatment and for 6 months afterwards. Treatment caused a sustained increase in HDL3 cholesterol levels and a small increase in low density lipoprotein cholesterol, which was significant at the six-month visit only. Apolipoprotein B levels rose significantly and there were marginal increases in apolipoproteins AI and AII. All changes and trends were reversed after cessation of treatment. We conclude that the treatment did not profoundly affect lipoprotein metabolism, neither LDL nor HDL cholesterol, the established important risk markers for coronary heart disease appreciably altered.
