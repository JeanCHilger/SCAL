Thoracoamniotic shunts: fetal treatment of pleural effusions and congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations. To determine whether fetuses that underwent thoracoamniotic shunt placement for treatment of pleural effusion (PE) or macrocystic congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) have an improved outcome as compared with an untreated population.A retrospective review from a single tertiary center was performed using thoracoamniotic shunt placement to treat PE or macrocystic CCAM between 1998 and 2001. Thoracoamniotic shunts were used on 26 occasions in 19 pregnancies.The average gestational age at the diagnosis of PE and CCAM was 22 + 4 and 20 + 0 weeks, respectively. Shunts were offered in pregnancies complicated by hydrops or at significant risk for pulmonary hypoplasia. Shunts were placed at 26 + 2 weeks (average) and 23 + 1 weeks (average) in the PE and CCAM groups, respectively. In CCAM patients, the mean pre- and postshunting mass volumes were 50.5 and 25.7 cm(3), representing a 51% reduction in mass volume following shunt placement. In the PE group, the average delivery age was 33 + 5 weeks, with an average shunt placement to delivery time of 7 + 3 weeks. In the CCAM group, the average delivery was 33 + 3 weeks, with an average shunt placement to delivery time of 10 + 2 weeks. The postnatal survival rates were 67% (6/9) and 70% (7/10) in the PE and CCAM groups, respectively.(1) Thoracoamniotic shunts should be considered as a treatment option for selected PE or macrocystic CCAM fetuses with hydrops or a significant risk for pulmonary hypoplasia (2) the neonatal survival with shunting was similar for PE and CCAM groups and was improved as compared with literature reports, and (3) fetuses with CCAM presented earlier with hydrops than those with PE. Successful shunting resulted in a prolongation of pregnancy into the 3rd trimester in both groups.
