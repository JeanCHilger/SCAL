Aspiration cytology of ovarian cysts in in vitro fertilization patients. Transvaginal ultrasonography is routinely performed in the course of egg retrieval in patients presenting for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and results in the discovery of occult, subclinical ovarian cysts that would otherwise have gone undetected. This study (1) evaluated the cellular composition of the cyst fluids based on a comparison with cells obtained from cysts of known and documented histologic type, and (2) attempted to determine if the cytologic evaluation of cyst fluid was necessary to exclude occult ovarian cancer. During the 1.8 years of our study, 931 patients underwent 1,544 ultrasound-guided ovum retrievals during this same period, 90 specimens of ovarian cyst fluid were examined. Of them, none contained cancer cells. A single case of cystic ovarian cancer was detected by ultrasound but was not aspirated. The cytologic diagnosis of endometriosis was established in 12 specimens from 10 patients, 5 of whom did not have a previously documented clinical diagnosis of endometriosis. The role of routine ovarian cyst fluid cytology as part of an IVF protocol may be of limited value in cancer diagnosis. However, until the incidence of ovarian cancer in the subset of women with both infertility and ovarian cysts is known, it would seem prudent to continue to examine any voluminous or discolored ovarian cyst fluid obtained from IVF patients. The presence of ovarian cysts did not affect the clinical pregnancy rate per retrieval.
