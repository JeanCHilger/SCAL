The peritoneal environment in endometriosis. The local environment of peritoneal fluid (PF) surrounding the endometriotic implant is immunologically dynamic and links the reproductive and immune systems. Peritoneal fluid contains a variety of free floating cells, including macrophages, mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils and mast cells. Macrophages are attracted to the peritoneal environment more abundantly than any other cell type. These scavengers promote cellular growth and viability through secretion of growth factors and cytokines. It is now becoming evident that cytokines play an important role in reproduction at various levels, including gamete function, fertilization and embryo development, implantation and postimplantation survival of the conceptus. Peritoneal fluid has been shown to affect negatively ovum capture by the fimbria, sperm survival, spermatozoon-oocyte interaction and embryonic development. We have recently identified the presence of two pro-inflammatory chemoattractant cytokines for monocyte/macrophages (MCP-1) and for granulocytes (interleukin-8, IL-8) in the PF. Concentrations of both IL-8 and MCP-1 are not only elevated in PF of women with endometriosis compared to those without endometriosis, but they are related to the severity of the disease. Over the past 70 years, at least a dozen theories have been proposed to explain the histogenesis and aetiology of endometriosis. It appears that the aetiology is multifactorial, and today a composite theory of retrograde menstruation with implantation of endometrial fragments in conjunction with peritoneal factors to stimulate cell growth is the most widely accepted explanation for peritoneal endometriosis.
