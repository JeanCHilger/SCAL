Diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis. A review. The correct approach for endometriosis management is still unclear. This review explores recent data concerning diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis, trying to define guidelines for the most appropriate diagnostic approach and therapeutic regimen. At present, laparoscopy is still considered the gold standard in endometriosis diagnosis. The risks and the diagnostic limitations of laparoscopy and the inaccuracy of clinical examination justify the considerable efforts made to improve the diagnosis with imaging techniques. The therapeutic approach is still far from being defined as causal and focuses on management of clinical symptoms of the disease rather than on the disease itself. A first-line medical therapy should be tried in patients with pelvic pain not asking for a pregnancy. Surgical treatment is considered the best treatment for women with pain and or pelvic mass who wish to become pregnant in a short time. For infertile patients, medical therapy has a limited role. The 2 treatment options include surgery or in vitro fertilization (IVF). According to our results, it seems that correct management of infertile women with endometriosis is a combination of surgery and IVF in women who did not obtain post-surgery pregnancy spontaneously.
