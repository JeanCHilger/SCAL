ESHRE guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis. The objective was to develop recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis and its associated symptoms. A working group was convened comprised of practising gynaecologists and experts in evidence-based medicine from Europe, as well as an endometriosis self-help group representative. After reviewing existing evidence-based guidelines and systematic reviews, the expert panel met on three occasions for a day during which the guideline was developed and refined. Recommendations based solely on the clinical experience of the panel were avoided as much as possible. The entire ESHRE Special Interest Group for Endometriosis and Endometrium was given the opportunity to comment on the draft guideline, after which it was available for comment on the ESHRE website for 3 months. The working group then ratified the guideline by unanimous or near-unanimous voting finally, it was approved by the ESHRE Executive Committee. The guideline will be updated regularly, and will be made available at http://www.endometriosis.org/guidelines.html with hyperlinks to the supporting evidence, and the relevant references and abstracts. For women presenting with symptoms suggestive of endometriosis, a definitive diagnosis of most forms of endometriosis requires visual inspection of the pelvis at laparoscopy as the 'gold standard' investigation. However, pain symptoms suggestive of the disease can be treated without a definitive diagnosis using a therapeutic trial of a hormonal drug to reduce menstrual flow. In women with laparoscopically confirmed disease, suppression of ovarian function for 6 months reduces endometriosis-associated pain
