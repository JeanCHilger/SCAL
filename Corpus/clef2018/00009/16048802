Vascular endothelial growth factor and its soluble receptor in ovarian pathology. The soluble form of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor, s-VEGFR-1, may negatively regulate the action of VEGF. Our purpose was to better understand the regulation of angiogenetic processes in ovarian cysts.Seventy-three women, 36 with serous cystoadenoma, 30 with ovarian endometriosis and seven with cystoadenocarcinoma, were enrolled. We calculated both VEGF and s-VEGFR-1 levels in cystic fluid and a VEGF activity index by means of the ratio VEGF/s-VEGFR-1. Student's t test was used for the statistical analysis.We found higher VEGF concentration in both endometriotic and malignant lesions than in serous cystoadenoma (p=0.03 and 0.001, respectively). Also s-VEGFR-1 concentration was higher in endometrioma than in serous cysts (p=0.005) however, there was no statistically significant difference between cystoadenoma and the malignant lesions (p=0.15). VEGF activity index in cystoadenoma, endometriotic and malignant lesions was 0.61, 0.27 and 0.50, respectively.VEGF certainly has an important role in both ovarian endometriosis and for cancer progression however, the activity index may be better to investigate the real role of VEGF in the pathology we have considered.
