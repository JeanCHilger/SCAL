Activation of protease-activated receptor 2 stimulates proliferation and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 secretion of endometriotic stromal cells. Inflammation has been proposed to play essential roles in the pathophysiology of endometriosis, in which neutrophils and mast cells have been suggested to be involved. We studied whether the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), which is activated by enzymes from neutrophils and mast cells, in endometriotic stromal cells (ESC) has any implication in the development of the disease.Cultured ESC were stimulated with various concentrations of a specific PAR2 agonist peptide. Proliferating activity of the cells was determined using immunostaining of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (a cell proliferation marker), 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA and cell count. The concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 were measured using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The phosphorylation of three mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), i.e. p38 MAPK, p42/44 MAPK and stress-activated protein Kinase/c-jun N terminal Kinase, in ESC was examined with Western blot analysis.Activation of PAR2 stimulated the proliferation of ESC and the secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 from ESC in a dose-dependent manner. Activation of PAR2 stimulated the phosphorylation of all three MAPK, and inhibitors of each MAPK suppressed the PAR2 activation-induced proliferation of ESC.The activation of PAR2 in ESC may be involved in the pathophysiology of endometriosis by inducing the growth and inflammation of endometriotic lesions.
