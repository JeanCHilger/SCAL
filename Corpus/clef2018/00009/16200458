Endometriotic cells exhibit metaplastic change and oxidative DNA damage as well as decreased function, compared to normal endometrium. A widely accepted theory of the etiology of endometriosis is that it originates from the implantation and invasion of cells from retrograde menstruation to various sites in the body particularly the pelvic peritoneal cavity. Little is known of the function of these cells in ectopic sites. Normal endometrium was compared with endometriotic tissue using an antibody to Placental Cadherin (P Cadherin), a recently studied cadherin that is implicated in metaplasia and early neoplasia and also 8-hydroxyguanine, an indicator of oxidative DNA damage. Comparisons of endometrial tissue function were made using expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFbeta-1) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). There was no labelling for anti-P Cadherin or anti-8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine in normal endometrium but marked labelling for both on the apical surface of the endometriotic epithelium. Studies of markers of normal endometrial function were all de-expressed in endometriosis. This study indicates that endometriosis cells are abnormal and exhibit oxidative DNA damage, metaplasia and markedly reduced function compared to normal endometrium.
