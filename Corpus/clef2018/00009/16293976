Allelic loss at TP53 is not related to p53 protein overexpression in primary human endometrial carcinomas. We examined loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the TP53 gene in primary human endometrial carcinomas (EC), and investigated the relationship between allelic loss, p53 protein overexpression, pRb-1 pathway alterations and MIB-1 proliferative activity. Applying the non-isotopic PCR-RFLP/VNTR-silver staining techniques, we investigated TP53 LOH in 46 tumors at four polymorphic loci. Out of 42 informative carcinomas, LOH was found in 19% of the cases studied. In general, there was no significant relationship between LOH and the clinical and pathological variables of cancer, including patient age, clinical stage, histological grade or depth of myometrial invasion. Interestingly, none of 7 tumors associated with hyperplasia revealed allelic imbalance, whereas 8 of 27 (30%) tumors without hyperplasia exhibited LOH (p=0.312 Fisher's exact test). Overexpression of nuclear p53 was not correlated with allelic loss at TP53 (p=0.336, Fisher's exact test). It is worth pointing out that p53 immunoreactivity was significantly related to proliferative activity of cancer (R=0.42, p=0.0037
