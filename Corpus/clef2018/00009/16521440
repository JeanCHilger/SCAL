Complex and not definitively recognized etiopathogenesis, impedes diagnostic progress and effective treatment. Frequent incidence of endometriosis in reproductive age and high percentage of the illness in the group of patients with infertility, both determine the importance of that issue. The article below presents the latest lines of research on efficient therapeutical scheme, covering reproductive abilities. Attempts of implementation of aromatase inhibitors, selective estrogen receptor modulators, immunomodulators and antiinflammatory agents have been described. Considering groups of medicines mentioned in the article, the outcome of examination using aromatase inhibitors, immunomodulators mainly IL-2, INF-alpha-2b, as well as antiinflammatory agents--recombinant human TNF binding protein-1, seem to be most encouraging. Part of the survey was conducted on animal models therefore it requires verification of usefulness and effectiveness on people. The results are very promising, they set the trend of future research aimed at application of modern and efficient treatment of endometriosis.
