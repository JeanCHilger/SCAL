Umbilical endometriosis in a 45 year old Nigerian grandmultipara. A case of a 45 year old grandmultipara seen at our gynaecological clinic in October 2002 with a 5 month history of cyclical umbilical pain and swelling is presented. There was no prior history of abdominal or pelvic surgery. Umbilical lesion was excised and subjected to histological examination. This revealed umbilical endometriosis. Umbilical endometriosis is rare. The optimum treatment is surgical excision. It has been acknowledged that lack of awareness and facilities for diagnosis may contribute to its rarity. We recommend that gynaecologist should have an increased index of suspicion for this condition and send tissues of umbilical mass for histology.
