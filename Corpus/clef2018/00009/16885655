Management of ovarian endometrioma. The optimal conservative treatment for endometriotic cysts is unclear, particularly when treated laparoscopically. We performed a systematic analysis of the published literature on ovarian endometrioma especially focused on comparing laparoscopic cystectomy with laparoscopic drainage and coagulation of the cyst with regard to evaluating advantage and disadvantage of each method. We observed that cystectomy was superior in terms of risk of recurrent symptoms, cyst, reoperation, pregnancy: this was true in both prospective and retrospective studies previously published. Given the evidence available, excision of cyst wall in endometrioma is strongly recommended especially in infertile patients.
