Antiangiogenic therapies in endometriosis. Oral contraceptives, androgenic agents, progestins and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues have all been successfully used in the treatment of endometriosis. However, none of these drugs can eradicate the disease. It is widely accepted that the growth of newly formed blood vessels is essential for the establishment and growth of endometriotic lesions therefore, inhibition of angiogenesis may offer a new option for treatment of this disorder. In this paper, we reviewed anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents and other angiostatic drugs (i.e., TNP470, endostatin, anginex, rapamycin) that have been studied in laboratory and animal models of endometriosis. Although preliminary results are interesting, further investigations are required before clinical trials can be planned in humans.
