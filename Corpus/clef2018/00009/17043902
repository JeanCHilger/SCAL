Scar endometriosis - a gynaecologic pathology often presented to the general surgeon rather than the gynaecologist: report of two cases. Scar endometriosis develops in and is adjacent to surgical scars at the site of previous abdominal operations. The most frequent clinical presentation of the disease is that of a palpable subcutaneous mass near surgical scars associated with cyclic pain and swelling during menses. Endometriosis of the surgical scar is often referred to the general surgeons because the clinical presentation suggests an incisional hernia or other conditions related to the general surgery. Cyclical symptoms such as pain and swelling, in relation to surgical scars, which worsen at the time of menstruation, are nearly pathognomonic of scar endometriosis. However, often the diagnosis of endometriosis is not suggested until after histology has been performed.We present two cases of cutaneous endometriosis that has occurred on the site of previous cesarean section scar area.
