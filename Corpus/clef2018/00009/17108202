PLAC1 mRNA in maternal blood correlates with Doppler waveform in uterine arteries in normal pregnancies at the second and third trimester. Doppler analysis of the uterine arteries is currently used for pre-eclampsia (PE) screening. PLAC1 is a trophoblast-specific gene, and it is known that in normal pregnancies, trophoblastic cells are released into the maternal circulation, where specific trophoblastic mRNA can be detected. In PE, as in women who eventually develop PE, an abnormal passage of fetal and placental cells is also present. In this study, we aimed to verify whether, in normal pregnancies, Doppler waveform of the uterine arteries correlates with PLAC1 mRNA concentrations. Thirteen cases of normal pregnancies at 37 weeks' gestation (23-41) were enrolled in the study. PLAC1 mRNA was extracted from 2 mL of blood by ABI PRISM 6100 nucleic acid Prep Station (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed by a PE 5700 Sequence detection system. Bulk RNA from normal placental tissue was used as the reference curve, and the amount of PLAC1 mRNA in the study samples was then expressed as the "relative amount" of weight of placental tissue (ng/mL). The uterine arterial mean resistance index (RI) and presence/absence of a dicrote waveform were calculated by using a 5 MHz transabdominal probe (Tecnos, ESAOTE) at the uterine cervico-corporal junction. Doppler measurement was performed on the same day as blood collection. The median of the means of uterine arterial RI was 0.52 (0.39-0.68). RI of uterine arteries and PLAC1 mRNA were significantly correlated in a log-linear regression (R(2) = 0.483, P = 0.024). Our data support that in normal pregnancy, the passage of trophoblast material into the maternal circulation is correlated with the quantitative measurement of uterine hemodynamics.
