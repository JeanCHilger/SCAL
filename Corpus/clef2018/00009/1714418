Primary clear cell carcinoma of the peritoneum. A case of primary clear cell carcinoma of the pelvic and abdominal peritoneum which occurred in a 67-year-old woman and with histological characteristics of Mullerian derivation is presented. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a case. Although clear cell carcinomas have been previously described in peritoneal or retroperitoneal locations, these have been mass lesions thought to arise from endometriosis. All other cases of diffuse primary peritoneal adenocarcinomas have been of the serous type.
