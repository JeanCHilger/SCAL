CA54/61 as a marker for epithelial ovarian cancer. Using a new one-step, double-determinant enzyme immunoassay, we performed quantitative measurements of a mucin-type glycoprotein antigen (CA54/61) that we recently detected in sera of ovarian carcinoma patients. When the cutoff value was set at 12 units/ml, at which a high diagnostic efficiency was demonstrated [or at 20 units/ml (mean + 3 SD of healthy females)], the positive rates of ovarian serous, mucinous, clear cell, and endometrioid carcinomas were 76% (or 63%), 63% (or 55%), 57% (or 52%), and 50% (or 38%), respectively. Even in mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, more than one-half of the cases were positive, indicating the potential utility of the assay in the diagnosis of mucinous tumors. In sera from patients with benign ovarian tumors, only 9% (or 4%) of the cases were positive, indicating the quite high specificity of this test for ovarian carcinomas. To make a comparison between CA54/61 and CA125, we set the cutoff level of CA125 at 110 units/ml, at which value a high diagnostic efficiency was demonstrated [or at 35 units/ml (mean + 3 SD of healthy females)]. When both CA54/61 and CA125 were assessed in sera from 36 patients with mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, the positive rates of CA54/61 and CA125 were 64% (or 56%) and 36% (or 56%), respectively, suggesting that CA54/61 is of clinical value as a new tumor marker for ovarian cancers, including mucinous tumors.
