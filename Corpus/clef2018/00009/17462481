The emerging presence of interstitial cystitis in gynecologic patients with chronic pelvic pain. Emerging data are changing the pelvic pain paradigm for gynecologic patients. Historically, interstitial cystitis (IC) was rarely considered as a cause of chronic pelvic pain (CPP), but recent data suggest that IC is a common cause of CPP in gynecologic patients and perhaps is even the most common cause. It is important to consider the bladder as a generator of symptoms early in the evaluation of the gynecologic patient with CPP. New tools have been developed to aid the gynecologist in ruling out IC in patients with CPP, including a new IC symptom questionnaire and the Potassium Sensitivity Test (PST). By determining whether the pain is of bladder origin, the physician can more successfully treat the patient with CPP.
