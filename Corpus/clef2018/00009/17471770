Pelvic inflammatory disease and an abscessed endometriosis cyst: a diagnostic problem and a therapeutic dilemma. A 52-year-old woman with known endometriosis was treated with a levonorgestrel-containing IUD for irregular vaginal blood loss. Two weeks later she was admitted with signs ofpelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and was treated with antibiotics. As no clinical improvement ensued, laparoscopy was performed which demonstrated an infected endometriosis cyst in her right ovary. Ovariectomy was performed. In a 29-year-old woman with a symptomatic endometriosis cyst in the right ovary, PID was also suspected. After an initially good response to antibiotic therapy her condition deteriorated. Laparotomy revealed an infected endometriosis cyst. It was drained with subsequent cystectomy. A third, 43-year-old, woman with known endometriosis was admitted with signs of PID. Although she had a good clinical response to antibiotic therapy, her C-reactive protein (CRP) level remained elevated. Diagnostic laparoscopy demonstrated a large abscess in the right ovary. Ovariectomy was performed. Histology showed signs of an infected endometriosis cyst. All these women presented with PID and, in addition, a cystic adnexal mass on ultrasonography. The incidence oftubo-ovarian and ovarian abscesses is higher in the presence of an endometriosis cyst. Irrespective of the presence of an endometriosis cyst, antibiotics should be the first line of treatment. Reduction in the size of the abscess is not a useful parameter for monitoring conservative treatment when an infected endometriosis cyst is present. If it is decided to perform surgery on the infected endometriosis cyst, drainage of the abscess is usually not sufficient: excision of the endometriosis cyst is the only adequate therapy.
