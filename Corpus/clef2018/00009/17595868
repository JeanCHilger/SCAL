Morphogenesis and differentiation of the female genital tract. Genetic determinism and epithelium-stromal interactions. The epithelium-stromal interaction is important in the process of morphogenesis, differentiation, and hormone response, in female genital tract. This review is organized in four sections: i) female genital tract morphogenesis, based on genetic determinism ii) hormonal control of endometrial proliferation
