Pelvic endometriosis with urinary and digestive involvement. Apropos of 7 cases. Seven cases of pelvic endometriosis of the urinary or digestive tracts are reported: 4 cases of vesical endometriosis, 1 case of ureteral involvement, 1 rectal case and 1 sigmoid location. The authors point out the difficulty of the clinical preoperative diagnosis--in despite of cyclic troubles--and underline the interest of complementary explorations performed at the time of periods: ultrasound, cystoscopy, rectosigmo√Ødoscopy and coelioscopy. The MR imaging, showing high intensity a T1-weighted images and prominent high intensity on T2-weighted images, is very suggestive of an endometrial lesions. A joint medical and surgical treatment is required. Endoscopic excision, endoprothetic tube, excision-suture, resection-anastomosis and a complementary medical treatment using Danazol, Decapeptyl or progestational agents have to be proposed. Per-operative microscopy is advised as routine procedure in order to avoid excessive surgery.
