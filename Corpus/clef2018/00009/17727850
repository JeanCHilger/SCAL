Prolonged stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced partial methylation at PR-B promoter in immortalized epithelial-like endometriotic cells. The promoter of P receptor isoform B (PR-B) has recently been shown to be hypermethylated in endometriotic tissues, but one question remains as what causes the aberrant methylation. We show that sustained stimulation of an epithelial-like endometriotic cell line with tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulation for 30 days induced partial methylation in the promoter region of PR-B with concomitant reduction of PR-B expression.
