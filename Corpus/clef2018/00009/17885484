CD10 expression in pure stromal and sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary: an immunohistochemical analysis of 101 cases. CD10 has been recently advocated as a good immunohistochemical marker for endometrial stromal tumors. Metastatic endometrial stromal tumors to the ovary and primary endometrioid stromal sarcomas may show overlapping histological features with pure stromal and sex cord-stromal tumors (SCSTs). We investigated CD10 expression in a large series of pure stromal and SCSTs of the ovary to ascertain whether CD10 may aid in this differential diagnosis. Archival material from 11 fibromas, 10 thecomas, 10 sclerosing stromal tumors (SSTs), 10 adult granulosa cell tumors (AGCTs), 4 luteinized AGCTs, 9 juvenile granulosa cell tumors (JGCTs), 9 Sertoli cell tumors, 9 Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, 11 sex cord tumors with annular tubules, 10 steroid cell tumors (StCTs), and 8 fibrosarcomas of the ovary were immunostained for CD10. The percentage of cells stained (<5%, 5%-39%, 40%-75%, and >75%) and intensity of staining (1+, 2+, 3+) were evaluated. CD10 was expressed in 7 of 10 thecomas (4 with 5%-75% and mostly 1+), 9 of 10 SSTs (7 with 5%-39% + cells, mostly 1+), 9 of 10 AGCTs (<5%-39%, four 1+, five 2+), 1 of 4 luteinized AGCTs (<5% and 1+), 8 of 9 JGCTs (mostly <5% to 39% and +1), 4 of 9 Sertoli cell tumors (either focal or >75% with variable intensity), 4 of 9 Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (mostly <10% with variable staining), with the Leydig cells being positive in only 1 tumor (1+ and <5%), and 7 of 10 StCTs (4 tumors with more than 75% + cells, from 1+ to 3+). All fibromas, all but 1 fibrosarcoma (<5% and 1+), and all sex cord tumors with annular tubules were CD10 negative. CD10 expression was frequently seen in StCTs, SSTs, and thecomas of the ovary, although the latter 2 categories usually showed only faint immunoreactivity. In conclusion the frequency and intensity of CD10 immunoreactivity in pure stromal and sex cord-stromal ovarian tumors are low and contrast with the typical strong and diffuse immunostaining seen in endometrial stromal tumors however, faint CD10 positivity is consistent with the diagnosis of ovarian SCST. Steroid cell tumors are often positive for CD10, but these tumors do not pose problems in differential diagnosis with endometrial stromal tumors. CD10 may play a useful role in aiding the differential between endometrial stromal tumors in the ovary and SCST and stromal tumors.
