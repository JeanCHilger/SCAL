Cranial thromboembolism secondary to patent foramen ovale and deep venous thrombosis after cesarean section. Paradoxical embolism via a patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a rare event in the puerperium as a cause of stroke.We report a 21-year-old, G4P3A1 woman with the symptoms of convulsion, stroke and unconsciousness 1 week after cesarean delivery. An infarction was detected in both frontal lobes, and echocardiography and MRI confirmed the PFO. Her follow-up course with low-molecular-weight heparin and then warfarin for 6 months was uneventful.Patients with an unexplained arterial event should be screened for PFO and possible paradoxical embolism.
