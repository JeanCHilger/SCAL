Treatment of endometriosis in Danish hospitals. Endometriosis is a chronic disease. The prevalence is difficult to define, but is estimated to be around 10%. Among women with chronic pelvic pain and infertility, the prevalence is considerably higher.All patients registered by the National Board of Health with the diagnosis of endometriosis treated in Danish Hospitals in the period 1997-2005 were evaluated.The number of women referred to Danish hospitals with endometriosis almost doubled during the period 1997-2005, probably reflecting the increased focus on the disease. The number of patients with endometriosis in the rectovaginal septum more than tripled from 2000-2005 and 2/3 of these patients were treated at the two Danish centres of excellence. The number of patients with ovarian endometriosis has been relatively stable over the years. The risk of laparotomy in surgery for endometriosis was 6% 2005 in the two centres of excellence and 14.4% in other Danish hospitals.Increased focus on endometriosis reflected by more patients referred to Danish hospitals. An increasing number of patients with severe endometriosis are referred to the centres of excellence although 1/3 of patients with endometriosis in the rectovaginal septum are still treated outside the centres with special surgical skills in endometriosis. Internationally, it is generally agreed that surgery for endometriosis should be done by laparoscopy and in Denmark the risk for laparotomy in the centres of excellence is only 6%.
