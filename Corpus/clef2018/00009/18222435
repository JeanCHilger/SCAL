Follicular-fluid neurotrophin levels in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology for different etiologies of infertility. To determine follicular-fluid neurotrophin levels in women undergoing assisted reproductive techniques for different etiologies of infertility.Prospective observational study.Academically affiliated assisted reproductive techniques unit.One hundred six patients undergoing an IVF cycle for different etiologies of infertility.Assessment of follicular fluid for neurotrophins.Follicular-fluid neurotrophin concentrations.Women with a history of endometriosis have significantly lower follicular-fluid brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels compared with women with male-factor (control) infertility. Women with diminished ovarian reserve have significantly higher levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) compared with women with male-factor infertility. Follicular-fluid BDNF levels tend to be lower in patients with endometriosis and diminished ovarian reserve and to be higher in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Interestingly, NGF concentrations follow the opposite trend. Finally, follicular-fluid NT-3 concentrations are similar in women with different etiologies of infertility.Endometriosis is associated with low follicular-fluid BDNF levels, and diminished ovarian reserve is associated with increased follicular-fluid NGF levels.
