Endometrial patterns during danazol and cyproterone acetate treatment for endometriosis: structural and ultrastructural study. We studied the endometrial structure and ultrastructure in serial biopsies from 16 patients with endometriosis treated with danazol (n = 9) or the combination cyproterone acetate plus ethinyl estradiol (n = 7) for 6 months. Biopsies were performed before and at 3 and 6 months of treatment. The material obtained was studied by light (LM), scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A morphometric analysis was performed evaluating three morphometric and three stereologic indices. The results indicate that danazol had a progestational effect on endometrial glands and stroma, associated with a marked hypotrophy of the mucosa. The cyproterone acetate/ethinyl estradiol combination induced progressive atrophy of the endometrium with an increase in the stromal component and a reduction of glandular tissue.
