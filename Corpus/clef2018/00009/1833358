The influence of laparoscopy on infertility management. In 1983, we reported on the role of laparoscopy in the Infertility Clinic at the Rotunda Hospital. We now present the current position and the effect of a laparoscopic investigation on subsequent patient management. At laparoscopy, 31% of patients had evidence of pelvic inflammatory disease and 5% had endometriosis. Management was altered in 39 (43%) patients. When reviewed, 14 (23%) patients had conceived, 5 patients without medical intervention and more patients with secondary infertility. The incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease is increased and of endometriosis is unchanged from the previous report.
