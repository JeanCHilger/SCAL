Myomectomy by laparoscopy: a preliminary report of 43 cases. To evaluate the technique and short-term results of intraperitoneal (IP) myomectomies.From January 1, 1990, to March 1, 1991, IP myomectomies were performed in all cases in which it appeared feasible.This study was conducted in a tertiary care center, the Port-Royal University Hospital.Among 49 consecutive patients with interstitial or subserous myomas, 6 patients with voluminous, multiple myomas had laparotomies. Intraperitoneal myomectomy was performed in 43 patients. The indication for laparoscopy was a pelvic mass in 29 cases, infertility in 13, and severe endometriosis in 1 case.Thermocoagulation or monopolar coagulation was used for the uterine incision. Myometrium and serosa were sutured in 23 of 43 patients. Myomas were removed through the suprapubic puncture site after fragmentation of large myomas.We evaluated the length of the procedures, blood loss, and postoperative course.Ninety-two myomas were removed laparoscopically. No complication was observed.In selected cases, IP myomectomy appears to be a safe technique with the advantages of laparoscopic surgery.
