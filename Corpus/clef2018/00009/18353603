Internal jugular venous thrombosis after in vitro fertilization. Internal jugular vein thrombosis is an uncommon entity with high morbidity and an increased risk of mortality. Spontaneous clotting of the internal jugular vein without any known risk factors is virtually unheard of, and intravenous drug use is the most common cause for thrombosis. Assisted reproductive techniques alone or in conjunction with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome seem to predispose patients for thrombosis of the internal jugular vein. We present the case of a patient who, after in vitro fertilization, developed ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and clotted the internal jugular vein. In the setting of the Emergency Department, the norm should be to "rule out internal jugular venous thrombosis" in pregnant patients who have undergone in vitro fertilization and present with neck pain, with or without swelling or distended collaterals.
