Pelviscopy. Pelviscopy, along with the entire concept of minimally invasive surgery through endoscopically guided intra-abdominal surgery, has become a mainstay in gynecologic surgery. The review of instrumentation in this field includes comments on the CO2-Aqua-Purator, CO2 insufflator, round-grip instruments, electrocautery, endocoagulator, and lasers. Detailed procedural descriptions are given of visually controlled peritoneal perforation and second-look pelviscopic procedures are given in the second section, and the final section covers the role of pelviscopy in the treatment of endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and pelvic inflammatory disease.
