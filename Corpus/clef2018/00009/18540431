Endometrial pathomorphology in bacterial vaginosis associated with chronic endometritis. A complex morphological and morphometric study was used to examine endometrial biopsy specimens from 133 patients with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Chronic endometritis (CE) was detected in 100% of them. The morphological components of CE in BV were significant dystrophic changes in integumentary endotheliocytes and glandular cells, differently pronounced polymorphocellular infiltration of the uterine mucosa with signs of tissue lymphopenia, as well as stromal and vascular fibroblastic changes with the decreased volume density of the endometrial integumentary endothelium, lower relative volumes of glands, and increased relative volume of connective tissue. The characteristic structural changes for CE and BV are intensive processes of apoptosis of the uterine mucosal epithelium in the presence of its slight proliferative activity, which determines progressive endometrial atrophy and may contribute to non-developing pregnancy. As this takes place, discrinism occurs in the uterine mucosa, mainly as inadequate progesterone reception of endometrial target cells, which leads to uterine gland dysfunction and may also cause fetal depletion syndrome.
