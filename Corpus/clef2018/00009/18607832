MMP-2, TIMP-1, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin expression in endometrial serous carcinoma compared with low-grade endometrial endometrioid carcinoma and proliferative endometrium. To investigate the expression of MMP-2, TIMP-1, E-cadherin and beta-catenin in endometrial serous carcinoma (ESC), low-grade endometrial endometrioid carcinoma (EEC), and proliferative endometrium.We performed an immunohistochemical study on 14 cases of ESC, 15 cases of low-grade EEC, and 10 cases of proliferative endometrium.Compared with low-grade EEC, ESC showed significantly increased MMP-2 and TIMP-1 expression, as well as decreased membranous beta-catenin staining. E-cadherin expression was significantly lower in ESC and EEC as compared with proliferative endometrium.We suggest that MMP-2 and TIMP-1 expression and loss of beta-catenin have a role in the pathogenesis and progression of ESC. Decreased E-cadherin may have an important role in the development of both ESC and EEC. Furthermore, the dissimilarities in MMP-2, TIMP-1, E-cadherin and beta-catenin expressions in ESC compared with EEC may be responsible, along with other factors, for their different biological behavior.
