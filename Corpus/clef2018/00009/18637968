Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia is associated with polyps and frequently has metaplastic change. Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) is a monoclonal precursor to endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma characterized by a geographic cluster of crowded glands with epithelial cytology altered relative to the background. It may demonstrate epithelial metaplastic changes, or arise within polyps, but the frequencies of these features as encountered in practice is unknown. The aim was to report the epithelial differentiation state and polyp context of 83 sequential EIN lesions diagnosed over a 2-year period.EIN is a rare lesion, seen in only 1.4% of endometrial biopsy specimens in a busy hospital-based practice. Of 83 EIN cases, 39 contained metaplastic changes (18% squamous morular, 14% tubal secretory and 5% each of secretory, mucinous or ciliated change). Endometrial polyps were more likely (odds ratio 5.2, P < 0.001) to occur in the endometrial biopsy specimens of women with EIN lesions (43.3%), compared with the background polyp rate (12.9%) of comparable specimens from the same patient population.Non-endometrioid differentiation and occurrence within polyps are frequent presentations of EIN lesions. Possible mechanisms of polyp association with EIN include: non-shedding of polyp tissue creating a shelter for persistence of pre-existing neoplastic glands, or promotion of premalignant glandular clones by unique polyp stroma.
