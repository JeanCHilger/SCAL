Expression of class I histone deacetylases indicates poor prognosis in endometrioid subtypes of ovarian and endometrial carcinomas. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are an emerging class of targeted cancer therapeutics, and little is known about HDAC expression in gynecologic malignancies. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis whether high-level expression of class 1 HDACs (HDAC1, 2, and 3) is associated with clinically distinct subsets of ovarian and endometrial carcinomas. Expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in a population-based cohort of 465 ovarian and 149 endometrial carcinomas and correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. Each of the HDACs was expressed at high levels in most ovarian (HDAC1, 61% HDAC2, 93%
