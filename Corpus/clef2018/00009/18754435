Association between susceptibility of endometriosis and the gene polymorphism of tumor necrosis factor. To evaluate the association between the susceptibility of endometriosis (EMS) and the gene polymorphism of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in Chinese Han population.Peripheral blood samples were collected from 76 EMS patients and 87 normal controls. PCR-RFLP was used to detect the single base change polymorphism in both TNFalpha gene and TNFbeta gene.The allele frequencies of the TNFalpha polymorphism were 0.9474 and 0.9253 in the EMS patients and the control group respectively, and the TNFbeta polymorphism were 0.0526 and 0.0747 respectively. The allele frequencies of the TNFbeta1 polymorphism were 0.4605 and 0.5115 in the EMS patients and the control group, and the TNFbeta2 polymorphism were 0.5395 and 0.4885. No difference in the gene and genotype frequencies of TNFalpha and TNFbeta was noted in the EMS patients and normal controls (all P > 0.05).TNF gene polymorphism has no effect on EMS in Chinese Han population. Ethnic difference may exist in TNF allele frequency.
