Correlation between laparoscopic and histological diagnosis in patients with endometriosis. This is a study to detect the correlation between laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis and histological findings. It is a retrospective study of 63 patients undergoing laparoscopy for pelvic pain at the University Hospital of North Durham, of whom 48 had excision of endometriosis. Scissors and graspers were used to dissect suspected endometriotic lesions laparoscopically. The tissues obtained were examined at the histology department to confirm the diagnosis. Positive histology for endometriosis was confirmed in 75% of cases, the histology was negative in 18.7% and in 6.3% was non-diagnostic. The study confirmed that correlation between laparoscopic findings and positive histology was dependent on the site of lesion and the stage of endometriosis. As more information was provided to the laboratory and as the pathologists became accustomed to looking for the disease, there was a higher detection of endometriosis.
