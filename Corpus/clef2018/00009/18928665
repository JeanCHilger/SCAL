Uterine papillary serous carcinoma: state of the state. Uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) is an aggressive form of endometrial cancer that is likely to present with deep myometrial invasion and lymph vascular involvement. By the time most affected women are diagnosed, the UPSC has spread outside the uterus. Because many reports include patients who are not completely staged, the risk of recurrence in stage I patients has likely been overestimated. Recently, several large series of well-staged patients have demonstrated that survival in stage I patients is similar to that of poorly differentiated endometrioid tumors. Because of the high risk of extrauterine spread, all patients with UPSC should have an extended surgical staging procedure, including lymphadenectomy and omentectomy. Chemotherapy with or without local or regional radiation is probably the most effective adjuvant therapy in both early and advanced disease. Because patients with stage I UPSC are still at significant risk of recurrence, adjuvant therapy is often recommended for all patients. It has been difficult to conduct prospective randomized trials for patients with UPSC because of the rare nature of these cancers.
