Molecular pathology of endometrial carcinoma: practical aspects from the diagnostic and therapeutic viewpoints. This article reviews the main molecular alterations involved in endometrial carcinoma. Five molecular features (microsatellite instability, and mutations in the PTEN, k-RAS, PIK3CA and beta-catenin genes) are characteristic of endometrioid carcinomas, whereas non-endometrioid carcinomas show alterations of p53, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on several chromosomes, as well as other molecular alterations (STK15, p16, E-cadherin and C-erb B2). The review also covers the phenomenon of apoptosis resistance, as well as the results obtained from cDNA array studies, and the perspectives for targeted therapies. A group of practical applications of molecular pathology techniques are also mentioned: diagnosis of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer syndrome in patients with endometrial carcinoma evaluation of precursor lesions
