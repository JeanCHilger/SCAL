Combination of CCR1 mRNA, MCP1, and CA125 measurements in peripheral blood as a diagnostic test for endometriosis. This study investigated the possible use of CCR1 mRNA measurement in peripheral blood leukocytes in combination with measurements of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and CA125 protein in serum as a diagnostic test for endometriosis.The expression of CCR1 mRNA in peripheral blood leukocytes was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. MCP-1 and CA125 levels in serum were determined by ELISA and ECLIA.The ratio of CCR1/HPRT mRNA in peripheral blood of patients with endometriosis and adenomyosis was significantly elevated compared with women without endometriosis. Additionally, serum levels of MCP-1 and CA125 were significantly higher in patients with endometriosis. This method showed a sensitivity of 92.2%, a specificity of 81.6%, a negative predictive value of 83.3%, a positive predictive value of 92.3%, a likelihood ratio of a positive test result of 5.017, and a likelihood ratio of a negative test result of 0.096 to predict the presence or absence of endometriosis.The results imply the potential use of CCR1 mRNA, MCP-1, and CA125 protein measurements for the diagnosis or exclusion of endometriosis.
