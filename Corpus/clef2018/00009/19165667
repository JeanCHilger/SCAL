Doppler measurement of renal interlobar vein impedance index in uncomplicated and preeclamptic pregnancies. To define normal values of Renal interlobar vein impedance index (RIVI) throughout gestation, as a reference to RIVI in preeclampsia (PE).Longitudinal evaluation of 20 uncomplicated pregnancies (UP) by standard renal duplex scan, every 4 weeks during pregnancy and postpartum. Comparison of RIVI between 40 PE and UP, and plotting of PE values against the normal reference range at corresponding gestation.In PE, RIVI is significantly higher than in UP, the difference being larger at the left side and in cases of preeclampsia remote from term.Increase of RIVI in women with PE is gestation-dependant.
