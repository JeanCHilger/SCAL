Xanthogranulomatous salpingitis: report of three cases and comparison with a case of pseudoxanthomatous salpingitis. Xanthogranulomatous inflammation, an uncommon form of chronic inflammation, has been described in several organs including those of the female genital tract. A rare condition described as pseudoxanthomatous salpingitis or pseudoxanthomatous salpingiosis, which is often associated with endometriosis, has been distinguished from xanthogranulomatous inflammation of the fallopian tube based on its histological features. In the present report three cases of xanthogranulomatous salpingitis and one case of pseudoxanthomatous salpingitis are presented and their clinical, pathological and histochemical features are compared.
