Five years survival in patients with endometrioid ovarian cancer versus patients with serous ovarian cancer. The ovarian cancer is the most malignant disease from all oncogynecological localizations. There are different scientific opinions whether the different histological types have different prognosis and survival. The aim of our research work was to evaluate if the endometrioid cancer of the ovary has a different prognosis from the serous ovarian cancer.84 patients were evaluated for five years period from 2003 till 2008. The patients with endometrioid ovarian cancer (42) were matched with the patients with serous ovarian cancer (42). They were matched for age, grading,stage, and level of cytoreduction.84 patients (42 with endometrioid cancer and 42 with serous ovarian cancer) were evaluated for 5 years period. The five years survival of the patients with endometrioid ovarian cancer was 62% while the five years survival for patients with serous ovarian cancer was 72%. In patients with endometrioid ovarian cancer the mean survival rate was 58 months, and for patients with serous ovarian cancer 70 months (P=0.30). The estrogen receptor levels were not statistically significant between the two groups (P=0.110), while the progesteron receptor levels were statistically different (P<0.002).In patients with endometrioid and serous ovarian cancer, while taking into consideration the age, grading, stage and level of cytoreduction--there is no difference for the five years survival or the length of survival.
