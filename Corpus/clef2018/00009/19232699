Sentinel lymph node mapping for grade 1 endometrial cancer: is it the answer to the surgical staging dilemma? To describe the accuracy of SLN mapping in patients with a preoperative diagnosis of grade 1 endometrial cancer.A prospective, non-randomized study of women with a preoperative diagnosis of endometrial cancer and clinical stage I disease was conducted. A subset analysis of patients with a preoperative diagnosis of grade 1 endometrial endometrioid cancer was performed. All patients had preoperative lymphoscintigraphy with Tc99m on the day of or day before surgery followed by an intraoperative injection of 2 cm(3) of isosulfan or methylene blue dye deep into the cervix or both cervix and fundus. All patients underwent hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and regional nodal dissection. Hot and/or blue nodes were labeled as SLNs and sent for histopathological analysis.Forty-two patients with a preoperative diagnosis of grade 1 endometrial carcinoma treated from 3/06 to 8/08 were identified. Twenty-five (60%) had laparoscopic surgery 17 (40%) were treated by laparotomy. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy visualized SLNs in 30 patients (71%)Sentinel lymph node mapping using a cervical injection with combined Tc and blue dye is feasible and accurate in patients with grade 1 endometrial cancer and may be a reasonable option for this select group of patients. Regional lymphadenectomy remains the gold standard in many practices, particularly for the approximately 15% of cases with failed SLN mapping.
