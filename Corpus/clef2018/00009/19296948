Immunoreactivity of progesterone receptor isoform B, nuclear factor kappaB, and IkappaBalpha in adenomyosis. Compared with normal endometrium, progesterone receptor isoform B (PR-B) and IkappaBalpha immunoreactivity were statistically significantly reduced in ectopic as well as eutopic endometrium from women with adenomyosis while nuclear p65, p50, and p52 immunoreactivity were statistically significantly increased in ectopic and eutopic endometrium. Nuclear p65 immunoreactivity was positively associated with heavier menses, and decreased PR-B and increased nuclear p65 immunoreactivity in ectopic endometrium were statistically significantly associated with the severity of dysmenorrhea in women with adenomyosis.
