Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in VEGF gene with the risk of endometriosis and adenomyosis. To investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGF gene with the risk of endometriosis and adenomyosis.Genotypes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method in 344 endometriosis patients, 174 adenomyosis patients, 360 frequency-matched control women of endometriosis and 199 frequency-matched control women of adenomyosis.No significant difference was found in allele frequencies and genotype distributions of the -460C/T polymorphism between patients (endometriosis and adenomyosis) and control women (all P value > 0.05). However, there were significant differences in genotype and allele distributions of the VEGF -1154G/A polymorphism between patients (endometriosis and adenomyosis) and control women (all P value < 0.05). The genotype frequencies of the VEGF -1154 AA, GA, and GG in endometriosis patients and control women were 1.7%, 28.8%, 69.5% and 5.8%, 32.8%, 61.4%, respectively and the A and G allele frequencies in the two groups were 16.1%, 83.9% and 22.2%, 77.8%, respectively. The genotype frequencies of the VEGF -1154 AA, GA, and GG in adenomyosis patients and control women were 2.9%, 23.6%, 73.6% and 7.0%, 34.2%, 58.8%, respectivelyThe VEGF -1154G/A polymorphism was associated with susceptibility to endometriosis and adenomyosis, and the GG genotype could significantly increase the risk of developing endometriosis and adenomyosis. However, the VEGF -460C/T polymorphism was not associated with susceptibility to endometriosis and adenomyosis in the population studied.
