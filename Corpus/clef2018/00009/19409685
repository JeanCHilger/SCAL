Differentiating interstitial cystitis from similar conditions commonly seen in gynecologic practice. Interstitial cystitis is a syndrome characterized by pelvic pain, urinary urgency/frequency, nocturia, and dyspareunia, with no other identifiable etiology. The clinical presentation of interstitial cystitis is similar to that of many other conditions commonly seen in female patients, including recurrent urinary tract infections, endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain, vulvodynia, and overactive bladder. In addition, interstitial cystitis may exist concurrently with these conditions. Correct diagnosis is necessary for appropriate treatment and improved outcomes. Tools to assist in the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis, as well as effective therapies for this condition, are available. A diagnosis of interstitial cystitis should be considered in patients with irritative voiding symptoms and/or pelvic pain complaints.
