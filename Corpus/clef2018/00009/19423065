Comparative study of the neuropeptide-Y sympathetic nerves in endometriotic involved and noninvolved sacrouterine ligaments in women with pelvic endometriosis. To show the relationship between the neuropeptide-Y pelvic sympathetic nerves and neoangiogenesis in the development of endometriosisProspective study.Academic community teaching hospital.Fifteen consecutive women with unilateral endometriotic infiltration of the sacrouterine ligaments.A laparoscopic excision/biopsy of involved and noninvolved parts of the sacrouterine ligaments were taken. The sections were incubated with the neuronal marker rabbit polyclonal anti-protein gene product 9.5 and rabbit polyclonal anti-neuropeptide-Y. We made a comparative study on the distribution of nerve fibers and their relationship to the vessels on intact and endometriotic involved tissue.The results show that a large amount of nerves are present around the blood vessels in the endometriosis samples, and a large number of these nerves are neuropeptide-Y sympathetic nerves. Adrenergic fibers are also present in the intact control subjects, however, in significantly smaller amounts.This finding shows a strong relationship between the neuropeptide-Y sympathetic pelvic nerves and the neoangiogenesis required for the development of endometriosis.
