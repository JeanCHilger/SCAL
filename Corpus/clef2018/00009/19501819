Association between patient age at the time of surgical treatment for endometriosis and aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor polymorphism. A cross-sectional comparative study among women who underwent surgical treatment for endometriosis revealed that frequency of the Ala/Ala genotype at aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) Pro185Ala polymorphism was three times higher (27.6% vs. 9.9%) in the younger group (<or=30 years) than in the older group (>30 years). AHHR genotyping may help to identify a subpopulation of women who are susceptible to the earlier onset of endometriosis.
