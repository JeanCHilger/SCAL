Relationship between IL-10 promoter gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility to endometriosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between IL-10 promoter gene polymorphism and the susceptibility to endometriosis (EMs) in Chinese population. Amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reactions (ARMS-PCR) and DNA sequencing were performed to detect polymorphism of -1082G/A site and PCR-RFLP was used to determine the genotypes in -819T/C and -592A/C sites. One hundred and nineteen Chinese women with different stage EMs and 120 controls were employed in this study. Although there were no significant differences in the polymorphism of -1082 site between two groups (P>0.05), the frequencies of -819C, -592C alleles and -819 CC+TC, -592 CC+AC genotypes were significantly increased in EMs patients compared with the controls (P<0.05). The frequencies of -819C, -592C alleles and -819 CC+TC, -592 CC+AC genotypes were significantly increased in III-IV EMs patients compared with I-IIMs or controls (P<0.01). This suggests that polymorphisms of IL-10-819 (T/C) and -592 (A/C) may be associated with the susceptibility to EMs in Chinese population.
