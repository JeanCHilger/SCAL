Ovarian steroid hormones differentially regulate thrombospondin-1 expression in cultured endometrial stromal cells: implications for endometriosis. Thrombospondin-1 messenger RNA and protein levels in cultured human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) treated with 17-beta estradiol (10 nM) were reduced by 47.6% (+/-6.5% SD P < 0.05) and 49.0% (+/-8.6%
