Effect of GnRH-II on VEGF secreted by stromal cells from endometrium of endometriosis. To inspect the effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormonel II (GnRH-II)on the secretion of VEGF by eutopic and ectopic endometrial stromal cells cultured in vitro.Eutopic and ectopic stromal cells cultured in vitro were treated with different concentrations (1x10(-10) - 1x10(-6) mol/L) of GnRH-II,and the control group was not treated by GnRH-II.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the VEGF protein in the medium of the above 2 groups.There was no difference between the VEGF protein expressed by eutopic and ectopic stromal cells in the medium after culturing in vitro for 48 hours (P>0.05). The 1x10(-10) - 1x10(-6) mol/L GnRH-II could dose-dependently reduce VEGF protein secreted by endometrial stromal cells (P<0.01), and the inhibition to ectopic endometrial stromal cells was stronger than that to eutopic endometrial stromal cells (P<0.01).Ectopic stromal cells cultured in vitro can secrete VEGF, and so can eutopic stromal cells. This may play an important role in the formation and development of endometriosis. GnRH-II can reduce VEGF protein secreted by ectopic endometrial stromal cells cultured in vitro, and its inhibition is stronger than that of eutopic endometrial stromal cells.
