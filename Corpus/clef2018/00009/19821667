Can high histological confirmation rates be achieved for pelvic endometriosis? This paper aims to determine the correlation between the diagnosis of endometriosis on the basis of the visualisation at laparoscopy and the histological diagnosis. Histological confirmation rates vary in the current literature. We retrospectively reviewed 160 patients over 2 years, who had laparoscopy for pelvic pain or suspected endometriosis. Our results showed higher histological confirmation rate compared with other studies. In addition, the use of CD10 IHC may increase detection rates further when the diagnosis is suspected but not confirmed by routine histology. Diagnosis of endometriosis is essential as it can influence patients' management.
