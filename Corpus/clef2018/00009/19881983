Intestinal endometriosis mimicking carcinoma of rectum and sigmoid colon: a report of five cases. Among women with intestinal endometriosis, the sigmoid colon and rectum are the most commonly involved areas. Sometimes, the differential diagnosis of colorectal endometriosis from carcinoma of the colon and rectum is difficult due to similar colonoscopic and radiologic findings. From October 2002 to September 2007, we performed five operations with curative intent for rectal and sigmoid colon cancer that revealed intestinal endometriosis. Colonoscopic and radiologic findings were suggestive of carcinoma of rectum and sigmoid colon, such as rectal cancer, sigmoid colon cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Anterior resection was performed in two patients, low anterior resection was performed in one patient and laparoscopic low anterior resection was done in two patients. We suggest to consider also intestinal endometriosis in reproductive women presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms and an intestinal mass of unknown origin.
