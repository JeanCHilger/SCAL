Neuroendocrine cells in eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common gynaecological disease, but the pathogenesis of endometriosis and pathophysiological basis for endometriosis-associated painful symptoms are still uncertain. Little is known about neuroendocrine (NE) cells in the uterus.For this study, 38 premenopausal women with histologically diagnosed ovarian endometrioma or peritoneal endometriosis and 24 women without endometriosis were selected. Biopsy samples from eutopic endometrium were used for immunohistochemical staining to detect synaptophysin (SYN) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) expression in women with and without endometriosis.There were substantially more NE cells of eutopic endometrium stained with SYN and NSE in women with endometriosis than in those without endometriosis (3.8 +/- 1.8 versus 0.5 +/- 0.7/mm2, P < 0.001, and 2.8 +/- 2.1 versus 0.4 +/- 0.6/mm2, respectively, P < 0.001). These cells were scattered in the epithelium of endometrial glands. At all stages of the menstrual cycle, the densities of NE cells stained with SYN and NSE were greater in women with endometriosis than in those without endometriosis (P < 0.05).These results suggest that NE cells in eutopic endometrium probably play some role in the pathogenesis or symptoms of endometriosis.
