Bilateral ovarian carcinoma: cytogenetic evidence of unicentric origin. Cytogenetic analyses were performed on the tumors from both ovaries in 15 patients with bilateral ovarian carcinoma. In 4 of them, omental implants were also examined. Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 11 cases. The baseline karyotypes in the 2 tumorous ovaries were identical in each patient, indicating that bilateral ovarian cancer develops by metastatic spreading. There was no clear-cut evidence of differences in the clonal evolution between the tumors of the 2 ovaries, and hence the side harboring the primary tumor could never be determined. The metastatic nature of the omental implants was proved by the fact that their karyotypes were indistinguishable from those of the ovarian tumor tissue.
