Intrauterine progestins, progesterone antagonists, and receptor modulators: a review of gynecologic applications. Intrauterine progestins, progesterone receptor modulators, and antagonists have many important current and potential gynecologic applications. This article will describe the evidence for use of intrauterine progestin for common gynecologic conditions beyond its important role in contraception. We will review the evidence for use of intrauterine progestin delivery for menorrhagia, endometriosis management, adenomyosis treatment, uterine fibroids, endometrial hyperplasia, and its concurrent use in women on hormone replacement therapy or tamoxifen.
