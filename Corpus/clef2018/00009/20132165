Serum anti-endometrial antibodies in infertile women - potential risk factor for implantation failure. Female infertility patients with diverse etiologies show increased production of autoantibodies.Immunoblot analysis of sera from patients with endometriosis and tubal factor infertility (TFI) and mass spectrometry identification of candidate antigens.The immunoblot results demonstrated the presence of IgA and IgG anti-endometrial antibodies (AEA) to various antigens at molecular weights ranging from 10 to 200 kDa. Differences were detected in certain AEA reactions between the patients' groups and particular AEA were associated with in vitro fertilization (IVF) implantation failure. IgA AEA to a 47-kDa protein were more prevalent in TFI patients and were associated with unsuccessful IVF treatment. This antigen was subsequently identified as alpha-enolase.Determination of the presence and spectra of AEA in patients with endometriosis and TFI undergoing IVF may be a useful marker to predict their pregnancy outcome.
