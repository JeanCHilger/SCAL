Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) in infertile women with endometriosis and its correlation with magnesium levels in peritoneal fluid. Endometriosis is a complex disease that can result in substantial morbidity, including chronic pain, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. There are contradictory reports regarding the connection between acute and chronic stress and magnesium levels in body fluids.A prospective study included 87 patients undergoing laparoscopy. The study group included 40 women with endometriosis and the control group consisted of 47 women with other causes of infertility. The levels of fright were determined using HAMA scale. The measurements of Mg levels were performed using biochemical analyzer "Monarch Plus".One day before the operation, HAMA score was 9.54+/-7.34 in the women with endometriosis, and 6.69+/-5.51 in the women without endometriosis. The morning before the operation, HAMA score was 8.64 +/- 8.10 in the women with endometriosis, and 4.29+/-2.29 in the women without endometriosis. The second postoperative day, HAMA score was 8.96+/-7.60 in the women with endometriosis and 6.92+/-5.16 in the women without endometriosis. Higher HAMA score in the women with endometriosis, in comparison with the control group, in all three time periods has been found, but the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). A negative correlation between the concentration of Mg in peritoneal fluid and HAMA score was found in the control group (p<0.01).In infertile women without endometriosis a correlation between Mg concentration in peritoneal fluid and HAMA score was found. No such correlation was found in the women with endometriosis, possibly due to a systemic disorder in endometriosis that might affect Mg transport through the cell membrane.
