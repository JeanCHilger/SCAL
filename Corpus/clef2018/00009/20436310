Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in pregnancy: diagnosis, complications, and management. Venous thromboembolism is a leading cause for maternal mortality. Because of the increase risk for thromboembolism in pregnancy and the postpartum period, the clinician must be on high alert for the signs and symptoms and use appropriate diagnostics in a timely manner so that prompt anticoagulation therapy can be initiated. A diagnostic and management approach for both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and for prophylaxis against thromboembolism in the obstetric patient are crucial to decreasing morbidity, mortality, and long-term sequelae.
