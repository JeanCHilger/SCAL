The prognosis of ovarian cancer depends on the CA125 value at the end of induction therapy. The prognosis of ovarian cancer depends on the CA125 value at the end of induction therapy. The relationship between the prognosis and the CA125 value at the end of induction therapy was analysed in 16 ovarian cancers. In the group with a CA125 value less than 35 units/ml after the induction therapy (initial surgery + 3 courses of chemotherapy) all patients have survived for 18-45 months since the initial treatment to the present, whereas in the group with a CA125 value above 35 units/ml all patients died within 16 months after the initial treatment. Comparison of the survival rates in these two groups showed a significant difference. These results suggest that the most important factor that affects prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer is the normalization of the CA125 value after the induction therapy.
