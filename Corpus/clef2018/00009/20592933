MRI appearance of florid cystic endosalpingiosis of the uterus: a case report. Endosalpingiosis is a non-neoplastic proliferation of ectopic tubal epithelium. It may be found incidentally or the patients may present with chronic pelvic pain. It may resemble a gynecologic malignancy on imaging findings and clinicians and radiologists should be aware of this benign entity to render a correct diagnosis and to avoid over-treatment. We report here the MR imaging appearance of a case of florid cystic endosalpingiosis.
