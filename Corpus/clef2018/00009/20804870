Scar endometriosis - a series of six patients. Scar endometriosis is a rare form of extrapelvic endometriosis that is usually confused with other surgical or dermatological conditions leading to delay in diagnosis.We reviewed the case records of patients with the diagnosis of scar endometriosis seen in our hospital from January 1996 to December 2008.We found six patients of scar endometriosis in 13 years making it one of the rare conditions. The median age of the patients was 32.5 years (range 28-37 years) and median interval from symptoms to treatment was 2 years (range 1-6 years). Four patients had first presented to either the surgery or dermatology physicians. Cyclic pain and swelling at local site was the most common presenting symptoms. All patients underwent wide excision of the mass with no recurrence of symptoms at a follow up ranging from 9 months to 12 years.Increasing awareness of this condition among doctors can help in early diagnosis and treatment with gratifying results.
