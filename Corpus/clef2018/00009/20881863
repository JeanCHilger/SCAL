p16 expression in squamous and trophoblastic lesions of the upper female genital tract. p16, a surrogate marker for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, is uniformly present in HPV-related carcinomas. This study aims to further characterize p16 expression in trophoblastic lesions and squamous lesions of the upper female genital tract, as little data exists. p16 immunostaining was performed on sections from ichthyosis uteri (1), primary uterine corpus squamous cell carcinoma (UCSCC) (2), primary ovarian SCC (OSCC) (5 2 associated with a dermoid cyst), endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma with extensive squamous differentiation (EC-SD) (5), ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma with extensive squamous differentiation (OC-SD) (4), placental site nodule (5), and placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) (6). We evaluated the percentage of positive cytoplasmic and nuclear staining (focal ≤10%, multifocal=10% to 50%, and diffuse ≥50%) and staining intensity (weak, moderate, and strong). HPV-DNA analysis by polymerase chain reaction was performed on 5 OSCC. Ichthyosis uteri, all UCSCC and 1 OSCC (arising in a dermoid) were negative
