Risk factors for adenomyosis in patients with symptomatic uterine leiomyomas. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential risk factors for adenomyosis in patients with symptomatic uterine leiomyomas.The medical charts and histopathology reports of 1499 women who underwent hysterectomy between 2003-2007 were retrospectively reviewed. The study group was composed of 135 patients with coexisting uterine leiomyoma and adenomyosis. The control group comprised 176 patients with uterine leiomyoma without adenomyosis.Among 233 patients with adenomyosis 135 (57.9%) had associated uterine fibroids. Women who delivered twice or more were at increased risk for adenomyosis in relation to nulliparuos women: RR (95% CI) 2.44 (1.04-5.72), p = 0.040. No relationship was found between adenomyosis and cesarean section rate, abortions, menorrhagia or dysmenorrhea.Results of our study indicate that multiparity is a risk factor for adenomyosis in women with symptomatic leiomyomas.
