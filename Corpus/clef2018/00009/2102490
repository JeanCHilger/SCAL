Elucidation of sialyltransferase as a tumour marker. The report describes results of separation of sialyltransferase isoenzymes by electrofocusing plasma from healthy volunteers and patients having different types of malignant tumour. Extensive modification of the technique was adopted in determining enzyme activity, such as elution of gel strips with the buffer pH corresponding to the gel focusing point assessment of the effect of different pH on endogenous incorporation of radioactivity to desialated fetuin
