Apigenin inhibits tumor necrosis factor α-induced cell proliferation and prostaglandin E2 synthesis by inactivating NFκB in endometriotic stromal cells. Apigenin suppressed tumor necrosis factor α-induced cell proliferation and prostaglandin E2 expression via the attenuation of nuclear factor κB pathway in endometriotic stromal cells in vitro. Apigenin reduced the mitogenic activity and inflammatory reaction in endometriotic stromal cells.
