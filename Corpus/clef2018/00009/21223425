A possible mechanism of autoimmune-mediated infertility in women with endometriosis. Endometriosis has been proposed to be an autoimmune disease because of the presence of a variety of autoantibodies specific for endometrial or ovarian antigens. The object of the present study is to characterize binding specificity of anti-laminin-111 autoantibodies in infertile patients with endometriosis and to investigate whether these autoantibodies affect the in vitro embryo development.An ELISA analysis using overlapping synthesized peptides that covered the entire G domain of laminin-α1 chain was performed in infertile patients with endometriosis (n = 45). Mouse blastocysts were cultured in media containing the purified IgG from one antibody-positive serum on laminin-111-coated dishes.Anti-laminin-111 autoantibodies were directed to several particular biologically functional peptide sequences in laminin-α 1 chain G domain. The tested IgG significantly inhibited the extent of in vitro trophoblast outgrowth.Anti-laminin-111 autoantibodies may have major pathogenic roles on early reproductive failure including endometriosis-associated infertility.
