Relevance of MRI for endometriosis diagnosis. Endometriosis is a disease of the uterus with displacement of endometrium-like tissue outside the endometrium. Endometriosis is a common benign chronic often debilitating disease that primarily affects young woman. The estimated prevalence is about 10 %. In addition to the uterus and ovaries, clinically important localisations are the rectovaginal space, rectum, sigmoid colon, urinary bladder, ureter and peritoneum. The most common localisation outside the pelvis is the abdominal wall. Today, MRI is one of the most important tools in the diagnosis of endometriosis. The detection of peritoneal manifestations and the exact definition of the depth of infiltration in the rectum, sigmoid colon and bladder walls are limitations of MRI.
