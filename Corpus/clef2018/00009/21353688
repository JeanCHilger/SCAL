Agenesis of the infrarenal inferior vena cava with thrombosis of the renal vein in a fetus: a case report. Agenesis of the inferior vena cava, especially of the infrarenal segment, is exceptional. This condition is thought to result from thrombosis during gestation rather than from a true congenital malformation. Agenesis of the inferior vena cava can be associated with renal vein thrombosis, which in turn is related to suprarenal hemorrhage in the fetus. We present a case of agenesis of the inferior vena cava with preservation of the hepatic segment, thrombosis of the left renal vein, and secondary bilateral suprarenal hemorrhage diagnosed prenatally using sonography and magnetic resonance imaging.
