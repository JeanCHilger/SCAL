Influence of danazol and goserelin on insulin and glucagon in non-obese women with endometriosis. To investigate the effects of medical treatment of endometriosis on concentrations of insulin and glucagon in comparison with those of androgens, 12 non-obese women with minimal endometriosis were randomly allocated to receive treatment with either danazol or the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue, goserelin. In subjects treated with danazol, mean (SD) summed serum insulin (1.08 (0.22) nmol/l pretreatment 3.00 (1.50) nmol/l after treatment, p less than 0.05) and summed plasma glucagon (94 (21) pmol/l pretreatment
