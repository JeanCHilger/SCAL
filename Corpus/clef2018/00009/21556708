Endometriosis and headache. Headache and endometriosis show some similarities in their clinical and epidemiological features that are probably due to the influence of female sexual hormones on both disorders. Epidemiological studies indicate that they are comorbid disorders. However, the nature of the comorbidity is not known with certainty, but a likely explanation may be common susceptibility genes. Another possibility is that, because they both are related to pain, increased pain sensitivity induced by one of the disorders may lead to a higher likelihood of developing the other, possibly mediated by nitrogen oxide or prostaglandins. A common link to the widespread use of estroprogestins may seem less probable. For physicians dealing with women with either of these disorders, awareness of the comorbidity may be helpful in the treatment of the patient.
