Increased levels of human neutrophil peptides 1, 2, and 3 in peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis: association with neutrophils, T cells and IL-8. Endometriosis is a common gynaecological disorder characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. This disease is associated with pelvic inflammation and displays some features of autoimmune disorder. Human neutrophil peptides 1, 2, and 3 (HNP 1-3) belonging to Î±-defensin family play a crucial role in innate immunity against infections and may exert immunoregulatory effects. They may play a role in various inflammatory reactions however, their role in endometriosis has not been studied. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate HNP 1-3 in the peritoneal fluid of 67 patients with endometriosis and 16 healthy control women in relation to peritoneal leukocyte subpopulations (neutrophils, T cells, and macrophages) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8). HNP 1-3, IL-6 and IL-8 were evaluated in the peritoneal fluid by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and peritoneal leukocyte subpopulations were evaluated by flow cytometry. We found that the levels of HNP 1-3 were significantly increased in the peritoneal fluid of endometriosis patients, compared with control women, and correlated with severity of the disease. Endometriosis was also associated with increased concentrations of peritoneal neutrophils. In endometriosis the levels of HNP 1-3 strongly correlated with concentrations of neutrophils, T cells and IL-8. HNP 1-3 levels were not associated with peritoneal IL-6 or macrophages. These data suggest that HNP 1-3 and neutrophils might play a role in immunopathogenesis of endometriosis and may be worth evaluating as targets for anti-endometriosis therapy.
