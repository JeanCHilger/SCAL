Left-ventricular non-compaction with congenital left ventricular diverticulum. Left-ventricular non-compaction may be isolated or associated with other cardiac or noncardiac anomalies. Left-ventricular non-compaction associated with left ventricular diverticulum is very rare. We describe a 30 year-old pregnant woman with a long standing diagnosis of biventricular non-compaction in whom a hidden left ventricular apical diverticulum was detected on transthoracic echocardiography. Both these conditions increase the risk of thromboembolism. Additionally, she was also diagnosed to have endocervical adenocarcinoma. This case suggests that a comprehensive echocardiographic examination is mandatory in cases of suspected isolated left-ventricular non-compaction to detect any other associated cardiac or noncardiac anomalies.
