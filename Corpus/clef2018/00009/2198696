The mechanism of the therapeutic effect of norethisterone in hyperplastic diseases of the endo- and myometrium in women of reproductive age. The paper is concerned with results of a study of clinico-biologic effect of a gestagen norsteroid drug--norcolut--on solitary and combined lesions of the endo- and myometrium. Four hundred and thirty-four patients of reproductive age with hyperplasia or polyps of the endometrium, uterine myoma, internal endometriosis or a combination of the pathologies were examined prior to administration of norcolut and during posttreatment cycle to evaluate the influence of the drug on the female reproductive system. Norcolut exerted the regulatory effect on the rhythm and pattern of menstruation and inhibited tumor growth. Also, changes in localization of myoma nodes, normalization of steroid hormone profile, decrease in the level of estradiol and progesterone receptors, and secretory transformation of the endometrium were observed. Those changes resulted in regression of endometrial lesions.
