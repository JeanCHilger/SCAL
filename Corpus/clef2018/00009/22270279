Proteomics analysis of plasma for early diagnosis of endometriosis. To test the hypothesis that differential surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry protein or peptide expression in plasma can be used in infertile women with or without pelvic pain to predict the presence of laparoscopically and histologically confirmed endometriosis, especially in the subpopulation with a normal preoperative gynecologic ultrasound examination.Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis was performed on 254 plasma samples obtained from 89 women without endometriosis and 165 women with endometriosis (histologically confirmed) undergoing laparoscopies for infertility with or without pelvic pain. Data were analyzed using least squares support vector machines and were divided randomly (100 times) into a training data set (70%) and a test data set (30%).Minimal-to-mild endometriosis was best predicted (sensitivity 75%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 63-89 specificity 86%, 95% CI 71-94A noninvasive test using proteomic analysis of plasma samples obtained during the menstrual phase enabled the diagnosis of endometriosis undetectable by ultrasonography with high sensitivity and specificity.II.
