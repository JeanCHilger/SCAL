Deer (Cervus elaphus) antler extract suppresses adhesion and migration of endometriotic cells and regulates MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Deer antler has been used for centuries as medicine for a wide range of health problems, including various women's diseases. However, there is a safety concern related to its use in hormone-sensitive conditions, such as breast cancer and endometriosis. In the present study, we investigated the effect of deer (Cervus elaphus) antler extract (DAE) on adhesion and migration of human endometriotic cells.Adhesion, wound-healing, and transwell migration assays were performed in endometriotic cells 11Z and 12Z. Expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, TNF-α, and IL-6 were measured by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis.DAE (50 and 100μg/ml) decreased the adhesion of 11Z and 12Z cells on peritoneal mesothelial Met5-A cells. Wound-healing and transwell migration assays revealed that DAE (50 and 100μg/ml) inhibited migration in 11Z and 12Z cells. It was further demonstrated that treatment with DAE (50 and 100μg/ml) significantly decreased the levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, TNF-α, and IL-6.These results indicate that DAE is a potential anti-endometriotic agent to inhibit the adhesion and migration of endometrial cells through the suppression of various related molecules.
