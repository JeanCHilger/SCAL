Expression of steroidogenic factor 1 in ovarian endometriosis and adenomyosis. To investigate the expression of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) in eutopic endometrium, ovarian endometriosis (EM) and adenomyosis.From Jan. 2008 to Dec. 2010, 30 patients with both ovarian endometriotic cysts and adenomyosis underwent hysterectomy, cystectomy or adenxectomy in Peking University First Hospital. The combination of ovarian EM and denomyosis were confirmed in 17 cases. In the mean time, endometria form 10 patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN) III underwent hysterectomy were selected as controls. The expression of SF-1 in eutopic endometrium, ovarian EM and adenomyosis was detected by immunohistochemistry staining.No immunoreactivity of SF-1 was observed glandular cell and stromal cell in eutopic endometrium of both groups. 14/17 of positive rate of SF-1 were observed in lesions of ovarian endometriosis. SF-1 protein was not expressed in the endometrial glandular cells of ovarian EM and in adenomyosis foci.The differences of SF-1 expression in ovarian endometrioma and adenomyosis foci might mediate the development of the disease.
