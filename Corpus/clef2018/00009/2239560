Danazol therapy of endometriosis of the bladder and ureter: a case report. Endometriosis of the urinary tract is uncommon. A thirty-year-old woman was referred to our hospital, complaining of macrohematuria. Intravenous pyelography (IVP) showed bilateral hydro nephrosis. Cystoscopic examination revealed a mass around the bilateral ureteral orifice. Danazol therapy was commenced. After 6 months of therapy, IVP showed the improvement of hydronephrosis of left kidney and cystoscopy revealed the resolution of most of the mass in the bladder. For definite diagnosis and treatment, danazol therapy is considered to be effective for endometriosis, but if secondary fibrosis has occurred, surgical treatment may be necessary.
