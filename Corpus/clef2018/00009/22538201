Extragenital endometrial stromal sarcoma arising in endometriosis. The diagnosis rate of deep pelvic endometriosis is increasing. Endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) is a rare neoplasm. Extragenital ESS is an extremely uncommon event. Very few cases of extragenital ESS have been reported to date. The diagnosis of this entity is very difficult in some instances. Knowledge about its management is also limited. In this paper, we review the current literature on the clinical management, histology, immunohistochemistry, treatment and outcome of ESS arising in pelvic endometriosis.
