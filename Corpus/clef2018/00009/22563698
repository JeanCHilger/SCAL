Pilot study of CD147 protein expression in epithelial ovarian cancer using monoclonal antibody 12C3. CD147 is a membrane glycoprotein that is expressed in various cancer cells and is involved in tumor invasion and metastasis by inducing stromal fibroblastic cells to produce matrix metalloproteinases. This study was carried out to evaluate the correlation between CD147 expression and various clinicopathologic parameters, including histological grade and prognosis in a small sample set of human ovarian cancer patients.Paraffin-embedded surgical tissue samples from 25 patients with ovarian serous and endometrioid adenocarcinoma were stained with anti-CD147 antibody (monoclonal antibody 12C3: MoAb 12C3) for immunohistochemical analysis.CD147 protein was expressed in 84.0% (21 of 25 cases) of cancerous lesions, but not in normal lesions. CD147 expression by ovarian cancer cells was inversely correlated with overall survival. There was no correlation between CD147 expression and histological grade.These results suggest that measurement of CD147 expression may enhance the understanding of the pathophysiology of epithelial ovarian cancer.
