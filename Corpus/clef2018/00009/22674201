Rationale of first-line endoscopy-based fertility exploration using transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy and minihysteroscopy. The transvaginal access for exploration of tubo-ovarian function in women with unexplained infertility has been revived since transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (THL) was introduced in 1998. One prospective double-blind trial and several reviews have validated the diagnostic value of THL in comparison with laparoscopy for the exploration of women with unexplained infertility. A review of the recent literature confirms the efficacy and safety of the technique for first-line endoscopy-based exploration of fertility. The standard policy of 1-year delay for laparoscopic investigation in unexplained infertility is challenged. In older women and particularly in women experienced in fertility awareness methods, THL and minihysteroscopy can be performed after a waiting period of 6-12 months.
