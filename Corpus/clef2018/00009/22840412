New directions in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism in pregnancy. The diagnosis and management of pulmonary embolism in pregnancy is difficult, because diagnostic procedures and the use of anticoagulants potentially can expose mother and fetus to adverse effects. This article reviews evidence for current best practice and emerging novel techniques for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in pregnancy and includes clinical prediction models, biomarkers, and diagnostic imaging that may offer improvement in the diagnosis and investigation of pulmonary embolism in pregnancy in the future. The usefulness of new anticoagulant agents (fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran) in managing pulmonary embolism in future pregnancies is also explored.
