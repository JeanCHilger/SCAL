The abdominal wall lumps and bumps: cross-sectional imaging spectrum. This article focuses on the cross-sectional imaging spectrum of abnormalities that affect the abdominal wall, with emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cross-sectional imaging is valuable for diagnosing and evaluating the extent of abdominal-wall masses. With the increasing use of MRI, it is often possible to reach a diagnosis or narrow the differential diagnosis, thereby guiding effective management. Neoplastic and non-neoplastic pathologies will be illustrated, and the distinctive imaging characteristics of these entities will be highlighted.
