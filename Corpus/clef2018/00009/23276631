PGRMC2, a yet uncharacterized protein with potential as tumor suppressor, migration inhibitor, and regulator of cytochrome P450 enzyme activity. PGRMC2 (progesterone receptor membrane component 2) is highly homologous if compared with PGRMC1, a cytochrome-related protein, which is induced in several cancers and linked to cell growth in these cancers. Further it seems to be involved in progesterone signalling and cytochrome P450 binding. For PGRMC2 only sparse information is available. Recent data show that PGRMC1 and 2 share several similar characteristics, but there are also important differences in expression and function of the both proteins. Several findings point to the fact that PGRMC2 might play a role in cancer as well. The protein influences the migration rate of ovarian cancer cells and a loss of PGRMC2 might result in higher metastasis rates. In contrast to PGRMC1 it seems more likely to act as a tumor suppressor than a promoter. Altered PGRMC2 expression was further detected in the context of term and preterm labour, though the implications of this finding are currently unknown and need further examination. PGRMC2 further might play a role in gynaecologic diseases like preterm labour and endometriosis. PGRMC2 shares the cellular localisation and the ability to bind cytochrome enzymes with PGRMC1. Further the protein was shown to influence the activity of CYP3A4. In conclusion, though not much is known about PGRMC2 so far, it deserves further examination as data point to a role of PGRMC2 as tumor suppressor, migration inhibitor and regulator of cytochrome P450 proteins.
