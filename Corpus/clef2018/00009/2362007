Fertilization failure in IVF: why and what next? Among 297 couples who underwent 587 oocyte collection procedures, 95 (16%) total fertilization failures (FF) were observed. This frequency is similar in couples with either normal or only mildly deficient spermatozoa (16.2 and 13.7% respectively) but is almost doubled in cases of moderately and severely defective sperm (26.5%). However, this latter group accounts for only 19% of FF events. The fertilization rate per oocyte (FR) follows an inverse trend. FR was correlated with the final (i.e. after swim-up) sperm count and with initial and final motility of the sperm sample. If the final count and motility were less than 2 x 10(6)/ml and 40% respectively, the FF frequency in the group with partner's spermatozoa was significantly higher and FR significantly lower. FR was inversely correlated with the number of oocytes recovered but FF was found significantly more frequently only when fewer than three eggs were retrieved. No correlation was found between FF and either female causes of infertility, age or dosage of stimulation treatment. However, in the group with donor spermatozoa the FR was significantly lower amongst tubal, endocrinopathic and endometriotic patients (67.6, 67.2 and 56.6 respectively versus 79.7% in harvests from idiopathic cases). FR was decreased and FF increased when ovulation induction resulted from a spontaneous LH peak supplemented with human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), as compared to induction by HCG alone. In the group using normal or mildly defective spermatozoa, if FF occurs at the first attempt, the frequency of recurrence in further trials is high (29%) and the probability of pregnancy after completed trials is low (12.5%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
