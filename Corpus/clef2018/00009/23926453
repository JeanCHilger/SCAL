In vitro apoptosis effects of GnRHII on endometrial stromal cells from patients with endometriosis. To study the effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone II (GnRHII) on the cell apoptosis of ectopic, eutopic and normal endometrial stromal cells cultured in vitro from endometriosis patients, and to provide theoretical basis for exploring new treatments for endometriosis (EMs).Ectopic, eutopic and normal endometrial stromal cells were isolated, cultured and identified in vitro, then treated with different concentrations of GnRHII (0, 10(-10) M, 10(-8) M and 10(-6) M). Cell apoptosis was detected by Hoechst staining and flow cytometry.GnRHII increased apoptosis in ectopic, eutopic and normal stromal cells in a dosage-dependent manner (P<0.05), and apoptosis of ectopic stroma cells was significantly higher than that of eutopic and normal cells (P<0.05) apoptosis in eutopic and normal cells had no different (P>0.05).GnRHII can significantly induce apoptosis in ectopic, eutopic and normal endometrial stromal cells from patients with endometriosis, especially to the ectopic.
