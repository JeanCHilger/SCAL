The use of serial CA 125 concentrations to monitor endometriosis in infertile women. To evaluate the potential use of CA 125 concentrations in monitoring women with endometriosis, serial determinations were correlated with the clinical course of the disease and pregnancy rates. Preoperative CA 125 concentrations were obtained in 134 consecutive infertile women with endometriosis. Seventy-six (57%) women had values greater than or equal to 16 U/ml and were followed up for 18 months. At the 6-, 12-, and 18-month intervals, pregnancies occurred in 18 of 45 (30%), 14 of 24 (58%), and 5 of 12 (42%) women in the good prognosis group, respectively pregnancy rates in the poor prognosis group were 1 of 31 (3%), 2 of 33 (6%), and 0 of 26 (0%) women (p less than 0.001). Changes in the CA 125 values correlated with the surgical findings in 24 of the 26 women (92%) who had a second-look operative procedure. The study supports the use of serial CA 125 concentrations to assist in the management of women with endometriosis.
