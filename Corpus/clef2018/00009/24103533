Role of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole in the management of uterine leiomyomas in premenopausal women. Uterine myomas are benign tumours affecting 20-40% women. Various medical and surgical therapeutic options are available but the search for an ideal medical option continues. Aromatase inhibitors have recently been reported to have a potential role in the management of oestrogen-dependent conditions like endometriosis and leiomyoma.To evaluate the effect of letrozole on uterine myoma size and symptomatology in perimenopausal women.Prospective interventional study conducted on 30 premenopausal women aged between 30 and 55 years with menstrual or pressure symptoms and having a single intrauterine myoma of size 4 cm or more with or without one or more additional myomata each of size 2 cm or less. They received tablet letrozole 2.5 mg a day for 12 weeks, and the effect of the drug on myoma size and volume and symptomatology was studied along with the adverse effect profile and patient satisfaction.The mean myoma size reduced from 5.4±1.3 cm to 4.3±0.9 cm (p<0.05) and the myoma volume exhibited a reduction of 52.45% (p=0.00) at the end of 3 months. The symptomatology score showed a significant improvement that persisted up to 3 months after cessation of therapy. No significant effect was observed on lipid profile, serum estradiol, progesterone, testosterone and FSH and LH levels during the therapy. Nausea and hot flushes were the main adverse effects observed and were self-limiting.Letrozole significantly reduces myoma size and volume and also improves the associated symptoms. It has a good adverse effect profile and appears to be a promising medical option for management of uterine myomas.
