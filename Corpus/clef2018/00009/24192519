Endocervical-like versus intestinal-type mucinous borderline ovarian tumors: a large retrospective series focusing on the clinicopathologic characteristics. To evaluate the clinical and pathologic features of patients with mucinous borderline tumor (MBT) of the ovary with special emphasis on the endocervical-like (EMBT) and intestinal-type (IMBT).This is a retrospective review of patients with MBT who were diagnosed and treated between 1995 and 2009 at a single institution. The records were analyzed for the patients' clinicopathologic information. The survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Of a total of 203 patients with MBT, there were 56 (27.6%) with EMBTs and 147 (72.4%) with IMBTs. Patients with EMBTs were significantly more asymptomatic (58.9%), had higher CA125 and CA19-9 levels, larger tumors (mean 17.3 cm), less frequent bilateral occurrence (5.4%), and less relation to endometriosis (1.4%), compared with those with IMBTs (all p < 0.05). During the median follow-up of 57.3 months (range 6-158), a total of 8 recurrences were identified: 6 were borderline and 2 were invasive lesion. With regard to the recurrence, EMBT and IMBT showed a 7-year recurrence-free survival rate of 97.1 and 92.1%, respectively, with no significant difference.EMBT and IMBT had different clinicopathological profiles, although the histologic distinction of MBT was not associated with the prognosis.
