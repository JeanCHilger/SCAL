Two month after discontinuation of danazol 5 women were free of symptoms. The metabolic studies revealed significant changes in many biochemical parameters. Two month after discontinuation of chlormadinone acetate also 5 women were free of symptoms. The metabolic studies revealed significant changes only for the blood plateled concentration and serum bilirubin.
