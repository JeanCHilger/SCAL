Relationship between the expression of dual specificity phosphatase-1 and the prognosis of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. To clarify the relationship between the expression of dual specificity phosphatase-1 (DUSP1) and the prognosis of endometrioid adenocarcinoma.The expression of DUSP1 was determined by immunohistochemical staining in specimens from 81 patients with endometrial carcinoma undergoing surgical resection. The relationship between DUSP1 expression, clinicopathological factors and prognosis were further evaluated.In 81 endometrioid carcinoma samples, 59 (72.84%) cases were positive while 22 negative.Except for lymph node metastasis, the expression of DUSP1 was correlated with FIGO stage, tumor grade, myometrial invasion and the expressions of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) (P < 0.05) .Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with a positive DUSP1 expression had significantly prolonged 5-year disease-free survival rates of 98.2% and 76.0% respectively (P < 0.05). And COX regression analysis revealed that the expressions of DUSP1 and PR were independent prognostic indicators of endometrioid carcinoma, the HR (hazard ratio) of DUSP1 negative expression was 21.2.Spearman analysis further showed that the expression of DUSP1 was positively correlated with PR (r = 0.256, P < 0.05).DUSP1 may be a potential negative prognostic indicator for endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
