FOXL2 in human endometrium: hyperexpressed in endometriosis. The present study investigated expression and protein localization of FOXL2 messenger RNA (mRNA) in endometrium of healthy women and in patients with endometriosis during endometrial cycle. In endometriotic lesions, FOXL2 mRNA and protein were evaluated and a possible correlation with activin A mRNA expression changes was also studied. Endometrium was collected from healthy women (n = 52) and from women with endometriosis (n = 31) by hysteroscopy endometriotic tissues were collected by laparoscopy (n = 38). FOXL2 gene expression analysis in endometrium of healthy women showed a significant expression and no significant changes in mRNA levels between proliferative and secretory phases
