Description of an endometrioid ovarian cancer cell line. A human cell line, designated L-1, has been established from the ascites of an untreated patient with stage IV (FIGO) endometrioid ovarian cancer. This cell line initially grew uninterupted for 6 months without fibroblast contamination and contact inhibition, and has been subcultured weekly for the past 7 years. L-1 does not contain steroid hormone receptors nor does it demonstrate the presence of oncofetal antigens by immunohistochemical techniques. The doubling time of L-1 is 11.8 hr. Flow cytometric analysis reveals an aneuploid DNA peak, and an abnormal karyotype demonstrates hyperdiploidy, translocations, and deletions. Morphology, growth patterns, cytogenetic analysis, and other features of L-1 are characterized.
