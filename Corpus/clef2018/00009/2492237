Enzyme immune assay determination of CA-125 in serum, peritoneal fluid, and follicular fluid from women with minimal endometriosis after ovarian hyperstimulation. We conclude that the acutely preovulatory expression of CA-125 in serum and FF as determined by EIA is low and not significantly enhanced by OH. Although the PF concentrations were elevated in women with minimal endometriosis when compared with women without endometriosis, the still unresolved problem associated with measurements of CA-125 in PF for both RIA and EIA and the considerable overlap in individual values between both patient groups preclude its use as a reliable screening or monitoring parameter, at least for the present.
