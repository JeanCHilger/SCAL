Hormonal changes in buserelin therapy. Buserelin has been applied intranasal in 31 women of the reproductive age for endometriosis that had been diagnosed by laparoscopic and bioptic means. The treatment period was 6 month and hormonal changes were evaluated after 2, 4, 8, 12, 17, 20, and 24 weeks. After 2 weeks we observed a decrease of FSH to the lower normogonadotropic range, and of progesteron to less than 0.5 ng/ml. After 4 weeks LH decreased to the lower normogonadotropic range and E2 was below 55 pg/ml. Prolactin concentrations varied between 6 and 8 ng/ml.
