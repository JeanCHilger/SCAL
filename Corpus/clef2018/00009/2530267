The effects of prostacyclin and thromboxane analogue (U46619) on the fetal circulation and umbilical flow velocity waveforms. In placental insufficiency and pre-eclampsia the relative production rates of prostacyclin and thromboxane by the placenta and umbilical vessels are altered and the Doppler umbilical flow velocity waveform shows a high resistance pattern. To investigate the control of umbilical placental blood flow by those eicosanoids either prostacyclin (10 micrograms/min), or the thromboxane analogue U46619 (10 ng/min) was infused into the distal aorta of 12 chronically catheterized fetal lambs at day 125. Thromboxane produced a rise in mean arterial pressure and a rise in the systolic diastolic ratio of the umbilical artery flow waveform (2.6 to 3.1 P less than 0.05). Umbilical blood flow did not change and there was no evidence of altered flow to other organs. Prostacyclin caused a fall in fetal mean arterial pressure and a decrease in the umbilical artery systolic diastolic ratio (2.9 to 2.4
