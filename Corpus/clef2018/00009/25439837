Macrophage migration inhibitory factor as a potential biomarker of endometriosis. To evaluate the expression of MIF, CD74, and COX-2 in normal, ectopic, and eutopic endometrium during the menstrual cycle and to assess MIF level in peripheral blood.The expressions of MIF, CD74, and COX-2 in normal, ectopic, and eutopic endometrium were evaluated with the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction. MIF protein in peripheral blood samples was checked with the use of ELISA.Reproductive biomedicine research center.Sixteen normal women and 20 women with endometriosis.Ectopic biopsies were obtained with the use of laparoscopic procedure, and eutopic and control biopsies were obtained with the use of Pipelle. Peripheral blood samples were collected before laparoscopy.The expression of MIF, CD74, and COX-2 in normal, ectopic and eutopic endometrium during the menstrual cycle and the expression level of MIF in peripheral blood samples.Relative mRNA expression of MIF, CD74, and COX-2 were significantly higher in ectopic endometrium than in eutopic and control endometrium. Also, there were significant differences in expression of these genes in normal, ectopic, and eutopic endometrium during the menstrual cycle. Moreover, women with endometriosis had significantly higher circulating levels of MIF compared with control subjects.Dynamic expression of MIF, CD74, and COX-2 during the menstrual cycle could play an essential role in reproduction, inflammation, and endometrium reconstruction. A higher expression of these genes in ectopic endometrium can be considered as a molecular biomarker for endometriosis development and pathophysiology. Also, a high level of MIF in blood serum can act as a biomarker in the diagnosis of endometriosis.
