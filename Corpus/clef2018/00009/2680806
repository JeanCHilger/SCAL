Abnormally high values of CA 125 and CA 19-9 in women with benign tumors. Tumor markers have proved to be generally useful for diagnosing and monitoring malignancy. In contrast, high levels of tumor markers disturb us for differing benign disease from malignancy. We had 5 cases with benign disease who showed high values of tumor markers (CA 125 and CA 19-9). In this report, we illustrated 3 patients with endometriosis who showed high values of CA 125 and 2 patients with dermoid cyst who showed high values of CA 19-9. It was impossible to rule out malignant disease in all cases preoperatively. In diagnosing ovarian tumors, bimanual examination, ultrasound, CT scan and tumor markers should all be considered.
