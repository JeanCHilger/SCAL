Clinical therapeutics of endometriosis, Part 2. The 2nd part of a review on medical therapy of endometriosis discusses pseudopregnancy brought on by oral contraceptives, and pseudomenopause induced by Danazol and GnRh agonist therapy.  Oral contraceptives are not FDA approved for endometriosis, but many physicians prescribe 1 tablet daily for 2 weeks, then 2 tablets daily for 6-12 months, or higher doses in case of breakthrough bleeding.  Pills cause endometrial decidual changes initially then atrophy.  Danazol selectively inhibits release of FSH and LH by the pituitary, resulting in anovulation and atrophy of the endometrium.  It is currently the preferred and most effective medical therapy for endometriosis, and is approved for this indication.  It is used in doses of 200-800 mg in 2 divided doses, or 400-800 mg/day preoperatively.  Side effects are androgenic, some of which are not reversible, antiestrogenic, metabolic and nonspecific, i.e., muscle spasms.  Drug interactions such as increased insulin requirements have been reported.  The GnRH antagonists, nafarelin, buserelin, histrelin and leuprolide must be given subcutaneously or nasally.  The anti-ovarian side effects, hot flashes, calcium loss, vaginal dryness and insomnia are more prevalent than the androgenic side effects, weight gain, edema, myalgia, and decreased libido reported with Danazol.  Clinical and laparoscopic evidence of improvement is temporary with drug treatment, in contrast to surgery.  Infertility is common even with mild endometriosis, and the condition may recur, even after pregnancy.
