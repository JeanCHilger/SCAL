Adenosquamous-cell carcinoma of the ovary: report of a case with positive peritoneal fluid cytology. Cytologic examination of peritoneal fluid showed only malignant squamous cells, without revealing adenocarcinomatous cell components, in a patient who had an endometrioid adenosquamous-cell carcinoma of the ovary. Histologic examination of the ovary demonstrated diffuse squamous-cell carcinoma with rare foci of endometrioid and abortive malignant glands, as well as isolated mucin-positive cells. The cytologic differential diagnosis of malignant squamous cells in peritoneal fluid and the pathogenesis of squamous-cell carcinoma of the ovary are discussed.
