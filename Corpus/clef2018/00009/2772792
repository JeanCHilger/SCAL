Surgical staging of carcinoma of the ovaries. One hundred and eighty-seven patients with stages I, II and III optimal (metastatic lesions of less than 3 centimeters) epithelial carcinoma of the ovaries were evaluated preoperatively and had standardized exploration and biopsy. The protocol called for examination and biopsy of the peritoneum, diaphragm, omentum, pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes and aspiration of ascites or peritoneal washings for cytologic examination. Of those patients with metastases to the omentum, the clinical impression did not correlate with pathologic findings in 45 per cent. The findings were similar for diaphragmatic lymph nodes (50 per cent), pelvic lymph nodes (71 per cent) and para-aortic lymph nodes (96 per cent). Nine of 97 patients clinically thought to have stage I disease had the stage elevated to II and III based on pathologic findings. Similarly, 15 patients thought to have stage II were found to have stage III based on histopathologic findings. There were 74 complications in 54 patients, with 29 having at least one complication. Surgical exploration for early stage carcinoma of the ovary should include biopsy of the retroperitoneal pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, excision of the infracolic omentum, biopsies of pelvic and abdominal peritoneum, including the right diaphragm, and peritoneal cytologic studies.
