Carcinoembryonic antigen in primary and metastatic ovarian tumors. The immunoperoxidase method and an absorbed monospecific commercial rabbit anti-CEA antiserum were used to detect CEA in 105 primary ovarian tumors and 12 metastatic ovarian adenocarcinomas of intestinal origin. Primary ovarian tumors showed CEA in foci of squamous differentiation in 9 out of 10 cases of endometrioid carcinomas and focally in areas of intestinal differentiation in 21 out of 28 mucinous tumors as well as 4 out of 5 Brenner tumors. All of the serous tumors, clear cell carcinomas, and undifferentiated carcinomas as well as 19 of the 22 mucinous tumors without intestinal differentiation lacked CEA. All metastatic ovarian adenocarcinomas showed characteristic diffuse staining of CEA. Differences in CEA staining were found to be useful for histological differentiation between primary ovarian cancers and metastatic ovarian adenocarcinomas of intestinal origin. Furthermore, these data might be helpful in the selection of patients for serial CEA evaluation.
