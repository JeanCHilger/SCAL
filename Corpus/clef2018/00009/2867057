Mild endometriosis and luteal function. The luteal function of 27 patients with mild endometriosis and infertility was compared with that of 50 infertile patients without endometriosis. The incidence of endometrial luteal phase deficiency was similar in both groups of patients. Luteal phase length and plasma levels of progesterone (P), estradiol (E2) and prolactin (PRL) in infertile patients (both groups) were similar to those in a group of 10 fertile women. We conclude that luteal phase defects should not be considered as a primary cause of infertility in mild endometriosis.
