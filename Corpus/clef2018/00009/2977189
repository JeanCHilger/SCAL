Carbon dioxide laser laparoscopy in treatment of infertility and disorders associated with pelvic pain. Seventy-five patients, from December 1984 to December 1985, received carbon dioxide (CO(2)) laser laparoscopy for infertility and pelvic pain. The chief complaint of 55 patients was pelvic pain, and for 20 patients, either primary or secondary infertility. The most common findings were endometriosis (84 percent) and pelvic adhesions (35 percent).This paper gives the incidence of multiple diagnostic findings and the use of CO(2) laser laparoscopy. The results indicate that with the availability of the CO(2) laser laparoscope a significant number of patients can be treated for endometriosis, pelvic adhesions, salpingitis, and other disorders, preventing the need for future surgical procedures or medical therapy.
