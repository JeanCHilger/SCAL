Doppler C.W. study of the lower limb venous hemodynamics during pregnancy and prevention of thrombotic complications. Thirty-two women (14 primiparae and 18 multiparae) were submitted to clinical and ultrasound investigations during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd quarter of pregnancy and after childbirth, for the evaluation of the lower limb venous system. An increase of the venous pressure in the standing position was present in all the women during the last quarter of pregnancy. In 14 cases varices (6 primiparae, 8 multiparae) with incontinence of the saphenous-femoral valve in 10 (3 primiparae, 7 multiparae), were detected during pregnancy. In these patients a compressive bandage associated, in selected cases, to calcium-heparin therapy (25000 IU/daily) was employed. After childbirth the venous pressure resumed physiological values in 20 of the 32 women while the varices remained in 12 cases. No thrombotic complication of the superficial and/or deep venous system neither hemorrhagic episodes related to calcium-heparin therapy occurred.
