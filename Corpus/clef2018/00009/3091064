Follicle growth patterns and endocrinological abnormalities in infertile women with minor degrees of endometriosis. Eighteen patients whose only demonstrable cause of infertility was a minor degree of endometriosis and whose partners were normal, were investigated prospectively for one menstrual cycle using ultrasonography and endocrine profiles. Twelve cycles appeared to be normal. A luteinized unruptured follicle (LUF) occurred in two cycles and one patient had a follicular cyst. In a further two patients there was inadequate or abnormal folliculogenesis whilst in the last patient the follicle ruptured prematurely. This study describes the variety of endocrinological abnormalities found in women with mild endometriosis, and concludes that, in this series at least, there is a low frequency of LUF.
