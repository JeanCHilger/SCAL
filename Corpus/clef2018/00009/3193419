Diagnosis and management of intestinal endometriosis. A report of five cases. Five cases of intestinal endometriosis presented with infertility and pelvic pain. Rectal bleeding occurred in two patients and diarrhea in one. A diagnosis was achieved with a barium enema study and colonoscopy. All the patients had pelvic endometriosis as documented by laparoscopy. Endometriosis was present in the sigmoid colon in three patients and in the cecum in one it was pericecal in the fifth.
