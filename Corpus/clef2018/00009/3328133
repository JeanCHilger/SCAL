Pelvic endometriosis. The recent heightened interest in endometriosis has led to remarkable progress in the elucidation of the pathophysiology of this enigmatic disease. Presently, it is not clear why some individuals with endometriosis develop infertility and pelvic pain, whereas others with a similar degree of disease do not. Several tantalizing clues have been extracted from studies of the molecular pathogenesis, immunology, and biochemistry of endometriosis. Investigations are now under way to determine the specific relevance to infertility of macrophage aggregation prostaglandin and related metabolite production by endometriotic lesions and macrophages
