Serum level of the tumor marker CA 125 in ovarian pathology. The tumor marker CA-125 is an embryonal glycoprotein detectable in tissues derived from celomatic epithelium. Serum CA-125 was determined by RIA in 66 patients with various ovarian pathologies (16 malignant at stage III-IV and 50 benign). Six patients with ovarian carcinoma were monitored during the first week after surgery and chemotherapy for a total of 150 days of treatment. We observed that CA-125 serum level is consistently above the normal range (greater than 35 U/ml) in all malignant diseases. In benign pathology, levels above the normal were found to be represented almost exclusively by ovarian endometriosis. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that chemotherapy alone is capable of lowering CA-125 serum levels. This tumor marker may be of great advantage in diagnosis and follow-up of ovarian malignancy.
