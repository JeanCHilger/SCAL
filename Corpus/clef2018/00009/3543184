Noninvasive diagnosis of deep venous thromboses by Doppler ultrasound. A Duplex ultrasound technique combining real time ultrasound B imaging with pulsed Doppler investigation was used for non-invasive exploration of peripheral venous trunks. A series of 72 patients (21 men and 51 women including 26 pregnant women) was investigated by the examination of deep venous trunks of upper limbs (68 cases) and of lower limbs (4 cases). Lesions were identified in 19 cases (26%), including 9 total thrombosis, 6 partial thrombosis, 3 sequelae of a previous thrombosis and 1 case of valve incontinence. Morphologic (caliber, wall, intraluminal echos) and functional (expansion, flow rate, compression) features establishing diagnosis are discussed. Phlebography findings in 8 of the 15 cases of thrombosis (total or partial) provided very satisfactor correlation, clinical correlation being considered sufficient in the other cases. This duplex technique is a reliable, reproducible and non-invasive method for diagnosis and for follow up of medical treatment of thrombophlebitis.
