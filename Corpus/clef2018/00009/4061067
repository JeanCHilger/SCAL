Plasma 20 alpha-OH-progesterone in women with malignant epithelial 'non-endocrine' ovarian tumors. The production of 20 alpha-OH-progesterone (20 alpha-OH-P) in women with malignant epithelial ovarian tumors was investigated. The study material comprised 51 postmenopausal and/or oophorectomized women with ovarian carcinoma, including the histological types Ic, IIc, IIIc and V and FIGO stages I-IV. Their tumor volumes were evaluated once a month using bimanual recto-vaginal palpation under anesthesia. Blood samples were drawn for 20 alpha-OH-P radio-immunoassay at monthly intervals for 3 months. The plasma levels were compared with those of a control group of postmenopausal women. The results show a relationship between tumor volume and plasma 20 alpha-OH-P level. Another finding is that endometrioid ovarian cancer (histologically IIIc) showed a significantly lower 20 alpha-OH-P production than the other types. The reason for this is discussed.
