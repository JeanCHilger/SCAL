Ureteral endometriosis. In the literature, figures quoted for the involvement of the urinary tract range between 1% and 11%, adenomyosis being the exception rather than the rule. The problems of preoperative diagnosis are illustrated with reference to five of the author's cases. In four-fifths of the cases definitive confirmation of the findings was only obtained by intraoperative examination with a rapid incision. In cases with preserved renal function, ureteroneocystostomy employing the psoas hitch technique with subsequent hormone treatment was the treatment of choice. Summarizing, endometriosis should be considered in differential diagnosis in premenopausal women with unclear complaints and micturition disorders in the distal one-third of the ureter.
