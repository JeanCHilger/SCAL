Steroid receptor levels and histology of endometriosis and adenomyosis. Steroid receptors in endometriosis and adenomyosis were investigated to clarify their clinical significance. The receptor levels were determined by Scatchard plot analysis (4 degrees C, by dextran-coated charcoal). In the cytosols of both tissues, the 17 beta-estradiol-estrogen receptor (ER) complex demonstrated a dissociation constant (Kd) of 4.5 x 10(-10) M the Kd of the progesterone-progesterone receptor (PR) complex was 1.5 x 10(-9) M
