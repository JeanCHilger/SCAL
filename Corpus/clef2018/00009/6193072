Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate determinant 19-9 (CA 19-9) localization in 121 primary and metastatic ovarian tumors: an immunohistochemical study with the use of monoclonal antibodies. An immunoperoxidase study, using the Avidin-Biotin-Peroxidase complex method and the monoclonal antibodies, anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and anti-carbohydrate determinant 19-9 (CA 19-9), was carried out on 108 common epithelial tumors of the ovary and 13 epithelial tumors metastatic to the ovary. Primary mucinous tumors were positive in 62% of the cases (benign, 15% borderline, 80%
