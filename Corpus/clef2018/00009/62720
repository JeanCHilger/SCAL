Serum alpha-fetoprotein as a marker for the effect of post-operative radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy in eight cases of ovarian endodermal sinus tumour. The clinical pathological findings of eight cases of ovarian endodermal sinus tumour (yolk sac tumour) are presented. Histological exmination in all eight cases showed a typical endodermal sinus tumour pattern, and in six of the patients other tumour elements such as dysgerminoma, choriocarcinoma, malignant teratoma, endometriosis, and a dermoid cyst were also found. Six patients had increased serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration in the post-operative period, and two patients had a normal concentration 27 and 35 days after operation, respectively. In all cases except one, a close correlation between serum alpha-fetoprotein and progression or regression of tumour was found. Serum alphafetoprotein was thus found to be a reliable parameter in post-operative radiation and/or chemotherapy (VAMBLE). In one patient who died 10 months after operation with widespread endodermal sinus tumour growth, only a small terminal increase in serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration was found. Four of the eight women are still alive with normal alpha-fetoprotein concentration, and without clinical evidence of tumour disease.
