Digestive endometriosis: a diagnostic pitfall not to be ignored. Seven selected cases illustrate the problems which arise in the diagnosis and management of digestive endometriosis.

Digestive endometriosis, which is often mistaken for intestinal carcinoma, may have various clinical presentations: latent form discovered during laparotomy, subacute intestinal obstruction, acute abdominal syndrome, or cyclic gynecologic or digestive symptoms. Finally, the therapeutic means of curing these patients and avoiding unnecessary extensive intestinal resection are discussed.
