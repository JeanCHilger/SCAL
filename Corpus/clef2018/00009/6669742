Real-time high-resolution echotomography and oral cholecystography in the study of hyperplastic cholecystosis. A series of 305 patients underwent both cholecystosonography and oral cholecystography. Ultrasounds showed a higher diagnostic accuracy in the diffuse and localized cholesteroloses. Oral cholecystography is still reliable in the diagnosis of adenomyomatosis, especially of the fundus. As present diagnostic and therapeutical indications are nonhomogeneous, early sonographic visualization and follow-up of small cholesterol polyps are valuable for understanding the development of the disease and its clinical and prognostic significance.
