Effect of combined synthetic progestins on blood coagulation properties and alpha 2-glycoprotein content. Blood coagulation properties and the level of pregnancy-related alpha-2-glycoprotein were examined in patients with dyshormonal diseases of the sex organs before and during treatment with combined synthetic progestins containing high (0.1 mg) and low (0.05 mg) doses of estrogen.  The use of these hormonal preparations led to the development of blood coagulation disturbances such as chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation.  A reduction of the estrogen doses contained in the synthetic progestins by 1/2 was found to lessen the degree of those disturbances.  During the treatment with the estrogen-containing drugs, the level of pregnancy-related alpha-2-glycoprotein rose.  A relationship between the doses of the estrogens (contained in the preparations) and the glycoprotein level was found.  It is supposed that the pregnancy-related alpha-2-glycoprotein takes part in the processes of the intravascular coagulation.  (author's)
