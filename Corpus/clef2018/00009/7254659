On the possibility of correlation between an IUD and endometriosis. 2 women, wearers of IUD for 3 and 5 years, without antecedent bynecological pathology were examined for dysmenorrhea, pain, and galactorrhea in one case.  Celioscopy revealed the presence of ovarian endometriosis in both cases.  Both patients were treated with danazol at 800 mg per diem for 6 months prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone values were controlled at beginning of treatment and at every 2 months.  Both patients were completely cured at 6 and at 8 months after beginning of treatment.  It is suggested that a relationship exists between IUD presence and the development of endometriosis, since an IUD may influence all immunity through changes in the hormonal situation
