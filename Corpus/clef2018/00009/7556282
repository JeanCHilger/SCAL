Cell dynamics of undifferentiated carcinomas of the ovary. Immunohistochemical estimation of their growth fraction and apoptotic status. The proliferative and apoptotic status of undifferentiated carcinomas of the ovary was estimated immunohistochemically by antibody for Ki-67 proliferative antigen and Le(Y) apoptotic antigen. Well-differentiated types of ovarian carcinoma were examined for comparison. In 8 cases of undifferentiated carcinomas, the proliferative activity in terms of the growth fraction expressed as percentage of positive nuclei for Ki-67 antigen ranged from 28.2 to 81.2% (mean 60%). In well-differentiated carcinomas, which included 8 serous, 8 mucinous, 4 endometrioid and 4 clear cell adenocarcinomas, the growth fraction ranged from 8.2 to 33.4% (mean 20%). Thus, statistically significant differences were found in the proliferative activity between undifferentiated and well-differentiated ovarian carcinomas. On the other hand, apoptotic status as estimated by Le(Y) staining varied considerably among the cases in both undifferentiated and differentiated carcinoma groups. Nevertheless, in general, undifferentiated carcinomas seemed to be more prone to apoptosis than well-differentiated carcinomas. It is concluded that in ovarian undifferentiated carcinomas, more active cell proliferation takes place with a concomitant cell loss compared to their differentiated counterparts.
