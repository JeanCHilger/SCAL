The galactorrhoea-endometriosis syndrome. A new syndrome consisting of galactorrhoea and endometriosis is described. Nine patients with endometriosis, eight of whom had galactorrhoea either at diagnosis or after treatment with danazol are reported. Prolactin concentrations were normal in seven patients. Galactorrhoea in a woman with regular menstrual periods should suggest a possible diagnosis of underlying endometriosis,  especially if there is a history of dysmenorrhoea.
