Interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and growth hormone levels in human follicular fluid. To investigate possible relationships of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and growth hormone (GH) with biochemical variables in human follicular fluid (FF) and selected in vitro fertilization (IVF) parameters.A total of 67 FF samples (n = 67 patients undergoing oocyte retrieval for IVF) was evaluated. IL-1 beta, IL-6, GH, hLH, FSH, PRL, hCG, testosterone, total protein, fibrinogen, sialic acid, alpha 1-antitrypsin, plasminogen levels, and spectrophotometric absorbance at 458 nm were analyzed for selected FF. IL-6 and GH levels of serum and FF samples were also compared (n = 23).Immunoreactive levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and GH were detected in all FF samples. A positive correlation existed for IL-6 (r = 0.5069, P = 0.0161) when serum-to-FF levels were compared (concentration ratio, 1:1.857). Smaller-volume follicles (< 4 ml) were associated with high IL-1 beta levels (P = 0.0229), and an additional tendency of IL-1 beta to decrease with increasing embryo cleavage and scoring was observed. With the exception of a weak positive correlation between follicular IL-1 beta and testosterone levels (r = 0.3128, P = 0.025), no other relationship with biochemical variables or IVF parameters (etiology, e.g., endometriosis) could be implicated.Substantially higher IL-6 levels occurred in FF compared to serum, thus supporting intrafollicular production. Interleukin-1 beta, IL-6, and GH levels in FF are, however, unsuitable markers for in vitro fertilization outcome.
