The sensitivity of the CA125 immunoradiometric assay for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and its correlation with complex treatment. From 1988 to 1993, 141 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer were treated in our hospital. Histologically, tumors were: 69 serous, 16 mucinous, 6 clear cell, 24 endometrioid, and 26 undifferentiated. Serial serum specimens were obtained from 50 patients at least 2 times in posttreatment 1 to 3 months to observe the correlation between CA125 levels and disease progression or regression. The result showed that CA125 levels were elevated (> 33kU/L) in 65/69 of serous, 0/16 of mucinous, 6/6 of clear cell, 19/24 of endometrioid, 10/26 of undifferentiated tumors. The CA125 determinants was associated with the 80% of cases of nonmucinous epithelial ovarian cancer. Moreover, increases or decreases in CA125 levels have been found to correlate well with disease progression or regression in more than 96% of instances. The determination of CA125 levels may aid in monitoring the response to treatment in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.
