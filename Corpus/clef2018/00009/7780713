Congenital aneurysm of the internal jugular vein in a pregnant woman. A pregnant woman with a symptom-free congenital aneurysm of the internal jugular vein (IJV) is described. A color duplex scan revealed an aneurysm (2.4 cm in diameter) of the right IJV in the mid-neck without evidence of thrombus. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case demonstrating that such a lesion in a pregnant woman can be safely managed without excision.
