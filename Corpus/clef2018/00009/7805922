Association of Chlamydia trachomatis immunoglobulin gamma titers with dystrophic peritoneal calcification, psammoma bodies, adhesions, and hydrosalpinges. To correlate Chlamydia trachomatis immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) titers with psammoma bodies, dystrophic peritoneal calcification, degree of calcification, adhesions, and hydrosalpinges.This is a prospective single-blinded histologic analysis of tissue and retrospective analysis of historical laboratory and clinical variables.Tertiary hospital and private practice patient charts.Sixty consecutive patients with C. trachomatis IgG titers reported on the coding sheets of a previous study for endometriosis.The histologic slides were reviewed in a blinded fashion for calcification. Previously used data sheets were reviewed for C. trachomatis IgG titers. Historical data, adhesion scores, hystrosalpingogram findings, and laparoscopic findings were obtained from charts.Dystrophic calcification, psammoma bodies, moderate-to-severe dystrophic calcification and hydrosalpinges were associated with positive C. trachomatis IgG titers.This study suggests relationship of C. trachomatis with dystrophic calcification, psammoma bodies, adhesions, and hydrosalpinges. This relationship suggests that C. trachomatis IgG titers can be used as a marker to help determine those infertility patients who might best benefit from hysterosalpingogram or laparoscopy and in clinical studies of endometriosis, infertility, pain, or ovarian cancer. However, there is no current data to suggest a need for therapy on the basis of a positive C. trachomatis IgG titer or of dystrophic peritoneal calcification.
