Expression of p53, transforming growth factor alpha, epidermal growth factor receptor, and c-erbB-2 in endometrial carcinoma and correlation with survival and known predictors of survival. Abnormal expression of p53, transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and c-erbB-2 occurs in a variety of cancers and in some cases is associated with poor prognosis. Immunoperoxidase staining using these markers in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded endometrial carcinoma tissue was performed to determine whether immunoreactivity correlates with survival and known prognostic variables. Cases included 84 endometrioid adenocarcinomas, five adenoacanthomas, 12 adenosquamous carcinomas, 11 serous carcinomas, 15 clear cell carcinomas, and one carcinosarcoma for a total of 128 cases. Frequencies of immunoreactivity were as follows: p53, 37 of 128 (29%) TGF alpha, strong (2+) 23 of 128 (18%) and intermediate (1+) 26 of 128 (20%)
