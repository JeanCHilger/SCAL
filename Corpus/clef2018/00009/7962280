Quantitative analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor gene expression in endometriosis. The molecular mechanisms by which endometriosis persists in locations outside the uterus are unclear. Recently, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) has been postulated to have a role in the disease process of endometriosis. To explore this, we determined the levels of EGF-R protein and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression in endometriotic tissues and compared the levels to that of eutopic endometrium. Using rabbit anti-EGF-R antibody, we found more intense immunohistochemical staining for EGF-R in glandular cells than in stromal cells of both endometriomas and endometriotic implants. No difference in staining intensity was noted between endometriotic tissues and eutopic endometrium. A ribonuclease protection assay was used to determine mRNA levels for EGF-R. PhosphoImager analysis revealed the following levels of mRNA for EGF-R eutopic endometrium, 1.00 +/- 0.27 (arbitrary units
