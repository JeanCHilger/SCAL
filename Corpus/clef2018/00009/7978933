Cytokine regulation of cellular proliferation in endometriosis. This study was designed (1) to characterize the resident leukocyte population in ectopic endometrium (EE), (2) to assess proliferative activity of cellular components in EE, (3) to assess whether resident leukocytes in EE express IFN gamma mRNA and (4) to demonstrate endometrial epithelial cell IFN gamma receptors in EE.Biopsies of EE and normal eutopic endometrium (UE) were studied immunocytochemically using monoclonal antibodies specific for CD45 leukocyte common antigen, CD3 (a T cell marker), CD11c (a macrophage marker), and Ki67 (proliferation marker). Leukocyte types were identified immunocytochemically, followed by in situ hybridization to assess expression of IFN gamma mRNA. IFN gamma receptor expression was assessed by immunocytochemistry.The percentage of scattered stromal cells staining for each CD marker was greater in EE than in UE. The proliferative activity of endometrial stromal cells and epithelial cells was significantly less in EE than in UE. The overall concentration of T cells and macrophages expressing IFN gamma mRNA was significantly greater in EE than in UE. The percentage of each leukocyte type expressing IFN gamma mRNA was also greater in EE than in UE, and IFN gamma receptors were present in glandular epithelium of EE.These findings support a possible paracrine role for resident leukocytes and IFN gamma in regulating cell proliferation in endometriosis.
