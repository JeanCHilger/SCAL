Genome scanning detects genetic alterations in human ovarian carcinoma. Genome scanning, originally used to detect mouse mutations, is a technique which can rapidly identify differences between genomic DNA samples. The procedure is essentially a high resolution Southern analysis using a probe that hybridizes to a medium copy number (1000-2000 copies per haploid genome) repetitive element naturally dispersed throughout the genome. This technique detects genetic changes (primarily large scale genetic changes, e.g., amplifications and deletions) as differences in hybridization band intensity. The use of a probe derived from an endogenous human retroviral-like repetitive sequence, the RTVL-H element, has made genome scanning in humans feasible. In this report, the genome scanning technique was used to evaluate genomic DNA extracted from 14 frozen ovarian tumors. These included 8 high grade serous cystadenocarcinomas, 2 endometrioid carcinomas, one malignant mixed mullerian tumor, 2 Krukenberg tumors, and one tumor where histological classification was unavailable. Band amplifications were identified in 11 cases, with the most prominent amplifications observed in the high grade serous cystadenocarcinomas. In some of the cases, the amplifications involved bands of identical molecular size suggesting that similar underlying changes occurred in different tumors and are potentially associated with specific histological tumor types or clinical behavior. Band deletions were also observed in one endometrioid tumor where blood leukocyte genomic DNA was available from the same patient, allowing a direct comparison.
