Effects of gossypol acetate, danazol, progesterone and GnRH-A on estrogen and progesterone receptors of human endometrial cells. In order to evaluate the drugs in treating endometriosis, the direct effects of gossypol acetate, danazol, progesterone, and gonadotropin releasing hormone-agonist (GnRH-A) on the isolated human endometrial cells were determined by DCC assay. The binding capacity of cytosolic estradiol receptor (E2R) and progesterone receptor (PR) in groups treated with gossypol acetate or progesterone decreased. In danazol-treated group, the binding capacity of PR decreased but not that of E2R. GnRH-A showed no significant effect on the binding capacity of E2R and PR. There was a significant linear correlation between the inhibitory rates of PR binding capacity of progesterone and danazol. The results suggested that gossypol acetate, danazol and progesterone might have peripheral effects mediated by steroid receptors, while GnRH-A work clinically through the central path way only.
