Deep vein thrombosis during pregnancy. Antepartum deep vein thrombosis is quite rare in Chinese women during pregnancy. An adequate diagnosis and early treatment are extremely important as the deep vein thrombosis can embolize, in particular, to the pulmonary vasculature. We present a case of pregnancy at 36 weeks gestation complicated by deep vein thrombosis. The objective diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis for obstetric patients is the noninvasive Doppler ultrasound and plethysmography. An early diagnosis is important to reduce maternal and fetal risks related to embolization. Continuous therapy of low dose intravenous heparin is safe and effective during pregnancy.
