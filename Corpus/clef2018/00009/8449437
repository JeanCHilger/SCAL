Pelvic-peritoneal tuberculosis with elevated serum and peritoneal fluid Ca-125 levels. A report of two cases. We report 2 patients with pelvic-peritoneal tuberculosis and elevated serum and peritoneal fluid levels of Ca-125. The first was a young and infertile women who had cul-de-sac nodularity and dysmenorrhea. The other was postmenopausal and presented with weight loss and ascites. While a preoperative diagnosis of endometriosis was made in the former, intraperitoneal malignancy was considered in the latter. The diagnosis of pelvic-peritoneal tuberculosis was reached by laparoscopic-directed biopsy in both patients. Serum levels of Ca-125 returned to normal limits following antituberculous drug treatment.
