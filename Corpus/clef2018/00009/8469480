Pregnancy complicated by Gorham disease. A pregnancy with Gorham disease (massive osteolysis syndrome) is described. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a pregnancy associated with this disease.A 25-year-old woman was seen for pre-conception counseling with the diagnosis of Gorham disease. Before pregnancy, magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a stable disease process. The woman and fetus were followed during pregnancy with ultrasound and consultations. Severe preeclampsia developed at delivery, with a significant thrombocytopenia. We delivered the infant by low forceps, with a good outcome. Subsequently, the mother and child were doing well at 18 months postpartum.We briefly review this rare bone disease as it relates to pregnancy and provide information for preconception counseling.
