Comparison of Doppler with two-dimensional sonography and CA 125 for prediction of malignancy of pelvic masses. To assess the validity of Doppler flow sonography for the prediction of malignancy in adnexal masses and to compare the results with two-dimensional ultrasonographic examination and CA 125 levels.In a cross-sectional study, 55 patients with adnexal masses were examined using Doppler sonography to measure the resistance index of tumor-associated blood flow profiles. In addition, abdominal and transvaginal ultrasound examinations were performed and preoperative CA 125 serum levels were assessed.Sixteen patients had malignant tumors and 39 had benign tumors. A resistance index cutoff of less than or equal to 0.8 showed the highest sensitivity (93.8%), with a specificity of 56.4%, a positive predictive value of 46.8%, and a negative predictive value of 95.7%. Compared with two-dimensional sonographic evaluation using either a scoring system or subjective assessment, and with CA 125 levels, the resistance index showed higher sensitivity and negative predictive value but lower specificity and positive predictive value. False-positive resistance index values were prevalent with endometriosis, leiomyomata, and mucinous cystadenoma. The combination of the resistance index with either the sonographic features or CA 125 increased the sensitivity and negative predictive value to 100%, with only a slight decrease in specificity and positive predictive value, but was not superior to the combination of two-dimensional sonography and CA 125.Doppler sonographic evaluation of resistance indexes in the vessels of adnexal masses increased the sensitivity of two-dimensional sonography and CA 125. However, 46% of positive Doppler results were false and 37.5% of the benign tumors had low resistance indexes, thus limiting the validity of this technique for screening programs.
