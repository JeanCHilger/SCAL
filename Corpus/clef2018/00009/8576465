MRI in predicting the response of ovarian endometriomas to hormone therapy. Our goal was to investigate the usefulness of MRI in predicting the response of endometriomas to hormone therapy.MRI and laparoscopy at the onset of treatment and follow-up MRI after 6 months of hormone therapy were performed in 21 patients with 49 endometriomas. T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained with a 1.5 T apparatus using a body coil. The lesions were divided into a responder group and a nonresponder group according to whether the lesion size decreased by > or = 50% or not.With MRI, shading was seen in 25 of 27 lesions (93%) from the nonresponder group, but in only 6 of 22 (27%) from the responder group. Low SI rim was seen in 59% of the responders and 89% of the nonresponders. Multiplicity in 68% of the responders and in 85% of the nonresponders and irregularity in 41% of the responders and in 78% of the nonresponders were shown. Multiple logistic analysis revealed shading was the most important factor in prediction of the response to hormone therapy.Shading was an important sign in evaluating the response of endometriomas to hormone therapy. MRI may assist in selecting the appropriate therapy for endometriomas.
