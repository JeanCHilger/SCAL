Differential expression of VLA beta 1 (CD29) on monocytes from patients with endometriosis. Previous studies have established that in vitro proliferation of endometrial cells is enhanced by peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) and suppressed by peritoneal macrophages (PM) from patients with endometriosis but only suppressed by PBM and PM obtained from normal subjects. The functional activity of PBM and PM is influenced by the engagement of numerous cell surface receptors with their respective physiological ligands.In this study, PBM and PM from fertile women (Group 1), women with unexplained infertility (Group 2), and women with limited (Group 3) or severe (Group 4) endometriosis were isolated in order to analyze these cells for the expression of CD54, CD58 and HLA-DR (immunoglobulin supergene antigens) CD18 and CD29 (integrins) and CD44 (an addresin). These cell surface antigens are involved in monocyte/macrophage trafficking, activation, signal transduction and/or adhesion.No differences were detected in the percentage of PBM expressing CD18, CD44, CD54, CD58, or HLA-DR among the four groups of subjects. Furthermore, the density of these antigens expressed on PBM was identical in patients and control subjects. In contrast, the percentage of PBM expressing CD29 (also known as VLA beta 1) and the density of CD29 expressed per cell were significantly reduced (P < 0.01) in patients with limited endometriosis compared to controls and patients with severe disease. Interestingly, although the percentage of CD29+ PBM from women with severe endometriosis was not statistically different from the percentage of CD29+ PBM from controls, the density of CD29 expressed per cell was significantly elevated among patients with severe disease. Analysis of PM from the four subject groups revealed no differences in CD29 expression or density. However, the percentage of PM expressing CD18 was significantly decreased in patients with limited (but not severe) endometriosis.Since both CD18 and CD29 play a role in cell trafficking and/or adhesion, alterations in their expression among patients with endometriosis suggest that these integrin beta chains may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.
