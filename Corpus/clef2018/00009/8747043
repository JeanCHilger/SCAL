Clinical value and cumulative pregnancy rates following rigid salpingoscopy during laparoscopy for infertility. This study was designed to evaluate the routine use of rigid salpingoscopy during diagnostic laparoscopy for infertility, and to relate the morphologic image of the endosalpinx with pregnancy outcome. A total of 158 consecutive patients (232 Fallopian tubes) undergoing a diagnostic laparoscopy for infertility were studied. Salpingoscopy was performed at the time of diagnostic laparoscopy for infertility. The intraluminal image was classified using a simplified classification (class I-V). The relationship between this classification and the cumulative pregnancy rates was calculated using life table analysis. Patients with a normal salpingoscopy (class I and II) had a 71% cumulative pregnancy rate. In the intermediate group (class III) the cumulative pregnancy rate was 34%. No intrauterine pregnancies were observed in the group with severe intratubal pathology (class IV and V). Of the 107 slapingoscopies of patients with endometriosis 105 (98%) were class I or II. However, among patients with pelvic adhesions, only 42% were normal. Nine out of 50 abnormal salpingoscopies were found when no tubal factor was suspected during laparoscopy, without any pelvic adhesions. These results suggest that salpingoscopy is an important tool for detecting mucosal abnormalities, and for eventually referring patients for assisted reproductive technology. Salpingoscopy is usually normal in patients with endometriosis, but in patients with non-endometriotic pelvic adhesions it is not.
