Immunohistochemical analysis of endometrial adenocarcinoma for bcl-2 and p53 in relation to expression of sex steroid receptor and proliferative activity. In order to clarify the factors that affect growth of endometrial carcinoma, immunohistochemical analyses of bcl-2, p53, sex steroid receptors, and Ki-67 were performed in 35 cases of endometrial carcinoma (32 endometrioid and three clear-cell carcinomas). Correlation of antigen expression with clinicopathological features was analyzed. Expression of bcl-2 was found in 58.8, 33.3, and 20.0% of grade 1 (G1), grade 2 (G2), and grade 3 (G3) endometrial carcinomas, respectively. Estrogen receptor (ER) was observed in 70.6, 22.2, and 0% of G1, G2, and G3 cases (p < 0.01), respectively. In contrast, expression of p53 was found in 5.8, 33.3, and 60.0% of G1, G2, and G3 cases, respectively. The labeling index of Ki-67 correlated with p53 overexpression (p < 0.01). Lymph node metastases were observed in 6.6 and 5.5% of ER- and PR (progesterone receptor)-positive carcinomas, whereas metastases were observed in 44.4 and 53.3% of ER- and PR-negative carcinomas, respectively (p < 0.05). Lymph node metastases were observed in 50.0% of p53-positive carcinomas, whereas metastases were observed in 22.2% of p53-negative carcinomas (p < 0.05). These results suggest that bcl-2 expression in endometrial carcinomas is regulated in a hormone-dependent manner. Expression of bcl-2 may occur more frequently in estrogen-related, low-grade endometrial carcinomas, whereas p53 overexpression is found more often in endometrial carcinomas in estrogen-unrelated, high-grade endometrial carcinomas with prominent proliferative activity and a high frequency of lymph node metastases.
