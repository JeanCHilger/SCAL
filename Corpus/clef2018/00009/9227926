Laparoscopic surgery in infertile women with minimal or mild endometriosis. Canadian Collaborative Group on Endometriosis. Minimal or mild endometriosis is frequently diagnosed in infertile women. It is often treated by resection or ablation of the lesions, but whether this improves fertility has not been established. We carried out a randomized, controlled trial to determine whether laparoscopic surgery enhanced fecundity in infertile women with minimal or mild endometriosis.We studied 341 infertile women 20 to 39 years of age with minimal or mild endometriosis. During diagnostic laparoscopy the women were randomly assigned to undergo resection or ablation of visible endometriosis or diagnostic laparoscopy only. They were followed for 36 weeks after the laparoscopy or, for those who became pregnant during that interval, for up to 20 weeks of pregnancy.Among the 172 women who had resection or ablation of endometriosis, 50 became pregnant and had pregnancies that continued for 20 weeks or longer, as compared with 29 of the 169 women in the diagnostic-laparoscopy group (cumulative probabilities, 30.7 percent and 17.7 percent, respectively P=0.006 by the log-rank test). The corresponding rates of fecundity were 4.7 and 2.4 per 100 person-months (rate ratio, 1.9Laparoscopic resection or ablation of minimal and mild endometriosis enhances fecundity in infertile women.
