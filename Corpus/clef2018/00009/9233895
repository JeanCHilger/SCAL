Rapid T2-weighted MR imaging of uterine leiomyoma and adenomyosis. To compare three rapid T2-weighted pulse sequences with high-resolution turbo spin-echo (SE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for the diagnosis of leiomyoma and adenomyosis.Eighteen patients referred for evaluation of suspected leiomyoma or adenomyosis underwent imaging at 1.5 T with a phased-array multicoil. Non-breath-hold, fat-saturated sagittal images of 4-7 mm, with equivalent voxel size, were obtained through the pelvis with the following three rapid pulse sequences: segmented, half-Fourier single shot turbo SE (HASTE), turboGRASE (TGSE) and turbo SE MR images. Mean acquisition times were 17 s (HASTE), 37 s (TGSE), and 42 s (turbo SE). These images were compared, in a blinded fashion, to high resolution turbo SE MR images, which are considered the "standard" for pelvic MRI.The three rapid pulse sequences, HASTE, TGSE and turbo SE, provided equivalent diagnostic information when compared with high-resolution turbo SE MR images. There was no significant difference in image quality, detection and localization of leiomyoma or in diagnosis of adenomyosis among the three rapid sequences. HASTE imaging demonstrated the least ghosting.Diagnostic T2-weighted images of benign uterine pathology may be obtained in as little as 17 s.
