Interleukin-8 concentration in peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis and modulation of interleukin-8 expression in human mesothelial cells. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemoattractant and activating factor for human neutrophlls and a potent angiogenic agent. The peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis has been shown to have increased neutrophil chemotactic activity. We postulate that IL-8 may be an important modulator in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and adhesion formation. We first investigated IL-8 concentrations in the peritoneal fluid of women with or without endometriosis, then assessed peritoneal mesothelial cells as a potential source of peritoneal fluid IL-8. Northern blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to investigate IL-8 mRNA and protein modulation. The mean concentration of IL-8 in samples obtained from control patients (n = 28) was 4.8 +/- 0.5 pg/ml from patients with minimal-mild endometriosis (n = 24) was 27.5 +/- 2.6 pg/ml
