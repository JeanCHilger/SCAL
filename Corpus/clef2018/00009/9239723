The pattern of cytokine mRNA expression in ovarian endometriomata. Intraovarian cytokines play a pivotal role in the normal growth and development of the ovarian follicle. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pattern of cytokine mRNA expression in ovarian endometriomata. A total of 10 patients with histologically confirmed endometriomata undergoing surgery formed the study group while nine patients undergoing sterilization with no evidence of a cyst in the ovary formed the control group. Biopsies of the ovary were obtained at surgery and stored in liquid nitrogen until processed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification to identify the presence of mRNA for interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA were expressed by nine and seven patients respectively in the endometriosis group compared with three and one patients in the control group this difference was significant (P < 0.05). IL-1 alpha mRNA was expressed by seven of 10 patients with endometriosis but by only one of the control group
