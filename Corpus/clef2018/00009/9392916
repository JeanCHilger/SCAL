Integrin adhesion molecules in the endometrial glandular epithelium in patients with endometriosis or adenomyosis. To assess the role of beta 1-integrin and E-cadherin molecules in the eutopic glandular epithelium in patients with endometriosis or adenomyosis.Twenty-four patients with endometriosis, and 22 patients with adenomyosis diagnosed histologically were selected as subjects. The controls consisted of 29 fertile women. Eutopic endometria were obtained by curettage or immediately after the operation. The samples were immunohistochemically examined for the expression of very late activation antigen-2 (VLA-2), VLA-3, VLA-4, VLA-5, VLA-6, and E-cadherin.The expression of each VLA molecule and E-cadherin except VLA-4, VLA-5, and VLA-6 was significantly increased throughout the menstrual cycle in endometria in both the endometriosis and adenomyosis groups. In contrast, the expression of VLA-4 in the adenomyosis group was significantly reduced in the secretory phase.Altered expression of beta 1-integrins and E-cadherin was observed throughout the menstrual cycle in patients with endometriosis and adenomyosis, suggesting the defective microenvironment of the endometrium.
