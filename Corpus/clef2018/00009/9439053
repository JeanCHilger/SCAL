Extensive thrombophlebitis with reactive thrombocytosis in a high risk Chinese parturient associated with retained placenta increta: a case report. Postpartum thrombophlebitis is an infrequent disorder in Chinese women. A case is reported of extensive postpartum thrombophlebitis involving 23 cm of the femoral and pelvic veins. This 25-year-old splenectomized victim of beta-thalassemia was bedridden for 12 weeks because of threatened premature labor before Cesarean delivery. During the operation, placenta increta with massive bleeding was encountered. To save the uterus, ten percent of the placenta was retained. Duplex color Doppler imaging was performed for the diagnosis and follow-up of the thrombosis and vigorous anticoagulation therapy successfully cured this patient.
