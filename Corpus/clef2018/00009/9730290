Potential implications of chemokines in reproductive function: an attractive idea. Chemokines are a new family of cytokines specialised in attracting leukocytes, acting in physiological conditions and in pathological processes. A wide variety of cell types in response to exogenous irritants or endogenous mediators of the inflammatory reaction produce them. Pivotal parts of reproductive function are based on inflammatory like processes wherein different leukocytes subsets are recruited and activated to produce paracrine autocrine effects in which cytokines and growth factors are implicated. Since chemokines control leukocyte trafficking and belong to the cytokine superfamily, in this review we analyze the implications of these molecules and related cells in ovulation, embryonic implantation, menstruation, parturition and their role in pathological process such as preterm delivery, endometriosis, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and HIV infection.
