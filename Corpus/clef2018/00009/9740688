Steroid receptor expression in endometria from women treated with tamoxifen. Breast cancer patients receiving tamoxifen (Tam) are at an increased risk for developing endometrial carcinomas, possibly due to the partial estrogenic effect of Tam on endometrial cells. Progestational therapy has not routinely been included in Tam regimens. It was our aim to determine the presence of estrogen receptors (ERs) and progesterone receptors (PRs) in normal and abnormal endometria from postmenopausal women with breast cancer who were treated with Tam. Standard immunohistochemical staining of ERs and PRs was performed on paraffin sections from formalin-fixed uterine curettings or hysterectomy specimens from 40 patients who had received 20-40 mg of Tam daily for a minimum of 3 months. For comparison, normal endometria from 20 women who had not received Tam (11 premenopausal, 9 postmenopausal) were also studied for ER and PR expression. Staining was evaluated using semiquantitative immunoreactivity scores (IRS) ranging from 0 (negative) to 12 (strongly positive). In the group of patients receiving Tam, ERs and PRs were detected in the nuclei of glandular cells in 24/24 cases of endometrial atrophy (ER/PR-IRS, 2-12), in 8/8 endometrial polyps (ER-IRS, 6-12 PR-IRS, 4-12), in 4/4 adenomatous endometrial hyperplasias (ER-IRS, 3-8
