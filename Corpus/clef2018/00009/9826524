Identification of various exon-deleted progesterone receptor mRNAs in human endometrium and ovarian endometriosis. We demonstrated the expression of various exon-deleted progesterone receptor (PR) variant mRNAs in human uterine endometrium and ovarian endometriosis using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-DNA sequencing analyses. In addition to PR wild-type mRNA, various exon-deleted PR variant mRNAs were identified in all samples analyzed. The sequence of these variants showed a perfect junction between exons surrouding the deletion area. PR wild-type, exon 6-deleted, exon 4-deleted, exon 5, 6-deleted and exon 4, 5, 6-deleted PR variant mRNAs were observed in all samples analyzed. Exon 4, 6-deleted PR mRNA was observed only in ovarian endometriosis. This is the first study to demonstrate the coexpression of various PR exon-deleted variant mRNAs with the wild-type in uterine endometrium and ovarian endometriosis. All resulting variant proteins might indicate functional diversity and modify the progestational action of wild-type PR, and thus be involved in the pathophysiology of ovarian endometriosis.
