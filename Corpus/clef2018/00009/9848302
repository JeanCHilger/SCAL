The performance of CA-125 measurement in the detection of endometriosis: a meta-analysis. To assess the diagnostic performance of serum CA-125 measurement in the detection of endometriosis.Meta-analysis.Twenty-three studies comparing serum CA-125 levels and laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis.Serum CA-125 measurement and laparoscopy.Sensitivity and specificity of serum CA-125 measurement in the diagnosis of endometriosis with laparoscopy as the reference standard.The estimated summary receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the performance of serum CA-125 measurement in the diagnosis of endometriosis grade I/IV is limited, whereas its performance in the diagnosis of endometriosis grade III/IV is better.Despite its limited diagnostic performance, we believe that the routine use of serum CA-125 measurement in patients with infertility might be justified. In contrast to laparoscopy, serum CA-125 measurement is an inexpensive test that is not a burden for the patient. It could identify a subgroup of patients who are more likely to benefit from early laparoscopy. Studies reporting on the mutual dependence between serum CA-125 measurement and data from the history and physical examination are needed.
