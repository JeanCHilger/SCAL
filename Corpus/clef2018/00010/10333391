Aneurysm of the ductus arteriosus: a congenital lesion. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical, radiological, and echocardiographic findings in 11 neonates with aneurysm of ductus arteriosus presented in our institutions between 1993 and 1996, and to postulate a new theory for the pathogenesis of this lesion. Medical records, radiographic studies, and echocardiograms were reviewed. All infants underwent follow-up echocardiograms every 2 to 3 days until the aneurysm spontaneously resolved or surgery was performed. The infants were predominantly term males six had evidence of fetal distress, two were diagnosed prenatally by fetal echocardiogram, chest X ray evidenced mediastinal mass in six patients. The first echocardiogram showed structurally normal heart with an aneurysmal patent ductus arteriosus. In eight patients the aneurysm completely resolved by 5 to 10 days. One infant underwent surgical resection of the aneurysm after observation for 11 days with no change in size. Thrombosis of the aneurysm was noted in two patients
