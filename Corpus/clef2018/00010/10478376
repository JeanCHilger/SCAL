Brain stem involvement in eclampsia and HELLP syndrome. Nowadays, eclampsia is a rare complication of pregnancy and the puerperium. However, it is still one of the main causes of maternal morbi-mortality. Systemic findings in eclampsia may sometimes include association with microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia, raised liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia. This clinical combination constitutes the HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platelets). The commonest neurological findings in eclampsia are headache, visual alterations, convulsions and stupor or coma. The presence of clinical symptoms and signs due to brainstem disorders is unusual.We present the case of a thirty year old woman with eclampsia and associated HELLP syndrome, which briefly affected the brain stem. The patient showed progressive general and neurological improvement. Three months afterwards she still had paresia of the sixth right cranial nerve, due to what was presumed to be a right paramedian infarct of the pons.We consider it important not to forget this exceptional association so that suitable treatment may be given to such patients since prognosis is not invariably bad.
