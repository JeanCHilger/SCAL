Sonographic investigation of flow patterns in the perfused human placenta and their modulation by vasoactive agents with enhanced visualization by the ultrasound contrast agent Albunex. Our objective was to demonstrate sonographically the flow distribution in the circulation of human placentae as well as the sensitivity of the human fetal capillary bed to vasoconstriction and dilatation.Five human full-term placental lobules were maintained in vitro with fetal and maternal flow. Commercial ultrasound scanners were used for imaging. Albunex (1 ml bolus) was administered to the fetal "artery" to monitor patterns of flow. U46619 (1 ml, 10(-6) M a thromboxane agonist and potent vasoconstrictor) and/or nitroglycerin (a potent vasodilator) were added to the fetal artery.Following the addition of U46619, mean "fetal pressures" rapidly rose from 23.2 +/- 0.8 to 118 +/- 2. 9 mm Hg (mean +/- standard error of mean p < 0.001)The contrast medium Albunex improved visualization of the fetal circulation throughout the lobule. Flow in the human placental capillary bed can be regionally manipulated throughout the placental lobule by vasomodulators and monitored by Albunex-enhanced sonographic examination.
