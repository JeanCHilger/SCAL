Severe uterine diastolic notch as a prognostic factor in preeclamptic women. To investigate the usefulness of grade II uterine diastolic notch to predict maternal or perinatal outcome during conservative management of preeclampsia.We reviewed medical charts of 35 pregnant women admitted for hypertension and > or =1+ urine dipstick protein determination and who had a uterine Doppler examination at admission. Grade I notch was defined as a 'nadir' in early diastole higher than half of peak diastolic notch velocity. Grade II diastolic notch was defined as a 'nadir' in early diastole lower than half of peak diastolic notch velocity.Thirty-one preeclamptic women were admitted at 30.1+/-3 weeks. Of them, 23 had a grade I notch (group I) and eight a grade II notch (group II). Rates of abruptio placenta, eclampsia, thrombocytopenia, stillbirth, birth weight < or = 3rd centile, fetal distress before delivery and neonatal death were similar in the two groups. Rates of delivery before 32 weeks and newborn spending more than 48 h in neonatal intensive care unit were significantly higher in group II. Admission-to-delivery interval was significantly lower in group II (2.6+/-1.5 vs. 9.4+/-8.7 days, P<0.05).Grade II notch seems to identify in preeclamptic women those with a higher risk of early pregnancy termination.
