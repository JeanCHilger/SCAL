"Lines and tubes" in neonatal intensive care patients. Central catheters in neonatological intensive care patients are used for the prolonged application of medication or parenteral infusions. Dislocations and septic and thromboembolic complications may occur.Radiologically, the correct position of the catheter must be proven. Dislocations or complications associated with central catheters must be diagnosed. For catheter monitoring plain film radiographs are the first line of investigation however, sonography may be of additional assistance. Angiographic techniques should only be performed when conventional noninvasive methods do not supply satisfactory results. Special knowledge is necessary for monitoring catheters that are set via the umbilical artery or vein. The radiological applications for catheter monitoring in the neonate intensive care unit are discussed in this article.
