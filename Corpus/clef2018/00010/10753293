Internal jugular vein thrombosis in association with the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Thrombosis of the internal jugular vein is a rare entity with the potential for serious consequences. Most of the reported cases of jugular venous thrombosis have occurred in the presence of an indwelling venous catheter, an established hypercoagulable state, or in association with head and neck sepsis. This report presents a case of a patient in whom jugular venous thrombosis developed during the first trimester of pregnancy after in vitro fertilization. Thromboembolism in these circumstances can be related to a condition known as the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The presentation of severe neck pain in pregnant women, especially in those who have undergone assisted reproduction procedures, should prompt evaluation by duplex scan to evaluate the jugular veins for thrombosis. Anticoagulation is the treatment of choice.
