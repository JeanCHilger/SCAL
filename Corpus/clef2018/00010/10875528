Neonatal cerebral ischaemia with elevated maternal and infant anticardiolipin antibodies. A baby girl born by elective lower segment caesarean section was found to have left-sided focal seizures at 48 hours after birth. Her mother had previously had a neonatal death at 26 weeks' gestation and another child born at 32 weeks' gestation had a congenital right hemiplegia with a left middle cerebral artery infarct on CT scan. The mother had raised anticardiolipin IgG antibodies at the time of delivery of her second child, with no thrombotic symptoms. Therefore, during this pregnancy, she had been treated with low molecular weight heparin and aspirin. The baby's mother had raised IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies and the baby had IgG anticardiolipin antibodies at the upper range of normal 4 days after delivery. The seizures were controlled with phenobarbitone and phenytoin. CT and MRI scans showed evidence of cerebral ischaemia. A repeat MRI scan at 4 months of age was normal, anticonvulsants were discontinued, and her latest neurological examination at 5 months was normal.
