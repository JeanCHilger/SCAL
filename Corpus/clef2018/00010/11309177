Familial recurrence of spontaneous fetal intracranial hemorrhage: ultrasonographic diagnosis and postnatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We report fetal intracranial hemorrhage in term siblings from consanguineous parents, spontaneously occurring in the third trimester of pregnancy. Prenatal ultrasound in one case and postnatal MRI in both demonstrated massive parenchymal bleeding involving large areas of the cerebral cortex, white and gray matter. Vasculopathies, vascular malformations, coagulopathies, thrombocytopenia and relevant metabolic disorders could be excluded.
