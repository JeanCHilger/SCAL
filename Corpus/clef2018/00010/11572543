Group A streptococcal sepsis and ovarian vein thrombosis after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Group A streptococcal puerperal sepsis is an uncommon peripartum infection that can quickly progress to a fulminant, multisystemic infection and life-threatening toxin-mediated shock. This infection can be asymptomatic during a short hospital stay after a routine delivery. Early treatment with antibiotics might not alter the course of tissue destruction caused by the exotoxin A.Literature searches were performed using the key words "puerperal infections," "streptococcal infections," "septic sacroiliitis," "postpartum septic arthritis," and "postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis." After patient consent was obtained, a report was prepared documenting the disease course, diagnosis, and treatment of a case of puerperal sepsis with multiple serious complications.Puerperal sepsis occurs when streptococci colonizing the genital tract or acquired nosocomially invade the endometrium, adjacent structures, lymphatics, and bloodstream. A lack of symptoms early in the course of infection is common later, minor somatic complaints can quickly progress to septic shock as effects of the exotoxin A are manifest. Women who complain of fever, pelvic pain, or unexplained systemic symptoms in the early postpartum period should have a detailed history and physical examination. All sites of suspected infection should be cultured. If sepsis is suspected, diagnostic imaging includes chest radiographs, contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scans, or magnetic resonance imaging to rule out ovarian vein thrombosis, pelvic abscess, or sacroiliac septic arthritis. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage must be initiated immediately after collection of cultures. Clindamycin plus a beta-lactam antibiotic is preferred for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.
