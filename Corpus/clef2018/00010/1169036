Pulmonary edema and wheezing after pulmonary embolism. A young, pregnant woman with angiographically proved pulmonary emboli developed pulmonary edema and wheezing without evidence of left ventricular failure. This cast study points out the unusual association of pulmonary embolism with pulmonary edema, wheezing, and hyper-reactive airways in a patient with a positive family history of allergy, but no antecedent history of bronchospasm. Mechanisms for the occurrence of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and wheezing after pulmonary embolism are reviewed.
