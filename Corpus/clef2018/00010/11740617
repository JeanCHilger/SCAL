Postpartum ovarian vein thrombophlebitis: sonographic diagnosis. We describe our experience with sonographic diagnosis of ovarian vein thrombosis, an uncommon but dangerous postpartum complication.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of seven patients in our institution who developed postpartum ovarian vein thrombophlebitis within the past 5 years.In all cases the diagnosis was made by ultrasound, which showed tubular hypoechoic masses lateral to the great abdominal vessels. The postpartum ovarian vein thrombophlebitis was on the right side in six cases and on the left side in one. In five cases, it protruded into the inferior vena cava. The first three cases were referred to computed tomography after the sonographic diagnosis. In the last four cases, the diagnosis relied solely on sonography and no further evaluation was necessary.Sonographic examination can be diagnostic for ovarian vein thrombosis if performed very carefully in symptomatic postpartum patients.
