Monitoring for suspected pulmonary embolism. It is fortunate that serious embolic phenomena are uncommon because, with the exception of neurosurgery in the sitting position and cardiac surgery, thoracic echocardiography and the precordial Doppler device, the most sensitive indicators of embolism, are seldom used. Vigilance is required of the anesthesiologist to recognize the rapid fall in end-tidal PCO2, the usual first indicator of a clinically significant PE. Any sudden deterioration in the patient's vital signs should include embolism in the differential diagnosis, particularly during procedures that carry a high risk of the complication.
