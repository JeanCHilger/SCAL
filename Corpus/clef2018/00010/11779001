Ultrasound diagnosis of postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis: case report. Postpartum ultrasound investigation of a woman with unremitting fever and right flank pain after Cesarean section revealed an extensive thrombosis of the right ovarian vein which extended into the inferior vena cava. Computed tomography was required to substantiate the diagnosis. Medical treatment with intravenous urokinase and heparin and antibiotics was successfully performed. During the postpartum period, the possibility of ovarian vein thrombosis should be considered in febrile patients with abdominal pain who are not responding to antibiotics, and imaging studies such as ultrasound and computed tomography should be performed early for prompt diagnosis and therapy.
