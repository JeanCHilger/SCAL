Optimal monitoring in EPH gestosis and idiopathic placentar insufficiency (author's transl). EPH gestosis and placental insufficiency sui generis are cause of fetal hazards. Clinical symptomatology and anamnesis indicate different tests to detect pathological conditions for the fetus. HPL, HCG, urinary estriol, measuring the placental flow-rate, ultrasonic diagnosis as all other usual examinations during pregnancy were carried out. In EPH gestosis a reduction of all placental functions was found like as for thrombocytes and fibrinogen. Placental insufficiency showed an even greater reduction of placental function, only thrombocytes and fibrinogen remained constant. Weight and length of the newborn were according the pathological placental function reduced. Morphology of the placenta could proof the results of the previous done tests.
