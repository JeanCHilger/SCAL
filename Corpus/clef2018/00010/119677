Ultrasonographic diagnosis of intervillous thrombosis related to Rh isoimmunization. Greyscale ultrasonography of the placenta was performed in 54 primigravidae with placentas located on the anterior wall of the uterus, in a longitudinal study. During pregnancy single and multiple 'nodular increased transsonity' was seen echoscopically in the placenta. After birth these findings proved to be highly correlated to 'intervillous thrombosis'. The clinical value of these findings is discussed.
