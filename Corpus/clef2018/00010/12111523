The use of a Greenfield filter to treat a pregnant woman for internal jugular venous thrombosis: report of a case. Internal jugular venous thrombosis is an unusual entity with the potential to develop into pulmonary embolism (PE). A 28-year-old woman at 15 weeks gestational age of pregnancy was referred to our hospital for pain and swelling on the left side of her neck. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography of her neck revealed an occlusion of the left internal jugular vein. Left internal jugular venous thrombosis was thus diagnosed. She was successfully treated by placement of a Greenfield filter in the superior vena cava and delivered a full-term healthy infant. This procedure could be an effective and safe method to prevent PE in patients of internal jugular venous thrombosis in whom anticoagulation therapy has either failed or is contraindicated.
