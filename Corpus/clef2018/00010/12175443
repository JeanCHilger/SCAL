Reduced red blood cell deformability, an indicator for high fetal or maternal risk, is found in preeclampsia and IUGR. Red blood cell (RBC) deformability is one of the factors determining microcirculation. In preeclampsia (PE) and some cases of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), microcirculation appears to be reduced. The aim of the study is to examine whether there are differences in RBC deformability in uncomplicated pregnancy when compared to pregnancies complicated by PE and/or IUGR.RBC deformability of 87 pregnant women with initially normal pregnancies was evaluated with the laser diffractoscope. RBC deformability was measured beginning in week 16 of gestation up to 5 days after delivery. Thirty-seven women had an uncomplicated pregnancy. In addition, RBC deformability of 10 nonpregnant women was measured on days 5 and 22 of their menstrual cycle. RBC deformability of women with preeclampsia (PE, N=15), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR, N=17), or PE plus IUGR (N=17) was measured weekly, beginning with the onset of clinical symptoms, up to 5 days after delivery.In early uncomplicated pregnancies, RBC deformability does not differ from the nonpregnant state. At week 30 of gestation, there is a slight decrease in RBC deformability followed by a return back to the values of nonpregnant women after delivery. Women with PE and/or IUGR show reduced RBC deformability. This is most pronounced in cases with severe fetal or maternal complications. After delivery, RBC deformability also returns to nonpregnancy values within 5 days.Reduced RBC deformability may contribute to a reduced microcirculation in PE and IUGR. Increasing RBC deformability therapeutically in these cases could offer new options for the treatment of decreased uterine and fetal perfusion and their sequelae.
