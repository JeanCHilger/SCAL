Thrombosis of the suprahepatic veins (Budd-Chiari syndrome) (author's transl). The suprahepatic veins occlusion or Budd-Chiari syndrome is an infrequent disease which etiology is very hard to obtain. In this paper the authors present the clinical case of a 26 years old female with epigastric pain, ascites, and vomite, iniciated just one month after her parturition and of six months evolution. 28 days after the admission the patient died and the post-mortem study showed complete obstruction of the suprahepatic veins by well organized thrombi. The authors point-out that the interrelation between this syndrome and the parturition is more frecquent than with the use of oral contraceptive drugs.
