Structural, functional and circulatory placental changes associated with impaired glucose metabolism. To investigate associations between structural, functional and circulatory placental changes in pregnancies complicated by impaired glucose metabolism.Umbilical artery (UA) blood flow resistance was measured by Doppler velocimetry in 21 gravidae with diabetes/impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 10 healthy gravidae. Umbilical and placental vessel segments were incubated for determination of prostacyclin and thromboxane synthesis, and tissues histologically examined. Non-parametric statistical tests at a two-tailed P<0.05 were used.Placental lesions were more common in diabetes/IGT and, although not being an uniform finding, in general associated with a higher vascular synthesis of thromboxane and/or lower prostacyclin/thromboxane synthesis ratio. As an exception, ischemic villitis was associated with a higher ratio and higher UA flow resistance.Placental lesions are associated with an altered vascular prostanoid synthesis in diabetes/IGT, but not until structural signs of ischemia develop is a rise of UA blood flow resistance detected.
