Streptokinase treatment of deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremity. Clinical, phlebographic and plethysmographic evaluation of early and late results. The investigation comprises 19 patients with acute deep vein thrombosis of the leg treated with streptokinase. The acute clinical symptoms rapidly subsided in 15 patients. Phlebography, performed immediately after treatment, revealed complete thrombus regression in 7 cases, restoration of venous flow but remnants of thrombi in 4 and no effect in 7. One woman was not evaluated radiologically due to pregnancy. The phlebographic restoration seemed to be correlated to the duration of the thrombotic symptoms. Follow-up examinations 6-50 months after the thrombotic incident demonstrated normal phlebograms in 8 patients, all of whom were also free from post-thrombotic symptoms. Venous occlusion plethysmography confirmed that these patients had a normal venous outflow capacity and valvular function in the relevant limbs. By contrast, the remaining 11 patients, with more or less extensive remnants of thrombi at the follow-up phlebography, were found to have plethysmographic signs of venous obstruction and sometimes also valvular insufficiency. The results indicate that thrombolytic treatment is able to give a complete and lasting anatomical and functional restitution of the deep veins after an acute thrombosis in the leg, provided that treatment is induced early enough.
