Factor V Leiden mutation. Successful outcome of a pregnancy after heparin therapy. Several reports have highlighted the significant correlation between maternal thromboembolism pathologies, such as factor V Leiden mutation, and the occurrence of gestational pathologies. The main causes of thromboembolism pathologies are the inherited coagulopathies. The most common genetic predispositions include autosomal dominant inheritance coagulative factors deficiencies, such as antithrombin III (AT III), C protein (CP), S protein (SP), G20210A mutation, hyperomocystinemia and the activated C protein resistance, caused by factor V Leiden mutation. Maternal thromboembolism as an inherited coagulopathy expression, may be associated with high fetal-maternal morbidity and mortality rate. Nowadays, a wide screening is not possible, but the patients with previous or familiar deep venous thrombosis episodes should at least undergo very careful examinations. In the present case the patient's knowledge of her own status as a factor V Leiden mutation carrier , the prophylactic therapy performed, and the frequent fetal and maternal monitoring allowed us to avoid the recurrence of the dramatic events occurring during her first pregnancy.
