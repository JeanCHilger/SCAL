Successful use of tissue plasminogen activator in catheter-related intracardiac thrombus of a premature infant. The incidence of clinically apparent neonatal thrombosis is about 0.1 to 0.2% in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The optimal treatment modalities for neonates with thromboses are not known. We report on our experience with recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in a premature infant with an intracardiac thrombus.
