Wandering spleen presenting as acute pancreatitis in pregnancy. Wandering spleen most frequently presents clinically with gastrointestinal bleeding and thrombocytopenia.A 24-year-old multiparous patient at 36 weeks' gestation presented with pancreatitis. Incidental thrombocytopenia was discovered. A 2722-g female neonate was delivered by repeat cesarean from a breech presentation. The spleen was observed at the left margin of the incision. An evaluation of the pancreatitis included a computed tomography study demonstrating an enlarged spleen twisted on its pedicle and displaced inferiorly. Esophagogastric duodenoscopy performed in evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding showed persistent gastric varices. Multiple transfusions were required. A splenectomy was performed. The recovery was uncomplicated.In this case of a wandering spleen, pancreatitis resulted from torsion and obstruction of the tail of the pancreas within the splenic pedicle and was effectively treated with splenectomy. Thrombocytopenia occurred as a result of sequestration of platelets in the enlarged spleen. Persistent gastric varices and subsequent gastrointestinal bleeding occurred secondary to splenic vein obstruction.
