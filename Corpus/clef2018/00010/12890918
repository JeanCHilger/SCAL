Usefulness of a second temporary vena cava filter for preventing acute pulmonary thromboembolism. The usefulness of a temporary inferior vena cava filter (t-IVC-f) for the prevention of acute pulmonary thromboembolism (APTE) associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been established, but not the requirement for an additional therapeutic method when the t-IVC-f has captured a thrombus. A woman underwent implantation of a t-IVC-f just caudal to the bifurcation of the renal vein immediately before cesarean section (C/S) for VTE that had occurred during the third trimester of pregnancy. After receiving a combination of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic therapies after the C/S, the t-IVC-f was found to contain a thrombus and in order to prevent its dissemination during the removal of the closed filter, another filter was inserted and expanded proximal to the first. Insertion of an additional t-IVC-f may prevent occurrence of APTE during removal of the primary filter containing a friable thrombus after fibrinolytic therapy, and the technique proved useful in the present case of VTE during pregnancy.
