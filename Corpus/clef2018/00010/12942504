Prenatal diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis by ultrasound. Neonatal portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a rare condition seen in the setting of thrombophilia or after umbilical vein catheterization. We report a case of fetal PVT with abnormal antenatal ultrasound findings at 27 weeks of gestation. This presented initially as dilation of the intrahepatic umbilical vein. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case evaluated prenatally. Color Doppler ultrasound was valuable in detecting constriction of the vessel with a high-velocity jet seen past the obstruction site. A discussion of this condition and differential diagnosis is presented.
