Intrauterine brain damage in nonimmune hydrops fetalis. Nonimmune hydrops fetalis has been described in a large number of pathological conditions, but brain aspect has been poorly explored. We report the neuropathological findings in a series of 38 fetuses and neonates with anasarca of various origin. Fourteen fetal cerebral ultrasonograms were available 8 presented some abnormalities. On brain examination, 23 cases showed hypoxic-ischemic lesions. The white matter was the main site of damage that consisted in classical leucomalacia or other features such as: astrocytic glial reaction, microcalcifications and microthromboses either as isolated finding or in association. Anoxic neuronal damage was much less frequent. Anemia, hypoprotidemia and cardiac failure with hypotension, which often occur in hydrops fetalis, may account for brain perfusion failure and hypoxic-ischemic changes.
