The search for thrombophilic gene mutations in women with gestational hypertension does not help in predicting poor pregnancy outcome. To evaluate whether genetic thrombophilic mutations, biochemical and biophysical indices help to predict pregnancy outcome in women with gestational hypertension.A group of 59 women with gestational hypertension were prospectively tested between 24 and 26 weeks of gestation for: (i) DNA analysis to search for gene mutations of Factor V Leiden, prothrombin, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-I) polymorphism (ii) maternal serum concentrations of homocysteine and PAI-1, activated protein resistance and Factor II:C activity levelsEighteen women had a poor pregnancy outcome (11 with severe pre-eclampsia, of whom two had superimposed FGR three with full HELLP syndrome, of whom one had DICOnly Factor II:C activity levels, uterine arterial Doppler and a history of familial hypertension are useful in predicting poor pregnancy outcome in gestational hypertension.
