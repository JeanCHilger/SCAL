Neonatal transcatheter occlusion of a large coronary artery fistula with Amplatzer duct occluder. A large fistula from the right coronary artery to the right atrium was diagnosed in a fetus at 22 weeks of gestation. Following delivery, the baby developed cardiac failure. The fistula was occluded at 3 weeks of age by transcatheter implantation of an Amplatzer duct occluder. Large coronary fistulas can be closed safely with a device even at this early age. Vigilance for ischemic events is required following implantation because of the rare possibility of thrombus extension proximally into the native coronary artery or spasm of the coronary artery.
