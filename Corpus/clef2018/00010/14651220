Successful pregnancy in a young woman with essential thrombocythemia treated with platelet apheresis. We report a 27-year-old woman with essential thrombocythemia who had delivered a healthy baby after Caesarian section. The patient was treated with two courses of platelet apheresis at the beginning of the gestation. Subsequent to this procedure, the platelet count decreased progressively and remained at about 500,000/microl of blood until delivery without any further treatment. Caesarian section was performed at the 37th week when the placenta presented grade III lesions on ultrasound examination. Histology of the placenta revealed multiple infarcts. Platelet count in the newborn was normal. We concluded that essential thrombocythemia is not a risk factor for pregnancy, and that platelet count may decrease during pregnancy. In addition, an emergent reduction of platelets may easily be obtained by platelet apheresis.
