Fatal intracranial hemorrhage in a pregnant patient with autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy is a frequent cause of hematological consultation. Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura results from platelet destruction due to autoantibodies. Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage is a rare but devastating complication of these patients. We present a fatal case of intracranial hemorrhage in a 18 week pregnant woman diagnosed with autoimmune thrombocytopenia. The clinical course and treatment of this unusual clinical complication is discussed in relation to the world literature.
