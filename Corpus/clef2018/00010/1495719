Axillary vein thrombosis during pregnancy: a case report. A 32-year-old multiparous woman had progressive swelling of the right arm at 32 weeks' gestation, accompanied by cyanosis and a preserved radial pulse. Phlebography demonstrated a 5-cm thrombus in the axillary vein. No known etiologic factors were found. Intravenous heparin administration resulted in rapid resolution of the clinical findings. Subcutaneous heparin 10,000 U/day was administered for secondary prophylaxis until cesarean at 39 weeks, during which a full dose was administered without complications. Axillary vein thrombosis during pregnancy may be diagnosed by either phlebography or duplex scanning, and preferably should be treated by heparin. Thrombolytic therapy is justified mainly for life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism.
