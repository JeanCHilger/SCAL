A trial of low-dose aspirin therapy in high-risk pregnancy. Intra-uterine growth retardation, intra-uterine fetal death and pre-eclampsia have common abnormalities: A reduction of uteroplacental perfusion, lack of vasodilation of spiral arteries and subsequent thrombosis. These physiological processes have been explained by an imbalance between prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 production. Many studies have suggested that treatment with low-dose aspirin and steroids is effective in preventing pregnancy loss or pre-eclampsia, but the mechanism has not been established. We evaluated the effectiveness of these therapies in patients at risk for pregnancy loss with the aspect of intracellular ionized calcium mobilization. Low-dose aspirin directs the prostacyclin/thromboxane A2 balance to the dominance of prostacyclin and steroids suppress the activities of lupus anticoagulant or antiphospholipid antibodies. The intracellular ionized calcium concentration in platelets is decreased significantly after these therapies. Concerning the pathological examination of placenta, there were deposits of fibrin in only 2 out of 8 cases and there were no abnormal findings in the other 6 cases. These data show that the aggregation of platelets is suppressed in microvascular circulations. These therapies do not cause any adverse effect on the mother or fetus. It is concluded that low-dose aspirin therapy with steroids is useful for patients with a poor obstetrical history.
