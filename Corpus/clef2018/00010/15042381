A study of pregnancy loss in 352 women with recurrent miscarriages. The aim of the study was to investigate the type of pregnancy loss (PL) in women with recurrent miscarriages.The study population included 411 women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) attending the Recurrent Miscarriage Clinic of the 2nd Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Athens (tertiary referral center). Subjects were divided in groups according to their underlying pathology and in some of them appropriate treatment was applied.The study of the 323 pregnancies achieved after referral, revealed that the PL after ultrasonographic detection of fetal heart (FH) is overall increased, is more common in women with anatomical uterine anomalies and unexplained RPL, and treatment reduces its rate in women with anatomical uterine anomalies and an inadequate luteal phase. The PL before the detection of FH is reduced after treatment in women with thrombotic tendency and an inadequate luteal phase.
