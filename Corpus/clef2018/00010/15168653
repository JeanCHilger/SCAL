Antiphospholipid syndrome and pregnancy. The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLS) is multisystem, autoimmune disease, which is characterized by: thrombosis, obstetrics complications and thrombocytopenia. The two most clinically significant antiphospholipid antibodies (APLa) that are associated with recurrent pregnancy loss and thrombosis are anticardiolipin antibodies (ACL) and lupus anticoagulant (LA). The laboratory diagnosis is based on the presence of moderate to high positive ACL and/or LA. The inhibitory effect of antiphospholipid antibodies /APLa/ on trophoblast intercellular fusion, hormone production and invasion may cause pregnancy loss. Once placentation is established their thrombogenic action leads to decreased placental perfusion and subsequent infarction. The APLa--mediated inhibition of trophoblastic invasion and APLa--mediated vasculopathy in the placental bed arteries result in abnormal uterine artery /UA/ Doppler waveforms. The association between APLa and high resistance index /RI/ and/or diastolic notch /DN/ in the Doppler waveforms is high predictive for adverse pregnancy outcome, including pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, placental abruption, intrauterine fetal death. Maternal treatment and careful monitoring of fetal well-being are mandatory in the management of these high-risk pregnancies.
