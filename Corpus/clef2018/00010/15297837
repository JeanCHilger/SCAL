Extracranial carotid aneurysm related to pregnancy. Carotid aneurysms are rare, and pregnancy-related carotid aneurysms are rarer still. We report the case of an extracranial carotid aneurysm related to pregnancy. It was noted in the 20th week of gestation, and was uncomplicated. Surgery was successfully performed urgently to preempt embolism or rupture. The patient had a full-term normal delivery. The graft is patent, and the patient has no symptoms at 28-month follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the first successful repair of an extracranial carotid aneurysm during pregnancy.
