A case of pulmonary embolic metastasis of choriocarcinoma presenting with multiple pulmonary infiltrative shadows. A 34-year-old woman visited our hospital complaining of dry cough. Chest radiography and computed tomography showed bilateral multiple infiltrative shadows over the lung field. After an initial diagnosis of pneumonia, antibiotics were administered, but the therapy failed to improve the symptoms and abnormalities observed on the chest radiograph. The patient was then admitted to our hospital. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was slightly bloody, but we were not able to make any specific findings in BALF. In order to confirm the pathological diagnosis, video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy was performed aiming at the right middle and lower lobes. There were bleeding pulmonary infarctions in a biopsy specimen from the right middle lobe. Atypical cells positive for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) proliferated in the pulmonary arteries, and so a diagnosis of pulmonary embolic metastasis of choriocarcinoma was made. After the diagnosis, it became clear that urine and serum hCG values were very high. The patient has since received systemic chemotherapy in the gynecology unit at our hospital. Pulmonary embolic metastasis of choriocarcinoma diagnosed by video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy has never been reported in the literature. However, early hCG measurement may have detected this syndrome in the earlier stages, and pulmonary metastasis of choriocarcinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of women with past pregnancy presenting with intractable multiple pulmonary shadows.
