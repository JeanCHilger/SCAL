Bilateral pleural effusion and ascites in the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. We describe a pregnant woman with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with bilateral pleural effusion and ascites. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is an iatrogenic complication of ovarian stimulation, characterized by a massive crossing of a protein-rich fluid from the vascular compartment into the peritoneal, pleural, or to a lesser extent, pericardial cavities. Management is usually conservative, with fluid and electrolytes correction and thromboprophylaxis. Prevention is very difficult, but an age younger than 35 years, low body mass index, polycystic ovarian disease, a high number of follicles, a high plasma oestradiol concentration, pregnancy, hyperandrogenism, and hypothyroidism are predisposing factors.
