Neonatal pelvic ectasia: long-term outcome and association with ureterovesical anomalies. To analyze the outcome of neonatal pelvic ectasia (PE) and the association between this entity and vesicoureteral reflux and/or other urinary tract abnormalities.We performed a retrospective study of 255 children (205 boys, 50 girls) with an ultrasonographic diagnosis of PE in the first month of life. The initial ultrasonographic examination was indicated by urinary tract infection in 30 neonates, abnormalities in the prenatal ultrasonographic examination in 150 and by other reasons in 75. Pelvic ectasia was classified in four stages according to anteroposterior pelvic diameter: I < 1 cm, II 1-1.5 cm, III 1.6-2 cm, and IV > 2 cm.Pelvic ectasia was bilateral in 153 children (60 %) and unilateral in 102 (left side in 81.4 % and right side in 18.6 %). Stage I was found in 75.49 %, stage II in 20.34 %, stage III in 3.9 % and stage IV in 0.24 %. The mean follow-up was 32.6 +/- 25.2 months. At the end of the first year, the results of renal ultrasound were normal in 70.2 % of left-sided PE and in 55.9 % of right-sided PE, but 46 patients (18 %) showed worsening of PE between the first and second ultrasound scans. Voiding cystourethrography was performed in 79.6 % of the children and some abnormalities were found in 50 (24.6 %): urethral dilatations in two patients and vesicoureteral reflux in 48. No correlation was found between vesicoureteral reflux and the degree of ectasia (74 % had an anteroposterior diameter of < or = 1 cm). Urinary tract infection was present in 24.3 % of the children and 13 required surgery (eight pyeloplasties, four urethral reimplantations and two resections of type III urethral valves).Neonatal PE was more prevalent in boys (4:1) and was more frequently located on the left side in both sexes. Associated vesicourethral reflux was found in 23.64 % with no correlation between the degree of dilation and the presence or degree of reflux. Consequently, cystourethrography should be performed in any child with pelvic ectasia, regardless of stage, side or sex.
