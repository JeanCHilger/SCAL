Characteristics of six newborn infants with postnatal findings of severe intracranial haemorrhage. The objective of this study was to study the characteristics of newborn infants with postnatal findings of severe neonatal intracranial haemorrhage.All the records of babies who underwent surgery from 1997 to 2002 for intracranial haemorrhage were reviewed. These were correlated with their antenatal records to see if fetal intracranial haemorrhage had been detected at the 20 weeks' screening scan or any other incidental scan e.g. growth scan. The perinatal records were also reviewed to see if there was associated birth trauma such as instrumentation or obstetric manoeuvres at delivery.Six cases of severe intracranial haemorrhage were diagnosed postnatally. Of these, only 1 case was detected antenatally on ultrasound scan. None of the cases were due to birth trauma. Three babies were found to have clotting factor deficiency. One of them subsequently developed cerebral palsy. One baby was diagnosed to have alloimmune thrombocytopenia. One case underwent an emergency Caesarean section for non-reassuring fetal status. Extensive intracranial haemorrhage, attributed to hypoxia, was found. The baby died.Our study suggests that neonatal intracranial haemorrhages are not exclusively due to birth trauma. The study also shows that fetal intracranial haemorrhage may not be detected antenatally by the routine practice. The causes in our study included clotting deficiency, alloimmune thrombocytopenia and hypoxia.
