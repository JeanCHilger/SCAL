Prenatal recognition of central nervous system complications of alloimmune thrombocytopenia. The radiological findings associated with alloimmune thrombocytopenia have not been well described.

An awareness of this entity and its early diagnosis and intervention may greatly reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with alloimmune thrombocytopenia.
