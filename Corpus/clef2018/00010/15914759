Thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke in late pregnancy with intra-arterial recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. The most common presentation of ischemic stroke related to pregnancy is arterial occlusion, occurring during the third trimester or postpartum. The authors present the first successful administration of intra-arterial cerebral tissue plasminogen activator to treat an embolic cerebral vascular accident in a 37-week parturient resulting in complete recovery of neurological function.The patient presented with left hemiplegia, left-sided neglect, and aphasia. Right internal carotid artery cerebral angiogram showed occlusion of the mid-M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). After 15 mg of tissue plasminogen activator was administered via intra-arterial route, there was greatly improved retrograde flow through the posterior communication artery and the MCA territory.A reduction in size of the MCA occlusion was noted with improvement of antegrade flow through the MCA. Three days after the procedure, the patient was induced successfully and delivered a healthy infant vaginally.This report describes the use of intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator in the setting of stroke in late pregnancy.
