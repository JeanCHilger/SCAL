Contrast column interruption artefact in computed tomography pulmonary angiography. Interruption of the contrast column during inspiration can lead to non-diagnostic CT pulmonary angiograms. The importance of this artefact will increase with more CT studies being performed for pulmonary embolism on multidetector row CT. We describe here an instance of such an artefact and discuss its aetiology.
