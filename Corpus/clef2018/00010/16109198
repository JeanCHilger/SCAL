Ischemic cerebral infarction in a young woman undergoing gonadotropin treatment for infertility. We describe a case of a 27-year-old previously healthy woman with a homonymous hemianopsia caused by thrombosis of a branch of the posterior cerebral artery. The woman had been treated with gonadotropin due to infertility and gone through in vitro fertilisation before the symptoms started. She was pregnant in the first trimester when we first saw her. We did not find any predisposing factors, and the clinical examination, including biochemical analysis, MRI arteriography and echocardiography, did not reveal any cause for the cerebral infarction (CI). The risk of CI during pregnancy itself is less than among non-pregnant women (0, 7) but increases in the postpartum period (8, 7). The cause of cerebral infarction in this case was idiopathic, but we must be aware of the possible link between treatment with gonadotropin for infertility and the development of cerebral infarction.
