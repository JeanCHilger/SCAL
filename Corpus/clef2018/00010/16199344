Emergency department ultrasound and echocardiography. Bedside sonography has become an important tool in the emergency physician's diagnostic armamentarium. Sonography is useful in the evaluation of a number of conditions, including cholecystitis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and ectopic pregnancy. Applied to the heart, sonography aids in the assessment of pericardial tamponade, electromechanical dissection, pulmonary embolus, and other cardiorespiratory emergencies. Echocardiography also has a role in differentiating patients with cardiac activity from those in ventricular standstill and in estimating central venous pressure. This article reviews these and other clinical applications and the physics of ultrasound, techniques for sonographic evaluation, and the practical aspects of emergency department use, such as strategic placement of the equipment for quick activation and storage of collected data.
