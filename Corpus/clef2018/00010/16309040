Umbilical artery thrombosis. A report of a case and review of the literature. The thrombosis of the umbilical vessels is associated to high prenatal mortality. The arterial occlusion can compromise the maternal-fetal circulation with the neonatal death. Only two cases are reported in the literature with antepartum diagnosis and neonatal survival. We present the case of a 24 years old primigravida patient at 35 weeks normal pregnancy who was admitted in the hospital for diminution of the fetal movement's perception. The diagnosis was made with Doppler ultrasound of umbilical vessels in biophysical fetal evaluation we decided pregnancy interruption with cesarean surgery. Cesarean delivery produced a male with Apgar scores of 8-9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively, who was discharged one week later without vital compromise.
