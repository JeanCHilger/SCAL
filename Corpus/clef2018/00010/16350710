Succenturiate placenta: a rare variant in Rivers State Nigeria (a report of one case). The objective of this paper is to highlight the complications associated with succenturiate placenta in pregnant women.A case report of succenturiate placenta. Thorough examination of the placenta grossly and histologically as well as autopsy of the fetus following standard procedure to confirm the gestational age and to ascertain the cause of death was undertaken by the authors.The succenturiate lobe was attached to the major placenta by fibrous tissue which was transversed by blood vessels. The visceral surface showed haemorrhagic necrosis and thrombosis and these led to placental insufficiency resulting in fetal death.This rare placental abnormality showed that abnormal placental can be responsible for intrauterine fetal death. This can be detected through the use of ultrasonography.
