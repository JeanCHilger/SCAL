Ultrasound detection of placental insufficiency in women with 'unexplained' abnormal maternal serum screening results. Serious placental insufficiency results in perinatal death or preterm birth from ischemic-thrombotic pathology, a process which has its origins in placental maldevelopment in the first trimester. A proportion of at-risk pregnancies may be identified from abnormalities in first or second trimester serum screening data, uterine artery Doppler waveforms or placental shape and texture at the time of the 18-20-week anatomical examination. In combination, these tests may be capable of recognizing a subset of at-risk pregnancies with 50% positive predictive values. Early recognition before fetal viability affords opportunities to direct women to regional perinatal care centres for enhanced maternal-fetal surveillance, corticosteroids to enhance fetal lung maturation, prophylactic measures to prevent pre-eclampsia and optimal decision making around the time of delivery. The creation of regional screening programs to use screening data with a placental focus is likely to be cost-effective, because existing patterns of care are utilized. More importantly, this strategy can direct women to participate in clinical research programs designed to reduce morbidity and mortality from this common group of conditions.
