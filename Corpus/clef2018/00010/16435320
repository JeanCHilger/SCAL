Prenatal diagnosis and therapy of upper extremity vascular malformation causing high cardiac output and Kasabach-Merritt sequence: a report of two cases. We present two cases of upper extremity vascular malformation causing a high output state in the prenatal period. One fetus responded well to transplacental digitalis treatment. Both newborns had a Kasabach-Meritt sequence including anemia and thrombocytopenia. Postpartum treatment included successful interventional occlusion of the main feeding arteries and subsequent surgical removal of the tumor.
