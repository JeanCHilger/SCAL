The effect of anticoagulation on antenatal ultrasound findings in pregnant women with thrombophilia. To assess whether treatment with heparin alters ultrasound findings in pregnant women with inherited thrombophilia.This was a retrospective study of a cohort of patients referred for pregnancy complications who were found to have genetic thrombophilia. Ultrasounds were reviewed in treated and untreated pregnancies for the presence of growth restriction, oligohydramnios or abnormal Doppler results.There were a total of 178 pregnancies in 51 patients. The overall percentage of abnormal ultrasounds was significantly greater in the untreated compared with treated pregnancies (52.8% vs. 27.9% p = 0.024.) Growth restriction and abnormal Doppler results were more common in untreated pregnancies. There was a significantly decreased risk of oligohydramnios with treatment (27.3% vs. 7%Treatment markedly improves ultrasound parameters of growth, fluid and feto-placental blood flow in patients with thrombophilia. The presence of abnormalities despite treatment reinforces the need for close antenatal surveillance.
