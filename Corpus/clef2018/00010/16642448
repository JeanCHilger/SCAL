Cerebrovascular accidents in full-term newborn infants. The purpose of this paper is to review the role of the neurologist in the management of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) (insults resulting from a sudden obstruction or rupture of an intracranial vessel). This was accomplished by reviewing the literature (PubMed) under the heading of stroke and term neonate.CVA in full-term neonates are classified as hematomas and infarcts. Hematomas are classified according to: location, structure (arterial, venous, or sinus), type of malformation (aneurysm, venous malformation, and telangiectasia), and cause of the bleed (vessel wall rupture or hypo-coagulation). Classification according to location is based on compartment supra or infratentorial space -extra-axial (epidural, subdural, or subarachnoid) or intra-axial (parenchymal or ventricular)-The neurologist roles in the management of CVA are to classify the event, select the appropriate investigation, and implement treatment.
