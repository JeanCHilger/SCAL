Stroke in young woman in the first day after delivery. Strokes among young people are not only the most threatening complications of the cerebrovascular diseases, but they also lead to considerable disability and society' dependency. Among patients under 40 years old heart diseases constitute about 18% causes of ischaemic strokes. Other causes of strokes are: artery wall dissection, blood clotting disturbances, birth control pills, stimulants (alcohol abuse, cigarettes, narcotics), vascular immunological diseases. Among these causes there are modifiable factors, which can be eliminated through patients' education, change of the lifestyle and proper treatment of diseases. In paper there is presented the case of 22-year-old woman, who had in the first hours after delivery the paresis of left limbs with paresis of left facial nerve, proceded by loss of consciousness and convulsions. In computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) there was extensive angiogenic lesion in the area of right internal cervical artery revealed in duplex ultrasonography. In transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) there was revealed haemodynamically significant patent foramen ovale (PFO). In the patient in ten months after stroke there was performed diagnostic cathetarization and then transvascular occlusion of PFO using Starflex 28 mm implant. The patient was rehabilitated from the early time after stroke. Based on carried out examination results that the most likely hypothesis seems to be embolic-thrombotic stroke in the course of hemodynamically significant heart defect (paradoxical embolism in patent foramen ovale) revealed in drastic way during delivery. The earlier lasted process of dissection of cervical internal right artery cannot be also excluded as a cause of stroke.
