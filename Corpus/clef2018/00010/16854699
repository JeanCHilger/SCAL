Pneumomediastinum as a cause of acute chest pain postpartum. Pneumomediastinum can easily be mistaken for a pulmonary embolus or myocardial infarction. We describe herein a case of pneumomediastinum postpartum. A primigravida complained five-hours postpartum of acute chest pain and mild dyspnea. The initial (working) diagnosis was pulmonary embolus and the patient was treated with antithrombotic therapy. A CT scan revealed the real cause of the chest pain: pneumomediastinum. The patient was given adequate analgesia and two days later was able to leave the hospital in good clinical condition. We suggest that in the case of acute chest pain during or shortly following labor, pneumomediastinum should be considered.
