Fracture and migration of a suprarenal inferior vena cava filter in a pregnant patient. Placement of retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters as prophylaxis for pulmonary embolism (PE) is an increasingly attractive option for patients who require temporary IVC filtration. However, experience thus far with retrievable filters in pregnant patients is limited. This report describes a suprarenally placed Recovery IVC filter in a pregnant woman with PE despite therapeutic anticoagulation. After failed induction of labor and uneventful cesarean section, the patient returned for filter retrieval 167 days after initial placement. Fracture and inferior migration of the filter was observed, and subsequent attempts at filter retrieval were unsuccessful.
