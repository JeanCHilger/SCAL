Cardiomyopathy in pregnancy and caesarean section: four case reports. We present the clinical details of four women with cardiomyopathy who required caesarean section. Two women had peripartum cardiomyopathy and two had hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, one of whom has had two caesarean sections. Those with peripartum cardiomyopathy were more compromised than those with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Co-operation between obstetric and cardiac anaesthetists ensured optimum experience was available. An incremental combined spinal-epidural technique with invasive monitoring was used for three women and one received general anaesthesia. The risks and benefits of different anaesthetic techniques are discussed.
