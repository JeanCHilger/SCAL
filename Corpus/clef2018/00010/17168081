Right sided lower abdominal pain two weeks after delivery. We report the CT imaging findings of a 33 year old patient who presented to the emergency department with increasing right lower abdominal pain and shivering. She delivered a healthy baby two weeks ago after induction in the 39th week of pregnancy due to a large fetus. Two days after delivery, sterilisation was performed. Clinically the primary differential diagnosis was appendicitis. However, computed tomography revealed thrombosis of the right ovarian vein. Consequently, management was altered appropriately with administration of antibiotics as well as a therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin.
