Prenatal diagnosis and outcomes of fetuses with cutaneous hemangioma. To study the ultrasonic characteristics of fetal cutaneous hemangioma and the association with perinatal outcomes.Five fetuses with cutaneous hemangioma were detected by gray-scale and color Doppler ultrasound, compared with the result of pathology and hematology examinations after birth.Of the 5 cases diagnosed by ultrasound, 3 had arteriovenous fistulas. In these 3 cases two fetuses developed high-output cardiac failure, and one developed cardiac insufficiency and thrombocytopenia. Finally one fetus was induced, one fetus died in the uterus and one neonate survived. The other two fetuses who had small tumors diagnosed by ultrasound did not develop any perinatal complications, and the neonates had favourable prognosis.Massive hemangiomas are frequently associated with life-threatening complications such as high-output heart failure, thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (Kasabach-Merritt syndrome).
