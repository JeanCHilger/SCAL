Venous thromboembolism in obstetrics and gynecology. The diagnosis of venous thromboembolism can present a clinical challenge. Using D-dimer testing and spiral or helical computed tomography scans has simplified the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism. In addition, the use of low molecular weight heparin has become widely accepted in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism. However, further studies are needed to determine optimal prevention and treatment strategies, particularly in the obstetric population.
