Doppler velocimetry alterations related to platelet changes in third trimester pregnancies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between the haematological parameter mean platelet volume and Doppler velocimetry parameters in order to improve clinical management in third trimester complicated pregnancies (pre-eclampsia, PE, and IUGR) affected by altered uterine resistances. Fifty-one patients were included in the abnormal uterine arteries Doppler velocimetry group (25 pregnancies were complicated by PE, 26 pregnancies were complicated by IUGR). Ninety-nine normotensive pregnant women taking no drugs for at least 2 weeks prior to testing and with no difference in gestational age at evaluation, with normal Doppler velocimetry profiles at routine screen, were used as controls. From all pregnant women, 20 mL of whole blood were obtained into citrate tubes after Doppler velocimetry evaluation and analysed for red blood cell counts (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), haemoglobin (HGB), haematocrit level (HCT), white blood cells count (WBC), platelet counts (PLT), mean platelets volume (MPV) and other biochemical parameters. From all blood parameters studied, MPV was significantly higher in women with altered uterine artery Doppler velocimetry compared with those with normal Doppler profiles (9.4 +/- 1.0 vs. 8.05 +/- 1.2 fL, P<0.001). In the group with altered uterine artery Doppler velocimetry, pregnancies complicated by PE showed a MPV value higher than pregnancies affected by IUGR (9.5 +/- 1.6 vs. 8.9 +/- 1.1, P<0.001). Finally, mean uterine arteries RI values were significantly related to MPV (fL) in both PE and IUGR groups (P<0.01, r=0.37 and P<0.01, r=0.38, respectively). Our study shows that a periodical monitoring of haematological parameters such as MPV can be associated to Doppler velocimetry in order to improve the management of pregnancies with uterine arteries Doppler velocimetry alterations.
