Splenic vein thrombosis. Diagnosed with Doppler ultrasonography. The case of a 31-year-old pregnant woman with an isolated splenic vein thrombosis, diagnosed with Doppler ultrasonography is presented. Routine ultrasound examination in the fourth month of the pregnancy revealed massive splenomegaly of unknown origin. Doppler ultrasonography subsequently revealed splenic venous thrombosis with absence of blood flow. Noteworthy gastric varices were present at the endoscopic examination. On splenectomy, a spleen weighing 2,600 was removed, and numerous venous collaterals were found in the perigastric region. The postoperative course was satisfactory, pregnancy evolved normally, and a healthy female baby was delivered at term. The patient remained in excellent health with normal clinical and laboratory data.
