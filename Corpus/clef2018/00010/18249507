Atypical abdominal pain in the first trimester of pregnancy. We report the case of a 22-year-old woman who presented a violent epigastric pain at eight-weeks gestation. Superior mesenteric vein thrombosis was detected, with an extension to portal vein and remaining blood flow. Screening for thrombophilia revealed a heterozygote prothrombin gene mutation. Portal vein thrombosis is uncommon and difficult to diagnose. Diagnosis is made by Doppler ultrasound, a second intention test to be done in case of unusual upper abdominal pain during pregnancy.
