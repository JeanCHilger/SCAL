Determinants of adverse perinatal outcome in high-risk women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler images. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic role of placental ultrasound imaging at 19-23 weeks of gestation in clinically high-risk women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler (UTAD).Placentas of 60 women with abnormal UTAD were examined at 19-23 weeks of gestation for shape and texture abnormalities. Findings were correlated with clinical outcomes (preterm delivery at <32 weeks of gestation birth weight <10th percentile [small for gestational age]Women with abnormal placental shape at 19-23 weeks of gestation (n = 28) had higher odds of intrauterine fetal death (odds ratio, 4.5 95% CI, 1.3-15.6), delivery at <32 weeks of gestation (odds ratio, 4.7Combined abnormal UTAD and placental dysmorphologic condition before fetal viability identifies a subset of women who are at risk of adverse outcomes. Placental size is critical in the determination of the outcome in this situation because of the very high prevalence of destructive lesions, although present methods of placental imaging have significant limitations.
