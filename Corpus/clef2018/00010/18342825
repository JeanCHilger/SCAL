HELLP syndrome: an atypical presentation. HELLP syndrome without proteinuria or hypertension is rare. We present the case of a 33-year-old primigravid who initially was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. The patient was readmitted with a diagnosis of subcapsular hematoma and eventually diagnosed with HELLP syndrome with a sequela of hepatic rupture.
