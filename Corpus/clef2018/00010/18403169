Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: a potentially fatal complication of early pregnancy. We present the case of a patient who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) 48 h after successful in vitro fertilization with abdominal pain, hypotension, and free fluid on an ED-focused abdominal sonogram for trauma study. This presentation is typical of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS), a diagnosis that may be unfamiliar to many Emergency Physicians. With the increasing frequency of in vitro fertilization procedures, this disease process is becoming more common. Numerous complications can occur with OHSS, including third-space fluid accumulation, hemoconcentration, renal failure, and thromboembolic phenomena. Vigilance is required as these patients are at increased risk of ovarian torsion, ovarian rupture with internal hemorrhage, ectopic pregnancy, and infection. This case report provides an overview of clinical features and emergent management of OHSS.
