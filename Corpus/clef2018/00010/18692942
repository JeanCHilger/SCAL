Pregnancy and systemic lupus erythematosus. Pregnancy is widely authorized in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Fertility is similar in SLE and in the general population although the age of menarche seems higher. Some cases of sterility might be attributed to SLE because of autoimmune ovaritis or antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). These antibodies might lead to endothelial activation and thrombosis by influencing homeostasis, complement activation, inhibition of protein C and annexin V. They might have a deleterious effect on embryonic implantation by adhesion to the trophoblast, inhibition of invasion and placentation and decreased hCG production. The most important part of sterility seems secondary to the use of cyclophosphamide and might be prevented by acetate leuprolide administration. Maternal morbidity seems correlated to SLE activity (controlled by pregnancy planning), hypertension, preeclampsia, Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, Low Platelets (HELLP) syndrome, therapy and aPL. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) should be maintained throughout pregnancy. Aspirin is prescribed alone in patients with asymptomatic aPL and in addition to heparin if there is a history of thrombosis or fetal loss with aspirin. Fetal and neonatal morbidity correlate with prematurity, adverse effects or maternal steroid therapy and maternal anti-SSA antibodies with 1 to 2% risk of congenital atrioventricular block. Abnormal obstetrical echography-doppler examination is the best predictor of pregnancy outcome. Abnormal umbilical artery flow on the second trimester echodoppler examination and history of thrombophlebitis predict fetal or neonatal death. Abnormal uterine notch on the second trimester echodoppler examination predicts adverse pregnancy outcome. Except for the preventive therapy of congenital atrioventricular block, modalities of SLE pregnancy monitoring and therapy are now well established.
