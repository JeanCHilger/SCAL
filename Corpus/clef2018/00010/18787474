Hepatic and mesenteric sarcoidosis without thoracic involvement: a case of severe noncirrhotic portal hypertension and successful pregnancy. Here we report a case of a 25-year-old woman with mesenteric and hepatic sarcoidosis without lung involvement complicated by severe noncirrhotic portal hypertension. In 1992, at the clinical presentation, she had abdominal pain, asthenia, and weight loss. Splenomegaly, signs of flogosis, sideropenic anemia, and cholestasis were observed. Laparoscopic abdominal exploration and histological analysis demonstrated noncaseating granulomas of the liver, abdominal lymph nodes, and mesenteric connective tissue. The clinical course was severe with episodic remissions and recrudescences characterized by ascites (mild or moderate), elevation of bilirubin levels (mean: 1.1 mg/dl range: 0.9-3.5 mg/dl), reduction of albumin levels (mean: 4 g/dl
