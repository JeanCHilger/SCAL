Early and late preeclampsia: two different maternal hemodynamic states in the latent phase of the disease. Because early and late preeclampsia (PE) are thought to be different disease entities, we compared maternal cardiac function at 24 weeks gestation in a group of normotensive asymptomatic patients with subsequent development of early (<34 weeks gestation) and late (>or=34 weeks gestation) PE (blood pressure >140/90+proteinuria >300 mg/dL) to detect possible early differences in the hemodynamic state. A group of 1345 nulliparous normotensive asymptomatic women underwent at 24 weeks gestation uterine artery Doppler evaluation and maternal echocardiography calculating total vascular resistance. In the subsequent follow-up 107 patients showed PE: 32 patients had late and 75 had early PE. Five of 32 patients with late PE and 45 of 75 patients with early PE had bilateral notching of the uterine artery at 24 weeks (15.6% versus 60.0% P<0.05). Total vascular resistance was 1605+/-248 versus 739+/-244 dyn . s . cm(-5), and cardiac output was 4.49+/-1.09 versus 8.96+/-1.83 L in early versus late PE (P<0.001). Prepregnancy body mass index was higher in late versus early PE (28+/-6 versus 24+/-2 kg/m(2)
