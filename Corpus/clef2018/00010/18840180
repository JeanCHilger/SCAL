Acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain as the presenting symptom of ovarian vein thrombosis in pregnancy. Ovari an vein thrombosis (OVT) is an uncommon, life-threatening complication of pregnancy. OVT clinical presentation is similar to that of acute appendicitis, and the latter is therefore the suspected diagnosis in most cases. We describe a case of a 36-year-old woman experiencing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism during the course of pregnancy and presenting to the emergency department with sudden pain in the right lower quadrant and severe abdominal pain. This case illustrates the difficulty in diagnosing OVT, which should be considered in any pregnant woman with unexplained lower abdominal pain suggestive of acute appendicitis.
