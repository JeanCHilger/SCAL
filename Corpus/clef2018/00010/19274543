Long-term epidural analgesia treatment in pre-eclamptic women: a preliminary trial. Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a clinical pregnancy-related condition, characterised by an elevated blood pressure and proteinuria. The author treated selected cases of PE with long-term epidural analgesia (LTEA), that reduced labour pain and operated directly on the PE aetiopathogenesis, not on the symptoms. A total of 15 women with PE were hospitalised at 35-37 weeks of pregnancy, checked for blood pressure, liver and renal function, platelet count and had an epidural catheter inserted for a continuous administration of an analgesic mixture of Naropin, Sufentanil and Clonidine. The average weeks at delivery were 37 weeks and 1 day 10 women had a spontaneous delivery and five a caesarean section: the mean birth weight was 2,906 g and the Apgar scores at 1 min and 5 min exceeded 7 in all cases. All the parameters improved after hospital admission and at discharge. All the patients were discharged in good condition and no patients needed supplementary antihypertensive treatment. The LTEA utilisation for 1 week is well tolerated and improves uteroplacental perfusion, but further studies and a larger number of patients are required to evaluate this pharmacological procedure and determine its place in the management of PE.
