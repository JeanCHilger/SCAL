1150 kyphoplasties over 7 years: indications, techniques, and intraoperative complications. In our cohort of 555 patients with a total of 1150 vertebral fractures treated with kyphoplasty we performed a 30-day postoperative analysis of cement leakage, neurological symptoms, pulmonary embolism, and infections. In our department, 22% of kyphoplasties were performed with calcium phosphate cement and the remainder with polymethylmethacrylate. All patients were initially assessed by an interdisciplinary kyphoplasty colloquium, composed of consultants in traumatology, radiology, and endocrinology. Indications included fresh traumatic vertebral fractures painful sintered osteoporotic vertebrae
