Cerebral venous thrombosis. Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) was formerly considered a rare disorder, associated with an unfavorable outcome. More recent data based on modern imaging techniques, however, have changed our perception of this disorder. The use of angiography and, especially, MRI have allowed an early diagnosis and have proved that the incidence of CVT is, in fact, higher than previously thought, approximately 3-4 cases per million people per year, and that the majority of patients have a favorable outcome. At present, the most frequent causes are oral contraceptives assumption and pregnancy/puerperium as a consequence, 75% of patients are females. CVT may cause isolated intracranial hypertension or lead to an ischemic stroke, which does not follow the distribution of an arterial vessel and has a relevant vasogenic edema. Venous strokes often have a hemorrhagic component, ranging from small petechiae to an actual intracerebral hemorrhage
