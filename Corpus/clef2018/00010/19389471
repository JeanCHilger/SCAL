Acute and chronic modulation of placental chorionic plate artery reactivity by reactive oxygen species. Control of vascular resistance and blood flow in the fetoplacental circulation is incompletely understood. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), physiological and pathophysiological regulators of vascular tone, are elevated in preeclampsia (PE), a disease of pregnancy characterized by increased fetoplacental vascular resistance. We tested the hypothesis that ROS modulate vascular reactivity in placental chorionic plate arteries. Wire myography was used to examine (1) the effects of acute exposure to ROS on arterial function in normal pregnancy and (2) the effects of maternal antioxidant supplementation on arterial reactivity in women at high risk for PE participating in the Vitamins in Pre-eclampsia (VIP) trial. ROS generated by xanthine plus xanthine oxidase enhanced basal tension, vasoconstriction in response to the thromboxane mimetic U46619, and relaxation in response to sodium nitroprusside. Hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite increased basal tone and relaxed preconstricted arteries (U44619), respectively. In women at risk for PE, chorionic plate artery constriction in response to U46619 was greater in the women receiving placebo compared to the women supplemented with the antioxidant vitamins C and E. ROS may regulate fetoplacental vascular resistance and blood flow in the short term, and chronic exposure to raised ROS could contribute to elevated fetoplacental vascular resistance in PE and fetal growth restriction (FGR).
