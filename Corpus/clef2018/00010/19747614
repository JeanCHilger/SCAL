Floating caval thrombus arising from the ovarian vein. We describe the case of a 37-year-old pregnant woman, who was admitted to hospital for suspicion of chorioamnionitis. An emergency C-section was performed. Four days later, the patient suffered from abdominal pain and fever. Computed tomographic scanning demonstrated only a thrombosis of the right ovarian vein. Anticoagulation and antibiotic therapy was started immediately. Color duplex imaging performed 3 days later revealed a free-floating caval thrombus reaching the confluence of hepatic veins while the patient was fully anticoagulated. Emergency thrombectomy was performed by laparotomy, and the thrombus was removed by caval incision during suprahepatic clamping of the inferior vena cava. The patient recovered rapidly from surgery and was discharged on the tenth postoperative day.
