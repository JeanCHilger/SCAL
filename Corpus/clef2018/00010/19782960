Hereditary thrombophilia and recurrence of ischemic placental disease. We sought to evaluate whether testing for hereditary thrombophilia alone or in combination with second-trimester uterine artery Doppler (UAD) is useful in predicting recurrent complications in patients with previous preeclampsia, placental abruption, or stillbirth.Between 2001 and 2005, 110 consecutive women were included in the study and received 100 mg of aspirin daily. Adjustment was made for several maternal confounding factors using a logistic regression model.After multivariable logistic regression analyses, only abnormal UAD assessment was significantly associated with recurrent complications (odds ratio, 11.2 95% confidence interval, 3.8-32.6) Combining the results of UAD and the presence of laboratory markers of thrombophilia failed to improve the accuracy of UAD to predict recurrent complications.Hereditary thrombophilia testing is not useful in predicting recurrent complications in subsequent pregnancy.
