Unrecognised dural puncture resulting in subdural hygroma and cortical vein thrombosis. Unrecognised dural punctures are difficult to diagnose early. Failure of recognition may lead to sinister consequences. A case of unrecognised dural puncture in a young female leading to the development of subdural hygroma and cortical vein thrombosis is presented. The dilemma in the diagnosis of headache in such patients along with the significance of follow-up of all, including attempted, epidurals is also discussed.
