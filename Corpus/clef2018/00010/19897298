Diagnosis of placental abruption: relationship between clinical and histopathological findings. We evaluated the extent to which histologic lesions bearing a diagnosis of abruption conform to a diagnosis based on established clinical criteria. We further examined the profile of chronic and acute histologic lesions associated with clinical abruption.Data from the New Jersey-Placental Abruption Study - a multi-center, case-control study - were utilized to compare the clinical and histologic criteria for abruption. The study was based on 162 women with clinically diagnosed abruption and 173 controls. We examined the concordance between clinical indicators for abruption with those of a histopathological diagnosis. The clinical criteria for a diagnosis of abruption included (i) evidence of retroplacental clot(s) (ii) abruption diagnosed on prenatal ultrasoundOf clinically diagnosed cases, the sensitivity and specificity for a histologic confirmation of abruption were 30.2% and 100%, respectively. Presence of retroplacental clots remained the single most common finding (77.1%) among clinically diagnosed cases. Among the acute lesions, chorioamnionitis and funisitis were associated with abruption. The only chronic histologic lesion associated with abruption was placental infarctions.The concordance between clinical and pathologic criteria for abruption diagnosis is poor. The criteria for diagnosing a clinical abruption should include sonographic visualization of abruption, evidence of retroplacental clots, or vaginal bleeding accompanied by nonreassuring fetal status or uterine hypertonicity.
