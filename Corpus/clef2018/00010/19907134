Prognostic role of uterine artery Doppler in patients with preeclampsia. To evaluate the predictive capacity of umbilical, cerebral and uterine artery Doppler in women admitted for preeclampsia (PE).190 consecutive singleton pregnancies admitted with PE were included. Umbilical, cerebral and uterine artery Dopplers were performed. The association with adverse perinatal outcome was evaluated from 2 x 2 tables and multivariately by logistic regression.A total of 82 (43%) women had an abnormal uterine artery Doppler on admission, being more prevalent in early-onset (<32 weeks) than in the late-onset PE (62 vs. 27%, p < 0.05). In both early- and late-onset forms, uterine artery Doppler showed a greater capacity than umbilical and middle cerebral artery Doppler for predicting adverse perinatal outcome.Uterine artery Doppler was the best predictive parameter for perinatal outcome in pregnancies with PE and may be included as a primary surveillance test.
