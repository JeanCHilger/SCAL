The diagnosis and treatment of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: new findings for antenatal and inpatient care. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are among the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. New guidelines and findings from clinical trials must be taken into account so that the diagnosis and treatment of HDP can be optimized.Current guidelines, Cochrane reviews, metaanalyses, and randomized, controlled trials were retrieved by a search in PubMed and the Cochrane Library for reports published from 2006 to March 2009. These publications were then analyzed and evaluated for their evidence levels (EL).Aside from hypertension and proteinuria, the definition of preeclampsia (PE) should also take organ dysfunction into account. Important aspects of antenatal care include the following: the early recognition of risk factors, measurement of the uterine arteries in the 1st and 2nd trimesters with Doppler ultrasonography (A diagnostic tool which is now well established), prophylactic oral administration of 100 mg of acetylsalicylic acid daily from the beginning of pregnancy, particularly in high-risk patients (EL I++), and appropriate measurement of blood pressure and urinary protein. Patients should be hospitalized whenever indicated. Therapeutic goals are adequate treatment of hypertension, as well as seizure prophylaxis with magnesium sulphate in severe preeclampsia to prevent maternal cerebrovascular complications (EL I++). If delivery is indicated, it should be performed, regardless of the gestational age (EL IV). Careful monitoring during the puerperium and a general medical review six weeks after delivery are essential. Women with preeclampsia have a significantly elevated long-term risk of developing cardiovascular diseases in later life (EL I++).
