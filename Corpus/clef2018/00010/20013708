Chest ultrasound in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a pregnant patient - a case report. Pregnancy is a risk factor for both pulmonary embolism (PE), and an incorrect diagnostic assessment in cases of suspected PE with potentially dangerous consequences for the mother and foetus. The major concern is ionising radiation utilized by diagnostic tests and its potential negative effect on foetal safety. This paper presents diagnostic difficulties encountered in a 31-year-old patient at 20 weeks of gestation who was admitted to hospital with non-specific chest pain and suspected PE as a complication of right lower limb venous thrombosis. The case study reminds of chest ultrasound as a useful tool in the diagnosis of PE. The official clinical practice guidelines do not recommend the use of chest ultrasound for diagnosing of PE due to lack of a sufficient number of published studies. This case report may encourage further, prospective studies in the hope to define whether and when chest ultrasound might find its place in the diagnostic strategy of PE, especially in pregnant women.
