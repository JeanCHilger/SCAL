Plasma soluble endoglin concentration in pre-eclampsia is associated with an increased impedance to flow in the maternal and fetal circulations. To examine the relationship between abnormalities in uterine (UtA) and/or umbilical artery (UA) Doppler velocimetry and maternal plasma concentrations of soluble endoglin (sEng) in patients with pre-eclampsia (PE).A cross-sectional study was conducted in 135 normal pregnant women and 69 patients with PE. Patients with PE were subclassified into four groups: those who had Doppler abnormalities in both the UtA and UA, patients who had Doppler abnormalities in the UtA alone, those who had Doppler abnormalities in the UA alone, and patients without Doppler abnormalities in either vessel. Plasma concentrations of sEng were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Among patients with PE, those with abnormal UtA and UA Doppler velocimetry had the highest median plasma concentration of sEng compared with any other group (P < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). Women with PE with normal Doppler velocimetry in both vessels had the lowest median plasma concentration of sEng. There was a significant relationship between plasma concentrations of sEng and mean UtA resistance index (Spearman Rho = 0.5, P < 0.001) as well as UA pulsatility index (Spearman Rho = 0.4, P = 0.002). Multiple regression analysis suggested that Doppler abnormalities in the UtA and UA as well as gestational age at blood sampling contributed to plasma sEng concentrations (P < 0.001).Abnormalities of impedance to blood flow in the UtA and UA are associated with an excess of sEng in the circulation of mothers with PE. These findings suggest that the 'antiangiogenic state' in PE is partially reflected in abnormalities of Doppler velocimetry.
