Compression and walking compared with bed rest in the treatment of proximal deep venous thrombosis during pregnancy. The purpose was to evaluate the benefits of compression and early mobilization in comparison with compression and bed rest in the acute stage of proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in pregnant women.Thirty-two consecutive pregnant women with proximal DVT diagnosed by color duplex ultrasound were divided into two groups. Group A consisted of 15 patients who received elastic compression bandages and early mobilization, and group B including 17 patients with compression bandages and bed rest. All patients received heparin therapy. The clinical characteristics of the two groups were comparable. We assessed the reduction of subjective pain daily with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the objective pain using Lowenberg test, the reduction of edema was recorded initially and on day 2, 4 and 7. Ultrasound was repeated after seven days.Resolution of subjective pain was faster during the first three days and near absent at the end of the study period in group A (p < 0.001). Objective pain seriously reduced in group A during the observation period while in group B decreased during the first three days almost by half but remained constantly present over the remaining days (p < 0.001). The same was true for the measurement of leg circumference (p < 0.05). There was no pulmonary embolism and progression of thrombus diameter.Pregnant women with proximal deep vein thrombosis may benefit from leg compression and early mobilization for a faster resolution of the signs and symptoms and this method does not seem to be an additional risk factor for pulmonary embolism.
