Catheter-directed thrombolysis of lower limb thrombosis. Late complications of thrombosis of the deep veins in the region between the popliteal vein termination and the confluence of the common iliac veins and inferior vena cava (suprapopliteal deep-vein thrombosis) are common and often unrecognized by those responsible for the initial management. Pharmacomechanical-assisted clearance of the thrombus at the time of first presentation provides the best opportunity for complete recovery with preservation of normal venous valve function and avoidance of recurrent deep-vein thrombosis and postthrombotic syndrome. Recent interventional radiology methods provide for rapid and complete thrombolysis even in some patients in whom thrombolysis was previously considered contraindicated. This review describes the methods, safety, and efficacy of acute interventional treatment of suprapopliteal deep-vein thrombosis.
