Live/real time three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography in the evaluation of post traumatic acquired thoracic aortic coarctation. We report a young patient with post traumatic acquired thoracic aortic coarctation in whom three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (3DTTE) demonstrated incremental value over two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2DTTE). 3DTTE showed (1) en face views of the obstruction site that showed a markedly narrowed, roughly circular orifice measuring 0.33 cm(2) in area, (2) echogenic tissue encroaching on the graft lumen consistent with fibrosis/thrombus, and (3) no graft protrusion into the aortic lumen, only hypermobility of the medial portion of the graft. These important findings were not detected by 2DTTE.
