Spontaneous twin anemia-polycythemia sequence complicated by recipient placental vascular thrombosis and hydrops fetalis. Twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS) is an atypical form of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) that presents as a large intertwin hemoglobin difference with one twin developing anemia and the other developing polycythemia, without oligohydramnios-polyhydramnios sequence (Lopriore et al., Placenta 200728:47-51). The prenatal diagnostic criteria for TAPS require that the middle cerebral artery-peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) measure greater than 1.5 multiples of median (MoM) in the donor twin and less than 0.8 MoM in the recipient twin (Robyr et al., Am J Obstet Gynecol 2006
