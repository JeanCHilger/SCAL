Does the number of pregnancies affect patterns of great saphenous vein reflux in women with varicose veins? Impact of pregnancies on great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux patterns deserves clarification. Which GSV segment is most affected? Is the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) involved?Colour-flow duplex ultrasonography was performed in 583 women extremities with primary varicose veins (clinical, aetiological, anatomical and pathological elements [CEAP C2]), without oedema, skin changes or ulcer. Women with previous thrombosis or varicose surgery were excluded. GSV reflux sources and drainage points were located at SFJ, thigh, knee and calf. Prevalence of most proximal reflux source was noted as a function of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 or more pregnancies. chi(2) statistics was employed.Prevalence of GSV reflux was not dependent on 0, 1, 2, 3 or >or=4 pregnancies: 75%, 69%, 79%, 70% and 76% for right leg (P = 0.79) and 78%, 81%, 82%, 79% and 73% for left leg (P = 0.87), respectively. Prevalence of SFJ reflux and GSV reflux, starting at the thigh, knee or calf, was similar and showed no tendencies to increase with number of pregnancies.Number of pregnancies did not influence GSV reflux patterns in women with primary varicose veins.
