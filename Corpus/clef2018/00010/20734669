Rupture of splenic artery aneurysm--life-threatening condition for women during pregnancy and after birth (with report of one case). Spontaneous rupture of a splenic artery aneurysm is an uncommon and usually catastrophic event during pregnancy and puerperium. The mortality rate among pregnant women is very high at 75% with a fetus mortality rate of 95%. This report describes the clinical course of a 25-year-old woman with hemorrhagic shock four hours after elective Cesarean Section. Symptoms like hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnoe were initially suggestive of pulmonary embolism. Ultrasound demonstrated a nonechogenic mass in the abdomen suggestive of a fluid collection. Ruptured splenic artery aneurysm was recognized during the second emergency laparotomy for hemoperitoneum. Splenectomy was performed. The outcome for the patient was good. We underline that the only way to avoid a fatal event is to know and to think about this rare but very important complication in any woman with unexplained abdominal pain or with clear signs of haemorrhage during pregnancy or shortly after delivery.
