Prostanoid production in umbilical arteries from preterm and term deliveries perfused in vitro. The endogenous prostanoid production in human umbilical arteries from gestational stages between 192 and 290 days was investigated using an in vitro perfusion technique. The outflow concentrations of prostacyclin and thromboxane (measured as their stable metabolites 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2), PGE2 and PGF2 alpha were determined by RIA-methods. The production of all four prostanoids was found to increase with the duration of pregnancy. The formation of prostacyclin was always dominating, followed by PGE2, PGF2 alpha and thromboxane.
