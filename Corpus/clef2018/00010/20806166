Neurodevelopmental outcome following congenital cytomegalovirus infection in preterm infants with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome: a case report. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome and conital cytomegalovirus infection bear the risk of brain damage. In the 27th week of gestation of a twin pregnancy a Caesarean section was performed because of pathological cardiotocogram and Doppler ultrasonography of the second twin (recipient). Both infants presented with severe, persistent thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes and direct hyperbilirubinemia. Primary congenital CMV infection was diagnosed. Both twins showed severe neuropathological symptoms, pathological aEEG with seizure activity and severe neurodevelopmental delay at corrected age of 12 months. The severity of brain pathology, the complex etiology, its consequence for neurotion with extreme prematurity make this case of special interest.
