Prenatal diagnosis of placental tumor using Doppler sonography. Chorioangiomas are relatively frequent, benign and highly vasculated tumours of the placenta. In a few rare cases they show an excessive growth. Placental necrosis, preterm delivery and foetal asphyxia are well-known complications. Another severe complication is maternal thrombocytopenia, leading to serious thrombopathia. In cases with unfavourable examination conditions, it may be difficult to distinguish ultrasonographically between a chorioangioma and foetal elements. In our case, final diagnosis of a 10 by 9 cm chorioangioma became possible by the use of Doppler ultrasound. Arterial and venous signals were seen all over the tumour. During the following period of observation, the tumour did not grow and pregnancy was uneventful. Diagnosis of chorioangiomas should be made as early as possible to enable the obstetrician to adjust the management of pregnancy to complications that can be expected.
