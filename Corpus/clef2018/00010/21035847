Pathologic basis of echogenic cystic lesions in the human placenta: role of ultrasound-guided wire localization. The sonographic appearance of the placenta is normally homogenous throughout the second trimester. A variety of abnormalities in placental texture have been described, some of which may be pathologic and associated with adverse clinical outcomes. We characterized the pathologic basis of one lesion termed echogenic cystic lesions (ECLs) that may be a prognostic marker in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).We retrospectively correlated placental pathology in 50 pregnancies that had a total of 84 ECLs documented by ultrasound prior to delivery. Six additional women with placental ECLs prospectively underwent immediate post-delivery ultrasound-guided wire localization of 9 lesions followed by placental pathology. Obstetric outcome data were recorded.Severe pre-eclampsia (20%) and extreme IUGR (18%) were common outcomes. Of 93 ECLs identified, 46 (49%) gross lesions were found by placental pathology. Inter-villous thrombosis was the most significant lesion found (30/46, 65%) compared to all other lesions (35% Z-Test, p = 0.007). Ultrasound guidance identified 8/9 (89%) lesions of which 6/8 (67%) were inter-villous thrombosis. Associated lesions (infarction, 36%ECLs are most commonly due to inter-villous thrombosis. The adverse clinical outcomes may be mediated by associated lesions not readily detectable by ultrasound. Ultrasound-guided wire localization is a promising research tool for future large-scale cohort studies needed to define the clinical utility of placental ultrasound findings.
