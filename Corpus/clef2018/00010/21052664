Acute abdominal and pelvic pain in pregnancy: MR imaging as a valuable adjunct to ultrasound? To investigate the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of pregnant women with acute abdominal and pelvic pain after sonographically (US) indeterminate findings.Forty pregnant patients with acute abdominal and/or pelvic pain, in whom ultrasound was indeterminate, were included in this study. Multiplanar MR images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained and independently reviewed by two radiologists with discrepancies were resolved by consensus.Correlation of prospective clinical MR interpretations with surgical and obstetric records and clinical follow-up showed correct identification of disease entities in all 40/40 patients. The following disease processes were correctly identified using MRI in 21/40 patients: appendicitis (n = 5), ileal volvulus (n = 1), common bile duct lithiasis (n = 2), pubic chondrosarcoma (n = 1), uterine dehiscence (n = 1), placental hematoma (n = 3), iliac venous thrombosis (n = 2), ulcerative colitis (n = 1), acute pancreatitis (n = 1), hydronephrosis (n = 1), ovarian dermoid (n = 1), and ovarian torsion (n = 2). 19 of the 40 patients had normal findings on MR examinations and unremarkable follow-up. Interobserver agreement for lesion detection was excellent (0.95 k).Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accurate investigation in detecting the cause of acute abdominal and pelvic pain during pregnancy and should be considered after US indeterminate findings.
