Pilot study of comparative placental morphometry in pre-eclamptic and normotensive pregnancies suggests possible maladaptations of the fetal component of the placenta. Adequate maternal, intervillous and fetal blood flow are all necessary for fetal well-being. Compromise to any part of this exchange would be detrimental to pregnancy outcome. Pre-eclampsia is associated with reduced maternal spiral artery flow, resulting in reduced placental perfusion. This in turn creates an ischaemic environment, which may predispose to morphological changes in placental villi. This pilot study sought to assess whether there were morphological alterations in the fetal component of the placenta which could be detrimental to exchange and therefore pregnancy outcome.This study utilized morphometric image analysis to examine some features of the fetal component of the placenta in normotensive (NT) and pre-eclamptic (PE) groups. The features examined included: density of placental villi (expressed as percentage of field area occupied by placental tissue) stem vessel carrying capacity (expressed as percentage of stem villus area occupied by vessel lumina)There were significant differences between NT and PE placentae in density of placental villus arrangement NT: 51.89 ± 6.19, PE: 64.78 ± 6.93 (P<0.001) carrying capacity of stem villi NT: 17.20 ± 11.78, PE: 8.67 ± 8.51 (P<0.001)These significant differences between normotensive and pre-eclamptic placentae suggest possible fetal maladaptations in response to the intervillous ischaemia, compounding the existing maternal compromise to materno-fetal exchange. Further investigations would, however, be necessary in order to make more conclusive deductions.
