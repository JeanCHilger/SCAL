Vaginal mass with urinary incontinence: a rare presentation. To our knowledge, there are only few published cases of benign renal AML presenting with tumor thrombus in females. We present a new case of this uncommon complication of a benign renal tumor.Epithelioid angiomyolipoma is a recently described rare variant of renal angiomyolipoma.It can occur in patients with or without tuberous sclerosis, and may potentially bemalignant. Benign renal angiomyolipoma (AML) rarely presents with evidence of extension into the renal vein, inferior vena cava (IVC) or atrium. We report a case of a benign renal AML with a tumor thrombus extending into the IVC in a 46-year-old female who presented with right-sided flank pain associated with a right sided abdominal mass. Right Radical nephrectomy with IVC tumor thrombectomy was done. Patient is totally asymptomatic. At 1 month after surgery, an abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of thrombus within the IVC. CT scan of the abdomen at 3 months post-operatively showed no evidence of recurrence. Surgical treatment of angiomyolipoma with IVC thrombus is warranted in view of risk of malignancy and to prevent tumor embolus to the heart or lungs.
