Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan for the diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography were used to diagnose fatty liver of pregnancy in a patient with preeclampsia and thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura. The clinical course included multiple system failure that necessitated mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and plasmapheresis. The MRI picture is described in this entity for the first time. Both imaging techniques are discussed and compared.
