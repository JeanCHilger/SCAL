A case of isolated congenital ductus arteriosus aneurysm detected by fetal echocardiography at 38 weeks of gestation. A 30 year-old pregnant woman (G1P0) was diagnosed with fetal ductus arteriosus aneurysm (DAA) at 38 weeks of gestation. The three-vessel view of the heart and the sagittal view of the ductal arch showed a 12-mm fusiform dilatation of the ductus arteriosus. Turbulent flow was detected in it by color Doppler. DAA was confirmed by postnatal echocardiography within 24 hours after birth and it spontaneously closed in the neonatal period. Congenital DAA, usually developed in the third trimester, is potentially fatal due to the possible complications such as spontaneous rupture, dissection, and thromboembolism.
