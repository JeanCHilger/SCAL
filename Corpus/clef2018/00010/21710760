Usefulness of preoperative lower limb venous ultrasound imaging in all gynecologic and obstetric surgical cases. Perioperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been increasing in gynecologic and obstetric practice. Lower extremity venous ultrasound use in the detection of VTE has been studied and has proven both reliable and efficient. However, there have been very few reports of the preventive effect on VTE-related complication of preoperative lower limb venous ultrasonography in gynecologic and obstetric surgical cases.Preoperative lower limb venous ultrasound imaging in gynecologic and obstetric surgical cases were performed to examine the presence or absence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and findings indicating the risk of DVT formation.Among 226 subjects, DVT and mural thrombus were observed in two and four subjects, respectively. Vasodilation within the soleus muscle was observed in the left leg in 10 subjects and the right leg in 15 subjects. Venous stasis was observed in 16 subjects. Fatal complications resulting from perioperative VTE could be avoided by preoperative thrombolytic therapy and prophylactic inferior vena cava filter placement based on preoperative screening.Our results suggest that preoperative lower limb venous ultrasonography was useful for the prevention of serious complications caused by perioperative VTE in gynecologic and obstetric surgical cases.
