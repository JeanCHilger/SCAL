Sinus venous thrombosis: a differential diagnosis of postpartum headache. In this report, we describe a patient who developed severe headache following epidural analgesia for labor and delivery. Although the epidural puncture had been reported to be uneventful, headache was initially suspected to result from an accidental dural puncture. After the headache worsened, a sinus venous thrombosis was suspected and subsequently confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. This case highlights the difficulty of differential diagnosis of headache in the postnatal period in patients after EDA and stresses the necessity of considering alternative pathologies.
