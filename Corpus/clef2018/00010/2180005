Diagnostic imaging of Budd-Chiari syndrome in adults and children. Budd-Chiari syndrome is caused by the obstruction of the hepatic veins or of the inferior vena cava. It is characterized by the classic symptomatological triad: ascites, hepatomegaly, and abdominal pain. In 2/3 cases its etiology remains unknown. Budd-Chiari syndrome may be associated with polycythemia vera, neoplasms, chronic leukemia, congenital abnormalities, hypercoagulation conditions, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, and constrictive pericarditis. Even though its clinical diagnosis is difficult, radiology plays a decisive role with US, CT, MR imaging and, above all, angiography the latter, together with liver biopsy, generally provides with an unquestionable diagnosis. Through the definition of stage of the disease, of level (intrahepatic, venous, caval, cardiac), of type (intrinsic or extrinsic), and degree of both obstruction and consequent development of collateral channels, radiology determines which patients should undergo a medical or a surgical treatment. In some case, percutaneous angioplasty can be performed. Four cases of Budd-Chiari syndrome, including two children, were investigated with US, CT, angiography, and liver biopsy
