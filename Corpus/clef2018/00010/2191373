Placental hypoechoic-anechoic areas and infarction: sonographic-pathologic correlation. High-resolution ultrasound (US) and pathologic analysis were used to define the relationship between placental hypoechoic-anechoic areas, frequently seen in the third trimester, and the clinically significant entity of placental infarction. Placentas were obtained from three groups of patients: those prospectively demonstrating one or more placental hypoechoic-anechoic areas greater than or equal to 1 cm in diameter on third-trimester sonograms (n = 14), those with risk factors for vascular disease (n = 12), and control patients without risk factors (n = 16). Pathologic analysis demonstrated significantly more infarcts in patients with risk factors than in control patients (17 vs three, P = .047). Of a total of 22 infarcts from all three groups, 19 (86%) were isoechoic to viable placenta and therefore not detected with US. The three infarcts identified with US contained hypoechoic or anechoic foci of fibrin or hemorrhage. Of 26 placental hypoechoic-anechoic areas 23 (88%) were decidual septal cysts or intervillous thrombosis without infarction. The authors conclude that nonhemorrhagic placental infarction cannot be identified with ex utero US and, by inference, that prenatal US is probably insensitive for detection of placental infarction.
