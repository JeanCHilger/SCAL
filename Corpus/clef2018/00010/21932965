Stroke in pregnant and postpartum women. Ischemic infarcts and hemorrhages are uncommon but dangerous complications of pregnancy. Their etiology is related to physiological changes during pregnancy. The majority of strokes are seen in the third trimester and postpartum and are etiologically related to three conditions: reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, preeclampsia/eclampsia and cerebral venous thrombosis. The first two conditions are etiologically connected and can lead to ischemic and hemorrhagic events, whereas cerebral sinus thrombosis is mainly related to hypercoagulation and causes venous infarcts and brain hemorrhages. MRI and CT scans are safe to use for diagnosis of stroke in pregnancy, although use of iodine-based contrast may affect thyroid function of the neonate. Management of stroke in pregnancy is specific to cause and depends on management of blood pressure and delivery in preeclampsia/eclampsia, expected management or calcium channel blockers in reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, and anticoagulation for cerebral sinus thrombosis.
