Translational analysis of mouse and human placental protein and mRNA reveals distinct molecular pathologies in human preeclampsia. Preeclampsia (PE) adversely impacts ~5% of pregnancies. Despite extensive research, no consistent biomarkers or cures have emerged, suggesting that different molecular mechanisms may cause clinically similar disease. To address this, we undertook a proteomics study with three main goals: (1) to identify a panel of cell surface markers that distinguish the trophoblast and endothelial cells of the placenta in the mouse (2) to translate this marker set to human via the Human Protein Atlas database
