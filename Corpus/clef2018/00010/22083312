Changes in coagulation and hemodynamics during pregnancy: a prospective longitudinal study of 58 cases. To investigate changes and establish reference values in coagulation, anticoagulation, fibrinolysis, anti-fibrinolysis and hemodynamics during normal pregnancy.A total of 58 women with singleton pregnancies were recruited. Blood and ultrasound examinations were performed in the 10th-14th, 20th-24th, and 30th-34th weeks of pregnancy. The same examinations were performed in 50 non-pregnant women who were selected as the control group.Levels of fibrinogen, thrombin time, fibronectin, prothrombin activated fragments 1+2 and thrombomodulin were higher in early pregnancy than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Fibrinogen, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, thromboxane B2, prothrombin activated fragments 1+2, thrombomodulin, D-dimer, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 were statistically different between the mid pregnancy and the control group (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, fibronectin, thromboxane B2, prothrombin activated fragments 1+2, thrombomodulin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 were obviously elevated in late pregnancy as compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, fibrinogen, thromboxane B2, prothrombin activated fragment 1+2, D-dimer plasminogen, and activator inhibitor-2 gradually increased during pregnancy with some fluctuation. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, international normalized ratio, and thrombomodulin as well as systolic/diastolic ratio, pulsatility index, and resistance index in uterine arteries showed a tendency to decrease in pregnant women.Coagulation, anti-coagulation, fibrinolytic and anti-fibrinolytic activities are enhanced and balanced at a higher level during pregnancy. In addition, uterine artery and umbilical artery hemodynamics become more baby friendly (i.e., high flow and low resistance).
