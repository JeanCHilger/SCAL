Atypical timing and presentation of periventricular haemorrhagic infarction in preterm infants: the role of thrombophilia. Periventricular haemorrhagic infarction (PVHI) is a complication of preterm birth associated with cardiorespiratory instability. To date, the role of thrombophilia as a possible additional risk factor in infants with atypical timing and presentation of PVHI has not been investigated.This was a retrospective cohort study of preterm infants who developed PVHI with an atypical timing and presentation either of antenatal onset or late in the postnatal course in the absence of a preceding sudden deterioration of their clinical condition. In infants with atypical PVHI mutation analysis of the factor V Leiden (G1691A), prothrombin (G20210A) gene, and C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene was performed, and plasma lipoprotein(a) and homocysteine levels were measured.Sixty-two preterm infants who presented with a PVHI were studied. Seventeen had an atypical presentation (seven males, 10 females median birthweight 1170g [range 580-1990g]An atypical presentation of PVHI in preterm infants tends to occur more often in the presence of thrombophilia. Testing of thrombophilia, especially factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutation, is recommended in these infants.
