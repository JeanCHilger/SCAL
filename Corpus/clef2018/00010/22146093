Maternal serum resistin at 11 to 13 weeks' gestation in normal and pathological pregnancies. The objective was to examine maternal serum levels of resistin at 11 to 13 weeks' gestation in normal and pathological pregnancies. Serum resistin, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), and uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) at 11 to 13 weeks were measured in 480 singleton pregnancies, including 240 with normal outcome, 60 that subsequently developed preeclampsia (PE), 60 that developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), 60 that delivered large for gestational age (LGA) neonates, and 60 that delivered small for gestational age (SGA) neonates. Each value in both the normal and pathological outcome groups was expressed as a multiple of the expected normal median (MoM), and the median MoM values in the outcome groups were compared. In the PE group, compared with the controls, there were an increase in median resistin (1.22 MoM, P = .003) and uterine artery PI (1.25 MoM, P < .0001) and a decrease in serum PAPP-A (0.72, P < .0001). There was no significant association between serum resistin with either uterine artery PI (P = .415) or serum PAPP-A (P = .290). In the SGA, LGA, and GDM groups, serum resistin MoM was not significantly different from that of the controls (P = .415, P = .702, and P = .549, respectively). In pregnancies that develop PE, maternal serum resistin concentration at 11 to 13 weeks is increased in a manner not related to altered placental perfusion or function. In pregnancies complicated by the development of GDM or delivery of SGA or LGA neonates, serum resistin is not significantly altered.
