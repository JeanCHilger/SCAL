Comparison of uterine artery Doppler in pregnant women with thrombophilia treated by LMWHs and without thrombophilia. The aim of this study was to use uterine artery Doppler ultrasonography to investigate the cases of women with thrombophilia who used LMWH during the 18-22-week period of gestation.This retrospective study was conducted at our university between January 2005 and July 2010. 64 patients were treated with low-dose LMWHs (enoxaparine 40 mg) from the beginning of pregnancy until 36 weeks of gestation. Fifty control subjects were also included in this study. Transabdominal ultrasound examination and bilateral uterine artery Doppler measurements pulsatility index (PI), resistive index (RI), and systole/diastole measurement (S/D) were performed during the 18-22-weeks period of gestation.No significant differences were found between the groups with respect to maternal age or gestational age at the time of uterine artery Doppler. However, the mean PI (1.07 ± 0.46 for LMWH group and 0.91 ± 0.31 for control, p = 0.036) and the mean RI (0.59 ± 0.12 for LMWH group and 0.54 ± 0.10 for control, p = 0.021) were significantly higher in the trombophilia group.Women with trombophilia still have an increased mean PI and RI, as determined by uterine artery Doppler ultrasonography during the 18-22-week period of gestation, even if they use LMWH.
