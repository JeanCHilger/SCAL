A case of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome following a spontaneous complete hydatidiform molar pregnancy. To present a rare case of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) following a spontaneous complete hydatidiform molar (CHM) pregnancy.A 38-year-old woman underwent vacuum curettage for a CHM pregnancy. Seven days later, she was admitted to our hospital with the symptoms of OHSS. Transvaginal ultrasonography demonstrated enlarged multicystic ovaries, marked ascites and large pleural effusions that required abdominocentesis and thoracocentesis, respectively. She was treated with intravenous fluid, exogenous colloid supplementation, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, and drainage of the ascites and bilateral pleural effusions. She recovered by day 14 of admission.OHSS may develop in older women who undergo treatment for CHM pregnancies. Serious complications may develop rapidly and therefore the prompt diagnosis of OHSS is very important.
