Incapacitating pelvic congestion syndrome in a patient with a history of May-Thurner syndrome and left ovarian vein embolization. The aim of this article is to report a rare case of unresolved incapacitating pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) in a patient with a history of May-Thurner syndrome previously treated with stenting and left ovarian vein embolization. Additionally, this article highlights the role of pelvic venography in patients with PCS and reviews the coexistence.A 32-year-old woman was referred to us for the evaluation of recurrent pelvic pain and dyspareunia requiring analgesics. Initially, she developed left lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis a few months after her first pregnancy. On further workup, she was diagnosed with May-Thurner syndrome and underwent left common iliac and left external iliac vein stenting. Furthermore, left ovarian vein coil embolization was performed for symptoms suggesting PCS at the same outside facility. The patient was referred to us for persistent pelvic pain approximately 1 year after she underwent left ovarian vein coil embolization. A diagnosis of incompletely resolved PCS was considered.Iliocaval venogram demonstrated patent left common iliac and external iliac venous stents in situ. Subsequent right ovarian venogram revealed a patent, but grossly dilated, right ovarian vein with retrograde flow and cross-pelvic collaterals confirming grade III PCS. Right ovarian vein coil embolization was performed, with excellent patient outcome.In the setting of a combined diagnosis of PCS and May-Thurner syndrome, persistent incapacitating PCS after initial iliac stenting should be followed with a complete pelvic venous evaluation including ovarian and left renal venography to rule out residual pelvic congestion secondary to any coexisting ovarian vein incompetencies or nutcracker syndrome.
