Effect of low-dose aspirin therapy on utero-placental blood flow and malondialdehyde (MDA) as an indicator of its therapeutic effect. Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia develop when an imbalance occurs between prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) production. PGI2 promotes vasodilation and decreases platelet adhesiveness, while TXA2 acts as a vasoconstrictor and enhances platelet aggregation and adhesion to vascular walls. The PGI2/TXA2 ratio appears to be important in pregnancy and the development of the functioning uteroplacental unit. Recently, antiplatelet treatment such as low-dose aspirin therapy has been effective in preventing the development of PIH and preeclampsia. TXA2 breaks down spontaneously into a stable substance, TXB2, which is inactive. Another stable, inactive metabolite, malondialdehyde (MDA), is formed via the same pathway. TXB2 and MDA are produced in approximately equimolar quantities. We studied the effects of a low-dose aspirin prescription. Production of MDA was remarkably suppressed during the low-dose aspirin therapy. Furthermore, pulsed doppler ultrasound assessment of blood flow was performed in the fetal descending aorta, umbilical artery and uterine artery of the low-dose aspirin therapy patients. Doppler abnormalities were improved during the therapy. It is concluded that low-dose aspirin improves the uteroplacental blood flow assessed by pulse doppler waveform and that determination of MDA is useful as an indicator of platelet thromboxane synthesis.
