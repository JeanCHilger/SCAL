Thrombophlebitis of the ovarian veins. A case report. Review of the literature. The authors report on one case of thrombophlebitis of the two ovarian veins complicated by thrombosis of the vena cava inferior after a septic abortion. The diagnosis suggested by the persistence of symptoms of a severe pelvic infection was confirmed using computerized axial tomography. Faced with a clot floating in the vena cava inferior, a Greenfield filter was placed subrenally and combined with antibiotic therapy and IV heparin therapy. Clinical symptoms resolved but the scanographic image of thrombosis of the vena cava persisted after 7 months of treatment. This is a rare disease which is currently easy to diagnose, thanks to computerized axial tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance.
