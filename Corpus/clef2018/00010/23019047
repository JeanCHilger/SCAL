Maternal hemodynamics at 11-13 weeks of gestation in pregnancies delivering small for gestational age neonates. To examine aortic systolic blood pressure (SBP(Ao)), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (adjusted to a heart rate of 75 beats per minute, AIx-75) at 11-13 weeks' gestation in pregnancies delivering small for gestational age (SGA) neonates with and without preeclampsia (PE).At 11+0 to 13+6 weeks' gestation, maternal history was recorded and PWV, AIx-75, SBP(Ao), uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) and maternal serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) were measured. We compared women with (n = 337) and without (n = 48) PE that delivered SGA neonates with unaffected controls (n = 6,429).In the SGA group without PE, compared to unaffected controls, there was no significant difference in AIx-75 (1.03 vs. 1.00 multiple of the median, MoM), PWV (0.98 vs. 1.00 MoM) or SBP(Ao) (1.01 vs. 1.00 MoM), but uterine artery PI was increased (1.10 vs. 1.00 MoM) and PAPP-A decreased (0.85 vs. 1.00 MoM). In SGA with PE, compared to unaffected controls, there was increased AIx-75 (1.13 vs. 1.00 MoM), SBP(Ao) (1.09 vs. 1.00 MoM), uterine artery PI (1.40 vs. 1.00 MoM) and decreased PAPP-A (0.72 vs. 1.00 MoM), but no significant difference in PWV (1.05 vs. 1.00 MoM).In pregnancies with SGA neonates, impaired placentation is reflected in low PAPP-A and high uterine artery PI at 11-13 weeks' gestation. In the SGA group with PE, but not in those without PE, there is increased SBP(Ao) and AIx-75.
