Recurrent miscarriage--causes, diagnostics and treatment. Recurrent miscarriage (RM) is defined as three or more consecutive early pregnancy losses and affects 1% of couples. RM is probably a multifactorial disease and evaluation includes parental karyotyping, testing for uterine anomalies, thyroid dysfunction, thrombophilia and immune factors. Couples facing RM should be offered tender loving care i.e. repeated measurements of hCG and ultrasound scans. Further treatments are directed against the underlying cause: surgery, hormone supplementation, anticoagulation and immunomodulation. However, the effect of these treatments needs further documentation.
