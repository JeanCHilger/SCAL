Surgical high ligation of the ovarian vein and preservation of ovarian function for twisted ovarian tumors. Appendectomy is the traditional surgical procedure for correcting torsion of the adnexa. Although it prevents pulmonary embolism, ovarian necrosis, and secondary infection, it can have critical adverse effects on the ovarian function.We performed surgery for adnexal torsion in 12 patients, using high ligation of the ovarian vein, followed by removal of the ovarian tumor.Blood flow in the residual ovary gradually returned to normal within 1 - 3 months, and a dominant follicle could be seen in the residual ovary within 2 - 6 months post-surgery in all the 12 cases. Menstruation recovered in these three cases within 2 - 3 months. Postoperative intrauterine pregnancies occurred in two cases, with a corpus luteum graviditatis in the residual ovary in one case, while the other patient underwent labor after 13 months and a normal ovary on the affected side was seen at cesarean section.This new surgical technique involving high ligation of the ovarian vein for adnexal torsion allowed successful preservation of the residual ovary and ovarian blood distribution, and can thus be used for the treatment of primary diseases of the ovary. The surgical procedure is simple, safe, and effective, and warrants extensive application in clinical practice.
