Performance of a first-trimester screening of preeclampsia in a routine care low-risk setting. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated first-trimester screening test to predict preeclampsia (PE).A prospective cohort of singleton pregnancies underwent routine first-trimester screening from 2009 through 2011 (n = 5759). A logistic regression-based predictive model for early- and late-onset PE was constructed based on: maternal characteristics levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A and free Î²-human chorionic gonadotropin at 8-12 weeksOf the 5170 enrolled participants, 136 (2.6%) developed PE (early PE: 26 [0.5%] late PE: 110 [2.1%]). At 5% and 10% false-positive rates, detection rates were 69.2% and 80.8% for early PE (area under the curve, 0.95First-trimester screening combining maternal factors with uterine artery Doppler, blood pressure, and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A is useful to predict PE in a routine care setting.
