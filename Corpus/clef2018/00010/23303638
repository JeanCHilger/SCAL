Uterine artery Doppler and sFlt-1/PlGF ratio: usefulness in diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. To evaluate the usefulness of the mean pulsatility index of the uterine arteries (mPI-UtA) and automated measurement of the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1)/placental growth factor (PlGF) ratio on suspicion or at diagnosis of pre-eclampsia (PE).Patients with singleton pregnancies with PE (n = 60) diagnosed according to current recommendations, or with suspected PE (n = 32) defined by (1) blood pressure (BP) ≥ 160/100 mmHg, (2) BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg or proteinuria, together with suggestive clinical symptoms or (3) intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) at < 34 + 0 weeks, were enrolled and mPI-UtA and the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio were measured. Values > 95(th) centile were considered abnormal. All cases were classified according to occurrence of PE and/or IUGR and subclassified, depending on gestational age at delivery, as early (< 34 + 0 weeks) or late (≥ 34 + 0 weeks).PE was confirmed in 72 cases, in which 32 early deliveries occurred. Isolated IUGR was diagnosed in nine early cases and one late case, while the remaining 10 cases were late deliveries without PE or IUGR. In pregnancies in which PE and IUGR were excluded, mPI-UtA was abnormal in 40% but the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was normal in 100%. In early PE, mPI-UtA at diagnosis was abnormal in 100% of cases with IUGR and in 91% without IUGR, while sFlt-1/PlGF was abnormal in 100% and 96%, respectively. In late PE, mPI-UtA was abnormal in 50% and 37% of cases with and without IUGR while the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was abnormal in 50% and 26%, respectively.Abnormal mPI-UtA and sFlt-1/PlGF ratio are common in early PE. In late PE, mPI-UtA is normal in most cases and thus not diagnostically useful. The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio shows high specificity but low sensitivity to confirm PE when suspected.
