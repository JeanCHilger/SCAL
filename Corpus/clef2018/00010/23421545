Prenatal diagnosis of a liver cavernous hemangioma. Liver tumors seldom occur in the perinatal period. Hepatic hemangiomas are the most common tumors of the liver diagnosed during fetal and neonatal life. The diagnosis can be suspected antenatally by ultrasound and MR scan. The differential diagnosis is often challenging. While small hepatic hemangiomas are usually asymptomatic, large tumors can lead to complications such as high-output congestive heart failure, consumptive thrombocytopenic coagulopathy and hemorrhage after tumor rupture. We describe a case of hepatic hemangioma presenting as a solid abdominal mass with several cystic areas on an obstetric ultrasound and report on the contribition fetal MR imaging to the diagnosis.
