First-trimester serum soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, free vascular endothelial growth factor, placental growth factor and uterine artery Doppler in preeclampsia. To compare the first-trimester serum concentrations of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), free vascular endothelial growth factor (free-VEGF), placental growth factor (PlGF), and uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) in women who later developed preeclampsia (PE).Prospectively collected maternal serum samples were evaluated for sFlt-1, free VEGF, and PlGF levels in 63 cases who later developed PE compared with 252 unaffected controls. Serum levels of these angiogenic factors were measured using Quantikine immunoassays. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the association between angiogenic factors and PE. The relationship between the angiogenic factors and mean maternal uterine artery PI was also evaluated.Maternal serum sFlt-1 levels were not significantly different between the cases and controls. Mean free-VEGF levels were significantly higher in women destined to develop PE compared with the controls (P=0.04), and mean PlGF levels were significantly lower in women who later developed PE (P=0.01). There was no significant correlation between maternal mean uterine artery PI and angiogenic factors evaluated. Receiver-operating characteristic curves revealed that none of the factors were clinically useful for prediction in the first trimester of PE.Despite some significant differences in the first-trimester serum levels of angiogenic factors, our models suggest that these factors are not clinically useful for prediction in women who later developed PE.
