Plasminogen deficiencies in 2 Spanish families. Response to the administration of DDAVP. We describe two families with heterozygous plasminogen deficiency. In the first the patient was a 27 year-old female who suffered an acute episode of ischemic cerebrovascular disease affecting the left temporal lobe documented by arteriographic, gammagraphic and CAT studies. She had no family history of thrombotic conditions. In the other family the propositus was a 31 year-old man with spontaneous deep venous thrombosis in the left leg. His father was also symptomatic, with a history of recurrent thrombotic complications after predisposing factors, that included multiple venous thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism. Laboratory data showed normal hemostasis test results. Antigenic and functional levels of protein C, protein S and antithrombin III were within normal limits. The only abnormality found was decreased plasminogen activity in plasma antigenic and functional levels were reduced to about half-normal levels. In both cases crossed immunoelectrophoresis revealed a normal migration pattern of plasminogen. Thus, we conclude that our patients were carriers of congenital hypoplasminogenemia or familial type I plasminogen deficiency, due to decreased synthesis. We also reported on fibrinolytic response to infusion of DDAVP, a synthetic analogue of the antidiuretic hormone. Fibrinolytic activity was normal in basal conditions as well as in response to DDAVP infusion.
