Four cases of fetal intra-abdominal umbilical vein varix: a single centre's approach to management. Fetal intra-abdominal umbilical vein (FIUV) varix is a rare prenatal abnormality characterised by a focal intrahepatic or extrahepatic dilatation of the intra-abdominal portion of the umbilical vein. Usually, it is an isolated finding, but in some cases it can be associated to other fetal anomalies. Thrombosis is a possible complication of FIUV varix and it can lead to poor fetal or neonatal outcome. We describe four consecutive cases of FIUV varix diagnosed in our Unit and managed with low-dose aspirin (LDA) prophylaxis until the 35th week of gestation. None of the fetuses developed thrombosis of the varix and the neonatal outcomes were good in all the cases.
