Thrombin split products (prothrombin fragment 1 + 2) in urine in patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis admitted for radiological verification. The appearance of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2) in urine has been associated with postoperative hypercoagulability and thromboembolism. We wanted to assess if F1 + 2 was released in urine (uF1 + 2) in patients with procoagulant disorders, and if higher levels were found in patients with radiological verified deep vein thrombosis (DVT).Consecutive patients were interviewed on comorbidities and medications. An unselected total cohort (n = 534) and a control cohort (n = 177) were analysed. A urine sample (10 ml) was collected and snap frozen before levels of uF1 + 2 were measured with an ELISA kit. Visualisation of DVT was done with compression ultrasound, supplied with venography when feasible. All patients were followed up for 3-6 months.DVT was diagnosed in 108/534 patients. Statistical significant higher uF1 + 2 levels were found in patients with DVT (p < 0.001), in DVT positive patients with ongoing malignancy (p = 0.034) and in pregnant women compared to the control cohort (p < 0.001). Non-significant increased urine concentrations were found in DVT positive vs. DVT negative patients with infections and traumas.Levels of uF1 + 2 was associated with DVT both in the total cohort and in the control cohort as well as in most patients with coexisting conditions.
