Prenatal diagnosis, clinical outcomes, and associated pathology in pregnancies complicated by massive subchorionic thrombohematoma (Breus' mole). To review the association between ultrasound findings, placental pathology, and prognosis in pregnancies complicated by massive subchorionic thrombohematoma (MTH)/Breus' mole.We identified 14 cases of MTH from January 2004 to December 2012. MTH was defined by >1 cm thickness hematoma and extensive (≥50%) involvement of the fetal surface of the placenta. Patient information, details of initial presentation, and perinatal outcome were obtained from the manual and electronic chart records. Ultrasound findings were related to pregnancy outcomes and associated placental pathology. Participants were stratified on the basis of birth outcome into survivors (live births, n = 7) and nonsurvivors (neonatal deaths or intrauterine fetal deaths/termination of pregnancy, n = 7).All 14 cases of MTH were suspected on ultrasound and confirmed by pathology assessment. All cases in the nonsurvivor group had abnormal umbilical artery (UA) Doppler waveforms compared with none in the survivors (p = 0.02). All cases in the nonsurvivor group had extreme preterm deliveries (p = 0.02). Birth weight was significantly reduced in the nonsurvivor group (p = 0.001), and 5/7 cases were diagnosed with severe intrauterine growth restriction, compared with none in the survivor group (p = 0.02).Massive subchorionic thrombohematoma/Breus' mole may be diagnosed in the second trimester by ultrasound assessment of the placenta. Normal fetal growth and UA Doppler waveforms are associated with perinatal survival.
