2D-Ultrasound and endocrinologic evaluation of placentation in early pregnancy and its relationship to fetal birthweight in normal pregnancies and pre-eclampsia. To study the relationships between 2D ultrasound measurements of placentation and maternal serum (MS) levels of PAPP-A, inhibin A and fβhCG in early pregnancy and subsequent fetal growth in pregnancies with a normal and abnormal outcome.Prospective population-based cohort study of 301 pregnancies with a normal outcome, 18 with a pregnancy complicated by pre-term delivery (PTD) and 14 with subsequent pre-eclampsia (PE).Basal placental surface area, placental thickness, ellipsivity and volume MS PAPP-A and fβhCG at 11-13 + 6 weeks, MS inhibin A at 15-22 weeks and birthweight centile at delivery.In the normal group, the basal surface area showed a significantly (P < 0.001) positive correlation with placental thickness and placental ellipsivity. With the exception of placental ellipsivity, all other placental ultrasound parameters were significantly related with birthweight centile. Inhibin A showed a significant (P < 0.005) correlation with birthweight centiles. The basal plate surface area and MS PAPP-A were significantly (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively) lower and MS inhibin A significantly (P < 0.01) higher in PE than in controls. No changes were found in pregnancies complicated by PTD.The basal plate surface area at 11-14 weeks reflects indirectly normal and abnormal placentation and development of the definitive placenta. Combined with MS PAPP-A and/or inhibin A levels this parameter could be useful in identifying from the end of the first trimester, pregnancies subsequently complicated with PE.
