Acquired hemophilia A in a patient associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare disease induced by autoantibodies to factor VIII (FVIII) and may be correlated with pregnancy, underlying malignancies, autoimmune diseases or drug administration. An 81-year-old man who presented with cough, expectoration, hemoptysis and multiple ecchymoses was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia by computed tomography scan. Respiratory symptoms were ameliorated after the application of antibiotics. Despite repeated infusion of fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate, his prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) maintained in the 75-110-s range and ecchymoses were not ameliorated. Then, he was transferred to the department of hematology. Based on a prolonged APTT, decreased level of FVIII and presence of antibodies against FVIII, the patient was diagnosed with AHA. Then the patient was treated with activated prothrombin complex concentrates, prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin, resulting in a complete remission of the bleeding, recovering the FVIII level and negativity for FVIII antibody titers. Here, we investigate this novel case retrospectively and review the relevant literature.
