Thrombus just beneath a retrievable inferior vena cava filter in a pregnant woman with deep vein thrombosis: its removal requiring catheter thrombus fragmentation with fibrinolysis. Recently, transient inferior vena cava (IVC) filters have been employed to protect against pulmonary embolism (PE) in pregnant women with deep vein thrombosis. A 34-year-old primiparous Japanese woman with a history of myomectomy was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis by ultrasound at 27 weeks of gestation. Unfractionated heparin was administered, which soon ameliorated swelling in the right thigh. A transient IVC filter was implanted just before cesarean section. An enhanced computed tomography scan 2 days after cesarean section revealed a wide thrombus just distal to the filter. We performed catheter thrombus fragmentation with fibrinolysis just before the removal of the IVC filter, resulting in re-canalization of blood flow. No significant PE occurred. Although a transient IVC filter may work well for the prophylaxis of PE during labor and delivery, catheter fragmentation with fibrinolysis may become necessary at removal of the filter.
