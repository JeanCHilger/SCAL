In utero magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosis of dural venous sinus ectasia with thrombosis in the fetus. Dural venous sinus ectasia with thrombosis (DVSET) in the fetus is a rare condition that can be diagnosed prenatally with the use of fetal MR imaging, yet with limited indication of long-term clinical significance.To describe and evaluate the diagnostic value of fetal MR imaging in the prenatal diagnosis of dural venous sinus ectasia with thrombosis and its clinical significance.We report a series of nine fetuses with dural venous sinus ectasia with thrombosis. The mothers, located in four feto-maternal centres, were referred for fetal MR imaging due to space occupying lesions identified on second-trimester antenatal ultrasound.In all but one case the dural venous sinus ectasia with thrombosis was in the vicinity of the venous confluence (VC) with various extension in the posterior dural sinuses. Antenatal follow-up imaging was performed in seven cases and showed progression in one, stable appearances in one and regression in five cases. Three pregnancies were terminated. In the remaining six cases there was no reported neurological deficit at up to 44Â months of clinical follow-up.This is among the largest series of postnatal clinical follow-up in cases of prenatal diagnosis of dural venous sinus ectasia with thrombosis in the literature. Clinical follow-up suggests a good prognosis when antenatal follow-up shows partial or complete thrombus resolution.
