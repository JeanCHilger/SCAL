Use of fibrin monomer complex for screening for venous thromboembolism in the late pregnancy and post-partum period. We measured fibrin monomer complex (FMC) levels in all subjects who gave birth at our hospital and evaluated the feasibility of using FMC for screening for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients during late pregnancy and the post-partum period.From August 2010 to January 2012, all women who gave birth at our hospital were included. FMC and D-dimer levels were determined during the late pregnancy and post-partum periods. Compression ultrasonography of the lower extremities was performed in women with high FMC values.Of the 673 women enrolled, measurements were performed in 595 women (88.4%) during late pregnancy and in 610 women (90.6%) during the post-partum period. The FMC levels were normal during late pregnancy in 400 women (67.2%) and during the post-partum period in 399 women (78.5%) having vaginal delivery and 83 women (81.4%) who underwent a cesarean section. The FMC levels were abnormal during late pregnancy in 50 women (8.4%) and during the post-partum period in nine women (1.8%) having vaginal delivery and in none (0%) who underwent a cesarean section. Ultrasonography detected thrombi in three (6.0%) women during late pregnancy. The FMC levels were strongly correlated with D-dimer levels (R = 0.726, P < 0.0001, in late pregnancy and R = 0.888, P < 0.0001, in the post-partum period following vaginal delivery).FMC levels could identify pregnancy-related abnormalities requiring compression ultrasonography examination, without changing the cut-off values for non-pregnant individuals. Thus, this marker may be used to screen for VTE.
