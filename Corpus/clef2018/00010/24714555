Added value of angiogenic factors for the prediction of early and late preeclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy. To explore the predictive role of angiogenic factors for the prediction of early and late preeclampsia (PE) in the first trimester.A nested case-control study, within a cohort of 5,759 pregnancies, including 28 cases of early, 84 of late PE (cut-off 34 weeks) and 84 controls. Maternal characteristics, mean blood pressure (MAP), uterine artery (UtA) Doppler (11-13 weeks), vascular endothelial growth factor, placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (8-11 weeks) were measured/recorded. All parameters were normalized by logarithmic transformation logistic regression analysis was used to predict PE.For early PE, significant contributions were chronic hypertension, previous PE, MAP, UtA Doppler, PlGF and sFlt-1. A model including these predictors achieved detection rates (DR) of 77.8 and 88.9% for 5 and 10% false-positive rates (FPR), respectively (AUC 0.958 95% CI 0.920-0.996). For late PE, significant contributions were provided by body mass index, previous PE, UtA Doppler, PlGF and sFlt-1. The model including these factors achieved DR of 51.2 and 69% at 5 and 10% FPR, respectively (AUC 0.888Among angiogenic factors, not only PlGF but also sFlt-1 substantially improve the prediction for early and late PE. The data need confirmation in larger studies.
