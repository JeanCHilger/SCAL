Successful management of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia in the second pregnancy: a case report. Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia is a serious disease, in which the mother produces antibodies against fetal platelet antigens inherited from the father it is still an underdiagnosed disease. This disease is considered the platelet counterpart of the RhD hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, yet in neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia the first child is affected with fetal and/or neonatal thrombocytopenia. There is a significant risk of intracranial hemorrhage and severe neurological impairment, with a tendency for earlier and more severe thrombocytopenia in subsequent pregnancies. This article reports a case of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia in the second pregnancy affected and discusses diagnosis, management and the clinical importance of this disease.
