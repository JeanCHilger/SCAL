Case of successful thrombolytic therapy in complex cardio-pulmonary resuscitation for massive pulmonary thromboembolism in parturient after elective caesarian operation. Pulmonary thromboembolism is a main cause of parturient mortality in the world. Recently there are few reports about a thrombolytic therapy use in parturient in medical publications. The article deals with a case of successful application of thrombolysis in a complex cardio-pulmonary resuscitation in parturient with massive pulmonary thromboembolism. Unexpected dyspnea and hypotension occurred in the 30 years old woman after elective caesarian operation. Syndrome S1-Q3 was fixed on an ECG monitor. Cardiac arrest was fixed in 10 minutes later. Streptokinase was administrated in a 1 hour after beginning of the resuscitation. Haemodynamic parameters recovered almost after the administration of streptokinase. Severe uterine bleeding occurred in 20 minutes after the administration. Uterine extirpation and tight tamponade of the small pelvis was performed for the bleeding stopping. Later a floating thrombus was diagnosed in the right femoral vein. Tromboectomy was performed. Convulsions had place on first and second day after the resuscitation. Cerebral edema was diagnosed by computed tomography. Consciousness occurred on the fourth day and the woman was weaned from the ventilator on the fifth day. The patient was discharged from the hospital on 20th day without neurological complications.
