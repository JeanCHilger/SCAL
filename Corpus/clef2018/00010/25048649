Placental mesenchymal dysplasia: consequences for the newborn. We report the case of a newborn presenting with anemia, thrombopenia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and hepatic hemangioma revealing placental mesenchymal dysplasia.This rare disease is not always diagnosed during pregnancy. Placental chorioangioma is responsible (in the absence of lethal complications in utero) for IUGR, anemia, neonatal thrombopenia, and hepatic or cutaneous hemangiomas. The early search for hemangiomas with ultrasound scanning could be useful to predict cardiac failure by left-to-right shunt.
