The effect of parity on first trimester uterine artery Doppler waveforms in low-risk singleton pregnancies. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effeot of parity on uteroplacental blood flow during the first trimester in low-risk singleton pregnancies.Uterine artery Doppler examinations were performed in 190 singleton pregnancies between 11-14 gestational weeks. Twenty-five pregnancies were excluded from the study due to history ci preeclampsia, diabetes mellitus or inherited thrombophilia. A total of 165 low-risk singleton pregnancies were included in the study Mean uterine artery pulsatility index (P1) was recorded and compared between nulliparous and multiparous women. The relation between maternal age, gestational week, maternal weight, parity biochemica, markers and abnormal uterine artery Doppler flows was evaluated. T-test and logistic regression analyses were used for the statistical analysis.A total of 165 singleton pregnancies without any risk factors for uteroplacental insufficiency were includec in the study Of them, 58 (36.7%) were nulliparous and 107(63.3%) were parous. Correlation analysis revealed that the uterine artery pulsatifity indices during the first trimester were not affected by maternal age and parity:Mean uterine artery pulsatility indices are not different in nulliparous and multiparous low nisA pregnancies at 11-14 weeks of gestation.
