Spontaneous carotid artery dissection: a rare cause of stroke in pregnancy and approach to diagnosis and management. Acute onset of neurological symptoms in a pregnant female is a rare medical emergency. We report a case of a 38-year-old female who presented with a stroke secondary to carotid artery dissection. Our case illustrates the need to consider vascular imaging before administering thrombolytic therapy in peripartum females to avoid unnecessary risks to either the mother or the fetus. Management is controversial and is discussed briefly.
