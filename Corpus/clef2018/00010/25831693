Frequency of proven risk factors for deep vein thrombosis in clinical patients: Results of a study on patients being treated at a tertiary care hospital in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. To enlist the dominant risk factors predisposing patients to deep venous thrombosis.The prospective study was conducted in surgical and medical departments of Combined Military Hospital, Rawalpindi, and Fauji Foundation, Islamabad, from January 2012 to December 2013. Patients having deep venous thrombosis of lower extremities by duplex scan were enrolled. After taking their detailed personal and biochemical history, frequency of risk factors was noted and graded accordingly.Of the total 120 patients, 71(59%) were males. Overall, left leg was involved in 53(44%), right leg in 34(28%) and both legs in 33(28%). Of the total, 68(57%) patients were >40 years of age. Immobility was the main cause of deep venous thrombosis in 18(15%), followed by surgical interventions in 10(8%). Pregnancy and post-partum thrombosis was the major cause in 9(8%) women. Only 6(5%) patients had natural predisposition to deep venous thrombosis.Immobility was an independent and important risk factor for deep venous thrombosis. Thromboprophylaxis is not routinely provided in most health centres in Pakistan, exposing patients to the risk.
