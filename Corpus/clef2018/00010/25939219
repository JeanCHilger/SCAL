Venous thromboembolism during pregnancy. Pulmonary embolism is one of the most common cause of maternal death in developed countries. Pregnancy is associated with a hypercoagulable state, increased especially in patients with thrombophilia. The post-partum period is the period carrying the highest risk of venous thromboembolism, especially after caesarean delivery. The diagnosis is essential, applying strategies validated in the non-pregnant population, as none of the diagnostic tests is contra-indicated during pregnancy. These strategies use a combination of empirical evaluation of clinical probability, D-Dimer measurement. In case of positive D-Dimer testing (or high clinical probability), ultrasonography of the legs should be performed first if there is no proximal deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary CT scan or lung scan should be performed. Low molecular weight heparin is the treatment of choice until 6 weeks after the delivery, for a minimal total duration of 6 months. The prophylaxis must be individually decided according to histories and risk factors of the patient.
