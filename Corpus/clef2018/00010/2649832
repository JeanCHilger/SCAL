Ovarian vein thrombosis with atypical presentation: role of sonography and duplex Doppler. Ovarian vein thrombosis was diagnosed in two patients, one postoperatively and one postpartum, with mild, atypical presentations, using sonography and duplex Doppler. Demonstration of the dilated ovarian vein with internal thrombus, without demonstrable flow by Doppler, was diagnostic. We propose that sonography with duplex Doppler be the initial screening examination in at-risk patients with typical or atypical presentations.
