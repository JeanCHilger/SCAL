Plasma plasminogen concentrations in clinically normal horses: the effect of age, sex and pregnancy. Plasma concentrations of plasminogen were determined in 28 clinically normal horses, including 13 adult geldings, five non-pregnant mares, five pregnant mares and five yearlings (two fillies, three geldings). Plasminogen was quantitated by a chromogenic assay based on activation of plasmin by excess urokinase. The overall mean plasma plasminogen for these horses was 2.94 +/- 0.54 CTA units (casein units, as defined by the Committee on Thrombolytic Agents) per ml. There were no significant differences in mean plasma plasminogen values among adult geldings, non-pregnant mares, pregnant mares or yearling horses (P greater than 0.05).
