Repeated cranial computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans in two cases of eclampsia. In two cases of eclampsia with consumptive thrombocytopenia, the maximum increase in blood pressure and the lowest platelet count coincided with the maximum degree of neurologic and neuroradiologic abnormality. Computed tomograms showed decreased attenuation, and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images showed increased signal intensity focally in the cerebral cortex and the deep gray and white matter. Blood pressure, platelet count, clinical status, and roentgenograms normalized completely in both cases. Severe arterial hypertension and disseminated transitory microvascular occlusions presumably caused multiple small foci of brain edema that resolved without remaining detectable ischemic brain damage.
