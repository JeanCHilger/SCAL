Substrate for endothelial prostacyclin production in the presence of platelets exposed to collagen is derived from the platelets rather than the endothelium. Interactions between vascular endothelial cells and blood platelets have been investigated using a model microcirculation consisting of microcarrier beads colonized with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and perfused with washed platelet suspensions. To simulate the effects of endothelial desquamation and exposure of subendothelium, fibrillar collagen in suspension was coinjected with the platelets. In this model, neither the passage of platelets alone nor collagen alone stimulated prostacyclin (PGI2) production by the HUVECs. Platelets activated by coinjection with collagen released thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and this was associated with the simultaneous production of PGI2 by the HUVECs. By means of double-isotope experiments with [3H]arachidonic acid (AA) incorporated into platelets and [14C]-AA into HUVECs, it was shown that all the PGI2 generated was derived from platelet AA and/or endoperoxides. This interpretation was strengthened by the finding that PGI2 production was not prevented by treatment of HUVECs with indomethacin followed by perfusion with collagen-stimulated platelets. AA metabolites in double-isotope label experiments were further characterized by reverse-phase chromatography, and it was shown that both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products of the HUVECs were derived from platelet membrane lipid. Thrombin regularly produced transient PGI2 release, but showed rapid tachyphylaxis. Platelet-derived compounds including ADP, ATP, and platelet-activating factor (PAF) did not produce PGI2 release by HUVECs in this system. Thus, the transfer of AA and metabolites from collagen-stimulated platelets is likely to be the mechanism for PGI2 production in the context of minor degrees of endothelial desquamation.
