Drugs in feto maternal medicine. The study of drug distribution in pregnancy was limited by ethical, technical and medico-legal considerations as samples of body fluids could only be taken at delivery. In recent times fetal blood samples have been taken with the fetoscope and will provide a new tool to monitor fetal concentrations and metabolic pathways. The advanced technology of ultrasound allows non invasive study of the fetal circulation and early experience of sympathomimetic drugs administered to the mother will be discussed. Auto immune disorders carry high perinatal wastage. New drugs have made reproductive life possible and when used prudently can improve maternal state and increase fetal salvage. The author has personally managed nearly 52 cases of systemic lupus erythematosus and 16 cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The use of steroids and low dosage aspirin therapy with elevated lupus anticoagulant levels will be described. Two cases of early hydrops in the fetus owing to heart failure due to supraventricular tachycardia were treated with digoxin given to the mother. The potential of therapeutic agents in fetal medicine will be discussed as it recognises the fetus as a patient and provides effective intra uterine therapy.
