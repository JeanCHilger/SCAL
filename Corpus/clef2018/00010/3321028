The ultrasound display of intervillous circulation. An ultrasonographic study of acoustic holes in the placenta shows that these contain maternal blood. The pattern of the maternal circulation can be visualized by ultrasonography, maternal blood entering the intervillous space in a continuous fashion with only a slight pulsatile pattern. Stasis of maternal blood and intervillous thrombus formation can also be distinguished.
