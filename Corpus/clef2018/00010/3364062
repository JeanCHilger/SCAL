Acute phlebographic diagnosis of thrombotic complications in gynecology and obstetrics. From 1971 to April 1986 phlebography was performed in a total of 459 patients suspected clinically having an acute phlebothrombosis. From 112 female patients (24.4%) coming from the departments of gynaecology and obstetrics in 94 cases an acute or subacute phlebothrombotic process was proved phlebographically. The main age of these female patients was 29 +/- 11 years (17 to 76 years). A combined ileo-femoral-crural vein thrombosis in 44.7% was the most frequent localization and expansion, however, an isolated thrombotic process of pelvic veins was found in 25.6% only. A coincidence of the calculated age of thrombosis and clinical symptoms could be proved in 62 female patients (66%), but often the phlebographically calculated thrombus age was much longer than suspected by clinical symptoms alone. Foudroyant pulmonary embolism was observed in each fifth or sixth patient. The special technique of phlebographic investigation is discussed in detail with the judgement of a differentiated therapy of phlebothrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
