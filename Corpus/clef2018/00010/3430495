Postabortal septic pelvic thrombophlebitis diagnosed with computed tomography. A case report. Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis is an uncommon complication in obstetrics and gynecology that may be difficult to diagnose clinically. Computed tomography (CT), an accurate and noninvasive modality, has greatly aided in the diagnosis of this disorder. In a case of septic pelvic thrombophlebitis complicating second-trimester pregnancy termination, CT enabled the correct diagnosis to be made and treatment to be initiated.
