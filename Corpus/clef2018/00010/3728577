Peripartum cardiomyopathy: echocardiographic features in five cases. Five cases of peripartum cardiomyopathy are presented. All patients were aged less than 35 years, and four were multiparous. Two cases followed twin deliveries. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in four patients. Electrocardiograms showed left ventricular hypertrophy or left bundle branch block. On echocardiography, left ventricular minor axis dimensions were increased (diastolic, 67 +/- 7 mm systolic, 59 +/- 7 mm) and mean fractional shortening was reduced (13% +/- 5%). All patients had hypokinesis or akinesis of the left ventricular segments and two had right ventricular dilatation. Gallium scanning performed in three patients was negative. Viral serologic testing was negative in all cases. All patients died within 5 years, three within 5 months. Survival duration was closely correlated with left ventricular fractional shortening. Autopsy in three patients confirmed the diagnosis of a dilated cardiomyopathy.
