Late venous function in the leg after deep venous thrombosis occurring in relation to pregnancy. The frequency of deep venous insufficiency was investigated in 23 patients 3-10 years (mean 7 years) after they had developed an objectively diagnosed deep venous thrombosis (DVT) during pregnancy or the first week after delivery. Investigations included clinical examination, listing of symptoms and plethysmography, venous pressure and Doppler ultrasound. At follow-up there were clinical signs or symptoms of venous insufficiency in 35% of the legs with earlier DVT but in none of the non-thrombosed contralateral legs. Objective evidence of venous insufficiency was present in 15 (65%) of the legs with earlier DVT and in only five (22%) of the non-thrombosed legs. The differences between thrombosed and non-thrombosed legs are statistically significant. There was no correlation between objectively measured venous insufficiency and extent of the DVT. It is concluded that a DVT during pregnancy often leads to venous insufficiency and the risk seems to be higher than after DVT occurring in other groups of patients.
