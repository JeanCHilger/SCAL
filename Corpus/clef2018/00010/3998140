Neonatal gangrene in the newborn infant of a diabetic mother. The newborn daughter of a diabetic mother developed neonatal gangrene of an upper extremity with massive muscle necrosis of the forearm, and required early dorsal and volar fasciotomies with subsequent debridements to salvage the limb. Decreased perfusion and local ischemia resulting in neonatal gangrene may result from the greater propensity for intravascular thrombosis in infants whose mothers have diabetes mellitus. While previous investigators have suggested that surgical intervention should be avoided in neonatal gangrene, in more severe cases early fasciotomy may be required to salvage a limb and avoid life-threatening complications.
