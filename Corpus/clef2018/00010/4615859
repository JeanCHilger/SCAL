Thromboembolic disorders in pregnancy: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment, with emphasis on heparin. Newer concepts of blood coagulation and the pathophysiology of phlebitis and pulmonary emboli with particular reference to pregnancy are examined. New as well as established diagnostic procedures are considered. The historical development, pharmacologic effects, and clinical indications for oral anticoagulants and heparin are reviewed. Finally our own data are presented regarding 19 patients with thromboembolic disorders occurring during pregnancy who were tested with heparin as the sole anticoagulant. Because of the favorable outcome, with excellent fetal salvage, we make a plea for the use of heparin as the anticoagulant of choice during pregnancy.
