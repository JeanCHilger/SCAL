The management of severe rhesus isoimmunization by fetoscopic intravascular transfusions. Twenty-five severely rhesus-isoimmunized fetuses, including 15 with hydrops fetalis, underwent a total of 77 intrauterine transfusions between 19 and 32 weeks' gestation. Fifty-eight of the procedures were fetoscopically directed intravascular transfusions, nine were ultrasound-guided intraperitoneal transfusions, and 10 were a combination of intravascular transfusion, fetal paracentesis, and intraperitoneal transfusion. The average number of antenatal procedures per patient was three (range, one to five). The survival rate for the 19 fetuses that received their initial intrauterine transfusion at or before 25 weeks' gestation was 84% 11 of the 13 hydropic fetuses and five of the six fetuses without antenatal evidence of hydrops survived. In six cases hydrops fetalis was reversed in utero. The outcome in patients referred after 25 weeks' gestation was poor
