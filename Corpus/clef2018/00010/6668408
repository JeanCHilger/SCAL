Thrombo-embolic disease of pregnancy. Methods and indications for surgical prevention. Thrombo-embolic disease can generally benefit from anticoagulant treatment. Nevertheless, there are circumstances that require surgical prevention of pulmonary embolism. The vena caval circulation can be interrupted using clips, which necessitates a general anaesthetic and laparotomy, or intravenous procedures such as Mobin-Udin or Greenfield filters may be inserted. The indications for these procedures depend on how advanced the pregnancy is. The authors point out the indications for interruption of the vena caval flow during pregnancy in the light of four recent case histories. The main one is failure of medical treatment. Interruption of the vena caval flow is to be recommended when there is impaired circulation or when a thrombus is threatening. The diagnosis of this condition does require invasive tests and whether these are toxic for the fetus is discussed.
