Efficacy of graded-compression antiembolism stockings in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. A prospective randomized trial evaluated graded-compression antiembolism stockings for prevention of leg vein thrombosis as assessed by Doppler ultrasound, in patients undergoing total hip replacement. The study was terminated after the evaluation of 18 patients revealed a significantly greater incidence of deep vein thrombosis, documented by phlebography, in patients without stockings (5 of 10) compared to those with stockings (none of 8, p less than 0.03). Three of the patients with thrombosis developed pulmonary emboli. Although the sample size of this study is small, the implication that graded-compression stockings reduce the incidence of leg vein thrombosis is strong and is supported by the results of other recent trials. These findings are at variance with earlier studies which failed to document efficacy of elastic stockings, which involved products which did not provide graded limb compression.
