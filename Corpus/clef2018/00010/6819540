Neonatal cholelithiasis. Cholelithiasis is very rare in the newborn infant and is usually not recognized until surgery or autopsy following perforation of the biliary tree. Two premature infants had calcified gallstones on abdominal radiographs. In one patient portal vein thrombosis was also present. The other had been treated with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and furosemide which have recently been implicated in the development of gallstones in premature infants.
