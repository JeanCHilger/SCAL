Neonatal abdominal aortic thrombosis. Thromboembolism of abdominal aorta and its branches after umbilical artery catheterization has been previously reported. In the past, total occlusion of the abdominal aorta and its major branches was associated with high mortality. Successful aortic thrombectomy in the neonatal period has been reported only once in English literature. The successful management of 2 infants described here shows the need for early diagnosis and aggressive approach, including surgical thrombectomy when indicated. Thromboembolism of abdominal aorta and iliac arteries can be diagnosed by noninvasive methods, such as 2-dimensional echoaortography and Doppler blood flow measurement.
