Iliac vein thrombosis with a "floating clot" at the 37th week of pregnancy. Caesarean section and the application of a clip on the inferior vena cava. A case history (author's transl). The authors describe a case of high venous thrombosis with floating clots at the 37th week of pregnancy. The problem of diagnosis was solved by urgent Doppler examination and by phlebograms of the legs. It is necessary to have a team of many disciplines that can be brought together at any time. These consist of: -an anaesthesist who can resuscitate with heparin and give obstetrical anaesthesia, -an obstetrician who can carry out caesarean sections, -a vascular surgeon who can carry out a partial block of the inferior vena cava. This would appear only to be possible in a special centre.
