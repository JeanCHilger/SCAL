Acute subdural hematoma following disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with an obstetric catastrophe. The clinical, laboratory, radiological and operative recordings of a patient with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) related to therapeutic abortion is reported. During a comatose state following respiratory arrest, anisocoria with right dilated unreactive pupil and decerebration signs appeared. A brain CT scan showed a right frontotemporal hemorrhage. On surgical intervention a subdural hematoma was found and removed. The patient remained in a persistent vegetative state. The rarity of subdural hematoma complicating DIC is presented and the causes of intracranial bleeding in obstetrics are reviewed.
