Lobar hemorrhages in full-term neonates. A chart analysis for a 5-year period through December 1992 identified four full-term neonates with lobar hemorrhage. Prenatal and obstetrical histories were uncomplicated all infants presented with seizures within 48 h following birth. Perinatal asphyxia and isoimmune thrombocytopenia were associated with lobar hemorrhage in two children. Although computed tomography was sufficient for diagnosis, magnetic resonance evaluation provided assessment of specific cortical injury and the age of the hemorrhage. No infant underwent surgical intervention
