Chlamydial psittacosis during pregnancy: a case report. Chlamydia psittaci infection typically causes a mild influenza-like illness in humans. However, during pregnancy, this disease may present with severe headache, hypoxemia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hepatic dysfunction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Limited reports of ovine-acquired psittacosis indicate appreciable maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality.A 19-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 32 weeks and 3 days' gestation developed C psittaci pneumonia after exposure to a parakeet. Worsening maternal respiratory status, development of a coagulopathy, and fetal compromise prompted cesarean delivery.Avian strains of C psittaci can cause atypical pneumonia during pregnancy. Massive placental infection with impaired placental perfusion may ensue subsequently. Given the serious nature of the disease and the ineffectiveness of erythromycin treatment, administration of tetracyclines may be justified, despite the possible adverse fetal effects. With persistent disease, early delivery of the fetus may provide good maternal and fetal outcomes.
