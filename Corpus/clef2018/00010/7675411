Distal gangrene in a polycythemic recipient fetus in twin-twin transfusion. Gangrene of an extremity in a twin pregnancy has been attributed to the release of thromboplastin from a dead fetus or to a combination of polycythemia and anomalous vasculature. It has not been described in a situation where both twins survived.In a pregnancy complicated by twin-twin transfusion syndrome and managed with repeated amniocenteses, both twins survived. The recipient twin had necrosis of the left lower leg, which had appeared in the antenatal period and was associated with polycythemia, but not anomalous vasculature.Antenatally, polycythemia alone may cause necrosis of an extremity. Necrosis could be detected with ultrasound examination and may be an additional argument for laser photocoagulation of the chorioangiopagus.
