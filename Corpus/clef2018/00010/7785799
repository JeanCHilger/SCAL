Cerebral dural sinus thrombosis. A case report. Cerebral dural sinus thrombosis is an uncommon syndrome that a patient presents with severe headache, which may be associated with complex physical and neurologic findings. The authors present a thirty-two-year-old woman with severe headache, focal motor seizures, and subsequent hemiparesis when she was ten weeks pregnant, diagnosed as having a dural sinus thrombosis by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography. In this report, the application of magnetic resonance techniques, including angiography to diagnose and monitor therapy for dural sinus thrombosis, is presented.
