Venous and pulmonary thromboembolism: an algorithmic approach to diagnosis and management. The frequently encountered disorder of venous thromboembolism (VTE) can cause serious morbidity and even death. Nevertheless, in more than 70% of patients who die of pulmonary embolism (PE), the diagnosis is not considered before death. Thus, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for VTE, especially in high-risk patients. Some risk factors for VTE are a recent surgical procedure and general anesthesia, immobilization, congestive heart failure, previous PE, pregnancy, and oral contraceptive use. Before therapy can be initiated, a definitive diagnosis of VTE must be established. An algorithm for assessing patients with possible VTE is presented decisions about proceeding with various studies are based primarily on the clinician's degree of suspicion for the presence of PE and the findings on a ventilation-perfusion scan. Elevation of the patient's legs before, during, and after a surgical procedure is a simple measure that may substantially decrease the occurrence of PE.
