Uterine artery waveform as a predictor of pregnancy outcome in women with underlying renal disease. To investigate the use of uterine artery flow velocity waveforms in predicting gestational hypertension (GH), preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), Colour Doppler ultrasound of the uterine arteries was performed at 19-24 weeks gestation in 51 women with known renal disease. On four consecutive waveforms, peak systolic (A), end-diastolic (B) and early diastolic (C) velocities were measured. Resistance index (RI) was calculated as (A-B)/A, and the severity of the waveform notch expressed as the AC ratio (A/C). Gestational hypertension was defined as a blood pressure (BP) > or = 140/90 mmHg with an increase of at least 15 mmHg in diastolic BP. PE included women with gestational hypertension and proteinuria > 300 mg/24 h or a doubling of early gestation protein excretion. IUGR was defined as a birthweight less than the 10th percentile for gestation. RI and/or AC ratio in 14 women (27%) exceeded the 90th percentile for gestational age of our low risk control population. Of the women with an abnormal test, 11 (79%) developed complications, 8 (57%) developed GH or PE, 3 (21%) IUGR alone, 2 (14%) GH and IUGR, and in one women intrauterine fetal death of an IUGR infant occurred, and 3 (21%) had an uncomplicated pregnancy. Of the women with a normal test, 34 (92%) had an uncomplicated pregnancy, and only 3 (8%) developed GH or IUGR. In summary, uterine artery waveform indices at 19-24 weeks gestation may be useful for the prediction of pregnancy complications in woman with underlying renal disease.
