Coexisting calcified inferior vena cava thrombus and adrenal hemorrhage in the neonate: report of three cases. Coexisting calcified inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus and adrenal hemorrhage are uncommon in children. We present three such cases diagnosed by ultrasound in three boys who were born after 41-, 38-, and 38-week gestations, respectively. In all cases the pregnancy and delivery were unremarkable. The birthweight was 3,630 g, 3,210 g, and 3,390 g, respectively. Left adrenal hemorrhage occurred in all cases. Associated left renal vein thrombus occurred in two cases. The mean followup was 8.5 years. In two cases ultrasound showed persistence of a calcified thrombus and residual stenosis of the IVC. In the third case the IVC thrombus had almost disappeared.
