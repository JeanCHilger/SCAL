Multicystic encephalomalacia in a surviving monochorionic twin. From a recent monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy seen at this hospital, one of the twins died in utero at 37 weeks' gestation. The other twin, a male infant, was delivered by Cesarean section because of fetal distress, with resuscitation performed in the delivery room. The infant developed generalized tonic seizure shortly after stabilization, and was put on anticonvulsants. The initial brain echography was normal follow-up echograms and CT scans performed at 8 and 12 days old, respectively, revealed diffuse low density over both side of cerebral hemisphere. At one month old, the infants's brain echogram showed diffuse cystic encephalomalacia. At four months, he was noted to be spastic and significantly delayed in neurodevelopment. Disseminated intravascular coagulation caused by fetal-to-fetal transfer of thromboplastic material from the dead fetus was considered as the most possible cause of the neurological complication in this patient. In addition, perinatal hypoxic-ischemic insult may also have been a superimposed, influencing factor.
