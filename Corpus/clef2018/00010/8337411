Correlation between umbilical artery resistance index, 6 ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 in the fetoplacental compartment in patients with pregnancy induced hypertension. Umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms (UAFVW's) were measured by Doppler ultrasound in 35 pregnant women with pregnancy induced hypertension. The stable hydration products of the vasoconstrictor and proaggregatory thromboxane A2 and vasodilatory and anti-aggregatory prostacyclin (i.e. thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and 6 ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6 keto PGF1 alpha) respectively) were measured in blood obtained from the umbilical vein and were assayed by radioimmunoassay. Abnormal umbilical artery Resistance Index (UARI) was associated with higher thromboxane B2 levels, lower 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha levels and lower 6-keto PGF1 alpha/TxB2 ratio. Moreover, the umbilical artery Resistance Index was significantly correlated with the 6-keto PGF1 alpha/thromboxane B2 ratio suggesting an association between abnormal umbilical artery blood flow and altered prostacyclin/thromboxane balance in the fetoplacental compartment in patients with pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH).
