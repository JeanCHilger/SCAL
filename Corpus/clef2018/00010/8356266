Imaging of pregnancy-related complications. Thirty-six cases of pregnancy-related complications were studied with plain radiography, ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging alone or in combination. Among the complications diagnosed with these various techniques were venous thromboembolic disorders, deep vein thrombosis, ovarian vein thrombosis, endometritis and pyometra, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet counts), hepatic hematoma and rupture, fatty liver, uterine rupture, various hematomas and a foreign body, tubo-ovarian abscess, cerebral venous thrombosis, cerebral ischemia, and cerebral edema. Prompt detection and appropriate management of many of these complications could result in decreased maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. Although US should be considered first because it can be performed bedside, does not require use of ionizing radiation, and is cost-effective, CT is superior in demonstrating the extent of the abnormality and MR imaging is best for detection of neurologic complications of pregnancy. The radiologist should select the best available method and tailor the examination according to the presumptive clinical diagnosis and the individual problem to be solved.
