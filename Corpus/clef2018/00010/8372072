Antenatal thrombocytopenia in three patients with TAR (thrombocytopenia with absent radii) syndrome. Three fetuses with TAR (thrombocytopenia with absent radii) or TAR variant syndrome were found to be thrombocytopenic during the third trimester of the pregnancy. These findings indicate that fetal blood sampling, besides ultrasonography, skeletal radiographs, or even fetoscopy, may indeed contribute to the prenatal diagnosis of TAR syndrome, and thus may help in differentiating TAR syndrome from other syndromes with malformations of the upper limbs.
