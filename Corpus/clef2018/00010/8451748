Massive hepatic necrosis in toxemia of pregnancy. Hepatic rupture and infarction associated with toxemia of pregnancy usually occur in multiparous women close to 30 years of age. The most important presenting symptom is right upper-quadrant abdominal pain. Sonography is the most expedient way of making the diagnosis of either rupture or hemorrhagic necrosis, but computed tomography is more sensitive. Elevated transaminase levels and thrombocytopenia or disseminated intravascular coagulation may occur acutely but resolve quickly. Termination of pregnancy is the cornerstone of any treatment plan. Many cases may not require operative treatment other than inspection. In others, surgical hemostasis will be lifesaving. We describe four preeclamptic women, two with ruptured subcapsular hematomas and two with hemorrhagic infarction. Radiological and laboratory evidence of liver damage and recovery are presented.
