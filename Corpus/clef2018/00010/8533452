Recurrent thromboses in a 32-year-old pregnant patient with permanent vena cava filter. Vena cava-filters are implanted where there is a risk of pulmonary embolisation as cases of thrombosis. Permanent vena cava-filters can induce various complications during the remainder of the patient's life. A case of a 32-year-old woman who became pregnant seven years after the implantation of a Kimray-Greenfield-Filter and gave birth to a healthy child is presented. During pregnancy and after the birth of a healthy child she suffered from two new thrombotic events. After the delivery, a complete thrombosis of the vena cava inferior, both venae iliacae communes and the right vena renalis were shown by computer-tomography and phlebography. Inspite of these longterm complications, pregnancy is not contraindicated after implantation of a permanent vena cava-filter.
