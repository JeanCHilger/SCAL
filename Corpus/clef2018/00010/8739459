Antiphospholipid antibody prevalence in patients with IVF failure. Antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs) have been associated with reproductive wastage. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of APAs in women who have had at least 12 embryos transferred during several in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles without ensuing pregnancy. Sera from 42 women with IVF failure and 42 women who successfully conceived after IVF were tested for the presence of APAs by ELISA. Successful post-IVF pregnancy was determined by obtaining two consecutive rising beta-hCG levels followed by an ultrasound to confirm a viable conceptus. The sera were tested for three isotypes of antibody: IgA, IgG, and IgM against seven phospholipids: cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidic Acid (PA), phosphatidyl-glycerol (PG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidyl-serine (PS). From the IVF failure group, 11/42 (26.2%) were positive for APAs. From the control group, 2/42 (4.8%) were found positive only for IgA against PE. The difference between IVF failure and successful IVF groups was significant (P = 0.01). These results suggest that antiphospholipid antibodies should be considered an important marker for increased risk of IVF failure. Patients who are involved with an IVF program should be tested for the presence of APAs prior to initiation of an IVF cycle.
