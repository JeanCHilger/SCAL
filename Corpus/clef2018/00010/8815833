Indications and results of conventional pulmonary angiography. Pulmonary angiography remains the only investigation which, in all cases, allows confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, providing that the technical quality is satisfactory. However, its "invasive" nature is a limitation and its place in the diagnostic strategy of venous thromboembolic disease is the object of on-going specific clinical trials. The reduction of morbidity and the improvement of the quality of the investigation must remain high priorities and depend mainly on the application and motivation of physicians, radiologists and clinicians managing patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.
