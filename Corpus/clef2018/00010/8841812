Eclampsia after polychemotherapy for nodal-positive breast cancer during pregnancy. We report the case of a 39-year-old para-4 gravida-4 who received polychemotherapy 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 and epirubicin 50 mg/m2 for invasive breast cancer (pT2N2Mo) with extensive metastatic involvement of all 23 axillary lymph nodes removed at 29 gestational weeks. Soon after the second course of chemotherapy at 35 weeks, she developed two eclamptic tonic-clonic seizures which were treated by antihypertensive and anticonvulsive drugs and delivery of a healthy infant, 1650 g (< 10th percentile) by cesarean section. That this patient indeed suffered from eclampsia was supported by the findings of transient postpartum severe hypertension (peak 170/110 mmHg), proteinuria (peak 3.2 g/24 h), incomplete features of the HELLP syndrome (thrombocytopenia 81,000/mm3, haptoglobin < 10 mg/dl) and of DIC, and by the results of cerebral CT scanning showing two 1-cm ischemic lesions. Since the detrimental effect of antineoplastic agents on the rapidly proliferating trophoblast is well known and as abnormal placental function, such as in triploidy, trisomy or hydatiform mole, has been associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia/eclampsia, a possible causal relationship between polychemotherapy and the subsequent development of this rare disorder is suggested.
