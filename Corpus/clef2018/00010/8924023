Case report of acute splenic and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis and its successful medical management. We report a case of a 27-year-old pregnant patient who presented with severe colicky abdominal pain, diarrhoea and fever. She was initially treated for gastroenteritis. She later requested a termination of the pregnancy. Abdominal X-rays showed small bowel dilatation. A dynamic computed tomographic scan was performed and showed a splenic and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. This was confirmed by colour duplex scanning and angiography. Anticoagulation with heparin was associated with dramatic relief of the symptoms and complete recanalisation of both veins. Surgical intervention was avoided.
