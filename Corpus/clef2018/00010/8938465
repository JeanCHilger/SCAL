The influence of angiotensin II on prostanoid production in preterm human umbilical arteries. The influence of angiotensin II on the formation of prostacyclin and thromboxane in preterm human umbilical arteries was investigated during in vitro perfusion. Bolus doses of 1, 10 and 100 ng led to a definite increase in the production of prostacyclin and a decrease in that of thromboxane.
