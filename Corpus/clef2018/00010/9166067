The value of ventilation-perfusion imaging in pregnancy. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major cause of maternal death during pregnancy. The aims of this retrospective study were to review 5 years experience of ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) imaging in pregnancy, to evaluate the effect of the V/Q scan report on the referring clinician's use of anticoagulants and to monitor the course and outcome of pregnancy. 82 patients (aged 17-44 years, gestation 6-40 weeks) underwent V/Q imaging for suspected PE, over a 5 year period. Modified PIOPED criteria were used to assess the probability of PE. 31 patients were shown to have normal scans (38%) 19 (23%) had low probability (LP) scans
