Ultrasound examination of the liver in HELLP syndrome. A 33-year-old multiparous woman in the 34th gestational week presented with severe upper abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Clinical examination revealed severe epigastric tenderness. Abdominal ultrasound examination showed geographical areas with increased echogenicity in the right lobe of the liver. Through haematological examination, we found severe thrombocytopenia and fibrinolysis. The diagnosis of HELLP syndrome was suspected and a caesarean section was performed. We suggest that obstetrical patients with upper abdominal pain and abnormal liver sonography should immediately be haematologically investigated to exclude the life-threatening condition of the HELLP syndrome.
