Perinatal myocardial infarction in a newborn with a structurally normal heart. Myocardial infarction in a newborn infant in the absence of congenital heart disease and anomalous coronary artery anatomy is extremely rare. We report a case of a newborn with a structurally normal heart who presented shortly after birth with congestive heart failure and cardiovascular collapse suggestive of a hypoplastic left ventricle or critical aortic stenosis. This newborn had a massive myocardial infarction caused by thromboembolic occlusion of the left main coronary artery. Clinical, laboratory, and autopsy data suggest the event occurred in utero.
