Placental chorioangioma: a case report and literature review. We report on a large asymptomatic placental chorioangioma, identified as an area of reduced echogenicity on ultrasound at 36 weeks' gestation. Despite the large size, it was not associated with the usual maternal or fetal complications expected with a chorioangioma of that size, possibly because of thrombosis and tumour degeneration.
