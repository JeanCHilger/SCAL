Factor V Leiden mutation: an unrecognized cause of hemiplegic cerebral palsy, neonatal stroke, and placental thrombosis. Activated protein C resistance caused by an Arg506Gln mutation in the factor V gene (factor V Leiden mutation) is the most common cause of familial thrombosis. This mutation is associated with arterial and venous thromboembolic disease in neonates, infants, and children, but is not a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke in adults. We report on 3 babies with different neonatal cerebrovascular disorders including ischemic infarction and hemorrhagic stroke who are heterozygous for factor V Leiden mutation. One infant had multiple thrombi in the fetal placental vasculature. This is the first reported association between hemiplegic cerebral palsy, placental thrombosis, and factor V Leiden mutation. We suspect that activated protein C resistance may be an important cause of in utero cerebrovascular disease and hemiplegic cerebral palsy.
