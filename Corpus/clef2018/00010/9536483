Reversible intracerebral pathologic entities mediated by vascular autoregulatory dysfunction. Several cerebral pathologic processes thought to result from derangements in vascular autoregulatory mechanisms show reversible abnormalities on computed tomographic and magnetic resonance images. The hypertensive encephalopathies are characterized by intracranial abnormalities due to subacutely elevated blood pressure these entities include hypertensive encephalopathy, preeclampsia and eclampsia, and cyclosporine toxicity. Imaging studies reveal symmetric confluent lesions with mild mass effect and patchy enhancement centered in the immediate subcortical white matter of the occipital lobes. The uremic encephalopathies are characterized by intracranial abnormalities due to an elevated level of blood urea nitrogen
