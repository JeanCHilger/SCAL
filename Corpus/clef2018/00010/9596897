The effect of platelet activating factor on the biosynthesis of thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin I2 in human placental villi and umbilical artery. To evaluate the effects of platelet activating factor (PAF) on the biosynthesis of thromboxane A2(TXA2) and prostaglandin I2(PGI2) in human chorionic villi and umbilical arteries.We perfused the human placental villi and umbilical arteries with PAF (10(-9)-10(-7) mol/l), then quantified TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in the perfusion fluid by Radioimmunoassay.PAF stimulated the biosynthesis of TXA2 and PGI2 in human umbilical arteries and chorionic villi in vitro. The production of TXB2 increased from 63.15 +/- 13.24 pg/mg protein to 127.03 +/- 27.76 pg/mg protein with response to the stimulation of PAF (10(-9) mol/L) (P < 0.01). The concentration of PAF (10(-8) mol/L) displayed the most optimal stimulating effect on PGI2 biosynthesis in umbilical artery samples and the production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha increased from 6,747.52 +/- 700.31 pg/cm to 8,342 +/- 335.81 pg/cm (P < 0.01).PAF may affect the fetal-placental circulation by regulating the local levels of PGI2 and TXA2.
