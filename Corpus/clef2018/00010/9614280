In utero intraventricular hemorrhage and growth discordancy in a quadruplet pregnancy. With the advent of real-time ultrasonography, there have been a number of reported cases of in utero fetal intraventricular hemorrhage. The most frequent etiology for this uncommon event is iso/allo-immune thrombocytopenia however, other risks have also been identified. This is the first report of an in utero diagnosis of intraventricular hemorrhage in a multiple gestation. Severe growth discordancy in this quadruplet pregnancy was an associated finding.
