The natural history of fetomaternal alloimmunization to the platelet-specific antigen HPA-1a (PlA1, Zwa) as determined by antenatal screening. Immunization against the human platelet antigen (HPA)-1 alloantigen is the most common cause of severe fetal and neonatal thrombocytopenia. Fetal therapy has substantial risks and its indications need better definition. Of 24,417 consecutive pregnant women, 618 (2.5%) were HPA-1a negative of whom 385 entered an observational study. All were HLA-DRB3*0101 genotyped and screened for anti-HPA-1a. Their partners and neonates were HPA-1 genotyped and the latter were assessed by cord blood platelet counts and cerebral ultrasound scans. Anti-HPA-1a was detected in 46 of 387 pregnancies (12.0% 95% CI 8.7%-15.2%). All but one were HLA-DRB3*0101 positive (odds ratio 140
