Congenital thrombosis of the aortic arch simulating aortic coarctation in a neonate. The authors present the case-history of a two-day-old neonate with clinical signs of critical coarctation of the aorta where echocardiography revealed thrombosis of the aortic arch and isthmus. By surgery it was impossible to remove the organized thrombus from the aorta, therefore the portion of the aorta with the thrombus was resected and the aorta was reconstructed by an end-to-end anastomosis. After surgery long-term anticoagulation treatment with Warfarin was started. Examination of haemocoagulation factors, incl. proteins C and S and antithrombin III revealed normal findings. The test for lupus erythematosus was also negative. From the case-history of the mother's pregnancy the cause of the serious congenital aortic thrombosis could not be traced. The child is all right after surgery and thrives.
