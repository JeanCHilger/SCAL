An "enigmatic" cause of back pain following regional anaesthesia for caesarean section: septic pelvic thrombophlebitis. A case of septic pelvic thrombophlebitis is reported. This presented as back pain and leg weakness 18 days after regional anaesthesia for caesarean section. The patient was referred to the Department of Anaesthesia. Obstetric review of the patient at the request of the anaesthetist led to a CT scan that demonstrated the diagnosis. This condition may lead to fatal "on-table" pulmonary embolus if the thrombosed vein is handled during an exploratory laparotomy. Treatment should be conservative with antibiotics and anticoagulation. This case illustrates the need for awareness amongst anaesthetists of possible surgical causes for morbidity that may initially appear anaesthetic-related.
