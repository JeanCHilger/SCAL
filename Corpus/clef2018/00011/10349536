Postpartum complications in the abdomen and pelvis: CT evaluation. Postpartum patients rarely develop complications that require radiologic evaluation. When indicated, CT can provide a rapid and reliable examination of the major pelvic organs and enable diagnosis of a multitude of postpartum complications, including abscesses, endometritis, thrombophlebitis, as well as more serious and potentially life-threatening sequelae of toxemia, DIC, and HELLP syndrome. This pictorial essay illustrates the utility of CT in the postpartum patient and demonstrates the spectrum of complications evaluated with CT.
