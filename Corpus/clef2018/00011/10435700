Intravascular ultrasound as an alternative to positive-contrast vena cavography prior to filter placement. In a nonconsecutive series of patients, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was investigated for safety and efficacy as an alternative to positive-contrast vena cavography for evaluating the inferior vena cava (IVC) prior to filter placement.In a 6.5-year period, 30 patients (15 women, 15 men) ranging in age from 22 to 98 years old (mean, 56 years) underwent vena cava filter placement without conventional positive-contrast vena cavography, after IVUS evaluation of the IVC with use of a 6.2-F, 12.5- or 20-MHz monorail catheter system. The rationale for using IVUS included contraindications to iodinated contrast material in 14 patients with renal insufficiency and in four patients with previous life-threatening anaphylactoid reaction to iodinated contrast material limitations to radiation exposure in four pregnant patientsIn all 30 patients, IVUS successfully determined the patency of the filter delivery route veins and the vena cava, the absence of thrombus, the location of renal veins, the absence of anatomical variants, and the vena cava diameter at the desired filter deployment level. Successful filter placement was confirmed in all 30 patients either with plain film alone (n = 12), IVUS alone (n = 3), computed tomography alone (n = 1), external ultrasound alone (n = 1), IVUS and another imaging modality (n = 10), or by combinations of other imaging modalities (n = 3). There were no complications.IVUS is a safe and effective alternative to conventional positive-contrast vena cavography for imaging the IVC prior to filter placement in patients with contraindications to iodinated contrast material or ionizing radiation.
