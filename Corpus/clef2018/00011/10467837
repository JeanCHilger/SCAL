Intraventricular haemorrhage and its prognosis, prevention and treatment in term infants. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognosis of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) in term infants and its prevention and treatment. The authors diagnosed IVH in full-term newborns by using computerized tomography (CT) or cranial ultrasonography (US). The results of CT or US were reviewed and the grade of haemorrhage was determined by an independent radiologist using Papile's criteria. All the infants were examined on the first day of their life by a paediatrician and judged to be full term. Survivors were examined between age 2 and 10 years at the Child Development Clinic by a Developmental Paediatrician using the Gesell scales and a standard neurologic examination. The results showed that three of 36 infants (8 per cent) died complications of pregnancy were present in 17 mothers (47 per cent)
