Antepartum diagnosis of fetal intracranial hemorrhage due to maternal Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a lack of glycoprotein IB/IX, is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder characterized by platelet dysfunction. Women with Bernard-Soulier syndrome are at risk of being immunized against glycoprotein IB/IX, leading to severe isoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia.A 26-year-old Japanese woman, gravida 1, para 0, with Bernard-Soulier syndrome presented at 35 weeks' gestation with changes in fetal heart rate patterns and ultrasonographic findings that strongly suggested fetal intracranial hemorrhage. Management was by cesarean hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at 36 weeks, but the neonate died 6 hours after birth.Maternal immunization to glycoprotein IB/IX during pregnancy can cause severe fetal thrombocytopenia and massive intracranial bleeding.
