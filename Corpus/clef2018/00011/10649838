Neuroimaging of postnatal pediatric central nervous system infections. Pediatric neuroimaging plays an important role in the timely diagnosis of postnatal central nervous system (CNS) infections, and in some patients the imaging findings are sufficiently specific to suggest a cause. The sequela of CNS infection, including hydrocephalus, subdural collections, ischemia/infarction, cerebral abscess, demyelination, and vascular thrombosis, can be accurately depicted and serially followed with current imaging techniques. The purpose of this review is to describe the spectrum of pediatric postnatal CNS infections, emphasizing key pathological and neuroimaging features, and to outline the strengths, weaknesses, and applications of current neuroimaging technology. The prenatal and perinatal infections falling under the designation of TORCH (toxoplasmosis, other [e.g., syphilis, HIV], rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex II) are not covered.
