Color Doppler monitoring the utero-placental-fetal circulation variety of normal pregnancy and intrauterine growth retardation. To study the utero-placental-fetal circulation (UPFC) in normal pregnancy and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) cases.Color doppler ultrasound was used to detect UPFC in 150 second and third trimester pregnant women, of which 89 cases were normal pregnancy and 58 cases were IUGR. 3 cases were IUGR with chronic renal failure. Hemodynamical value of the umbilical artery (UmA), umbilical vein (UmV) and uterine artery (UtA) were examined directly. The indices included time average velocity (TAV), pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio, blood flow volume (Q). The maternal serum estriol (E3), human placental lactogen (HPL) and plasma thromboxane B2 (TXB2)/6-keto-PGF1 alpha (6-KP) were measured simultaneously.The result shows that in normal pregnancy group UPFC is abundant gradually with increasing gestational age. In IUGR group 92.53% of cases showed that TAV and Q of UmA, UmV markedly decreased and PI, RI and S/D ratio of UmA elevated at 20 weeks of gestation. There were significant difference between the two groups, maternal serum E3, HPL level in IUGR group were significantly lower than that of the normal pregnancy group, 6-KP level reduced, and TXB2/6-KP ratio significantly increased.Using color doppler ultrasound examining hemodynamical changes of UmA, UmV and UtA could observe UPFC function directly. It is one of the best method to early diagnose and predict the prognosis of IUGR.
