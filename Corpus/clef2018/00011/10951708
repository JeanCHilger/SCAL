Diagnosis and therapy of leg and pelvic deep vein thrombosis in pregnancy. To establish differences in the management of acute thrombosis in the deep venous system associated with pregnancy in patients undergoing thrombectomy and in patients receiving heparin therapy.From 1984 to 1995 the course of pregnancy was assessed retrospectively in 26 patients with acute deep vein thrombosis. Thirteen patients underwent thrombectomy with establishment of an arteriovenous fistula and 13 patients received conservative treatment with heparin therapy. In addition to the assessment of clinical symptoms, signs of thrombosis, diagnoses established with imaging techniques and of laboratory parameters, early complications and obstetric data obtained in surgically and conservatively treated patients were compared.The incidence of deep vein thrombosis in the 26 patients (median age 28 years) was 0.21%. In 53.8% of the cases the occurrence of thrombosis was observed in the second trimester (median: 27.5 weeks of gestation). The presence of risk factors was demonstrated in 58% of cases. The most frequently reported symptoms were swelling of the affected leg (88.5%) and pain (61.5%). A marked predilection for the left leg was recorded in 88% of cases. In contrast to phlebography, twice the number of sonographic studies were performed. The comparison of both therapeutic regimes showed a three-fold increase in the rate of early complications in patients after thrombectomy. The rate of recurrent thrombosis in these patients was 58.3% compared to a recurrence rate of 15.4% in patients undergoing heparin therapy.Recurrent thrombosis and pulmonary embolism represent the most frequent complications associated with thrombosis in the deep venous system during pregnancy. Although currently there is a lack of conclusive data on the development of postthrombotic syndrome, heparin therapy appears to be associated with fewer maternal risks. Interdisciplinary cooperation is urgently needed.
