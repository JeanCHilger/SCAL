A case of massive subchorionic thrombohematoma diagnosed by ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Massive subchorionic thrombohematoma is uncommon but associated with a poor perinatal prognosis. Placental enlargement was detected in a 25-year-old Japanese primipara woman with fetal growth retardation and oligohydramnios at 23 weeks' gestation. Ultrasonography (USG) showed an abnormal sonolucency within the placenta at 28 weeks' gestation, but could not give an unequivocal differentiation from placental abnormalities such as hematomas, cysts and other tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pointed to a large hematoma in the subchorionic region. Simultaneously, the amniotic fluid was brownish colored. From these findings, it was possible to have prenatal diagnosis of massive subchorionic thrombohematoma. At 32 weeks' gestation, the fetus died in utero and was stillborn 3 days later. Pathological findings for the placenta revealed a large hematoma diffused between the villous chorion and the chorionic plate, with wide necrosis of placental tissue, likely due to formation of multiple thrombi. The clinical and pathological findings were compatible with massive subchorionic thrombohematoma. MRI might be useful for the detection of massive subchorionic thrombohematoma and help its clinical management in combination with USG and pulse Doppler imaging.
