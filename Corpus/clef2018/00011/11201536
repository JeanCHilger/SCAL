Postpartum follow-up of hepatic calcification detected by prenatal ultrasound. The causes of parenchymal hepatic calcification are mostly transplacental infection of TORCH complex, ischaemic necrosis, or tumours of foetal liver including haemangioma, hamartoma, teratoma, hepatoma, and hemangioendothelioma. Vascular pathologies like hepatic artery aneurysm, haematoma, calcified thromboemboli of portal vein and hepatic veins can also cause hepatic calcification. We present a case of hepatic calcification which was first diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. In the postpartum follow-up, we observed that the calcifications had decreased in number and size. The causes and results of hepatic calcification or underlying disease are discussed with analysis of the literature.
