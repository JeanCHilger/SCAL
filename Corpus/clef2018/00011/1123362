Gangrene of the newborn. A case report. Gangrene of the newborn is an uncommon condition usually resulting from decreased perfusion of a part, usually an extremity. There are a variety of situations which can result in this condition. Knowledge of the exact sequence of events which lead to the insult and the conditions surrounding it is helpful in determining the etiology and as a consequence the treatment of the lesion. In the patient described, direct pressure from the maternal pelvis was probably the contributing factor which led to venous occlusion of the extremity. Arterial thrombosis, emboli, trauma, congenital heart disease, sepsis, dehydration, coagulopathies, and venipuncture are other possible causes which should be considered. The treatment is in general supportive, allowing the ischemic area to demarcate and slough. Range-of-motion exercises and splinting to avoid contracture are helpful in the rehabilitative phase.
