HELLP syndrome and factor V Leiden. The association of thrombophilia and obstetrical complications is documented and well consistent with the hypothesis of an insufficient placental perfusion due to fibrin deposition as a major underlying pathophysiological mechanism. Factor V Leiden is one of the most frequent thrombophilic mutations. A high prevalence of this mutation has recently been reported in a group of 21 German women with haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome. In this respect, we studied the prevalence of factor V Leiden in 18 women who were consecutively diagnosed at our Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology as having HELLP syndrome, between 1995 and 1999. Women were tested either at the time of diagnosis or months or years after delivery for coagulation parameters, protein C (PC), protein S (PS), antithrombin III, lupus-like anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), activated protein C (APC) resistance and detection of the G1691A mutation (factor V Leiden). In all women, the parameters studied were normal and in none of the investigated cases was the G1691A mutation found. HELLP being a severe form of preeclampsia, we think that the reported association between factor V Leiden and HELLP may reflect the well-known association with preeclampsia.
