Complications associated with membrane lung support by venoarterial perfusion. A series of patients supported with long-term venoarterial perfusion is presented. Gas exchange was achieved with a membrane oxygenator at flows usually in excess of 50% of the patient's baseline cardiac output. Perfusions were maintained for 7 to 12 days. Two major complications were encountered: thromboembolic myocardial infarction and liquefaction necrosis of the lung. Possible etiologies and suggestions for prevention are discussed.
