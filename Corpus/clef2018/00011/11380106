Successful thrombolysis of prosthetic mitral valve thrombosis in early pregnancy. Prosthetic valve thrombosis occurring during pregnancy is a life-threatening complication. Surgical treatment requires clot removal or valve replacement under cardiopulmonary bypass, and carries a high mortality. We report successful thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase for prosthetic valve thrombosis in a pregnant, 28-year-old woman. The patient, who had undergone mitral valve replacement (St. Jude Medical prosthesis) two years previously for restenosis after closed mitral valvotomy, was successfully thrombolyzed during the first trimester (6-8 weeks) for prosthetic valve thrombosis, and without any complication. The patient delivered a normal healthy child at nine months' gestation. Although thrombolysis in pregnancy has been reported previously, this is the first case in which it was performed during the first trimester for prosthetic valve thrombosis.
