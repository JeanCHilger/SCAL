Hypoxia attenuates PGE(2)but increases prostacyclin and thromboxane production in human term villous trophoblast. Prostanoids have been proposed to play a major role in the regulation of uteroplacental blood flow. We examined the effect of hypoxia on the production of prostaglandin E(2)(PGE(2)) thromboxane B(2)(TXB(2)), and prostacyclin (measured as 6-keto-PGF(1alpha)) by human term trophoblast cells and villous placental explants. Explants (n=8) and purified trophoblast cells (n=5) were incubated for 24-72 h under either normoxic (21 per cent O(2)) or hypoxic (2 per cent O(2)) conditions. In trophoblast monolayer cultures, hypoxia attentuated PGE(2)production rates to 52+/-9.4 per cent (mean+/-sem, P< 0.05) but recovered to control rates within 48 h. In villous explants, PGE(2)production was significantly decreased after 48 and 72 h of hypoxia versus the normoxic control, accompanied by increased production of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha)to 173.9+/-26.7 per cent after 48 h. TXB(2)production was increased to 172.3+/-25.9 per cent and 653.2+/-135.7 per cent (P< 0.05) control after 48 and 72 h of hypoxia, respectively. These results were confirmed in villous explants (n=3) cultured in the presence of exogenous 10 microm arachidonic acid. Hypoxia had no significant effect on TXB(2)and 6-keto-PGF(1alpha)in trophoblast cells. In summary, our findings suggest that hypoxia could be responsible for abnormal profiles of prostanoid production commonly observed in women with pre-eclampsia. These results indicate a putative link between hypoxia and compromised placental perfusion.
