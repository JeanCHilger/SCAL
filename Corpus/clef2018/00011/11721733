Bilateral jugular venous thromboembolism and pulmonary emboli in a patient with severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. We report here a case of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with massive ascites in a 25-year-old woman with a history of primary infertility after an IVF-ET cycle. At the 9th gestational week she presented with neck pain and dyspnea and duplex Doppler sonographic examination of the neck veins revealed bilateral jugular venous thrombosis. Despite prompt administration of low-molecular weight heparin, pulmonary emboli developed a few days later.
