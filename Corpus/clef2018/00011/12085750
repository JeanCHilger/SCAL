Right atrial compressive aneurysm with favorable outcome after surgery at the age of 1 month. Right atrial aneurysms are uncommon and often revealed by arrhythmia. We report a case of right atrial aneurysm which required an early management and its follow up during one year. The abnormality was detected at 32 weeks gravida during a systematic echography. At birth the newborn was asymptomatic but with the progressive increase of the aneurysm size shifting the heart and vessels and the occurrence of an intra-cardiac thrombus, a surgical management was decided at the age of one month. The resection of the aneurysm was therefore performed and no complication occurred during recovery. After one year the child remains healthy. The surgical indications are difficult to precise as the majority of these aneurysms are detected at an adult age. Surgical management appears to be essential in case of poor tolerance. The prognosis after surgery seems favorable.
