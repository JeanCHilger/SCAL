Pulmonary embolism in pregnant patients: fetal radiation dose with helical CT. To calculate mean fetal radiation dose from helical chest computed tomography (CT) by using maternal-fetal geometries obtained from healthy pregnant women and to compare the calculated CT doses with the fetal doses reported with scintigraphy.Maternal-fetal geometries were determined in 23 pregnant women with varying body mass index and fetal gestational age. Monte Carlo techniques were used to estimate the dose that would be received by each fetus from CT scanning performed with the following parameters: 120 kVp 100 mAFor helical CT, estimated mean fetal doses in micrograys at varying gestational ages were as follows: 3.3-20.2 microGy, first trimester 7.9-76.7 microGy, second trimesterThe average fetal radiation dose with helical CT is less than that with ventilation-perfusion lung scanning during all trimesters.
