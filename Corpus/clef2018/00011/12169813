Fetal anemia, thrombocytopenia, dilated umbilical vein, and cardiomegaly due to a voluminous placental chorioangioma. A case report. We report a case of voluminous placental chorioangioma diagnosed by ultrasound and color Doppler imaging during the 20th week of pregnancy. The size of the tumor was enlarging progressively (up to 10 cm in the 32nd week), and during this time the signs of fetal intrauterine volume overload and blood cell consumption, such as cardiomegaly, umbilical vein dilation, hydramnios, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, were observed. In the 32nd week of pregnancy, the signs of uteroplacental insufficiency and fetal hypoxia appeared therefore, the pregnancy was terminated by cesarean section, and a female infant weighing 1,870 g was delivered. She was discharged, fully recovered, after 48 days. Histopathological examination of the placental tumor showed a benign, vascular-type chorioangioma.
