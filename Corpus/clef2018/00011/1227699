Intraluminal iliac venous calcification. Two patients with bilateral intraluminal iliac venous calcifications have been reported. Both patients are elderly multiparous females with long-standing peripheral venous disease and a history of previous gynaecologic surgery. The iliac thrombosis may have occurred at the time of delivery or pelvic surgery. These are the first such cases to be reported in the English literature in the last 25 years and the only example documented with venography in the recent world literature.
