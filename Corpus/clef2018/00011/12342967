Coagulation defect after middle trimester abortion using prostaglandin E2 by the extra-amniotic route. A 20-year old female seeking legal abortion was pregnant with gestation in the 16th week as confirmed by ultrasound.  Low hemoglobin count of 8.7 g/dl showed iron deficiency which was corrected by transfusion of 2 units of packed cells.  Extraamniotic termination of pregnancy was commenced, and 5 mg of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in 50 ml of .9% saline was administered.  Abortion started 9 hours later the placenta  was removed by curettage, however, severe hemorrhaging and shock ensued.  Uterine perforation was ruled out by examination.  Hartmann's solution and oxytocin 40 u/l were administered iv.  A clotting defect with prolonged prothrombin time, thromboplastin time, and thrombin time was implicated in the excessive bleeding.  3 units of whole blood, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 6 units of platelets were used to treat the coagulopathy.  The patient recovered quickly, and clotting tests became normal after 2 days.  Follow-up of 1 and 6 weeks showed normal hemoglobin values.  PGE2 is routinely used in middle trimester abortions, however, a twentyfold increase in maternal mortality had been reported.  Clotting screens are recommended for patients undergoing abortions because of coagulopathy associated with major hemorrhage.
