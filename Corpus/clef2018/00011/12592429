Postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis: an unpredictable event: two case reports and review of the literature. Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a rare but serious postpartum complication that, in most cases, occurs in the right ovarian vein. Certain diagnosis, following clinical suspect because of lower quadrant tenderness and fever that alone does not respond to adequate broad-spectrum antibiotics, is now based on computed tomography (CT), although other imaging techniques, such as color Doppler ultrasonography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, are useful. Heparin and intravenous antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment so as to avoid laparotomy. We report on the management of two cases of postpartum OVT.
