Antenatal administration of celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor, appears to improve placental perfusion in the pregnant rabbit. To investigate the effects of celecoxib on fetal growth, and placental prostanoid and nitric oxide (NO) production in fetal rabbits, pregnant rabbits received celecoxib (30 mg/kg per day) from 13 to 20 days (Cel-A), from 13 to 28 days (Cel-B), or vehicle from 13 to 28 days gestation. Fetal body and organ weights, and measurements of linear growth were recorded. The placentas were weighed and analyzed for prostaglandins (PGs), NO oxidation products (NOx), and total cellular protein levels. Placental prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and NOx levels increased (P < or = 0.05), while thromboxane B2 levels were suppressed (P < or = 0.01) in Cel-B group. Tail length and brain weight were greater, while lung weights were lower in the Cel-B group (P < or = 0.05). Maternal administration of celecoxib appears to preferentially increase placental vasodilators and decrease placental TxA2, suggesting that the drug may increase uteroplacental perfusion without adverse fetal outcome.
