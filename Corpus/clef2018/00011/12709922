Inherited thrombophilia and gestational vascular complications. Severe obstetric complications, including preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, abruptio placentae, and stillbirth, constitute a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and death. The etiology of these severe obstetric complications is still unknown. However, the frequent finding of structural and thrombotic changes in placental capillaries, which lead to inadequate fetomaternal circulation and decreased placental perfusion, and the high prevalence of heritable or acquired risk factors for thrombosis found in women with these complications strongly suggest a cause-and-effect relationship. This review describes the recent findings on the association between these obstetric complications and the various thrombophilias, and recent therapeutic approaches. Aspirin, which was regarded as the drug of choice for the prevention of such obstetric complications, has proved to be ineffective in a large clinical trial. The encouraging observations on the efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparins, which are also included in the recently published guidelines of The American College of Chest Physicians, are summarized in this review. However, controlled clinical trials are still necessary to allow the development of better clinical standards.
