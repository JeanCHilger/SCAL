A study of 100 high risk lupus pregnancies. Certain subgroups of lupus patients and those with circulating antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in particular, suffer a high rate of fetal loss. Over the past 4 years, we have prospectively studied 100 pregnancies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary antiphospholipid syndrome. In addition to conventional methods of monitoring SLE and fetal development, we have also used Doppler flow assessment of placental perfusion from the 14th wk of pregnancy onward. Patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome and previous history of thrombotic events were treated with daily heparin (10,000 IU) and low-dose aspirin (75 mg). Those without a history of thrombosis were treated with low-dose prednisolone, azathioprine, or hydroxychloroquine. Pregnancy loss was reduced from 81.3% in 101 previous pregnancies to 36.8% in 100 pregnancies managed by us. None of the patients who received hydroxychloroquine throughout the pregnancy presented fetal malformations. Careful management and close monitoring of the lupus pregnancy has substantially improved fetal outcome.
