Bilateral internal jugular venous thrombosis following successful assisted conception in the absence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The majority of the venous thromboembolic events seen in patient following gonadotropin administration were associated with the development of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). However, in this case report, a 29-year-old woman that conceived by controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, intracytoplasmic sperm injection and subsequent embryo transfer without conjunction of OHSS was described. Bilateral jugular venous thrombi were detected by duplex Doppler in the 8th week of pregnancy when she was admitted to the emergency room for difficulty in swallowing and bilateral neck pain. She had unremarkable history and negative results for thrombophilia screening. Full anticoagulation with intravenous heparin was initiated and continued subcutaneously throughout pregnancy. She delivered two healthy babies at 36 weeks of pregnancy. Venous thromboembolism should be taken in account in patients undergoing gonadotropin administration for assisted conception with the complaint of extremity pain regardless of having risk factors for thromboembolism.
