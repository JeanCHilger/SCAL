Pancreatic haemangioma in infancy: the place of radiology. Pancreatic haemangiomas in infants are rare. Seven cases have been reported in the literature to date. We report two new cases. One of our cases had antenatal diagnosis and was associated with atypical portal vein thrombosis. The diagnosis was obtained by percutaneous biopsy without complication. For both cases, regression was observed without treatment.
