Cushing syndrome during pregnancy. New diagnostic methods used in 3 cases of adrenal cortex carcinoma. Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy is most often caused by an adrenal cortical tumour it is a rare event which bears poor foetal and maternal prognoses. We report 3 cases of adrenal cortex carcinoma diagnosed during pregnancy (after 24, 27 and 28 weeks respectively of amenorrhea) and revealed by local tumoral signs in 2 cases and by pulmonary embolism in the third. Because hair growth was moderate and weight gain as well as high blood pressure had mistakenly been attributed to the pregnant state, these clinical features of hypercortisolism has only lately been related to tumoral secretion. The hypercortisolic state was firmly established by comparing the patients' urinary cortisol levels (677, 941 and 2,167 micrograms/day) and 20-hour salivary cortisol levels (9.9, 15 and 25.3 micrograms/ml) with values obtained in women at the same stage (88 +/- 11.4 micrograms/day and 2.31 +/- 0.25 micrograms/ml). The aetiological diagnosis was made by the finding of a highly increased salivary testosterone levels (50, 34 and 95 pg/ml
