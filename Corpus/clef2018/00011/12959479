Alloimmune thrombocytopenia in the fetus: current management theories. Fetal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (AIT) affects only a small number of fetuses but the consequences may be devastating. Outcomes range from mild thrombocytopenia without signs or symptoms to intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and fetal or neonatal death. Antenatal screening is available but not used routinely in the United States. The most frequent method of AIT identification is its diagnosis in the neonatal period (index neonate). AIT may be diagnosed antenatally if an ICH is noted on routine obstetric ultrasound. There are accurate predictors of AIT, as well as antenatal therapies, to prevent the occurrence of severe disease and ICH.
