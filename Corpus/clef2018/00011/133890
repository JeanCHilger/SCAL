Functional scintigraphic radiospirometry. First clinical results in patients with lung diseases. First clinical results of patients with diseases of the lungs. The previous experiences on patients with diseases of the lungs reveal that the regional function diagnostics of the lungs may be extended and improved by functional scintigraphic radiospirometry. Because of the determination of regional lung volumes restrictive lung diseases can be differentiated and analysed more exactly than it has been possible before by the examinations of perfusion and ventilation alone. A further advance of the determination of lung volume is that the question of functional operability can be cleared up exactly. In our opinion the routine use of the functional scintigraphic radiospirometry is justified. A contraindication for this kind of examination should only be pregnancy.
