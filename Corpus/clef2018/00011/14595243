Hypopituitarism and antiphospholipid syndrome. Endocrine disorders seen in antiphospholipid syndrome are rare. To date, these disorders have generally involved Addison's disease. Recently reports have appeared of a few cases of primary or secondary hypopituitarism associated with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. We report the case of a young female patient who presented neuroendocrine symptoms during the postpartum period associated with an antiphospholipid syndrome. Hormone assessment showed complete anterior hypopituitarism and antiphospholipid antibodies were positive. We discuss the clinical, biological and radiological features observed in our patient and compare results with cases reported in the literature. This case illustrates the importance of screening for antiphospholipid syndrome in the etiological work-up of hypopituitarism associated with a history of recurrent thrombosis.
