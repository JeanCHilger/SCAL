Pulmonary embolism in pregnant patients: a survey of practices and policies for CT pulmonary angiography. We surveyed the practices and policies of the radiology departments of the Society of Thoracic Radiology members regarding the use of CT pulmonary angiography in pregnant patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism.Surveys were mailed electronically to the 403 members of the Society of Thoracic Radiology (403 addresses). Respondents were asked to send one response from each institution or department. Information gathered included use of CT angiography in relation to ventilation-perfusion imaging in pregnant patients, written policies, informed consent procedures, and modifications of standard protocols for dose reduction.Fifty-seven members responded 43 (75%) reported that they perform CT angiography in pregnant patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism. Of the 43 respondents who perform CT angiography in pregnant patients, 23 (53%) generally perform CT angiography as the initial study rather than ventilation-perfusion scanning, 26 (60%) require informed consent from the patient, seven (16%) have a written policy concerning CT angiography in pregnant patients, and 17 (40%) modify standard imaging protocols for pregnant patients. The most common modification for dose reduction is decreasing the scanning area along the z-axis.Most respondents perform CT angiography in pregnant patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism, but their policies and practices vary considerably.
