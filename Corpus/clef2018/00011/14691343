Prediction of adverse neonatal outcomes in preeclampsia by absent or reversed end-diastolic flow velocity in the umbilical artery. To evaluate the independent contribution of absent or reversed end-diastolic umbilical artery Doppler flow (AREDF) in the prediction of subsequent adverse neonatal outcomes, we performed Doppler examinations on 270 preeclamptic women with a singleton pregnancy. The end-point variables were low Apgar scores and adverse neonatal outcomes (respiratory distress syndrome, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, seizures, jaundice, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, thrombocytopenia, polycythemia, and neonatal mortality). Stepwise logistic regression was used to control for gestational age, oligohydramnios, and fetal growth restriction. Infants with AREDF had an increased frequency of hypoglycemia (odds ratio=1.7) and polycythemia (odds ratio=1.7), whereas the remaining neonatal outcomes were explained by gestational age and growth restriction. Therefore, live-born infants of preeclamptic patients with AREDF velocities, independent of prematurity and growth restriction, are prone to hypoglycemia and polycythemia.
