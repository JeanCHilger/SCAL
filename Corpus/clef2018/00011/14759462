Successful treatment of massive pulmonary embolism in the 38th week of pregnancy. In 1998, a 32-year-old woman in week 38 of pregnancy was referred to our hospital because of swelling of the lower extremities and dyspnea at rest. A massive pulmonary embolism and thrombi in the right and left atria were detected. After a successful cesarean section, emergent pulmonary embolectomy was performed with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Both the mother and the fetus recovered without severe complications. Postoperatively, activated protein S deficiency was detected.
