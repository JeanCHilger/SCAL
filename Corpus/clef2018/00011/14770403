Inferior vena cava thrombosis presenting as non-immune hydrops in the fetus of a woman with diabetes. We present a rare case of non-immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) caused by a thrombus in the inferior vena cava in a neonate with low levels of anti-thrombin III. The diagnosis of (NIHF) was made in utero in a 43-year-old woman with poorly controlled gestational diabetes who subsequently developed pre-eclampsia. Cesarean section was performed due to fetal compromise and worsening pre-eclampsia. The thrombus resolved after neonatal treatment with heparin.
