An unusual case of HELLP syndrome. The Hellp's syndrome is a complication of gravidic hypertension which associates the microangiopathic hemolysis, the cytolytic hepatic anomalies and a thrombocytopenia. There are resemblences between the biologic and histologic forms of the thrombotic microangiopathy and Hellp's syndrome. In this publishing, we report one case of Hellp's syndrome which the particular character is that the hepatic and hemolytic biologic anomalies are still very discrete, where as the thrombopenia is deep this led us to rediscuss about the authencity of Hellp's syndrome. A neurologic complication, particulary gravissim, is noticed in one case, it concerns the intracerebral hematoma with left deficiency syndrome.
