Inherited thrombophilia, pregnancy, and oral contraceptive use: clinical implications. Inherited thrombophilia has been reported to be associated with an increased risk for complications of pregnancy, including venous thromboembolism (VTE) as well as preeclampsia (PEC), fetal loss (FL), fetal growth retardation (FGR), and abruptio placentae (AP), the latter probably due to inadequate placental perfusion. The estimate of risk largely depends on the kind of thrombophilia and on the criteria applied for the selection of the patients, producing in some cases contradictory results. Convincing evidence is available that deficiency of antithrombin III (AT), protein C (PC), and protein S (PS) is a risk factor for VTE and late FL. Factor V (Leiden) is associated with an increased risk for VTE, unexplained recurrent FL, late FL, and perhaps PEC prothrombin G20210A is a weak risk factor for VTE. So far, the data available for FGR and AP are scarce. However, the absolute risk for VTE during pregnancy and puerperium is between 1 and 3%, in comparison with the baseline risk of 0.08%. Antithrombotic prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin is warranted during puerperium in all women with thrombophilia and throughout all pregnancy in women at higher risk (AT deficiency, homozygosity for factor VLeiden, and perhaps PC and PS deficiencies)
