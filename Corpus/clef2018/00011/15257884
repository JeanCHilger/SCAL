Stroke following variceal sclerotherapy. Paradoxical embolism via a patent foramen ovale (PFO) has been identified as a potential risk factor for ischaemic stroke. Such occurrences are associated with risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), e. g. pregnancy, immobilisation, and surgery of the lower limbs.A 54-year-old otherwise healthy female presented with acute onset motoric aphasia and brachiofacial right hemiparesis. The cranial computed tomography showed a left striatal ischaemic infarction. The patient's history revealed a variceal sclerotherapy with polydocanol 0,5% three days prior to the onset of symptoms. Echovist TCM doppler revealed a right-to-left shunt. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) was detected by transesophageal echocardiography. There was no evidence of DVT in bilateral lower-extremity venous duplex ultrasound scanning. Other potential risk factors of stroke including thrombophilia could not be identified. The patient was treated with a high dose regimen of heparin and a further anticoagulation treatment was recommended.This case suggests a probable causal relationship between variceal sclerotherapy and paradoxical embolism resulting in a stroke. Variceal sclerotherapy might be a potential, but rare risk of embolism.
