Role of Doppler velocimetry of uterine arteries and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in detecting pregnancies at risk for preeclampsia. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in association with Doppler velocimetry of uterine arteries in the detection of preeclampsia (PE).In a prospective study, 22 patients at risk for the development of PE have been en-rolled: 17 were nulliparous women with increased resistances in uterine arteries at 24 weeks and 5 had an obstetric history of PE. All patients were tested with ABPM and uterine arteries Doppler velocimetry. A resistance index (RI) higher than 0.62 for the Doppler velocimetry and a diastolic midline estimating statistic of rhythm (MESOR) higher than 68 for the ABPM were considered abnormal. Patients were followed longitudinally until delivery. The occurrence of PE and low birth weight were considered as gestational outcomes endpoints.Overall, the mean gestational age at delivery was 36.3+/-3.4 weeks (range 29.4-41). Six out of 22 (27.2%) patients developed PE 4 out of 22 (18%) newborns were small for gestational age (SGA) <5 degrees percentile. In the prediction of PE, ABPM in association with Doppler velocimetry showed a positive predictive value (PPV) of 42% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 90%, for the development of low birth weight the PPV was 33% and the NPV 100%.This study shows that ABPM in association with Doppler velocimetry evaluation is a useful test to detect patients at high risk for the development of PE.
