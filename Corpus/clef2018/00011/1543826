Highlights of the past year include the use of real-time ultrasound rather than venography to diagnose deep vein thrombosis in pregnancy, the establishment of Doppler ultrasound for noninvasive measurement of cardiac output, better awareness of the risk to the fetus if the mother has immune thrombocytopenic purpura, the description of the maturation of fetal thyroid function, the problems of in utero treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia in the fetus, and an appreciation of the fetal risk if maternal phenylketonuria is not managed by strict dieting in pregnancy.
