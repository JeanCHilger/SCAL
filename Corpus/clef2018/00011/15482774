Predicted value of renin activity in a woman who had severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with internal jugular vein thrombosis. To assess plasma renin activity in a patient with severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and internal jugular vein thrombosis.Case report.University-affiliated infertility center.A 33-year-old woman with OHSS and internal jugular vein thrombosis.Controlled ovulation hyperstimulation with recombinant FSH induction.Plasma renin activity (PRA), color Doppler ultrasound of the neck.The patient had internal jugular vein thrombosis caused by severe OHSS. The PRA was significantly elevated during the acute stage and subsequently declined after resolution of the OHSS.In this patient elevated PRA appeared to be associated with the development of OHSS and thrombosis. The implication of the ovarian renin-angiotensin system in the development of OHSS and thrombosis is relevant.
