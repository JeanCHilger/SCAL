Thrombosis of the right ovarian vein. Thrombosis of the ovarian vein (TOV) is a rare complication which arises classically in the post-partum. Its main signs are pain in the flanks or the iliac fossa, associated with temperature and hyperleukocytosis. It is a differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis when located on the right side.A 26 year-old, primiparous woman consulted at 38 weeks of amenorrhoea for pain in the right iliac fossa and flank with a temperature of 38.6 degrees C. Three days after delivery, because of heavier pain, a coelioscopy was decided on that led to the diagnosis of thrombosis of the right ovarian vein.Improvement in the diagnosis techniques, notably Doppler ultrasonography and spiral CT should avoid the diagnosis of TOV during surgery. Traditionally a post-partum complication, TOV can occur before delivery, period during which it is very important not to misjudge this diagnosis, notably in case of thrombosis spreading to the inferior vena cava with free-floating thrombus. The treatment of TOV is essentially medical. In the case of extension to the vena cava, the installation of a vena cava filter or a surgical cava thrombectomy may be necessary.
