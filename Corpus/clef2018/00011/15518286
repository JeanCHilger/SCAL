Sucessful pregnancy outcome following three severe placental abruptions and intrauterine fetal death in the patient--heterozygous carrier of R506Q mutation of factor V (Leiden). A case of successful pregnancy outcome is reported in a patient with 3 preceding severe placental abruptions with intrauterine fetal death and caesarean deliveries. In the course of the current pregnancy heterozygosity for R506Q mutation of factor V (Leiden) was diagnosed in 26 weeks of gestation [w.g.] and low molecular weight heparin [LMWH] therapy initiated. Maternal condition was stable until delivery and all laboratory findings were within normal range. The fetus was followed up by ultrasound biometry and Doppler blood flow studies. From 28 w.g. on NST and biophysical profile were included. An emergency caesarean section was performed in 34 w.g. because of contractions not responding to tocolysis. The newborn was in good condition with weight and length corresponding to the 10th centile for gestational age [g.a]. Histologic study of the placenta showed anemic infarctions and recent haemorrhages in the basal and the chorionic plate. The initiation of LMWH therapy in the case reported was late (26 w.g.). By that moment there was already evidence of impaired fetal growth with fetal biometry corresponding to the 10th centile for g.a. After LMWH therapy was started no further slow down of fetal growth was registered. Successful pregnancy outcome may be related not only to LMWH therapy but also to other factors like active fetal monitoring after 28 w.g. and the emergency caesarian delivery immediately after the onset of uterine contractions. Patients with past obstetric history of severe preeclampsia, placental abruption or fetal growth restriction have to be screened for hereditary or acquired thrombophilia. If a thrombophillic state is present early LMWH therapy has to be considered. It is aimed to prevent anaemic placental infarctions and thrombotic complications.
