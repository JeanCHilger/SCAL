Umbilical and uterine Doppler velocimetry and prostaglandin levels in preeclampsia. Eleven preterm patients with severe preeclampsia underwent Doppler velocimetry prior to cesarean section. Maternal venous blood and umbilical arterial and venous samples were collected for prostacyclin and thromboxane determination by radioimmunoassay. Umbilical artery pulsatility index correlated positively with umbilical artery thromboxane B2 levels (r = 0.76 P less than 0.05) and maternal thromboxane levels (r = 0.78
