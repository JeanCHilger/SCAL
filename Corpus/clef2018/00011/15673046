Delivery and perinatal aspects of pregnant women with pre-eclampsia-eclampsia. Hypertension is the most important cause of disease in the expectant mother and the fetus, and it unfavorably affects the perinatal morbidity and mortality.To determine the method of delivery of a pregnant women with Praeeclampsia-Eclampsia (PE-E) depending upon the severity, continuity and term of appearance of hypertensive disease during pregnancy and its impact on perinatal morbidity and mortality.The study covers a two year period (2002-2003), during which 84 pregnant women are treated and deliver with PE-E in the Ist and IInd Obstetrics clinics. Of them 64 (76.20%) are with mild form of PE, 10 (11.90%) with mid severe form and 10 (11.90%) severe form of which 3 had Eclampsia. The pregnancies were followed using echography and cardiotocographic monitoring.With the severe forms of PE-E the disease started between 25-30 gestational weeks (60%), while with the mid severe the appearance was between 31-36 g.w. (50%). Persistence of PE > 4 g.w. was observed with severe PE, whereas in mild forms continuity of < 3 g.w. (73.44%) prevailed with its onset after 37 g.w. (57.81%). Normal delivery was attained with 41 pregnancies (48.81%), Caesarean section (CS) with 40 (47.62%), vacuum extraction with 1 (81.19%) and 2 (2.38%) had incomplete aborts. Frequency of CS with the severe forms of PE-E is 80%, with mid severe 50%, and with the mild forms is 42.19%. The most frequent indication of CS is fetal distress--11 (27.50%) and complicated obstetric anamnesis--9 (22.50%). With severe PE-E the most frequent indication is aggravation of symptoms and its non responsiveness to treatment. Born dead are 3 fetuses with severe retardation and body weight < 800 gm. Early gestational age hasn't given us the reason for premature delivery. Death of 1 child, born by CS with 750 gm weight is recorded. The higher rate of CS (3 times more than the median for the clinic--15.16%) can be explained to a degree by the fact that operative delivery by CS in pregnancies with PE-E reduces complications and has an aim to prevent complications to the fetus as well as the mother.
