Genetic thrombophilias and uterine artery Doppler velocimetry and preeclampsia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between genetic thrombophilic mutations, uterine artery Doppler at 24 weeks of gestation and preeclampsia.In a case control study we performed the genetic analysis for Leiden mutation of factor V gene (FV), G20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene (PT) and C677T polymorphism of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene in 103 women that had already attended routine ultrasonography scanner at 20 weeks at our Department.The frequency of heterozygous carriers of the factor V Leiden was 17.4% in the women with preeclampsia and abnormal artery Doppler compared with 3.12% in the patients with normal pregnancies. This difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The frequency of mutation G20210A of prothrombin gene was 1.5 vs. 4.3% between women with normal pregnancies and with preeclampsia. This difference is not statistically significant. The frequency of homozygous patients for the C677T mutation of MTHFR gene among the patients with preeclampsia was 21.7% and in the control group was 10.3%, but this difference is not statistically significant. No thrombophilic gene variants were found in women with preeclampsia and normal uterine artery Doppler.We demonstrated the important association between factor V Leiden mutation, abnormal uterine Doppler at 24 weeks and preeclampsia in our population.
