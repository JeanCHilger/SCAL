Low-molecular-weight heparins during pregnancy. A few years ago I suffered from pulmonary emboli. My physician recommended I use dalteparin during this pregnancy although, during my previous pregnancy, I had received subcutaneous heparin injections three times daily. Is dalteparin the same as heparin?: Based on the best available evidence from mostly small prospective case series, retrospective reports, and placental perfusion studies, low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), such as dalteparin, are a safe and convenient alternative to heparin during pregnancy for both mothers and fetuses.
