Biventricular thrombus complicating peripartum cardiomyopathy. A case report. The authors report a case of a biventricular thrombus complicating peripartum cardiomyopathy in a 38 years old female. The diagnosis was done by bidimensionnal transthoracic echocardiography which showed 2 thrombi in the apical region of the right ventricle and in the anterior and lateral wall of the left ventricle. With treatment associating salt restriction, diuretics and angiotensin-converting-enzyme- inhibitors, the evolution was good: the thrombi disappeared at the first month for the left ventricular thrombi and after 45 days for the rignt ventricular thrombi. The patient didn't experience any embolic complication.
