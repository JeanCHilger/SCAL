A case of late postpartum seizures after epidural analgesia. We present the case of a 29-year-old female who in her third pregnancy developed seizures seven days postpartum. The only symptoms preceding the seizures were headache and visual disturbance. There was no evidence of preeclampsia antepartum or postpartum. All clinical investigations were normal including computerised tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and lumbar puncture. All symptoms resolved within 24 h of the first seizure. In this case report we highlight the difficulties in establishing the cause of postpartum seizures.
