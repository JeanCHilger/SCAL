Subclavian vein thrombosis: a late complication of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Two cases of subclavian vein thrombosis following ovarian stimulation for in-vitro fertilization and subsequent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) are described. Both occurred several weeks after complete resolution of the OHSS. The site of the lesions and their timing suggest that there is a generalized disturbance of coagulation associated with OHSS, which persists beyond the duration of the clinical syndrome.
