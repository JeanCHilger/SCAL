Fetal/neonatal outcome in abruptio placentae during preterm gestation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fetal/neonatal outcome and to determine the important factors in that outcome, including the use of ultrasonography and fetal heart rate monitoring, in abruptio placentae during preterm gestation. A case-control study was performed using a logistic regression model. Adverse outcome was defined as neonatal death before hospital discharge or a diagnosis of cerebral palsy in surviving neonates. Stillbirth (group 1) occurred in eight of 50 cases of abruptio placentae (16%). Adverse outcome was seen in 11 survivors (11 of 42 26.2%). The obstetrical disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score in group 1 (11.8 +/- 7.1) was higher than that in the adverse (5.7 +/- 1.3) and satisfactory (5.3 +/- 2.4) outcome groups. A low Apgar score (< 7) at 5 minutes (odds ratio, 19.8
