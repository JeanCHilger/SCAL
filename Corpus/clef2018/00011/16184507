Thrombophilia and fetal germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage: does it matter? Germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) in the fetus is very rare and the role of thrombophilia in its pathogenesis is unclear. We report on the prenatal diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging of GMH-IVH in a 24-week fetus. The newborn presented posthemorrhagic ventriculomegaly and was found to be heterozygous for two thrombophilic patterns, factor V Leiden and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutation. The combination of this hypercoagulable state and prenatal GMH-IVH is discussed together with the opportunity of testing these infants for thrombophilia.
