Argon beam coagulator for treatment of hepatic rupture with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome. We present a case of hepatic rupture secondary to hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome and the novel use of the argon beam coagulator in achieving hemostasis.The patient presented at 33 5/7 weeks of gestation with elevated liver transaminases, thrombocytopenia, and ultrasonographic findings consistent with hepatic rupture. She underwent an emergent cesarean delivery followed by exploration of her abdomen by hepatobiliary surgeons. An expanding hematoma with rupture of the right lobe of the liver was identified. The hematoma was unroofed, and hemostasis was obtained using the argon beam coagulator. The patient was discharged home in good condition 9 days after surgery.With a multidisciplinary approach and the argon beam coagulator, we were able to achieve an excellent clinical outcome in a patient with hepatic rupture from HELLP syndrome.
