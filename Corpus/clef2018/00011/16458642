Pelvic magnetic resonance venography reveals high rate of pelvic vein thrombosis after cesarean section. In the run-in phase of a thromboprophylactic trial in women at moderate to high risk of deep vein thrombosis postcesarean section, we used magnetic resonance venography and found a surprisingly high rate of pelvic deep vein thrombosis (46% overall). Pelvic magnetic resonance venography may be a useful surrogate outcome in obstetric thromboprophylaxis studies but the clinical significance is not known.
