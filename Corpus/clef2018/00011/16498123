Radiation dose to the fetus from body MDCT during early gestation. The purpose of our study was to determine radiation dose to the fetus at early gestation when contemporary MDCT scanners are used for common clinical indications.Anthropomorphic phantoms were constructed to reflect a pregnant woman. Thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) and metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) detectors were placed in appropriate locations to determine real-time radiation exposure to the fetus at 0 and 3 months' gestation. Imaging was performed on a 16-MDCT scanner using current institutional CT protocols: renal stone (140 kVp, 160 mA, rotation time of 0.5 sec, 16 x 0.625 mm), appendix (140 kVp, 340 mA, rotation time of 0.5 sec, 16 x 0.625 mm), and pulmonary embolus (140 kVp, 380 mA, rotation time of 0.8 sec, 16 x 1.25 mm).The radiation dose to the fetus at 0 and 3 months, respectively, was as follows: renal stone protocol, 0.8-1.2 and 0.4-0.7 cGy appendix protocol, 1.52-1.68 and 2-4 cGyRadiation doses to the fetus from institutional MDCT protocols that may be used during pregnancy (for pulmonary embolus, appendicitis, and renal colic) are below the level thought to induce neurologic detriment to the fetus. Imaging the mother for appendicitis theoretically may double the fetal risk for developing a childhood cancer. Radiation doses to the fetus from pulmonary embolus chest CT angiography are of the same magnitude as ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning.
