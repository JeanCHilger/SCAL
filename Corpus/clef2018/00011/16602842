Dilatation of the abdominal umbilical vein is associated with increased risk of thrombotic complications. Malformations of the umbilical vein are rare abnormalities diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound. They might be associated with fetal hydrops and fetal death. We report two newborn infants with prenatal diagnosis of umbilical vein dilatation who developed venous thrombosis and discuss the pre- and postnatal management of the constellation with special emphasis on antithrombotic treatment.
