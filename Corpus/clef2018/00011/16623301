Retrospective study of 23 cases of hepatic infarction: CT findings and pathological correlations. The aim of this study was to retrospectively review the cases of hepatic infarction diagnosed at our institute using conventional, spiral and multislice computed tomography (CT) over the last decade in order to describe its morphological and density characteristics and define its possible etiopathogenesis.Twenty-three consecutive patients aged 27-65 years with hepatic infarction were studied by CT at our institute over a period of about 10 years. A conventional CT unit was used in seven patients, a helical CT scanner in ten and a multislice CT in six. CT was performed before and after the administration of 130-150 cc of contrast material infused at a rate of 3-3.5 ml/s.CT showed hepatic infarction due to arterial causes in 19 cases, 11 of which were in liver transplant patients. The infarction was related to right hepatic artery embolisation to control haemorrhage (one case), chemoembolisation of a multifocal hepatocarcinoma in a cirrhotic liver (one case), arterial mesenteric infarction due to thromboembolism (two cases), necrotising pancreatitis (one case), surgery in pancreatic cancer invading the hepatic artery (one case), pancreaticoduodenectomy (two cases), portal thrombosis in a young woman with pregnancy-related clotting disorder (one case), haemolytic anaemia, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome (one case) eclampsia and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (one case) and acute exacerbation of Budd-Chiari syndrome (one case). At CT scans, hepatic infarction was depicted as a hypodense parenchymal area, at times triangular in shape, with sharp peripheral contours (12 cases) or as a rounded central or marginal area (four cases) with irregular appearance (three cases), with lobar extension (two cases) and ill-defined shape (two cases). Moreover, CT showed intralesional gas not correlated to bacterial infection (two cases). In all surgical cases, the results were confirmed by pathology.CT is the method of choice in the diagnosis of hepatic infarction, providing useful information regarding site, morphology, and extent of the lesion. Furthermore, in most cases, CT is able to suggest the possible aetiology and guide appropriate management.
