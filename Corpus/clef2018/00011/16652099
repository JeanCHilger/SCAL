Need for an urgent ultrasound examination for neck lump. Thromboembolic phenomenon is rare but serious consequence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. We present a case of thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein presenting as a neck lump to the ENT department. Ultrasonography of the neck and upper extremity revealed thrombosis of right internal jugular vein. The patient was started on low molecular weight heparin, which resulted in resolution of her clinical condition. Interestingly, the majority of cases after OHSS involve thrombosis of the upper extremities. ENT surgeons, general physicians, and infertility experts should consider this in the differential diagnosis of neck swellings, particularly after OHSS and IVF treatment, and in this case report, we emphasis the need for an urgent ultrasound of the neck in such patients.
