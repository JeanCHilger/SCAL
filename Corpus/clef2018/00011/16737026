Management of recurrent early pregnancy loss. Recurrent pregnancy loss is a devastating health problem that affects many couples who are trying to establish a family. Evaluation depends on a number of factors, including the pattern of pregnancy loss, underlying medical disease and life-style issues. A detailed obstetric history, including gestational age at the time of death, ultrasound, pathology and cytogenetic results, is key in the evaluation and management of recurrent pregnancy loss. This complex reproductive disorder requires a multidisciplinary approach since genetic, endocrinologic, anatomic, immunologic, infectious, thrombophilic and iatrogenic factors may require evaluation and management. Monitoring of subsequent pregnancies requires close supportive care.
