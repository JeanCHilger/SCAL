Consensus on extra-hepatic portal vein obstruction. The Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) had set up a working party on portal hypertension in 2002 with a mandate to develop consensus on various aspects of portal hypertension. The first of these consensuses has been developed on extra-hepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO). It was discussed and prepared by the experts in this field from the Asian region and was presented at the annual meeting of the APASL, at Bali in August 2005. This article summarizes all the consensus statements approved by the APASL on various aspects of EHPVO.
