Perinatal risk factors for neonatal intracerebral hemorrhage in preterm infants. To investigate the perinatal factors related to neonatal intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and possibly to define obstetric and perinatal risk factors.All medical records of women who delivered in the period from 1 January 1991 to 1 January 2000 were reviewed for intracerebral hemorrhages in infants born between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation and treated in the postnatal period. Sixty infants with ICH (Group I) and 60 infants without ICH (Group II, matched controls) were determined for comparison. Obstetrical parameters and risk factors and perinatal outcome parameters were evaluated and statistically analyzed.Neonatal intracerebral hemorrhage prevalence was 0.8% (60/7635 births). Betamethasone administration was significantly less in Group I than in Group II (27% versus 46%). Although Doppler-sonography of the middle cerebral artery was performed in a minority of the cases, it showed a significant tendency of lower resistance indices (brain sparing) in the intracerebral hemorrhage group (66.7% versus 21.1%). Postnatally, infants with intracerebral hemorrhage showed a significantly more often umbilical arterial acidosis (18% versus 10%), a greater base deficit, lower median 5 min Apgar scores (6 and 8, respectively for Groups I and II), and a lower thrombocyte count (Group I 190,000 +/- 76,000 microl(-1), and Group II 227,000 +/- 96,000 microl(-1)). Infants in Group I were more often (93% versus 76%) and longer (26.7 +/- 30.5 days versus 15.4 +/- 11.7 days) dependent on ventilatory support than infants in Group II. Mortality rate in Group I (35%) was significantly higher compared to Group II (17%).Antenatal Doppler sonography in predicting intracerebral hemorrhage in preterm infants should be investigated in large scale prospective studies. Postnatal low pH-values (pH < 7.1) and a base deficit of more than -16 mmol/L in the umbilical artery, low Apgar scores and thrombocytopenia are associated with a neonatal intracerebral hemorrhage and prophylaxis with corticosteroids reduces the risk for it. A higher neonatal mortality and morbidity, including neurological and neuromotoric dysfunctions is expected in this clinical entity.
