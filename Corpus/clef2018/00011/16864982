First trimester markers for pre-eclampsia: placental vs. non-placental protein serum levels. Parallel investigation, in a matched case-control study, of the association of different first-trimester markers with the risk of subsequent pre-eclampsia (PE).The levels of different first trimester serum markers and fetal nuchal translucency thickness were compared between 52 cases of PE and 104 control women by non-parametric two-group comparisons and by calculating matched odds ratios.In univariable analysis increased concentrations of inhibin A and activin A were associated with subsequent PE (p < 0.02). Multivariable conditional logistic regression models revealed an association between increased risk of PE and increased inhibin A and translucency thickness and respectively reduced pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and placental lactogen . However, these associations varied with the gestational age at sample collection. For blood samples taken in pregnancy weeks 12 and 13 only, increased levels of activin A, inhibin A and nuchal translucency thickness, and lower levels of placenta growth factor and PAPP-A were associated with an increased risk of PE.Members of the inhibin family and to some extent PAPP-A and placental growth factor are superior to other serum markers, and the predictive value of these depends on the gestational age at blood sampling. The availability of a single, early pregnancy 'miracle' serum marker for PE risk assessment seems unlikely in the near future.
