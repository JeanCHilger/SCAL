Prenatal management of placental chorioangioma: value of the middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity. Placental chorioangiomas are benign tumors of the placenta. Large chorioangiomas may cause severe complications such as fetal anemia, hydrops and fetal death. We report the use of sonographic findings and peak systolic velocity in the middle cerebral artery in the diagnosis and management of fetal anemia without the occurrence of hydrops fetalis in a pregnant woman with a large placental chorioangioma. Successful intrauterine blood transfusion was performed at 26 weeks. Spontaneous thrombosis of the main supplying blood vessel of the chorioangioma was detected at 33 weeks. The child was delivered at 39 weeks of pregnancy in normal clinical condition.
