Rupture of intracranial aneurysm due to intravascular metastasis of choriocarcinoma. Case report. A 55-year-old female was admitted to the Juntendo Izunagaoka Hospital, because of sudden onset of motor aphasia and right hemiparesis. Neurological examination on admission revealed drowsy state, bilateral papilledema, motor aphasia, and right hemiparesis. Computed tomography showed a subcortical hematoma in the left frontoparietal region associated with perifocal edema. Left carotid angiography revealed a fusiform aneurysm at a peripheral branch of the central artery. There was no tumor stain on cerebral angiograms. A combination procedure was carried out during emergency surgery, including evacuation of the intracerebral hematoma and removal of the thrombus-like material from the aneurysmal cavity followed by wrapping the aneurysm with fascia. Histological examination of the thrombus-like material demonstrated that it was a neoplastic embolus of choriocarcinoma. Serum (2600 mIU/ml) and urinary (7200 mIU/ml) human chorionic gonadotropin levels were elevated. The features of neoplastic aneurysm due to choriocarcinoma are reviewed and discussed.
