Imaging of Budd-Chiari syndrome. Budd-Chiari syndrome occurs when venous outflow from the liver is obstructed. The obstruction may occur at any point from the hepatic venules to the left atrium. The syndrome most often occurs in patients with underlying thrombotic disorders such as polycythemia rubra vera, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and pregnancy. It may also occur secondary to a variety of tumours, chronic inflammatory diseases and infections. Imaging plays an important role both in establishing the diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome as well as evaluating for underlying causes and complications such as portal hypertension. In this review article, we discuss the role of modern imaging in the evaluation of Budd-Chiari syndrome.
