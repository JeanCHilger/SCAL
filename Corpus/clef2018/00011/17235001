Imaging of neurologic disorders associated with pregnancy and the postpartum period. Diverse pathologic conditions affect the central nervous system (CNS) and pituitary gland during pregnancy and the puerperium. Some are specific to the physiologic process of reproduction (eg, eclampsia, postpartum cerebral angiopathy, Sheehan syndrome, lymphocytic adenohypophysitis). Others are nonspecific but occur more often in pregnant women (eg, cerebral infarction, dural venous thrombosis, pituitary apoplexy). Recognition of the characteristic imaging findings in eclampsia, for example, may allow exclusion of other disorders. Even when imaging changes are nonspecific, knowledge of those entities associated with pregnancy and awareness of the increased likelihood of certain diseases in pregnancy will allow a more informed differential diagnosis. Differentiation of primary nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from aneurysmal SAH is an example. Moreover, earlier use of imaging will result in fewer delayed diagnoses. For example, magnetic resonance venography allows early diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis. Even when the imaging changes are less specific, knowledge of likely possibilities will lead to more appropriate earlier use of imaging. For example, the stimulatory effects of pregnancy on prolactinoma, meningioma, hemangioblastoma, vestibular schwannoma, and metastatic tumors such as breast cancer and choriocarcinoma suggest the early use of CNS imaging to avoid the consequences of a delayed diagnosis.
