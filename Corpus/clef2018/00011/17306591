Is a non-invasive management allowed for maternofetal alloimmune thrombocytopenia? Experience over a 10-year period. Our purpose was to study a non-invasive management of fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FMAIT).Between 1996 and 2005, 18 women were treated. The population was divided into 2 groups: patients with a history of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in the older sibling received weekly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy to the mother (1 g/kg per week) without initial cordocentesis whereas patients with a history of neonatal thrombocytopenia did not undergo any treatment.All pregnancies with a previous FMAIT were monitored with serial ultrasound scans without cordecentesis. 15 patients had HPA-1, 2 HPA-3 and 1 HPA-5 immunizations. Weekly intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was administered in 5 patients with a history of ICH in the older sibling. Two of these delivered thrombocytopenic children one had a platelet count < 50 x 10(9)/l. For the 13 women (one twin) who had a sibling with neonatal thrombocytopenia, 11/14 newborns had a platelet count < 50 x 10(9)/l. Predelivery fetal blood sampling were performed in 8/18 pregnancies. The neonatal periods of the 19 children were uncomplicated and no ICHs were observed.Our results suggest that a non-invasive strategy avoiding serial cordocentesis may be an effective therapy in patients who are at risk of fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia.
