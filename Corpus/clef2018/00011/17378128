The case of spleen's tumor and trombocytopenia in pregnant women. The women with spleen's tumor and trombocytopenia was diagnosed and observed during pregnancy, labour and puerperium. The lowest level of thrombocytes (50 K/microl) was detected in 32nd week of pregnancy. Termination of the pregnancy by cesarean section was performed because of a big risk for the mother and child (tumor's crack, haemorrhage, infection). The same time the splenectomy was conducted. The results were successful.
