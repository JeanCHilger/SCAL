Prenatal thrombosis of the inferior vena cava and the renal veins. This manuscript discusses the clinical presentation, diagnosis, pathophysiology and possible etiologies of prenatal thrombosis of the inferior vena cava and renal veins.Eleven cases were identified through a Medline search of the English literature. These cases were reviewed, together with a recent case that was treated in our medical center.Fetal thrombosis in the aforementioned vessels, presented as hydrops fetalis (33%), acute fetal distress (42%), or as an incidental prenatal ultrasound finding (25%). Underlying maternal conditions were present in 58%, and included chronic conditions (hypertension and diabetes mellitus), acute conditions (pyelonephritis and preeclampsia) and thrombophilia. In 42% cases, the prenatal ultrasound scan revealed an enlarged and hyper-echogenic affected kidney.Intrauterine fetal venous thrombosis is a rare phenomenon, probably attributed to a multifactorial process. These factors may include inherited thrombophilia as well as prothrombotic clinical conditions.
