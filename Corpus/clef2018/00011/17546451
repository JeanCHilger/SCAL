Bilateral renal venous thrombosis and adrenal hemorrhage: sequential prenatal US with postnatal recovery. A neonate presented with bilateral renal venous thrombosis (RVT) and adrenal hemorrhage. Serial fetal ultrasonography showed progressive development of severe atrophy of one kidney and mild atrophy of the other. At sequential postnatal imaging, both kidneys showed progressive growth. Bilateral fetal RVT is quite uncommon, and postnatal recovery of a kidney severely affected by RVT is very rare.
