Endothelin 1 and angiotensin II in preeeclampsia. It is generally thought that development of hypertension in preeclampsia (PE) is due to generalized endothelial dysfunction and/or results from an imbalance in the production and/or action of vasoactive factors, resulting in higher cytosolic Ca2+ concentration which in turn leads to vasoconstriction and decreased blood pressure perfusion in organs, including the fetoplacental unit. Among vasoactive factors involved in blood pressure regulation, endothelin 1 (ET-1) and angiotensin II (Ang II) regulate cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations and therefore are considered in this review. PE is associated with higher circulating and placental ET-1 levels, observation that explains, at least in part, vasoconstriction and oxidative stress. Higher and lower Ang II sensitivity seen in PE and normal pregnancy, respectively, could not be explained by changes in renin-angiotensin system components, including Ang II receptors (AT1). During normal pregnancy, AT1 receptors are found as monomers and are inactivated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to lower Ang II sensitivity. In contrast, PE is associated with increased AT1/bradykinin receptors (B2) heterodimers which are resistant to inactivation by ROS, maintaining increased AT1-receptor stimulated signaling in PE. In addition, AT-1 agonistic antibodies (AT1-AA) obtained from PE women increases intracellular Ca2+, NADPH oxidase components and ROS, effects not observed with normal pregnancy AT1-AA.High ET-1 levels, the presence of AT1/B2 receptor heterodimers and increased AT1-AA are involved, at least in part, in the hypertensive and oxidative stress states in PE.
