Salmonella neck abscess associated with jugular vein thrombosis. An unusual case of synergistic infection caused by Salmonella paratyphi and anaerobic streptococcus resulting in necrotizing cervical infection associated with deep neck abscess and internal jugular vein thrombosis, is presented. Salmonella acting as an oxygen consumer in the infected tissues, facilitates the growth of anaerobic cocci, hence the development of a devastating soft tissue infection. The precipitating cause was a tonsillar infection developing due to 'post-anginal sepsis'. The aetiopathogenesis of the cervical infection is discussed.
