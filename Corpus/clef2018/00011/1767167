Physiopathological elements of pre-eclampsia and the role of the main complementary tests. The origin of pre-eclampsia lies in uteroplacental ischemia due to an anomaly of the "vascular insertion" of the placenta. Although the cause of this anomaly remains unknown, it would appear to include both a genetic and an immunological origin possibly favourised by special underlying conditions and certain obstetric circumstances. Prostaglandin imbalance (in particular prostacyclins and Thromboxane A2) appears to be one of the chief factors governing these anomalies. One of the consequences of these mechanisms is the onset of hypertension but other disturbances are essential features. In particular, disseminated intravascular coagulation may occur leading to the release of numerous microthrombi which cause placental (leading to chronic fetal distress), renal, hepatic and cerebral lesions.
