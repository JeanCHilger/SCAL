MDCT of acute thrombotic and nonthrombotic pulmonary emboli. Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a common clinical challenge. MDCT pulmonary angiography has become the first line imaging study in the diagnosis of PE because of its speed, accuracy, low-interobserver variability, and ability to provide alternative diagnoses. This review article highlights the role of MDCT in the evaluation of acute thrombotic PE in the era of PIOPED 2. MDCT findings of acute PE and some potential pitfalls are covered as well as some of the controversies in imaging young and pregnant patients. MDCT findings of acute non-thrombotic PE are also covered. This latter group may be occult on the angiographic portion of the study but may declare themselves through secondary findings. Their findings and potential mimics are included so that the interpreting radiologist can make the most of a CT to rule out PE.
