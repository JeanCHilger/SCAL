Syncopal episode as the presenting symptom of jugular vein thrombosis in pregnancy: a case report. Jugular vein thrombosis has been reported to occur in pregnant women who conceived with assisted reproductive technology (ART).A 28-year-old woman at 17 weeks' gestation presented to the emergency room with a syncopal episode. She reported no arm pain or swelling, no neck pain or swelling, and no dyspnea or difficulty swallowing. Doppler sonography of the neck vasculature revealed acute bilateral internal jugular vein thromboses. Thrombophilia workup was normal. Intravenous anticoagulation with heparin was initiated, and the patient was discharged on low-molecular-weight heparin.Though rare, jugular vein thrombosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of syncopal episodes even in women who conceive without ART.
