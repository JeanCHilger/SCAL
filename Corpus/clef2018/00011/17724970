Acute headaches--when to treat immediately, when to wait. Headaches are among the most frequently named symptoms in general practices. About 90% of the patients suffer from idiopathic headaches, for example, migraine or tension headaches, which are treated according to guidelines. An acute headache can however also be a symptom of a serious primary disease, such as subarachnoidal haemorrhage, arterial dissection, cerebral infarction, cerebral venous thrombosis or acute glaucoma. Patients with suspected symptomatic headaches must be immediately referred to a specialist or hospital for further diagnosis and therapy.
