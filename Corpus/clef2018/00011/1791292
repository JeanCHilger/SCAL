Late postpartum eclampsia, myth or reality?. It has never been formally established whether eclampsia can come on more than 48 hours after delivery. We report a case of a patient who had convulsions together with transitory raised blood pressure coming on 14 days after her delivery. MRI was carried out 24 hours after the attack and showed pathological sub-cortical images and there was a hyper signal at T2. This is now a well known feature and has been described in the course of typical eclampsia fits. On the other hand MRI is able to eliminate a certain number of differential diagnoses such as cerebral thrombophlebitis, cerebral vascular accidents and tumours. A cerebral blood flow study and a trans-cranial Doppler flow study showed (as far as we know for the first time) a lessening in perfusion and in speed of flow giving rise to lowered blood circulation in that part of the brain and suggestive of vascular spasm. This observation makes it very likely that eclamptic crises can occur two weeks after delivery and favours a vascular spasm being the origin of these crises.
