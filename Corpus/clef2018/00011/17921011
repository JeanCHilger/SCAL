Thromboembolism in pregnancy. Venous thromboembolism in pregnancy is a clinical emergency that has been associated with significant risk for maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The adaptation of the maternal hemostatic system to pregnancy predisposes women to an increased risk of thromboembolism. A timely diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis is crucial because up to 24% of patients with untreated deep venous thrombosis develop a pulmonary embolism. Recent clinical guidelines identify compression venous ultrasound as the best way to diagnose deep venous thrombosis in pregnancy and CT pulmonary angiography as the best way to diagnose pulmonary embolism in pregnancy. Therapy involves supportive care and anticoagulation with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin, depending on the clinical scenario.
