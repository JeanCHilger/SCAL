Predictive value of angiogenic factors and uterine artery Doppler for early- versus late-onset pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. To investigate potential differences in the prediction of early- vs. late-onset pre-eclampsia and/or intrauterine growth restriction (PE/IUGR) by second-trimester uterine artery Doppler examination, and measurement of maternal serum placental growth factor (PlGF) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1).Uterine artery mean pulsatility index (PI) and maternal serum PlGF and sFlt1 levels were measured at 24 weeks of gestation in 76 healthy pregnant women and 38 cases of PE/IUGR, of which 19 were defined as early onset (< 32 weeks).For a specificity of 95%, the sensitivities of uterine artery mean PI, PlGF and sFlt1 for early-onset PE/IUGR were 47.4%, 84.4% and 36.8%, respectively. When combining uterine artery Doppler with PlGF, the sensitivity for identifying early-onset PE/IUGR was 89.5% with a specificity of 95%. Conversely, the sensitivity for late-onset PE/IUGR was below 11% for all parameters analyzed.Angiogenic factors and uterine artery Doppler evaluation may be useful second-trimester screening tests for early-onset, but not late-onset, PE/IUGR.
