Postpartum seizures after epidural analgesia: a patient with a mutation of the factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene. We report the case of a 27-year-old parturient who developed a headache within 12 hours of delivery and who subsequently seized. Further examination, including magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic scan, showed a partial thrombosis of a transversal venous sinus, the underlying cause being an activated protein C resistance caused by a heterozygote factor V Leiden mutation and heterozygote prothrombin-gene mutation G20210A. Seven months after delivery, the patient is in good health, showing no neurocognitive disability.
