The effect of a mast cell degranulating agent on vascular resistance in the human placental vascular bed and on the tone of isolated placental vessels. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a mast cell degranulating agent, compound 48/80, on vascular resistance in the perfused human placenta and on the tone of isolated human chorionic vessels. Human placenta was obtained from term nonlaboring women undergoing cesarean delivery. Placental vascular bed perfusion pressure and isometric tension for segments of chorionic plate artery and vein were obtained in response to potassium chloride, compound 48/80, a mast cell stabilizer (cromolyn), and thromboxane A2 mimetic (U46619). Compound 48/80 significantly increased perfusion pressure in isolated human placental cotyledons. This effect was significantly potentiated further after induction of active vascular tone by thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619. Cromolyn significantly attenuated responses to compound 48/80 in these preparations. Compound 48/80 also significantly increased tone in isolated human chorionic artery and vein rings, and responses were abolished by cromolyn. In conclusion, degranulation of placental and intravascular mast cells by compound 48/80 leads to the release of vasoconstrictive substances. This could impair placental blood flow and result in growth restriction in fetuses of women with type l hypersensitivity reactions.
