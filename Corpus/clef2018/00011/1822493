Gaucher's disease and pregnancy. Gaucher's disease is rare in association with pregnancy (we have only found 53 cases of women with this disease who had at least one pregnancy since 1945). A review of literature on this subject and this one case confirms that it is unlikely that the disease will progress as far as the symptomatology is concerned and that there are unlikely to be obstetric or fetal complications. All the same there are certain complications that can occur as the haematological state is concerned (thrombocytopenia, coagulation defects such as bleeding, particularly post-partum from the genital organs). Mechanical difficulties may occur because of the greatly enlarged spleen. Pregnancy is not contra-indicated but it is a high risk pregnancy that has to watched very carefully with ultrasound and great attention to the obstetric and biological condition.
