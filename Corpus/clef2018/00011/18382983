Dural sinus thrombosis following head injury: report of two cases and review of the literature. Dural sinus thrombosis (DST) usually involves the sagittal, transverse and sigmoid sinuses and is more common in women due to pregnancy, puerperium and oral contraceptive use. Other etiologies include coagulopathies, infection and head injury. We have present two DST cases following head injury. The first case was a 35-year-old man hospitalized because of one-week history of headache and repeated vomiting after a mild head injury. Thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, right transverse and sigmoid sinuses and right jugular vein was determined on angiography. The second case was a 25- year-old man operated on for epidural hematoma at the posterior fossa. Meningitis developed and an abducens palsy was determined. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated thrombosis of the right transverse and sigmoid sinus. Low molecular weight heparin was administrated for three months. Both cases had good recovery, but one had recanalisation of the thrombosis. Intracranial hematomas, depressed skull fracture or skull fracture that cross the sinus can obstruct the blood flow in the sinus. Moreover, closed head injury may cause to DST. Because of undefinitive pathophysiology, a consensus was not obtained on overall strategy concerning conservative, radiosurgical, or surgical therapy yet.
