Perinatal cerebral arterial infarction associated with a placental chorioangioma. Placental chorioangiomas are benign vascular tumors. Large chorioangiomas cause several obstetric complications, including premature labor, placental abruption, polyhydramnios, fetal hydrops, fetal growth restriction, fetal hepatosplenomegaly, cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure, and fetal death. The neonatal complications are hydrops fetalis, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The cause of perinatal cerebral arterial infarction remains unclear in the majority of cases. Investigators have reported a number of obstetric and neonatal complications in the setting of perinatal stroke, including birth asphyxia, preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, cardiac anomalies, polycythemia, systemic infection, and genetic thrombophilias. We present a rare case of perinatal cerebral infarction associated with placental chorioangioma.
