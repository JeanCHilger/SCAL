Comparison of different dose regimens of enoxaparin in deep vein thrombosis therapy in pregnancy. Pregnant women have a higher risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and consequent thrombogenic events, including pulmonary embolisms. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) products have been shown to successfully treat DVT with few significant side effects. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of two dose regimens of enoxaparin (a LMWH) in the management of DVT in pregnancy.A total of 35 pregnant patients with DVT were enrolled in this study. As first-line anticoagulation therapy, patients were administered an intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion for 5 days, followed by a subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice a day until discharge. The enoxaparin therapy continued at home with 1 mg/kg twice a day for 18 patients (group I) and 1.5 mg/kg once a day for the other 17 patients (group II). Enoxaparin was discontinued 12-24 hours before delivery and restarted within 8-12 hours after delivery. Warfarin was given as adjuvant therapy along with enoxaparin in the post-partum period. Enoxaparin was discontinued when an international normalised ratio of 2 or above was reached. Differences between the two groups in terms of therapy response, complications and efficacy were recorded.Thrombophilic disease was observed in three patients in each group. The iliac vein had the highest incidence of DVT in both groups. During therapy, two patients in group I were diagnosed with a mild haemorrhage one patient (in group II) had abortion. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of recanalisation (measured by venous ultrasonography examination), post-thrombotic symptoms or safety parameters.Enoxaparin can be used safely in DVT therapy during pregnancy. Our results indicate that therapy consisting of a single daily dose of 1.5 mg/kg enoxaparin is as effective as twice-daily administration.
