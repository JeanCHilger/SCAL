Spontaneous splenic vein aneurysm rupture in the puerperium. A case of intra- and retroperitoneal haemorrhage after a splenic vein aneurysm rupture is described. A 27-year-old woman complained of chest pain on her first postpartum day. Symptoms were initially suggestive of pulmonary embolism, but within 3 h she developed severe acute abdominal pain, abdominal distension and haemodynamic instability. Ultrasound demonstrated a non-echogenic mass in the abdomen suggestive of a fluid collection and a computed tomography scan confirmed the presence of a lesion at the pancreatic tail. Urgent laparotomy revealed splenic vein rupture near the pancreatic tail. Partial pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. The patient subsequently made an uneventful recovery. Histological examination revealed a splenic vein aneurysm and chronic inflammatory changes in the pancreatic tissue. Rupture of a splenic vein aneurysm is a rare event and the diagnosis may present difficulty because its presentation is similar to several other more common conditions. However, rupture of a splenic vein aneurysm should be suspected in any pregnant woman with unexplained abdominal pain or with clear signs of haemorrhage, as delay in diagnosis can have devastating consequences.
