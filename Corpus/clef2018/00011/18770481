Nephropathia epidemica as the result of a Puumala virus infection in a pregnant patient. A 29-year-old woman in the early stage of pregnancy ( approximately 6 (th) week) presented in our hospital with influenza-like symptoms of fever, headache, aching limbs and tenderness over the costovertebral angle. Acute oliguric renal failure occurred within a few days.Ultrasonography revealed symmetrically enlarged kidneys with a small amount of perirenal fluids. The blood count showed thrombocytopenia, and viral serology verified a recent infection with Puumala virus (species of Hantavirus).Epidemic nephropathy was diagnosed. The patient underwent one session of hemodialysis and soon recovered without any residual renal damage. The pregnancy continued without any further complications.There are only few reports on infections with Puumala virus during pregnancy are. None of theses described any fetal abnormalities causes by the maternal infection, as in our patient. Hantavirus infections should be considered in differential diagnosis of acute renal failure in endemic regions.
