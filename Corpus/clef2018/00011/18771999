Identifying the causes of stillbirth: a comparison of four classification systems. To identify the classification protocol for stillbirth that minimizes the rate of unexplained causes.All stillbirths at > 22 weeks from 1995-2007 underwent a workup inclusive of fetal ultrasonography, amniocentesis for karyotype and cultures, placental histology, fetal autopsy, skin biopsy, total body X-ray, maternal testing for thrombophilias, TORCH, Parvovirus spp, thyroid function, indirect Coombs, Kleiheuer-Betke test, and genital cultures. To such a cohort, we applied the 4 most commonly used classification protocols.The stillbirth rate during the study period was 0.4% (154/37,958). The RoDeCo classification provided the lowest rate of unexplained stillbirth (14.3%) compared with Wigglesworth (47.4%), de Galan-Roosen (18.2%), and Tulip (16.2%) classifications. Mean gestational age at stillbirth in unexplained vs explained stillbirth was similar in the 4 protocols.Adoption of a consistent and appropriate workup protocol can reduce the rate of unexplained stillbirth to 14%.
