Modern approaches to treatment of thrombosis in pregnant women, carriers of hereditary anomalies--F-V-Leiden and G20210A mutation. studying of efficiency low-molecular heparin for preventive maintenance and treatment of thromboembolic disorders in pregnant women, carriers of F-V- L and F-II-20210 G-A mutation. Under supervision, there were 27 women with thrombosis during pregnancy from 19 to 39 years old. The lower extremities veins thromboses was diagnosed by duplex sonography.
