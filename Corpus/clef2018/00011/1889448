Dextrocardia, situs inversus and severe mitral stenosis in a pregnant woman: successful closed commissurotomy. A 16-weeks' pregnant woman with situs inversus and dextrocardia underwent successful closed commissurotomy for severe mitral stenosis. The electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with right axis deviation and progressive diminishing of QRS amplitude towards the left precordial leads. The chest X-ray showed dextrocardia with situs inversus. Doppler echocardiography depicted severe mitral stenosis the mitral valve area increased from 0.9 cm2 pre-operatively to 1.8 cm2 post-operatively with mild increase of mitral regurgitation from grade I to II post-valvotomy. She also had associated mild functional tricuspid insufficiency and moderate pulmonary hypertension. No thrombo-embolic complications occurred intra- or post-operatively. There was no evidence of either clinical or Doppler restenosis. The course of pregnancy was uneventful. At 39 weeks a healthy baby was vaginally delivered. The patient is still free of cardiac symptoms.
