Ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy. Ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy remains an important diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients suspected of having PE. It is important for the emergency physician to be able to use the information from a lung scan appropriately in the diagnostic management of this elusive and life-threatening disorder. This requires a clear knowledge of how these scans are interpreted as well as a consultative approach between the physician ordering the lung scan and the nuclear medicine physician interpreting it. Each can ultimately contribute to the development of an effective management plan. It is important for the clinician to understand that a low-probability lung scan does not rule out PE, but in fact can have up to a 40% probability of PE when clinical suspicion is high.
