Ultrasonic study of deep-vein diameter and blood flow spectrum changes in full-term pregnant women. To explore the changes in lower limb deep vein diameters, blood flow velocity and blood biochemistry in full-term pregnant women for early diagnosis and treatment of prothrombotic state.One hundred and twenty-eight full-term pregnant women at high risk of thrombosis (Group A), 61 healthy full-term pregnant women (Group B), and 42 healthy non-pregnant women (Group C) underwent high-resolution color Doppler ultrasound (CDU) for examining the deep veins of the lower limbs. The hematological indexes such as D-D, PLT, HGB, HCT, TT, APTT, PT, and FbgC were also observed in these 3 groups.Compared to Group B, the women in group A showed significantly increased diameters of the common femoral veins (CFV) and left superficial femoral vein (SFV), HCT and DD, but with significantly decreased peak blood flow in the bilateral popliteal veins (POPV) (P<0.01) and increased left POPV diameter (P=0.034). Compared to those in group C, the diameters of the bilateral CFVs, SFVs, POPV, and posterior tibial veins (PTVs) were significantly increased, but the peak blood flow in the bilateral CFVs and POPVs were significantly reduced in groups A and B the PLT, HGB, HCT, DD, TT, APTT, PT, and FbgC also showed significant changes in groups A and B (P<0.01).The full-term pregnant women are at higher risk of prothrombotic state than non-pregnant women, and the full-term pregnant women with the high risk factors for thrombosis are more likely to have prothrombotic state than healthy full-term pregnant women. CDU examination of the lower limb deep veins can be of value in the diagnosis of prothrombotic state.
