Maternal plasma inhibin A at 11-13 weeks of gestation in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. To investigate the potential value of maternal plasma inhibin A in first-trimester screening for preeclampsia (PE).The concentration of inhibin A at 11-13 weeks was measured in samples from 121 pregnancies that developed PE, 87 cases of gestational hypertension (GH) and 208 normal controls. The distributions of inhibin A multiple of median (MoM) in the control and hypertensive groups were compared. Logistic regression analysis was used to derive algorithms for the prediction of hypertensive disorders.The maternal plasma inhibin A MoM was significantly higher in the early and late PE groups (1.55 MoM and 1.24 MoM, respectively p < 0.0083), compared to the controls (0.98 MoM), but not in GH. Significant contributions for the prediction of PE were provided by maternal factors, plasma inhibin A and uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) and with combined screening the detection rates for early and late PE were 88% and 42%, respectively, for a false positive rate of 10%.The proposed combined screening test could be used to identify women at high risk for PE and intensive monitoring in such patients would lead to earlier identification of the disease which could potentially improve pregnancy outcome.
