Lower limb deep vein ultrasonography and blood biochemistry in women after full-term delivery. To observe the postpartum changes in lower limb deep vein ultrasonography and blood biochemistry in women 2-5 days after full-term delivery.A total of 212 women at high risk of thrombosis underwent high-resolution color Doppler ultrasound (CDU) of the lower limb deep veins 2-5 days after full-term delivery (Group A). Sixty-one healthy women 2-5 days after full-term delivery (Group B) and 42 healthy non-pregnant women (Group C) were recruited as the controls. The hematological indexes including the D-dimers (D-D), platelet (PLT), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), thrombin time (TT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and fibrinogen (Fbg) were also determined in these 3 groups.Compared to Group B, the women in group A showed significantly increased diameters and D-D value of the common femoral veins (FV), common superficial femoral veins (SFV) and common popliteal veins (POV) (P<0.01), with decreased peak blood flow in the bilateral POVs (P<0.05). Compared to those in Groups C, the diameters of the bilateral FVs, SFVs, POVs, and posterior tibial veins (PTVs) were significantly increased, but the peak blood flow in the bilateral FVs, SFVs, and POVs were significantly reduced in groups A and B the PLT, HGB, HCT, DD, TT, APTT, PT, and Fbg also showed significant changes in groups A and B (P<0.01).The women 2-5 days after full-term delivery are at high risk of prethrombotic state in comparison with non-pregnant women, and the presence of high-risk factors for thrombosis increases the likeliness of prothrombotic state in these postpartum women. CDU examination of the lower limb deep veins can be of value in the diagnosis of prethrombotic state.
