Myocardial and cerebral infarction as initial presentation of antiphospholipid syndrome. The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is the most common acquired thrombophilia it is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis and/or pregnancy loss, in association with circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. The pathogenic mechanisms in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome that lead to in vivo injury are incompletely understood. Like other autoimmune diseases, a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved. We report the case of a 50-year-old woman suffering from an antero-lateral non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. After few days, coronary angiography showed a severe occlusive arterial disease, involving anterior descending, circumflex e right coronary arteries. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed with the implantation of a drug-eluting stent in the proximal segment of the anterior descending coronary artery. One day after discharge (10 days after the first hospitalization) the patient experienced dizziness, nausea, vomiting, swelling in absence of any electrocardiographic abnormalities or myocardial enzyme elevation
