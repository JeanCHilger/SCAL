Fetal blood sampling from the intrahepatic vein: analysis of safety and clinical experience with 214 procedures. Transabdominal fetal blood sampling under ultrasonic guidance was performed at the intrahepatic vein on 214 occasions in 177 fetuses. In 72 cases, an intravascular transfusion was also attempted at the same site. In 91.1% of the samplings, more than 1 mL of pure fetal blood was obtained, and in 89.9% of transfusions, fetal hematocrit or platelet concentration was raised to a satisfactory level. Fetal bradycardia and intraperitoneal bleeding occurred in 2.3% of the cases. Among fetuses at low risk, there was only one intrauterine death, which occurred 3 weeks after the procedure, and one spontaneous abortion in a patient with twin pregnancy. In fetuses with Rh/Kell alloimmunization or perinatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, the survival rate was 86%. Four liver enzymes were assayed in the blood of 13 fetuses that underwent transfusions at the intrahepatic vein and 13 controls in whom the site of sampling was the umbilical vein at the placental cord insertion. No differences were found between the groups at the subsequent transfusion 2-5 weeks later. The intrahepatic vein is an alternate site of sampling/transfusion when access is difficult or failure occurs at the placental cord insertion. This approach minimizes the risks of fetal blood loss, fetomaternal hemorrhage, arterial vasospasm, and cord tamponade.
