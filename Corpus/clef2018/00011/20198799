Adrenal hemorrhage in a newborn with factor V Leiden--a clinical case. Neonatal adrenal hemorrhage is frequently associated with birth trauma, perinatal asphyxia, septicemia, coagulation defects and thromboembolism. We report a case of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage in newborn baby with perinatal asphyxia. Ultrasound findings of subacute adrenal hemorrhage draw attention to its presumable antenatal genesis. DNA analysis for thrombophilic mutations identifies factor V Leiden.
