Maternal plasma soluble endoglin at 11-13 weeks' gestation in pre-eclampsia. To examine the performance of screening for pre-eclampsia (PE) by a combination of maternal factors, soluble endoglin (sEng), pregnancy associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), placental growth factor (PlGF) and uterine artery lowest pulsatility index (L-PI) at 11-13 weeks' gestation.Uterine artery L-PI, sEng, PAPP-A and PlGF were measured at 11-13 weeks in 90 singleton pregnancies that subsequently developed PE, including 30 that required delivery before 34 weeks (early PE) and 60 with late PE, and 180 unaffected controls. Screening performance for PE by maternal factors, sEng, PAPP-A, PlGF and uterine artery L-PI and their combinations was determined.In early PE, compared to controls, plasma sEng and uterine L-PI were significantly increased and serum PAPP-A and PlGF were decreased. In late PE, compared to controls, serum PlGF was decreased and uterine L-PI was increased but plasma sEng and serum PAPP-A were not significantly different. In screening for early PE, the detection rate for a 10% false-positive rate was 46.7% for sEng alone and 96.3% for a combination of maternal factors, sEng, PlGF and uterine artery L-PI.Effective screening for early PE can be provided by a combination of maternal factors, sEng, PlGF and uterine artery L-PI at 11-13 weeks' gestation.
