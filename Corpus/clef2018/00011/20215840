Successful treatment of massive pulmonary embolism in a pregnant woman, with low-dose, slow infusion of tissue plasminogen activator. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy. A 21-year-old pregnant woman presented with chest pain and progressive shortness of breath at 35 weeks of gestation. Her respiratory rate was 26 breaths/min. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia and nonspecific ST-T changes. Her plasma D-dimer level was elevated (1,325 ng/ml). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed enlargement of the right ventricle and a large, highly mobile thrombus in the right atrium moving during diastole into the right ventricle. Doppler ultrasonography of the lower extremities showed bilateral acute deep femoral vein thrombosis. Following the diagnosis of right heart thrombosis with massive PE, low-dose and prolonged infusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (25 mg in three hours) was administered. Echocardiography performed six hours after thrombolysis showed a significant decrease in the right ventricular size and complete lysis of the thrombus in the right heart. Thrombosis risk panel studies showed factor V Leiden homozygote mutation. A live newborn was delivered by cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation. No complications were seen during a 6-month follow-up.
