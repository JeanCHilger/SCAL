Placental vascular lesion differences in pregnancy-induced hypertension and normotensive fetal growth restriction. Pregnancy-induced hypertension/preeclampsia (PIH) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) share a common placental origin. The pathologic classification that divides placental lesions to maternal or fetal origin was compared between these disorders.Placentas from pregnancies that were complicated by PIH, normotensive FGR, or by both (combined) were analyzed, and lesions were classified as those consistent with maternal under-perfusion and with fetal thromboocclusive disease.Maternal vascular lesions were more common in the PIH group and combined group (61% and 59%, respectively), compared with the FGR group (16.2% P < .001), and villous lesions were more common in the combined group, compared with the FGR and PIH groups (79.5%, 53.5%, and 46.9%, respectivelyPlacental lesions correspond with different clinical presentations.
