Liver and preeclampsia. HELLP syndrome complicates PE in 5 to 20 % of cases. The clinical manifestations (i.e. epigastric pain, elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia and hemolysis) are secondary to the fibrin deposit within the peri-portal sinusoids. The clinical presentation of HELLP syndrome can be misleading. It is therefore necessary to suspect this complication whenever a PE patient develops gastro-intestinal pain. The interruption of pregnancy is the only effective treatment against HELLP syndrome. If it can be safely performed passed the 34(th) week of amenorrhea, a protective attitude should be adopted prior to reaching this date. This consists of the administration of corticosteroid therapy for fetal pulmonary maturation, intensive clinical, biological and sonographic monitoring of the mother's parameters. The administration of corticosteroids or performing a plasmapharesis is not recommended for the treatment of established HELLP syndrome because neither improves the maternal or neonatal outcome. The differential diagnosis may also include acute fatty liver of pregnancy. An early liver impairment, polyuria-polydipsia syndrome and a rise in INR support this diagnosis.
