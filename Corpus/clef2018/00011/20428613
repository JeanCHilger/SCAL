Flow-mediated dilatation in the differential diagnosis of preeclampsia syndrome. The preeclampsia syndrome is associated with endothelial dysfunction and the differential diagnosis between pure preeclampsia (PE) and superimposed preeclampsia (SPE) can be only be attained 12 weeks after delivery.To compare the assessment of endothelial function through flow-mediated dilatation in pregnant women with pure preeclampsia and superimposed preeclampsia.The flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery was carried out according to the recommendations of the International Brachial Artery Reactivity Task Force in pregnant women with preeclampsia syndrome. PE (n=14) and SPE (n=13) were diagnosed in the postpartum period according to the definitions of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy.The median of the flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in SPE (6.0% 1.9-10.3) was decreased in comparison with the PE (13.6%The FMD of the brachial artery of patients with preeclampsia syndrome was not capable of differentiating between PE and SPE. However, the data suggest that SPE is associated with worse endothelial function I comparison to PE.
