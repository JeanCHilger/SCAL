Clinical findings in newborn infants of mothers with kidney transplants. Renal transplant patients who become pregnant require continued immunosuppression. Little is known on the risk of infants born under these conditions. We observed 6 neonates of renal transplant patients, of whom 4 were premature and 3 small for gestational age (SGA). There were no congenital malformations. Transient thrombopenia in 1 preterm baby probably resulted from maternal immunosuppression. Further 232 cases were published since 1980. Among the total of 238 patients, including our observations, rates for prematurity (49%) and SGA-infants (29%) were high, 6% had congenital malformations. Maternal immunosuppression with Cyclosporin A, as compared to Azathioprine, seems to carry a higher risk of prematurity (66 vs. 43%) and SGA-babies (56 vs. 19%). On the contrary, Azathioprine might be more muta- and teratogenic. At present, no data are available on the long-term outcome of these children.
