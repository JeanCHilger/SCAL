Management of prenatally diagnosed abdominal lymphatic malformations. Abdominal lymphatic malformations (ALM) are rare congenital malformations that can regress spontaneously or lead to serious complications. Thus, the appropriate management may be challenging, particularly since pertinent literature is missing. We present our experience in the management of 5 patients with prenatally diagnosed ALM and their outcome and propose a decision-making algorithm.We retrospectively reviewed the history, diagnostics, therapy, complications, and outcome of 5 patients with a prenatal diagnosis of ALM, referred to our department between January 2006 and February 2008.ALM was prenatally diagnosed by ultrasound in all patients (gestational age 21, 23, 23, 32, and 34 weeks). MRI was performed pre- and postnatally in one patient and postnatally in another. Clinical symptoms ranged from none to respiratory distress and abdominal compartment syndrome. One ALM involuted. 2 patients underwent primary OK-432 treatment. This led to a 70% size reduction in one patient. The other developed massive intracystic bleeding and required emergency surgery. 2/3 patients with surgery needed segmental bowel resection and 3/3 stayed recurrence-free. Complications included one partial inferior vena cava thrombosis after surgery, one subileus, and one hemorrhage after OK-432 application.Asymptomatic and regressing ALM are best managed conservatively ("watchful waiting") while symptomatic ALMs require surgery. Further studies are necessary to determine the ideal timepoint for intervention for non-regressing ALM.
