Atypical presentation of basilar artery thrombosis due to hypercoagulable state and incidental patent foramen ovale: a case report. This is a case presentation of a 31 year old woman without history of any systemic illness and on her second pregnancy. Three days after an elective cesarean delivery without complications presented with neurological deficits mainly difficulty talking that progressed to aphasia, dizziness, and loss of vision. Neuro-images showed several ischemic areas in the brain. A magnetic resonance angiogram revealed a thrombus in the basilar artery. A transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated a patent foramen ovale (PFO). The early recognition and diagnosis of PFO is crucial in preventing long-term complications.
