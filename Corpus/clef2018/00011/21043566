Idiopathic infantile arterial calcification with thrombotic microangiopathy--a unique case. Idiopathic Infantile Arterial Calcification (IIAC) is a rare syndrome of unknown cause characterized by disruption and calcification of the internal elastic laminae of fetal arteries with calcium deposits leading to fibrosis and occlusion of the arteries. The diagnosis is often made at post-mortem examination. However, in a few cases it has been detected prenatally as in this case. Fewer than 10 cases of antenatal detection of this condition have been reported in the literature. In our case, thrombotic microangiopathy was an added feature, which has not been reported thus far in the literature to the best of our knowledge.
