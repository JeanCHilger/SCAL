Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis in pregnancy: report of a case and review of the literature. We present a report of a pregnancy complicated by chronic schistosomiasis. A.H. is a 22 year old G1 Filipina, referred at 34 weeks gestational age for evaluation of hypersplenism and progressive thrombocytopenia. Physical exam was remarkable for hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory evaluation of hepatic, renal, hematologic, autoimmune, or infectious disease etiology or abnormality was negative. Ultrasound revealed a normal fetus, an enlarged spleen, dilated splenic and hepatic vasculature and an enlarged liver with periportal fibrosis. Abdominal computed tomography revealed subcapsular calcifications, dilated ducts, and periportal fibrosis. Esophagogastrojejeunoscopy showed no varices. The presumptive diagnosis of hypersplenism secondary to chronic hepatosplenic schistosomiasis was made. Based on pathophysiology and literature review conservative management was elected. Liver functions, clotting functions, and platelet counts were monitored closely. Intense antepartum fetal monitoring was performed. Platelet counts remained between 30 and 40K. The patient went into labor at 38 3/7 weeks and delivered a 3148 g female Apgars 8/9 by spontaneous vaginal delivery. Evaluation of the placenta was negative for ova. By 2 weeks postpartum platelet counts had increased to the 60-70 k range, and a rectal biopsy, positive for S. japonicum ova was performed. Treatment with three doses of Praziquantel 20 mg/kg q8h was completed prior to her return to the Philippines.
