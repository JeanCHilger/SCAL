Management of angiomyolipoma vena cava thrombus during pregnancy. Angiomyolipoma can worsen during pregnancy. Inferior vena cava thrombus of renal angiomyolipoma during pregnancy is rare, and threatens to cause massive emboli. We report a case of vena cava tumor thrombectomy during the second trimester of pregnancy with delayed renal tumorectomy.A 34-year-old woman with bilateral known angiomyolipomas presented asymptomatic at 30 weeks of gestation with an inferior vena cava thrombus at renal follow-up ultrasonography. Retro-hepatic thrombus had fatty signal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The woman had renal vein and vena cava tumor initial thrombectomy, and had normal cesarean delivery at 39 weeks of gestation. The tumor was treated by postpartum right partial nephrectomy.Successful angiomyolipoma isolated thrombectomy during pregnancy with delayed partial nephrectomy is possible. Angiomyolipoma needs follow-up during pregnancy with repeated renal ultrasonography.
