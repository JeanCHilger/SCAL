Extensive thrombosis and first-trimester pregnancy loss caused by sticky platelet syndrome. Sticky platelet syndrome is an autosomal-dominant thrombophilia characterized by platelet hyperaggregability in the presence of adenosine diphosphate or epinephrine. The result clinically can be widespread thromboses, often arterial, in patients without apparent risk factors for thrombotic disease. Limited data exist regarding its role in adverse pregnancy outcomes.A gravid woman with two previous first-trimester miscarriages presented at 11 weeks of gestation with a deep venous thrombosis. Despite anticoagulation, she developed extensive and progressive arterial and venous thromboses and suffered a fetal demise. A thrombophilia panel was unremarkable, but platelet aggregometry demonstrated hyperactive platelets in the presence of adenosine diphosphate and epinephrine consistent with sticky platelet syndrome.Sticky platelet syndrome causes arterial thromboses and may be an underappreciated etiology for adverse pregnancy outcomes.
