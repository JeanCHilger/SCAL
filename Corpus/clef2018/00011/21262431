The diagnostic management of acute venous thromboembolism during pregnancy: recent advancements and unresolved issues. Adequate diagnostic management of suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnant women is of great importance. The diagnostic performance of clinical decision rules and D-dimer testing is influenced by physiological changes during pregnancy and is understudied. Recent studies have addressed these issues by developing a new clinical decision rule and raising the D-dimer level cut-off points. With imaging of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) the radiation exposure remains a concern. Recent studies have adjusted CT settings and scan length to minimize this exposure without loss of image quality. Furthermore the first choice imaging modality of suspected PE in pregnant women remains a matter of debate in view of studies showing high inadequacy rates for both CT scanning and VQ scanning. Issues concerning the diagnostic management of VTE in pregnant women and advancements made in recent years will be discussed.
