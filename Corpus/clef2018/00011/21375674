Extra hepatic portal vein obstruction and pregnancy outcome: largest reported experience. Evaluate pregnancy outcome in women with extra hepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO).A total of 26 pregnancies in 14 women with EHPVO were evaluated for maternal and perinatal outcomes in a tertiary centre of Northern India. Fourteen pregnancies were evaluated prospectively while the details of 12 previous pregnancies in the same women were studied retrospectively.Mean age of pregnant women with EHPVO was 24.5 years and approximately one-third were primigravidae. Only one patient was diagnosed as EHPVO in the index pregnancy. The presenting event was hematemesis in 71% of the patients others presented with thrombosis, pain abdomen and jaundice or incidental splenomegaly. The incidence of abortion, preterm deliveries and still births was 20%, 15.4% and 7.7%, respectively. Underlying hypercoagulable and prothrombotic state was diagnosed in around one-fifth of the patients. Half of these women required platelet transfusion in the intrapartum period due to hypersplenism resulting in thrombocytopenia. Anemia was seen in 40% of the patientsPregnancy outcome is expected to be successful in women with EHPVO if disease is adequately controlled prior to pregnancy.
