Unilateral adrenal ischemia during third trimester of pregnancy: about two cases. Unilateral adrenal ischemia by venous thrombosis during pregnancy is an extremely rare event. We report the case of two women, in their third trimester who presented intense abdominal pain located on their right flank. Obstetric and clinical examination are normal, so as are the biological check-up and hepatic and renal imaging. The thoraco-abdominal CAT scan shows the right adrenal necrosis associated with the vein thrombosis. A C-section was decided to allow administration of appropriate treatment: analgesics and anticoagulants. Clinical evolution was rapidly favorable. Protein S deficiency was diagnosed in one of the patients. The follow-up CAT scan shows the vein re-permeabilisation and disappearing of necrosis signs.
