Bilateral serous retinal detachment as a complication of acquired peripartum thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura bout. We report a case of a 26-year-old primigravid woman, believed to have HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelet count) syndrome, which turned out to be a thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) bout. At the 40th gestational week, based on the clinical picture of HELLP syndrome, a cesarean section was performed and a dysmature male newborn was delivered. Afterwards, clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities persisted. Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency with the presence of inhibitory anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies revealed acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura bout, which was complicated with bilateral vision decrease due to bilateral retinal detachment. At the first ophthalmological examination, ultrasonography and binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of the serous retinal detachment. After the diagnosis of acquired TTP bout, the patient was treated with multiple plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin with rapid improvement of the clinical and laboratory parameters. The ophthalmologic complications disappeared later without sequelae. At the 18-month examination, substantial visual acuity improvement without serous retinal detachment and full best corrected visual acuity were observed.
