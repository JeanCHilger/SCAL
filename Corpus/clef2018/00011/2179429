Safety of cordocentesis under ultrasound guidance for fetal blood sampling. In the present study, we attempted to assess the safety and the risk of cordocentesis under ultrasound guidance for fetal blood sampling. Forty-five cordocenteses in 43 cases were carried out. These forty-three cases included 23 nonimmunologic hydrops fetalis, 12 congenital fetal malformations, 3 chromosome aberrations, 3 Rh isoimmunization, and 2 idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Gestational age when cordocentesis was performed ranged from 17 to 39 weeks of gestation. In 42 (93.3%) out of 45 procedures, pure fetal blood was obtained. Postpuncture bleeding was observed in 17 cases (37.8%). In 12 (70.6%) out of 17 cases, bleeding stopped within 2 minutes. In only one case, bleeding continued for 11 minutes and cesarean section was performed due to fetal distress. Cardiotocogram obtained after cordocentesis revealed no ominous signs in the other 44 procedures. The other complications, including premature rupture of the membranes, premature labor, and intrauterine infection, did not occur during or after this procedure. There were no cases in which any kind of injury to the placenta or umbilical cord was observed.
