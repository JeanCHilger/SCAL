Thromboprophylaxis following cesarean delivery: one site prospective pilot study to evaluate the application of a risk score model. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains an important cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. Cesarean delivery (CD) is a known risk factor for VTE. Data from clinical trials of thomboprophylaxis following CD are lacking and current guidelines are based on experts opinion. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of a risk score model, established at our institution, in preventing CD-related VTE.Before undergoing CD women received a risk score assessment based on age, weight, history of thrombosis, thrombophilia, immobility, parity and varicose vein. Women at moderate-high risk received pharmacological prophylaxis all patients wore antithrombotic stockings. They had a visit before discharge and were advised to come back for visit and ultrasound if required. All received a follow-up phone call after three months.501 consecutive women were included in the study 233 (46.5%), at low risk, had no pharmacological prophylaxisThe risk score model applied proved effective in avoiding pharmacological prophylaxis in almost half of women and safe, since the rate of failure resulted very low (0.2%, C.I.95 0-1.1%) and there were not significant differences in bleeding in the two groups.
