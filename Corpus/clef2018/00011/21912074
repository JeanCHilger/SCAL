First-trimester adiponectin and subsequent development of preeclampsia or fetal growth restriction. The evidence regarding the utility of assessing first-trimester adiponectin (ApN) serum levels in early prediction of preeclampsia (PE) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) is contradictory. This study aims to determine the role of maternal serum ApN levels as an early predictor of PE and FGR.A prospective case-control study among a pregnant population who attended their 11- to 14-week ultrasound scan at the University of Chile's Clinical Hospital's Fetal Medicine Unit. We included patients who developed PE or FGR (10 cases per group) and 35 healthy controls. We determined ApN levels in blood samples from these 55 patients using a commercial ELISA kit and assessed the relationship of ApN levels with variables like development of PE, FGR, weight at birth and maternal BMI.There were no significant differences among first-trimester ApN serum levels in the groups. Average concentrations were 8, 6.8 and 10.8 ng/ml for the control, PE and FGR groups, respectively.In our study, maternal serum ApN levels were not useful in predicting subsequent development of PE and FGR. However, maternal serum ApN concentration adjusted by BMI was significantly higher during the first trimester in women who later developed FGR.
