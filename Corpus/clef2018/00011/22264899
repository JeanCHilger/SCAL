Pulmonary embolism evaluation in the pregnant patient: a review of current imaging approaches. Pregnancy is characterized by a higher incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) than in age-matched nonpregnant women. However, the diagnosis of PE during pregnancy might prove to be more difficult than in the general population. Clinicians strongly rely on imaging studies to establish a prompt diagnosis. On reviewing this article, the reader will learn the pros and cons of the 2 main imaging studies used in the evaluation for PE, computed tomography of the pulmonary arteries and lung scintigraphy. Radiation dose and other important factors to consider during the evaluation for PE in pregnancy are highlighted so that clinicians and radiologists can choose the most appropriate imaging study for diagnosis.
