Preventing maternal death: 10 clinical diamonds. The death of a mother during or after childbirth is one of the most tragic events in medicine. We have identified 10 specific recurrent errors that account for a disproportionate share of maternal deaths, primarily related to pulmonary embolism, severe preeclampsia, cardiac disease, and postpartum hemorrhage. Attention to these principles and the development and adoption of local or regional clinical protocols that address these issues will help reduce the likelihood and effect of error and of maternal mortality.
