Puerperal ovarian vein thrombosis: two case reports. Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is an uncommon but potentially serious complication in the early postpartum. Two case studies seem to prove the point: Case 1 A 24-year-old woman was transferred to our hospital with the chief complaint of abdominal pain radiating to the right thigh, vomit, diarrhea, and a slight pyrexia (37.6 Â°C rectal). Five days earlier, she had a spontaneous vaginal delivery after labor induction. The woman appeared slightly distressed because of pain vital signs were found to be normal and the CRP elevated (129.9 mg/L). Abdominal examination was remarkable for tenderness by palpation in the right lower quadrant with no rebound tenderness or guarding. Pelvic examination was remarkable for mild right adnexal tenderness. Abdominal-pelvic computer tomography with contrast medium revealed a 2.5-cm OVT having extended into the inferior vena cava for 14 cm with a slight peripheral edema. The patient was treated with nadroparin 0.6 cc (5700 IU) bid and warfarin 5 mg since the attainment of the therapeutic INR range. Case 2 A 31-year-old twin-pregnant woman had an emergency cesarean section at 35 gestational weeks because of hypertension complicated by increased liver enzymes, diuresis contraction, and continuous lower back pain bilaterally radiating to the groins. One day after delivery, CT scan that was performed because of onward anemia showed a pelvic, perihepatic, and perisplenic blood effusion, and a 1-cm right OVT extended to the inferior vena cava below renal veins for 28 mm. She underwent exploratory laparotomy and blood transfusion, and because of respiratory insufficiency she was transferred to a second level center with ICU facility, where she was placed under a suprarenal inferior vena cava filter, and AngioJet Rheolytic Thrombectomy for acute pulmonary embolism was performed.
