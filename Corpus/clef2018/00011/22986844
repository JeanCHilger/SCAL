Combined screening for preeclampsia and small for gestational age at 11-13 weeks. To combine a specific algorithm for small for gestational age (SGA) without preeclampsia (PE) and another algorithm for PE in the prediction of SGA and PE.This was a screening study of singleton pregnancies at 11-13 weeks including 1,426 (2.3%) that subsequently developed PE, 3,168 (5.1%) that delivered SGA neonates and 57,458 that were unaffected by PE and SGA. We developed a prediction algorithm for SGA requiring delivery before 37 weeks' gestation (preterm-SGA) from maternal characteristics, uterine artery pulsatility index, mean arterial pressure, serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A and placental growth factor multiple of the median values. We then examined the performance of this algorithm individually and in combination with a previously reported algorithm for early-PE in the prediction of SGA and PE.When screen positivity was defined by risk cutoff of 1:200 using the algorithm for early-PE and the risk cutoff of 1:150 using the algorithm for preterm-SGA, the false positive rate was 10.9% and the detection rates of early-PE, late-PE, preterm-SGA and term-SGA were 95.3, 45.6, 55.5 and 44.3%, respectively.Effective first-trimester screening for early-PE and preterm-SGA can be provided by the combined use of the specific algorithms.
