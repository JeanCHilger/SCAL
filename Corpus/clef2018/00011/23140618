Management of post-abortum infections. In countries where induced abortions are legal and medically supervised, the frequency of post-abortion infections is low and maternal death is infrequent. Nevertheless, short and long term consequences of post-abortion infections must be addressed. Sexually transmitted pathogens are frequently in cause here. Risk factors include in particular young age (less than 24 years), low socioeconomic level, late pregnancy, nulliparity, and history of previous untreated pelvic inflammatory disease. Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and an inflammatory syndrome occurring within 2 to 3 weeks after spontaneous or induced abortion. A pelvic ultrasound is recommended in order to ensure the uterus vacuity and to look for a possible pelvic abscess, and bacteriological samples must be performed. Management consists in a regimen combining two antibiotics intravenously, with the possible addition of intravenous heparin in case of pelvic thrombophlebitis. Antibiotics can be discontinued 48 h of a clinical improvement and further treatment by oral route brings no benefit. Intrauterine retention associated with post-abortion endometritis must be addressed either by medical or surgical method.
