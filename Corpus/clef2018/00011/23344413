Severe thrombocytopenia after contrast infusion in pregnancy. Intravenous contrast-induced thrombocytopenia is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication in pregnancy.A 22-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, at 33 2/7 weeks of gestation presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and tachycardia. A computed tomography angiogram was pursued to evaluate for pulmonary embolus. During contrast infusion the woman experienced facial flushing, throat tightening, and worsening dyspnea. Her platelet count was noted to decrease precipitously to 4,000/microliter several hours after the imaging study. With medical management and observation, the woman's platelet count steadily recovered without further exacerbation of thrombocytopenia during gestation.Prompt recognition and therapy for intravenous contrast-induced thrombocytopenia during pregnancy are essential to optimize maternal-fetal outcome.
