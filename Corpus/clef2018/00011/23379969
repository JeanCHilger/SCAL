Ultrasound-accelerated catheter-directed thrombolysis for the management of postpartum deep venous thrombosis. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, which remains an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Although oral or systemic anticoagulation therapy may minimize thrombus propagation, it remains ineffective in removing thrombus burden and consequently does not prevent post-thrombotic syndrome. A novel technique, ultrasound accelerated catheter directed thrombolysis (UACDT), has been developed to rapidly and completely resolve thrombus. While pregnancy and the postpartum period are generally considered as contraindications for thrombolysis, we demonstrate in this case study the safety and effectiveness of using UACDT to treat symptomatic, postpartum, iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis after only an overnight infusion.
