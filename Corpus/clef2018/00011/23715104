Pregnancy in Upshaw-Schulman syndrome. The Upshaw Schulman syndrome (MIM #274150) is a hereditary deficiency of the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease (ADAMTS13) due to homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene. Patients are prone to bouts of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. However, disease manifestation needs a second trigger event. Pregnancy is a known risk factor for TTP. Patients with USS may manifest during pregnancy and the postpartum period or relapse with a TTP bout. Before plasma therapy mortality for both the mother and the fetus was high, but even nowadays when plasma is delivered, therapy is challenging, still bearing a high risk for miscarriage or long term sequelae for the mother. In this report on pregnancies in three mothers with USS, plasma therapy was increased in frequency and amount given with regard to platelet count or ADAMTS13 activity, thus leading to a successful outcome.
