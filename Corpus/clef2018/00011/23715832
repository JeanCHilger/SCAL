Portal vein thrombosis during pregnancy. A 22-year-old primigravida was diagnosed to have portal vein thrombosis during 20th week of gestation by ultrasound examination which was carried out to rule out congenital fetal anomalies. She had splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. Investigations did not reveal any prothrombotic disorder. She was managed with anticoagulants which were started at 31 weeks of pregnancy. Labour was induced at 40 weeks of gestation and she delivered a healthy neonate without any complications. Anticoagulants were restarted after delivery and continued through the postpartum period and up to 6 months thereafter.
