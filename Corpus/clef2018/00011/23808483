The anti-aging factor α-klotho during human pregnancy and its expression in pregnancies complicated by small-for-gestational-age neonates and/or preeclampsia. α-klotho, a protein with anti-aging properties, has been involved in important biological processes, such as calcium/phosphate metabolism, resistance to oxidative stress, and nitric oxide production in the endothelium. Recent studies have suggested a role of α-klotho in endocrine regulation of mineral metabolism and postnatal growth in infants. Yet, the role of α-klotho during pregnancy remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether maternal plasma concentration of α-klotho changes during pregnancy and evaluate its expression in pregnancies complicated by small for gestational age (SGA) and/or preeclampsia (PE).This cross-sectional study included patients in the following groups: (1) non pregnant women (n = 37) (2) uncomplicated pregnancy (n = 130)The median plasma α-klotho concentration was higher in pregnant than in non-pregnant women. Among women with an uncomplicated pregnancy, the median plasma concentration of α-klotho increased as a function of gestational age (Spearman Rho = 0.2 p = 0.006). The median (interquartile range) plasma concentration of α-klotho in women with PE and SGA [947.6 (762-2013) pg/mL] and SGA without PE [1000 (585-1567) pg/mL] were 21% and 17% lower than that observed in women with an uncomplicated pregnancy [1206.6 (894-2012) pg/mL], (p = 0.005 and p = 0.02), respectively. Additionally, there were no significant differences in the median plasma concentration of α-klotho between uncomplicated pregnancies and women with PE without an SGA neonate (p = 0.5).Maternal plasma concentration of α-klotho was higher during pregnancy than in a non-pregnant state. Moreover, the median maternal plasma concentration of α-klotho was lower in mothers who delivered an SGA neonate than in those with an uncomplicated pregnancy regardless of the presence or absence of PE.
