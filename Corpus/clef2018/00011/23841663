Relationship between placental grade and mean platelet volume. This study was performed to investigate the correlation between mean platelet volume, as an indicator of thrombocyte function, and placental grade classified by the Grannum scoring system. Placental sonographic images were graded according to the Grannum scoring system, and synchronous haemogram samples were taken from patients who attended foetal assessments during the second and third trimesters. A total of 75 patients were in their second trimester, and 40 patients were in their third trimester. The relation between week of pregnancy and placental Grannum score was significant (p<0.001) i.e. placental Grannum score increased with gestational age. The association between Grannum score and mean platelet volume was analysed, including trimester and mean platelet volume, by linear regression analysis. The results indicated a distinct trimester-independent correlation between mean platelet volume and Grannum score (partial correlation coefficient=0.455
