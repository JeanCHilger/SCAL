Role of inflammatory proteins S100A8 and S100A9 in pathophysiology of recurrent early pregnancy loss. Altered expression of inflammatory molecule at the maternal fetal interface is associated with early pregnancy loss. S100A8 and S100A9 are inflammatory proteins and they exhibit cytokine like function enhancing leukocyte recruitment to the inflammatory site. Reports from mouse model suggest the role of S100A8 with the vasculature of the decidual tissue and leukocyte recruitment during early pregnancy. Hence we hypothesized that maternal overexpression of S100A8 & S100A9 might increase the recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes in maternal-fetal interface resulting in uteroplacental perfusion deficiency, development of thrombotic events, and placental hypoxia, eventually embryo abortion. In the present study we investigated altered expression of S100A8 and S100A9 in 25 recurrent early pregnancy loss (REPL) patients compared to 40 induced abortion subjects as controls. S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA were evaluated using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. To determine if differential expression pattern of these transcripts is translated to protein western blot analysis was performed.S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA and protein level were significantly increased in endometrial decidua tissue (p < 0.05) of REPL patients as compared to controls. This is the first report predicting the role of inflammatory molecules S100A8 & S100A9 in REPL. It opens a new perspective for understanding significance of S100A8 and S100A9 in pregnancy maintenance and outcome.
