Advances and controversies in the management of cerebral venous thrombosis. Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare form of stroke found most often in young women of reproductive age, often associated with oral contraceptive use, genetic or acquired thrombophilia, pregnancy, dehydration, or infection. CVT should be considered in any young patient who presents with an unexplained headache in combination with known hypercoagulable state, focal neurologic deficits, seizure, lobar hemorrhage, or bilateral thalamic or basal ganglionic edema. Acute treatment is with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. It is important to provide supportive treatment. Outcomes are good compared with other types of stroke. Pediatric patients, excluding neonates, have similar presentation, treatment, and outcomes as adults.
