Patterns of maternal vascular remodeling and responsiveness in early- versus late-onset preeclampsia. We sought to assess vascular structure and function in early- and late-onset preeclampsia (PE) at the time of diagnosis.We evaluated 100 PE cases subdivided into 50 early- and 50 late-onset cases according to gestational age at onset (</>34 weeks), and 100 controls paired by maternal age and gestational age at scan with cases. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), distensibility, and circumferential wall stress together with inferior vena cava (IVC) collapsibility were assessed by ultrasound.Early PE was characterized by increased carotid IMT diameters, and arterial stiffness with no significant changes in IVC parameters as compared to normotensive pregnancies. Late PE was characterized by significantly increased carotid IMT and lumen diameters as compared to controls while arterial stiffness, as expressed by distensibility, did not provide pronounced changes. A significant decrease of IVC collapsibility index was also observed in late PE as compared to controls.The current data suggest that distinct vascular adaptations in early and late PE could reflect different pathophysiologic mechanisms. Future studies are warranted to further assess the complex etiologies and clinical expressions of the 2 entities.
