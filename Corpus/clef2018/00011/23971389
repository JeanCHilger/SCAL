Conservative treatment of subcapsular hematoma in preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome: a case report. Liver hematoma is a rare and serious complication of pregnancy associated with preeclampsia-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome.27 years old patient with two pregnancies, first pregnancy with eclampsia, admitted with 36.5 weeks of gestation, blood pressure of 140-100 mmHg, epigastric pain, shoulder pain without peritoneal irritation and increased tendon reflexes. The requested preeclamptic profile supports the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome. It was decided to terminate the pregnancy by abdominal route. Male product was obtained alive, 2,060 g, Apgar 8/9, gestational age of 38.2 weeks Capurro. A review did not report liver parenchymal. The evolution during mediate puerperium was torpid, the patient presented epigastric pain and shoulder pain, and there was a rise in transaminases (AST 687 U/L, ALT 813 U/L), progressive thrombocytopenia (113, 103/ pL), decreased hemoglobin, proteinuria and hypovolemic shock. Abdominal CT scan was requested, and it confirmed a heterogeneous liver image (117 x 85 x 104 mm) with a volume of 694 cc, suggesting hepatic hematoma. Serialized control of abdominal CT indicated liver hematoma resorption after 25 days of hospitalization. Seven days after discharge transaminase levels were normal.To consider in the diagnosis of preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome the likelihood of liver hematoma as an acute complication early treatment improves the prognosis.
