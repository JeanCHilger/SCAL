Unilateral adrenal infarction in pregnancy. A 25-year-old pregnant woman at 28 weeks gestational age presented with increasing abdominal pain and was found to have a unilateral adrenal infarction on a CT scan of the abdomen. Her medical history was unremarkable. There was no evidence of adrenal insufficiency with normal cortisol and adenocorticotropic hormone levels for pregnancy. Evaluation of thrombophilia disorders established the patient to be heterozygous for methylenetetrahydrofolatereductase C677T gene mutation as the only finding. The patient was anticoagulated to prevent contralateral thrombosis. At 32 weeks she experienced spontaneous rupture of membranes. One week later she delivered vaginally and remained anticoagulated for the puerperium.
