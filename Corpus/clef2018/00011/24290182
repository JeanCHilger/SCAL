Neonatal cervical artery dissection secondary to birth trauma. Cervical artery dissection is rare in the neonatal period and is most often caused by birth injury during dystocic labor. The severity of this pathology is due to the possibility of serious neurological complications. We report a case of a male newborn who was born vaginally after shoulder dystocia. The extraction was difficult, resulting in a fracture of the right humerus. On the second day of life, the child presented generalized clonic convulsions. Computed tomography of the brain showed an ischemic stroke in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery, the territory of the right posterior cerebral artery, and the right lenticulostriate and capsular regions. Doppler ultrasonography and magnetic resonance angiography showed bilateral carotid artery thrombosis and dissection at the left common carotid artery and its two branches and the right vertebral artery. We discuss the mechanisms of this pathology and we emphasize preventive measures.
