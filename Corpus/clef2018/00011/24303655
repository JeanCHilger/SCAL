Management of acute iliac thrombosis in a pregnancy at term: case discussion and review of literature. Venous thromboembolic disease during pregnancy is an important cause of obstetric morbidity and mortality. Suggestive clinical signs lead systematically physicians to evocate this diagnosis. Unfortunately, the incidence of events remains low, reducing the ability to perform well-designed research and to give adequate recommendations. The discovery in term pregnancy of an iliofemoral venous thrombosis raises the question of obstetrical care, mainly considering potentially embolic risk. Through a case report and based on a thinking about the few medical publications in this field, we suggest that the placing of temporary inferior vena cava filter in presence of an extensive deep venous thrombosis at term pregnancy could be debatable.
