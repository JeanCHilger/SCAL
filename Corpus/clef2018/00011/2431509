Thrombosis of a mechanical valve prosthesis late in pregnancy. Case report and review of the literature. A case of acute thrombosis of a mechanical mitral valve prosthesis (Medtronic-Hall) in a 34 weeks pregnant woman is reported. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by Doppler echocardiography. Emergency surgery was performed starting with a cesarean section to save the fetus, followed by an obstetric hysterectomy. Valve thrombectomy could then be safely carried out. Both, the mother and child could be rescued by this combined intervention and were discharged from the hospital without further complications.
