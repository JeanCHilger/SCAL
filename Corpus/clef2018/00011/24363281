Examination of intrarenal resistance indices indicate the involvement of renal pathology as a significant diagnostic classifier of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disorder during pregnancy with endotheliosis leading to occlusion of renal perfusion with an impact on the glomerular filtration barrier. We therefore analyzed the role of intrarenal resistance indices in the renal interlobular arteries measured by Doppler ultrasound as a diagnosis of PE.Women with preeclampsia (n = 24 mean blood pressure/24 h = 145 ± 11/ 93 ± 7 mm HgThe intrarenal resistive index (mean ± SD = 0.63 ± 0.05 in women with preeclampsia vs. 0.59 ± 0.056 in healthy pregnant women P < 0.003), the pulsatile index (mean ± SD = 1.15 ± 0.19 in women with preeclampsia vs. 0.92 ± 0.13 in healthy pregnant womenIntrarenal resistive indices are a significant classifier of PE, providing the possibility to predict nephropathy. They could be a prognostic tool for cardiovascular comorbidity in PE patients even after delivery.
