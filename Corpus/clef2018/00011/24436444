Tomography and blood vessels in Hughes syndrome. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) or Hughes syndrome is a multisystem autoimmune disorder that is characterized by venous and arterial thrombosis and/or pregnancy complications (miscarriage and fetal death, preeclampsia, placental insufficiency, and fetal growth restriction), and positive serologic tests for anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), lupus anticoagulant (LA), or antibodies against beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-ß₂GPI) either of IgG or IgM isotype. APS is characterized by accelerated atherosclerosis that, together with an increased tendency toward thrombosis, leads to the occurrence of various vascular events. Timely diagnosis of vascular changes, preferably in the subclinical phase, is required both because of their severity and the high mortality rate. Detection of arterial and venous changes is performed by various invasive and noninvasive diagnostic methods. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) seems to be the most precise method with low exposure time, giving clinicians an opportunity for early diagnosis and timely treatment of APS patients.
