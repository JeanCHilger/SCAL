Comparison of clinical and perinatal outcomes in early- and late-onset preeclampsia. To compare the clinical and laboratory findings and maternal-perinatal outcomes between women with early-onset preeclampsia (EO-PE) and late-onset preeclampsia (LO-PE).One hundred and fifty-four women with preeclampsia (PE) who delivered in our clinic were included in the study. Perinatal and obstetric outcomes were evaluated.The incidence of abnormal uterine artery (UtA) velocity waveform was significantly higher in the EO-PE group (71.4 vs 30.1 %) (p < 0.001). The incidences of small-for-gestational age, oligohydramnios, Apgar score <7 at 5 min, stillbirth and early neonatal death rates were significantly higher in women with EO-PE compared to LO-PE (p < 0.01). Maternal complications were only recorded in women with severe PE.EO-PE, especially with abnormal UtA Doppler findings defines a placentation abnormality with higher perinatal adverse outcomes.
