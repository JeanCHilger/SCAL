Fetal intracranial hemorrhage related to maternal autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Maternal autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (AITP) can cause fetal intracranial hemorrhage.A 19-year-old primigravida was referred to our institution for prenatally detected ventriculomegaly at 30th week of gestation. Her personal and family histories were unremarkable. Her platelet count was 54 × 109/L. Fetal neurosonography showed intraparenchymal hemorrhage. AITP was diagnosed in the mother and platelet count decreased at 34 × 109/L. Patient was treated with methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin. She delivered a 2,340-g infant at 37 weeks with elective cesarean section. The platelet count of the newborn was 181 × 109/L and coagulation tests were normal. No antiplatelet specific antibodies were detected in cord blood. Postnatal MRI evaluation confirmed grade IV intracranial hemorrhage. The newborn baby has suffered from mild spasticity and seizures.Clinicians must be vigilant about the catastrophic fetal complications of maternal AITP a close follow-up with a multidisciplinary cooperation between obstetricians, hematologists, and neonatologists must be warranted.
