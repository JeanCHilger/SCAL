Association between CRP gene polymorphisms and the risk of preeclampsia in Han Chinese women. As an inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (CRP) has elevated expression in preeclampsia (PE), which is implicated in the pathogenesis of PE, but there has been a lack of information on the possible association between genetic variants of CRP and PE. In this study, we aimed to assess the genetic association between CRP polymorphisms and the risk of PE in Han Chinese Women.Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms of CRP, rs2794521 (T>C), rs3091244 (C>T>A), rs3093068 (C>G), rs876538 (C>T), and rs1205 (C>T) were genotyped using the Sequenom method in 181 PE patients and 203 controls.The T allele frequency for rs2794521 was significantly higher in PE patients than in controls (odds ratios [OR]=4.091 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.533-10.917The CRP variant rs2794521 shows a strong association with PE in Han Chinese women. Pregnant women with the TT genotype of rs2794521 have higher odds of having PE, which further supports a possible role for CRP in PE.
