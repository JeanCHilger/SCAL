Diagnosing pulmonary embolism during pregnancy: how should we do?. No diagnostic strategy for pulmonary embo- lism (PE) during pregnancy is based on strong evidence and unanimously accepted. Clinical scores are not validated. The diagnostic yield of the non radiating tests is low: D-dimer is rarely negative in pregnant women and lower limb venous compression ultrasonography is poorly sensitive. Nevertheless, they are still recommended as first line exams. The radia- ting exams (ventilation-perfusion scintigra- phy and thoracic angio-CT) have an equiva- lent diagnostic yield (more than 90%). But both raise the risk of cancer: any childhood cancer for the fetus (scintigraphy), and breast cancer for the mother (angio-CT). However, the diagnosis of PE in the pregnant woman has a major impact and must be established with certainty, even if this requires performing radiation imaging.
