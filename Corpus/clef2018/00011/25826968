Ductus arteriosus aneurysm. Case report and review of the literature. The saccular or fusiform dilatation of the ductus arteriosus is called aneurysm (DAA). It is diagnosed in the second trimester during a structural ultrasound. Even though the reported incidence is 2.2%, it remains infrequent, because it is not searched routinely. The pathogenesis is uncertain, resulting from an increase on the circulating blood volume thus in the cardiac afterload, associated to a thinning of the vessel wall, for an inadequate intima development. Ductus arteriosus aneurysm can be classified according by their diameter as small (<7 mm.) and large (> or =8 mm). The smaller commonly closes spontaneously in 70% of the cases, unlike the larger one, they are associate in a greater number of complications, such as thrombosis, embolism, infection, compression effects of adjacent structures and spontaneous rupture. The absence of spontaneous closure, according to the symptoms and possible complications, a neonatal surgical closure should be considered. We report a case of a 35-year-old patient, diagnose on the 35 week pregnancy, a ductus arteriosus aneurysm by ultrasound with an image of the three vessels performed communicating, saccular dilatation of 7-8 mm. and a turbulent Doppler flow.
