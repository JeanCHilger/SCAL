Maternal-fetal transport of vitamin K1 and its effects on coagulation in premature infants. We conducted a prospective study to determine (1) the maternal-fetal vitamin K1 transport in premature infants after vitamin K1 was given to the mothers antenatally and (2) the vitamin K1 effects on blood coagulation in the babies. Women in labor at less than or equal to 34 weeks of gestation were randomly selected to receive antenatal vitamin K1, 5 mg given intramuscularly (vitamin K1 group), or no vitamin K1 (control group). Eight infants, including one set of twins, were in the vitamin K1 group and six in the control group. Vitamin K1 concentrations were higher in the vitamin K1 group than in the control group (p = 0.06). Activated partial thromboplastin time was prolonged, and factor II coagulation activity and factor II antigen were proportionately decreased in cord plasma in both groups. The average ratio of factor II coagulation activity to antigen was not decreased in either group. Protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) was not detectable in any cord plasma sample in either group. These findings support previous reports that the decreased vitamin K-dependent coagulation activity in premature infants is the result of reduced synthesis of precursor proteins, rather than the result of vitamin K deficiency, and suggest that additional vitamin K1 is not likely to improve coagulation activity. Among those infants who underwent cranial ultrasonography, all four in the vitamin K1 group and one of five in the control group had mild intraventricular hemorrhage. Studies of a larger number of patients are necessary before it can be established that maternal antenatal administration of vitamin K1 results in improvement of coagulation and the prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants.
