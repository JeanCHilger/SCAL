Lung cancer presenting with choroidal metastasis in a pregnant woman. A 28-year-old, non-smoker pregnant woman who was initially diagnosed to have deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism earlier in pregnancy, presented at 22 weeks of gestation with dyspnoea, visual loss initially in the right eye and then in the left eye. Fundoscopic examination revealed metastatic foci, suggestive of choroid metastases. Computed tomography of the chest revealed a right hilar mass. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoscopic biopsy confirmed lung adenocarcinoma. As the patient and family wished to continue with the pregnancy, chemotherapy with cisplatin and was administered from the 31st week of pregnancy and she had undergone Caesarian section in the 32nd week and the baby was healthy. We report this case as it is probably the first reported case of lung cancer presenting with choroidal metastasis in a pregnant woman.
