Ultrasound demonstration of prenatal renal vein thrombosis. Renal calcification following renal vein thrombosis (RVT) has a virtually diagnostic lace-like radiological pattern. It has been seen as early as the first day of life, [1-3], indicating prenatal disease. This case report illustrates the sonographic appearance of such calcifications which to our knowledge has not been described. We observed abnormalities on a prenatal ultrasound at 37 weeks of gestation and calcifications within the kidney on ultrasound during the neonatal period in an infant of a mother with Class B diabetes mellitus.
