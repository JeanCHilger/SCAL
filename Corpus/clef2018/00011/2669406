Venous sonography for pregnancy-related thrombosis: case report. Venous sonography offers a reliable, noninvasive way of diagnosing deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity, a condition with a potentially fatal consequence. It is possible that sonography may underestimate the degree of involvement of the veins. However this is not usually of clinical concern since systemic heparin therapy will be given regardless of the extent of the clot.
