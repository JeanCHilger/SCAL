Factors influencing hemostasis after umbilical vein puncture in vitro. Bleeding from the site of cordocentesis can be detected by ultrasound examination, but significant hemorrhage into the amniotic fluid rarely occurs. To evaluate the relative contribution of amniotic fluid thromboplastins and the quantity of Wharton's jelly in facilitating coagulation at the puncture site, amniotic fluid samples and umbilical cord segments were obtained at cesarean section from 20 patients. After puncture of the umbilical vein, bleeding times were measured in amniotic fluid and 0.9% sodium chloride. The quantity of Wharton's jelly was assessed by measuring umbilical cord circumference. Mean bleeding times were significantly shorter in amniotic fluid compared with saline solution, but there was no consistent relationship between bleeding times and umbilical cord circumference. We conclude that properties of amniotic fluid facilitate coagulation at the site of umbilical vein puncture.
