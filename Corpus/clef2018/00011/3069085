Fetal renal vein thrombosis. Two cases of fetal renal vein thrombosis, diagnosed via maternal ultrasound scan are presented. One was associated with severe placental dysfunction and demonstrated haematuria and renal failure which resolved on day 10. The other followed an antepartum haemorrhage and resolved before the baby was born. The ultrasound showed, as transient findings, unilateral renal enlargement, thrombus protruding into the inferior vena cava, and mild fetal ascites. We suggest that fetal renal vein thrombosis may be more common than previously suspected, and warrants close monitoring of fetal well-being. Delivery should be considered if there is other evidence of fetal compromise, if the amount of peritoneal fluid suggests substantial haemorrhage, or if there is propagating thrombus in the inferior vena cava.
