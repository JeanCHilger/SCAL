Septic shock during pregnancy. A multiinstitutional review of 10 pregnancies complicated by septic shock was undertaken to identify the clinical characteristics and hemodynamic alterations associated with this condition. Prolonged rupture of membranes with the subsequent development of chorioamnionitis or postpartum endometritis were risk factors that commonly preceded the diagnosis of septic shock. The majority of septic shock cases occurred during the puerperium. There were two maternal deaths in this selected series. Associated complications included pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pulmonary emboli, and cardiac arrest. The primary hemodynamic derangements were reduced systemic vascular resistance with depressed myocardial function. The mean initial systemic vascular resistance index in eight surviving women was 885 +/- 253 dyne.sec/cm5.m2. Despite an overall presenting cardiac index of 4.20 +/- 2.01 L/min/m2, five patients (50%) had evidence of myocardial depression based on analysis of their left ventricular function curves. Mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and left ventricular stroke work index all showed significant improvement after therapy. A hemodynamic algorithm based on volume therapy, inotropic agents, and peripheral vasoconstrictors is offered. This therapeutic approach is designed to optimize cardiac performance and maintenance of organ perfusion in the critically ill patient with septic hypotension during pregnancy.
