Cerebral thromboembolism, oral contraceptives and pregnancy. The incidence rate of cerebral thromboembolic attacks (CTA) among women ages 15-34 exceeds that of men significantly.  Knowing the age-specific percentages of oral contraceptive (OC) use, and the distribution of pregnancies according to age, and on the assumption that OC use implies a relative risk (RR) for developing CTA of 4 compared to nonusers, and that pregnancy increases the risk 5-fold, the incidence rates of CTA for women were corrected for the contribution of OCs and pregnancy.  Thus, the established "background" incidence rates corresponded to those of men in the same age group.  The corrected incidence rates for women ages 35-44 were 37-41% below those of men the same age.  It was concluded that it was primarily OC use that was responsible for the high incidence of CTA among women ages 15-34 pregnancy played a minor role.  This study could not confirm that the RR for CTA among OC users increases with increasing age but rather that the contrary was true.  (author's modified)
