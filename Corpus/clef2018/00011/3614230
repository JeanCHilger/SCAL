Intracerebral hemorrhage at 2 different times in neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. We demonstrate the sonographic and computer-tomographic findings in a newborn with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAITP). Initial examination on the third day of life showed an extensive old and already partially resolved haematoma as well as a new perinatal haematoma in the left cerebral white matter. Follow-up investigations revealed enlargement of the cystic defect, midline-shift to the right and progressive dilatation of the right lateral ventricle caused by compression of the Foramina Monroi. Peritoneal drainage of the cyst resulted in prompt diminution of the enlarged right lateral ventricle. The case report emphasises that in patients with NAITP intracranial haemorrhage may occur in utero and during the perinatal period as well. In pregnant women suspected to produce antibodies against PLA 1 positive thrombocytes, we recommend regular ultrasonic cranial examinations of the fetus. Delivery should be as careful as possible.
