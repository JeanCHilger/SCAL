Visual loss from choroidal ischemia. Six patients with visual loss showed decreased perfusion of the choroid during fluorescein angiography. The most commonly associated systemic abnormality in these patients was severe hypertension. Other associated diseases included toxemia of pregnancy, renal failure, systemic lupus erythematosus, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Two patients had permanently decreased vision in one or both eyes whereas the other four regained normal vision. Known anatomic and physiologic differences between the retinal and choroidal vessels explained the pronounced choroidal vascular disturbances in the presence of minimal or no observed retinal vascular abnormalities in these patients.
