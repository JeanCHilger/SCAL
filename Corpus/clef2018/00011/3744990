Rupture of an aortic sinus aneurysm in a 15-year-old broodmare. A 15-year-old, Standardbred broodmare with an aortic sinus aneurysm developed rupture of the aneurysm with subsequent rupture of a tricuspid valve chorda tendinae, tricuspid regurgitation, acute right-sided congestive heart failure, and pulmonary thromboembolism. Shunting of blood from the aorta through the ruptured aneurysm into the right ventricle resulted in decreased renal perfusion and acute renal failure. Initially, treatment of the mare with analgesics, fluids, and digoxin resulted in clinical improvement, but the mare's condition deteriorated after 8 days and the mare was euthanatized due to unrelenting pain and a poor prognosis. Echocardiography was useful in diagnosis of the cardiac disease in the broodmare.
