Thrombophlebitis of the right ovarian vein. X-ray computed tomographic diagnosis and monitoring of 2 cases. We report two cases of post partum right ovarian vein thrombophlebitis: The aspect of the C.T. is presented, specifying the anatomic relations of the right ovarian vein. The C.T. progression under treatment is illustrated in one case by the appearance of a vena cava thrombosis and in another by a return to normal. The possibility of other examinations is discussed. Correct knowledge of these C.T. findings should allow a diagnosis and a treatment without invasive procedures.
