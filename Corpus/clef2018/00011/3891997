Conservative treatment of liver hematoma in the postpartum period. A report of two cases. Two pregnant women at term had antenatal symptoms of impending preeclampsia (thrombocytopenia, liver dysfunction) and developed clinical signs of a leaking subcapsular liver hematoma in the immediate postpartum period. They were managed conservatively, with blood transfusions and ultrasonic computerized tomographic monitoring of the hematoma. Both did well, and their hospital stays were brief. These cases suggest that immediate celiotomy may not always be necessary for suspected liver hematoma associated with preeclampsia.
