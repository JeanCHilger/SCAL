Thrombosis of the umbilical vein in the ultrasound image--pathological findings and review of the literature. The authors present a case of thrombosis of the umbilical vein in a foetus in the 27th week of pregnancy, discovered via ultrasound diagnosis. The foetus presented with marked ascites and anasarca. Despite foetal death there were no visceral malformations, and no pathological criteria presented by the mother. The characteristic features and sensitivity of sonographic diagnosis in umbilical vein thromboses are discussed as part of the extensive pathology of the umbilical cord.
