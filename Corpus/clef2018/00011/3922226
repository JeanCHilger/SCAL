Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling. This report describes a technique for the performance of a sonographically guided percutaneous umbilical blood sampling and its potential uses in the management of diagnostic problems in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. The method has been employed in the prenatal assessment of 13 fetuses at risk for hemostatic failure (hemophilia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura), chromosomal disorders, isoimmunization, and fetal hypoxia. This simple and rapid procedure offers access to the fetal circulation for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
