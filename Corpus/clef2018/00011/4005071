Bilateral, symmetrical hemorrhagic infarction of the basal ganglia and thalamus following neonatal asphyxia. With the advancement of perinatal intensive care, the occurrence of subependymal germinal matrix hemorrhage (= GMH) in low-birth-weight (premature) infants has became a major concern in perinatal medicine. The pathophysiology of the GMH has long been controversial. The introduction of computed tomographic (= CT) scanning to perinatal medicine has revealed various pathological events heretofore unknown in newborn infants having respiratory and circulatory distress. At our serving the entire Osaka Prefecture, infants suffering from birth asphyxia with severe perinatal brain damage were found to have CT findings distinguishable from those of GMH. We report three asphyxiated newborn infant who had hemorrhagic infarction in bilateral caudate nucleus, striatum and thalamus on the CT scan. Reports of similar findings are rare, and ours is the first serial observation of such CT scan image in newborn infants. The mechanism of development and pathology of this pathological condition have been variously argued as pathophysiology of GMH. The present study lacks postmortem examination, however, the findings in serial CT scans in three infants and review of the literatures related to the pathology of neonatal asphyxia indicate the following course. The thrombosis in the internal cerebral veins led to severe swelling of the brain, and hemorrhage occurred with the reduction in the swelling, eventually resulting in diffuse leukomalacia. Etat marbr√© (status marmoratus), mentioned earlier, is considered to represent a milder stage of this pathologic course.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
