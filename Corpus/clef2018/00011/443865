The structure of decidual mucosa in the accessory horn of an uterus bicornis (author's transl). The loosely attached decidual mucosa in the accessory horn of an uterus bicornis does not principally differ from the mucosa in the horn containing the fetus. Structural studies show that the regression of decidual endometrium to a endothelium-like lining is a hormone-dependent process such as stromagland dissociation. Mechanical factors due to expansion of the fetus certainly play no major role. Degenerative phenomena, such as focal necrosis, sclerosing edema, thrombosis, and inflammatory infiltrates probably appear more frequently in the accessory horn. They may be explained by more pronounced regional disturbances concerning perfusion and the inferior sealing of the uterine cavity.
