Hydatidiform mole with large ovarian cysts and venous thrombosis: a case report. A 24-year-old gravida 1 with benign molar pregnancy, which was evacuated after 12 weeks of amenorrhea, developed ovarian cysts that reached the costal margin. Afterwards, she developed thrombosis, which occluded the superior vena cava as well as the right axillary vein. Treatment with streptokinase, followed by heparin and warfarin sodium, apparently resulted in a clinically complete cure. The ovarian cysts regressed spontaneously, and regular menstrual cycles recurred.
