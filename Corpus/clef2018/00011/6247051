Liver and the contraceptive pill. Oral contraceptives have been used for many years and a number of adverse effects have been recognized (e.g., jaundice, deep vein thrombosis, thromboembilic disease, gallbladder disease, breast carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma and photosensitivity).

The biochemical effects of the oral contraceptive on the liver, with particular reference to jaundice, are discussed in detail.This paper discusses the hepatic and biochemical effects of OCs (oral contraceptives) based on a review of current literature on the subject.  The histological and pathologic features of liver tumors are described, as are the different etiological agents (diethylstilbestrol and androgenic anabolic steroids) and methods used in the management of liver tumors (laparotomy normal tissue excision
