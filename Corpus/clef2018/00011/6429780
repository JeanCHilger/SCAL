Puerperal thrombophlebitis of the ovarian veins--diagnosis using CT. Two cases of puerperal thrombophlebitis of the ovarian veins are described and the literature is reviewed. By means of computer tomography, it has become possible for the first time to make the diagnosis of this little-known and frequently missed condition by a non-invasive method. The patient is spared complicated angiographic procedures and possibly also surgery. The typical CT findings consist of: a) a thickened adnexa, b) a circular lesion extending from the adnexa to the hilum of the kidney, c) an obstructed ureter and c) an enlarged uterus.
