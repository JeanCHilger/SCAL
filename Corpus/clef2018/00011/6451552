Post partum occlusion of the hepatic artery: sonographic, computer tomographic and angiographic findings (author's transl). A case of post partum acute thrombosis of the hepatic artery with infarction of the liver is reported. The prognosis depends on the areas of obstruction, on the early development of a collateral circulation and on the contribution to the blood supply from the portal vein. The diagnosis of liver infarction was made by computed tomography. This was characterised by sharply demarkated hypodense areas, which did not enhance with contrast. An important clue is the lack of increase in density in the liver after intravenous injection of contrast when compared with the increased contrast of the spleen. This finding provided the indication for angiography. This confirmed the diagnosis of acute occlusion and made appropriate treatment possible.
