Ectopic pregnancy: current clinical trends, a fifteen year study. This paper reviews the clinical recognition, diagnosis, and management of ectopic pregnancy at the Queen of Angels Hospital for the past 15 years.  The incidence of ectopic pregnancy to deliveries is 1:195.  Pain is the cardinal symptom of ectopic pregnancy, and amenorrhea of some degree was present in all cases.  Pelvic inflammatory disease is a factor in the development of tubal pregnancy in some women.  A careful history and thorough physical examination are important in making a careful diagnosis.  The only laboratory procedures which are of any value are the blood type and the Rh determination.  While examination of endometrial tissue obtained by biopsy or curettage has proved useful in ectopic pregnancy diagnosis, it is not totally decisive.  Culdocentesis has proved to be the diagnostic procedure of the greatest value in recognizing intraperitoneal hemorrhage and it increases the correct preoperative diagnosis from 65-70% to 95%.  Laparoscopy is useful when the physician is in doubt about the nature of the problem and it has produced an increase in the number of ectopic pregnancies diagnosed.  Ultrasound is another useful tool in confirming a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy its accuracy ranges from 70-92%.  A newly developed pregnancy test is more sensitive than conventional pregnancy tests and would be positive for pregnancy.  Women who have had a previous ectopic pregnancy have a higher subsequent incidence of persistent infertility, recurrent ectopic pregnancy, and pregnancy wastage
