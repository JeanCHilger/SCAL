In vivo diagnosis of massive hepatic infarction by computed tomography. A patient is presented with a postpartum hepatic artery thrombosis in association with presumed fibromuscular hyperplasia. Massive hepatic infarction developed characterized clinically by fever, coma, ascites, ileus, jaundice, and renal failure and biochemically by markedly elevated SGOT and SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin levels, and decreased thromboplastin time. The diagnosis was made in vivo by computed tomography (CT). Angiography revealed thrombotic occlusion of the hepatic artery in association with presumed fibromuscular hyperplasia. Laparoscopy and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis.
