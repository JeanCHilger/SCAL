Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis: report of a case and review of the literature. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a condition that is well documented as a complication of the latter stages of pregnancy and with an even greater incidence during the puerperium. More recently this entity had been associated with the use of oral contraceptives. A case is presented of a 15-year-old girl with this condition, in whom the occurrence as well as the resolution of a superior sagittal sinus thrombosis was demonstrated with serial computed tomography (CT) scans and radionuclide studies. The discussion of this case, coupled with a review of the literature, describes the clinical presentation, explores the possible etiology, offers a noninvasive technique for confirming the diagnosis, and presents the medical management of this condition. It is postulated that cerebral venous sinus thrombosis occurs with a greater frequency than is currently recognized. Health professionals involved with monitoring the health care of adolescents during pregnancy and in the puerperium should be aware of this potential complications. In addition, association of this condition with oral contraceptive use should be recognized.
