Intervillous thrombosis: sonographic and pathologic correlation. Sonographic and pathologic documentation of 7 cases of intervillous thrombosis of the placenta are presented. These lesions were demonstrated on sonography as early as 19 weeks of gestation. Since intervillous thromboses are thought to be related to Rh isoimmunization, their sonographic documentation may be of clinical importance.
