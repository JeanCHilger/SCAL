Emergency in general medicine (43). Septic complications in implanted IUD. Between 2-6% of patients with an IUD will suffer related ascending infections of the inner genital region with possible spread to the pelvic region, independent of length of use.  In case of pregnancy with an IUD, septic complications will be more severe.  None of the IUD models is regarded as causing infection since the Dalkon Shield has been taken off the market.  The symptomatology of the disease develops similar to an uncomplicated ascending adnexitis.  It will cause diagnostic problems if it cannot be determined whether the septic focus is located in the inner genital region.  With uncharacteristic or absent pathological and gynecological findings by touch, a septic ovarial vein thrombosis has to be considered.  The search for the IUD, even with a nonvisible thread, by ultrasound is unavoidable.  Further measures include control of the kidney and pulmonary function and leukocytes and blood sedimentation.  If an infection develops with an implanted IUD, which is to be classed with the inner genital region, antibiotic therapy can be started provided that no shock signs, no acute abdomen, and no grave feelings of illness are present.  If the patient is pregnant it is absolutely necessary to send her to the hospital for examination, even if there are no grave symptoms.
