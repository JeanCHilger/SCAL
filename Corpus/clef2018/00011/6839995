Sonographic diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome. In a 28-year-old female patient a diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome was established post partum on the basis of characteristic ultrasonographic findings. The results permit establishment of the syndrome in the early phase of the disease. Early diagnosis of hepatic vein occlusion is particularly important because directed therapeutic regimes may lead to revascularisation of hepatic veins and may thus prevent liver cell necrosis and subsequent hepatic failure.
