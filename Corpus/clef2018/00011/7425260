Intensive care of severe preeclampsia-eclampsia. A report on 22 cases (author's transl). 22 patients with severe preeclampsia-eclampsia were treated in our Intensive Care Unit from 1972 to 1978. Control of convulsions was achieved by diazepam, diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbital. In 11 comatose patients brain monitoring was carried out by frequent neurological examination and use of computerized x-ray tomography aspiration of gastric contents was prevented by nasotracheal intubation. Brain oedema therapy included controlled hyperventilation, steroids and mannitol (7 patients). 10 patients with respiratory failure (due to pulmonary oedema, "shock lung" or aspiration pneumonitis) were treated by mechanical ventilation. Diastolic blood pressure above 100 mm Hg was reduced by hydralazine. Diuresis was induced by normalization of hypovolaemia with albumin and plasma expanders. Six patients died (27%)
