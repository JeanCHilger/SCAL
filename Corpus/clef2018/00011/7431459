Traumatic renal hemorrhage exacerbated by heparin. A case of stable blunt renal trauma is presented. The patient a 20-year-old pregnant woman, was heparinized and 2 days later developed severe renal bleeding. Her kidney returned to near normal with nonoperative measures. Care should be taken in the decision to heparinize such patients following renal trauma because of the possibility of delayed hemorrhage.
