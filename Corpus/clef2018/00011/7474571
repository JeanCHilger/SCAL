Puerperal secondary pulmonary hypertension in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease. A woman with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) developed pulmonary hypertension after delivery of a child, but had little evidence of parenchymal lung disease. This 29-year-old woman had been given a diagnosis of MCTD when she was 19 years old. She was admitted to our department two days after delivery of a child, because of dyspnea on exertion. Acute thromboembolism was suspected because of: (1) chest roentgenogram showing cardiomegaly and enlargement of the left main pulmonary artery, (2) a lung perfusion scan showing a segmental defect in the left S6 and S8 areas, (3) laboratory studies showing abnormally high WBC, LDH, FDP, and D-D dimer, and (4) arterial blood gas analyses showing mild hypoxemia and hypocapnia. Thrombolytic therapy with heparin and urokinase was begun, and was followed by a loop diurtic and anticoagulation with warfarin. One month after admission, cardiac enlargement and the A-aDO2 were found to have decreased. At that time, cardiac catheterization was done and revealed pulmonary hypertension (mean PA pressure: 45 mmHg) and low cardiac output with no detectable thrombosis in the left pulmonary artery. The patient was subsequently treated with a calcium antagonist and a prostacyclin derivative, and her condition was stable for 5 months. Then her exercise tolerance gradually decreased due to shortness of breath, and cardiomegaly gradually increased over the next 3 months. Eight months after delivery of the child, the patient died of right heart failure. In clinically stable patients with MCTD, delivery of a child may lead to pulmonary thromboembolism and pulmonary hypertension.
