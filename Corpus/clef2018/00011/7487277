Thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA for thrombosis of tricuspid valve prosthesis during pregnancy. The authors report the case of a woman with thrombosis of a tricuspid Saint Jude prosthesis during the fourth month of pregnancy. A first course of thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA reestablished normal prosthetic valve function but was followed by a threatened abortion and severe uterine haemorrhage. An early rethrombosis of the prosthetic valve led to interruption of the pregnancy after failure of a second course of thrombolysis, and to replacement of the tricuspid valve prosthesis. This case illustrates the problems of pregnancy in women with mechanical cardiac prosthetic valves and the difficulties of treatment.
