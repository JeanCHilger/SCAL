Uteroplacental blood flow monitoring by color Doppler flow imaging in pregnancy induced hypertension. The uteroplacental blood flow was monitored using color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) in 31 cases of pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and 71 cases of normal pregnancy. At the same time the values of serum estriol (E3), human placental lactogen (hPL), thromboxane (TXB2), 6-KP and TXB2/6-KP ratio were measured. The results showed that time average velocity (TAV) and volume of blood flow (Q) of uterine and umbilical arteries in PIH cases were much lower than those in normal pregnant women and fetuses (P < 0.05). After treatment with magnesium sulfate and qingxintong there was a marked improvement in placental blood flow. TAV and Q of uterine and umbilical arteries was also increased (P < 0.05). In PIH cases the E3 and hPL levels were much lower, while the ratio of TXB2/6-KP was significantly higher than that in normal pregnancy. Using CDFI to observe the velocity and volume of uteroplacental blood flow can monitor the blood supply of uterus and placenta. It is a valuable predictive index of fetal and placental function.
