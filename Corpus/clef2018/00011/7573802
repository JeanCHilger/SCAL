Effect of ethanol on prostacyclin, thromboxane, and prostaglandin E production in human umbilical veins. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ethanol on prostacyclin (PGI2), prostaglandin E (PGE), and thromboxane (TXA2) production in perfused human umbilical veins. PGI2, PGE, and TXA2 levels were measured from human umbilical veins perfused with either 25, 50, or 100 mM ethanol by radioimmunoassay of their stable metabolites. Alcohol content was measured by an enzymatic spectrophotometric assay. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Fisher's Protected Least Significant Difference Test. Ethanol decreased PGI2 production in a concentration-dependent manner (p < 0.05). In a concentration of 25 mM, ethanol did not affect PGI2 production, whereas 50 mM decreased levels after 60 min of perfusion (p < 0.01). With 100 mM ethanol, PGI2 production was decreased after 15, 30, and 60 min of perfusion (ps < 0.05), and the TXA2/PGI2 ratio was significantly elevated at all time points (p < 0.01). Ethanol (100 mM) did not affect TXA2 or PGE production. Reduction of PGI2 levels and the increase in the TXA2/PGI2 ratio seen after ethanol perfusion in umbilical veins may cause vascular disruption in the umbilical-placental circulation. This may, in part, be a contributing mechanism to the teratogenic effects of ethanol.
