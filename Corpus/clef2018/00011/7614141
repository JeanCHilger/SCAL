Prenatal ultrasonographic diagnosis of ductus arteriosus aneurysm with spontaneous neonatal closure. Aneurysm of the ductus arteriosus may be either spontaneous or acquired as a complication of surgical closure of a patent duct. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with a wide spectrum of symptoms, including hoarseness, respiratory symptoms, aortic or pulmonary thrombosis or embolism, or rupture of the aneurysm. We present the first report of prenatal ultrasonographic diagnosis of isolated ductus arteriosus aneurysm. The aneurysm presented at 39 weeks as an enlarged, dilated, vascular structure 15 mm in diameter, which began at the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery and ended in the descending aorta. Doppler imaging demonstrated turbulent flow in this lesion. Following spontaneous delivery, a bidirectional shunt in the ductus arteriosus was found on the 1st day, but the caliber of the vessel was normal. An almost completely functionally closed ductus was found on the 2nd day. Spontaneous resolution of the lesion was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging at 4 weeks of age.
