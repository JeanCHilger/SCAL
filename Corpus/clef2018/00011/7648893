Thrombophlebitis of the ovarian vein in the postpartum period. Diagnostic and therapeutic problems. Three cases of thrombophlebitis of the ovarian vein occurred early after delivery. The thrombus extended into the inferior vena cava in all three cases and led to pulmonary emboli in one patient. The clinical presentation was suggestive of the diagnosis which was confirmed by echography and computed tomography. Heparin and antibiotics were given at diagnosis and thrombectomy of the inferior vena cava was performed in 2 cases with a vibrating thrombus. Ligature was required in these cases. The clinical case was favourable in all three cases.
