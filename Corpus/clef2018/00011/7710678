Selective feticide in twin transfusion syndrome using ultrasound-guided insertion of thrombogenic coils. Twin transfusion syndrome is a common complication of monozygotic twin pregnancies. Selective feticide is one of the many different aggressive and invasive therapies that has been suggested to improve an otherwise dismal perinatal outcome. The ideal method of selective feticide remains to be delineated for cases of twin transfusion syndrome that occur remote from term. We describe a case involving the use of intracardiac placement of thrombogenic coils to attempt selective termination.
