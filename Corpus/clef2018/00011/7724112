Postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis after vaginal delivery: a report of 11 cases. To review and characterize the presentation of postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis after vaginal delivery.We reviewed medical records of patients with the prior diagnosis of septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism associated with pregnancy. The study covered the 10-year period from July 1984 through August 1994 and included women hospitalized at E.H. Crump Women's Hospital, Regional Medical Center, University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee.During the study period, there were 76,858 deliveries: 13,109 cesareans and 63,749 vaginal deliveries. Eleven patients had documented postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis after vaginal delivery. Ten patients were readmitted an average of 7.6 days after delivery (range 3-17). The diagnosis was documented by computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound in ten women and laparotomy in one. Nine patients were readmitted with the presumptive diagnosis of endometritis, the other two with the presumptive diagnosis of pyelonephritis. Nine were treated initially with ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin. Heparin therapy was added when failure of clinical response was noted. No patient defervesced within 24 hours of beginning heparin therapy only two patients defervesced within 48 hours, and the remaining patients became afebrile at an average of 6.8 days (range 4-18, median 5).The diagnosis of ovarian vein thrombosis should be considered early in the care of patients readmitted with a diagnosis of endometritis after vaginal delivery. If prompt defervescence does not occur with aggressive intravenous antibiotic therapy, a CT scan should be obtained in a timely manner for prompt diagnosis and therapy. Our findings do not support the time-honored rule that septic pelvic thrombophlebitis and ovarian vein thrombosis respond within 24-48 hours to therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin.
