Interventional therapy of inferior vena cava thrombosis in pregnancy--use of a new kind of temporary vena cava filter. Several changes occur during pregnancy that cause hypercoagulability such as venous stasis, increased levels of clotting factors, and decreased fibrinolytic activity. Nearly half of all maternal mortality can be attributed to thromboembolic disease. Recurrent embolism from venous thrombosis in pregnancy constitutes a major diagnostic and management problem. Treatment of deep venous thrombosis by anticoagulation alone may not be sufficient to prevent fatal pulmonary embolism. Because pulmonary embolism is a potential preventable and treatable condition, early and accurate diagnosis and treatment are mandatory. Prevention can be obtained by the implantation of clips, umbrellas or vena cava filters. There are only a few reports of the use of permanent inferior vena cava filters in the prevention of pulmonary embolisation in pregnancy mostly using the Greenfield-Filter. We present the indication and efficacy of a new retrievable vena-cava filter (FCP 2002) inserted through the internal jugular veins in pregnancy in two patients, which enables them to continue pregnancy, resulting in a vaginal delivery of healthy infants near term. The safety and effectiveness of this filter-system suggests that the indication for its use might be liberalized to include prophylactic insertion of this device in patients at risk known for thromboembolic disorders.
