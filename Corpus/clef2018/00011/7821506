Postpartum ovarian veins thrombophlebitis. Puerperal ovarian vein thrombophlebitis (POVT) is a rare postpartal complication. Its incidence is about 0.05%. POVT can follow a term pregnancy, a premature delivery, an abortion or an ectopic pregnancy. POVT usually presents as a syndrome consisting in lower abdominal pain and fever which does not respond to adequate antibiotics. We present a case report, in which the diagnosis was based upon computed tomography.
