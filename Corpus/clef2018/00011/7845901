Prenatal evaluation and in utero platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia absent radii syndrome. A fetus with absent radii in both forearms was discovered on routine ultrasound examination performed at 18 weeks of pregnancy. No other significant abnormalities were found, and no signs of haemorrhage were detected. Serial ultrasound examinations revealed no evidence of fetal internal bleeding. At 37 weeks of pregnancy, a CBC obtained by cordocentesis under ultrasound guidance confirmed the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia absent radii (TAR) syndrome. Apheresis platelets were transfused into the umbilical vein to correct the thrombocytopenia and was followed by an uncomplicated delivery. No bleeding was encountered during the remainder of the baby's neonatal course. We conclude that TAR syndrome can be readily identified prenatally on sonogram, and if severe thrombocytopenia is confirmed by cordocentesis, platelets should be transfused to diminish the risk of serious internal bleeding during and immediately after delivery.
