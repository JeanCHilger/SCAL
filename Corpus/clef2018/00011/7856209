Postpartum ovarian vein thrombophlebitis--case report. Because of the low incidence and the lack of clinical symptomatology, puerperal ovarian vein thrombophlebitis has constituted a diagnostic problem now as ever, and diagnostic errors are frequent. With the help of US and CT, however, the chances of early detection have improved. On the 26-year old patient P. C. a section had to be performed in the 34th week of pregnancy because of premature rupture of the bag of waters. On the 7th postoperative day, the patient developed pyrexia inspite of antibiotic therapy. Sonographical examinated lead us to suspect a floating thrombus in the vena cava inferior. It was in the CT that the diagnosis of ovarian vein thrombosis was made for the first time. On the 13th day post partum a laparotomy and exstirpation of the v.ovarica dextra with removal of the thrombus plug from the v.cava inferior infrarenally was performed. Primarily, conservative treatment is given preference if the development is uncomplicated operative sanitation is undertaken in case of difficulties only.
