Effect of phenazone (antipyrine) on the prostanoid formation in human umbilical arteries perfused in vitro. The influence of phenazone on the production of prostacyclin and thromboxane in human umbilical arteries was investigated by in vitro perfusion. With perfusate concentrations ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-4) M a decrease in the formation of both prostanoids was observed. The inhibitory effect of phenazone on prostanoid formation was found to be equal to that of indomethacin.
