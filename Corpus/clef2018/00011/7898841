Magnetic resonance imaging of deep venous thrombosis in pregnant women with lower extremity edema. To review our experience with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis in pregnant women.Ten gravidas with lower extremity findings suspicious for pelvic or thigh thrombosis were examined by MRI using a gradient recalled echo technique.In one case, MRI confirmed pelvic extension of a femoral thrombus diagnosed by Doppler ultrasound. In a second case, MRI diagnosed thrombus isolated to the pelvis. In another, MRI detected a femoral thrombus without extension into the iliac veins. Although no thrombus was detected in the remaining seven cases, pelvic vein compression by the gravid uterus was identified in five.Magnetic resonance imaging can detect deep venous thrombosis during pregnancy and should be considered when thrombosis of the pelvic veins is a clinical consideration.
