Study and treatment of varicose veins. Truths and counter-truths. Varicose veins are not the only symptomatology of chronic venous insufficiency of the lower limbs, which has other clinical manifestations: purely symptomatic problems, varicosities, edema and trophic skin lesions. The management of varicose veins is base upon thorough clinical examination. Doppler and ultrasonography are useful in cases of varicose veins in which radical treatment is envisaged. Ultrasound investigation is essential in the presence of cutaneous ulceration in order to avoid mistaking a trophic lesion due to incompetence of deep veins, most often of post-thrombotic origin, for a varicose ulcer. The treatment of varicose veins varies according to the precise nature of the preoccupations of the patient concerned. Elastic support is useful regardless of the clinical form of the disease. Vasculoprotective and venotonic drugs can be used when venous insufficiency is symptomatic. Radical treatment of varicose veins, whether by sclerosing injections or surgery, depends upon the anatomical nature of lesions, the degree of venous incompetence and the extent of signs, but also the wishes of the patient, properly informed of the advantages and limitations of each technique.
