Thrombophlebitis of the ovarian vein with free-floating thrombus in the inferior vena cava. Two cases of thrombophlebitis of the right ovarian vein, one occurring after cesarean section and the other after natural childbirth, are reported. The clinical diagnosis was based on the symptoms of postpartum fever in association with right flank pain and confirmed by abdominal CT scans. In both cases the thrombosis extended into the inferior vena cava and was associated with a free-floating thrombus extending up to the renal veins. Thrombectomy of the inferior vena cava and ligation of the right ovarian vein were performed with good results in both cases, as shown by late follow-up CT scans. This and alternative therapeutic strategies are discussed.
