Clinical experiences with passive immunotherapy in habitual abortion. In a pilot study, 25 patients with histories of repeated abortion were treated by passive immunotherapy with high-dosage immunoglobulin administration (Sandoglobulin). Plasma viscosity, RBC aggregation, hematocrit, PAI, D-dimer and Factor VIIIR:AG were studied in order to detect risks. By September 1, 1992, 16 women had given birth abortion had recurred in 2 women and 7 were pregnant between the 10th and 37th GW. Five pregnancies terminated in premature/small-for-date births and one neonate had a congenital malformation syndrome. Under immunoglobulin therapy no hyperviscosity or excessive fibronolysis defects with a tendency to thrombosis or restriction of intervillous perfusion were observed. Besides safety for mother and fetus, intravenous immunoglobulin administration has the added advantage that it can be used in cases of primary and secondary abortion and for women with deficient immune response.
