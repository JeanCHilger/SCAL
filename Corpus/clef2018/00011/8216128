Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis: an unusual treatable postpartum complication. Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis is an uncommon but serious postpartum complication occurring in about 1 in 2,000 pregnancies, characterized by pain, antibiotic resistant fever and tachycardia. In about 50% of cases a pelvic mass is present which is usually right-sided (especially when the ovarian vein is involved). It is estimated to cause 18 maternal deaths per million pregnancies in the United States. Use of contrast enhanced CT scanning and a trial of heparin therapy increases the diagnostic certainty. It is particularly important because surgical management which may otherwise be suggested because of a spiking fever and a mass seems to be associated with a poorer prognosis than does conservative management.
