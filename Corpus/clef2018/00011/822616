Changes in blood coagulation and thrombocyte aggregation during extended inhibition of labor (author's transl). The influence of extended tocolysis with Partusisten on blood coagulation was examined in 30 patients at various times during pregnancy. A rapid and statistically significant reduction of thrombocyte aggregation was found in all examined parameters. The effect was independent of the method of administering the medicine and continued during the whole period of time examined. Values, with which an increased tendency toward hemorrhage could be expected, did not occur. The values possibly reflect an increased disaggregation of the thrombocytes. The decreased whole blood viscosity with an unchanged hematocrit could also improve placental perfusion and, thereby, the nourishment of the fetus. All examined parameters of plasmic coagulation remained normal. No signs of a hypercoagulability or an increased fibrinolysis were present.
