Thrombophlebitis of the ovarian vein with a floating clot in the inferior vena cava. The authors report two recent observations of thrombophlebitis of the right ovarian vein. The first occurred after a cesarotomy, due to a bigeminal pregnancy, and the second, after a breech delivery. The diagnosis was given when faced to a febrile syndrome and pains of the right flank and confirmed in both cases by an abdominal tomodensimetric examination. In both cases, an enlargement of the lower vena cava thrombosis was observed with a floating clot that reached the renal veins. Both patients underwent a surgery. The latter consisted in both cases in a thrombectomy of the lower vena cava as well as a ligature of the right ovarian vein. In both cases, the evolution was positive, thanks to a remote-control of the lower vena cava via tomodensimetry. This therapeutic procedure and other potential therapies were discussed.
