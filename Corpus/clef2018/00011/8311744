Mitral catheter-balloon valvuloplasty in surgical high risk patients. To evaluate percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PMBV) in surgical high risk patients.Twenty (12%) patients out of 172 submitted to a PMBV were considered high surgical risk cases 17 (85%) were women and mean age was 43 (18-69). Thirteen (65%) were in acute pulmonary edema (3 were pregnant, 2 had previous cerebrovascular event, 1 had pulmonary thromboembolism and other had chronic renal failure), and 7 (35%) were in functional class (CF) III (2 had coronary artery disease, 2 severe obesity, 1 pulmonary neoplasia, 1 cardiac cachexia and one with previous cerebrovascular event). All patients underwent PMBV through transseptal technique. Double balloon was used in 10 (50%) patientsSeventeen (85%) obtained success and 2 (10%) had clinical improvement. The hemodynamic results pre versus post-PMBV showed: left atrium pressure (LAP) mmHg 28.2 +/- 10.0 x 15.2 +/- 9.2 (n = 20) (p < 0.001), mitral medium gradient (G) mmHg 21.2 +/- 10.7 x 10.7 +/- 6.7 (n = 18) (p < 0.001), mitral valve area (MVA) cm2 0.73 +/- 0.3 x 1.73 +/- 0.6 (n = 11) (p < 0.001), pulmonary artery pressure mmHg 52.0 +/- 18.2 x 40.1 +/- 14.7 (n = 18) (p < 0.001) and cardiac index L/min/m2 2.1 +/- 0.4 x 2.5 +/- 0.6 (n = 14) (p < 0.001). Comparative echocardiography results pre, post and 6 months after PMBV showed: MVA 1.06 +/- 0.39 x 1.92 +/- 0.51 x 1.65 +/- 0.5 and G 13.8 +/- 4.7 x 7.3 +/- 3.6 x 7.3 +/- 4.4. There were two immediate deaths (pulmonary thromboembolism and multiple organs failure) and other after hospital discharge. The complications were: 2 (10%) patients with neurological complications, 1 (5%) atrial septal defect and other right atrium perforation (5%).PMBV offers an alternative to surgical treatment in high risk surgical patients and the results are maintained in the 6 month follow-up.
