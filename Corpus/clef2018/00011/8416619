Safety of intracavitary urokinase with percutaneous abscess drainage. Percutaneous drainage of abscesses is an effective treatment, but the success rate is lower for abscesses that have septa and are multilocular. Several clinical and in vitro studies suggest urokinase may be useful in such cases. Our study was designed to determine the safety of urokinase administered into an abscess cavity during the course of percutaneous drainage.Our study included 26 consecutive patients with 31 abscesses treated with percutaneous drainage. Exclusion criteria included age less than 18 or more than 95 years, CNS disorders (e.g., tumor, vascular problems), coagulation impairments, hepatic failure, pregnancy, and abscesses in the spleen, pancreas, or interloop area. Three doses were used: group 1 (nine patients), 1000 IU of urokinase per centimeter of abscess diameter group 2 (11 patients), 2500 IU of urokinase per centimeter of abscess diameterOur results showed no significant change in hematologic studies and no bleeding complications. Analysis of purulent material indicated that urokinase remained active in the abscess milieu. Drainage was successful in seven of 11 patients in group 1, all nine patients in group 2, and 10 of 11 patients in group 3. All eight abscesses with septa were successfully drained.Intracavitary urokinase can be given safely during percutaneous drainage of an abscess, with no associated bleeding complications or changes in coagulation parameters.
