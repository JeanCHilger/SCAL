Multicystic encephalomalacia in a surviving twin after death of the other twin in utero. A case of multicystic encephalomalacia in a twin is reported. The other twin died in utero at 32 weeks gestational age. Because there was no evidence of fetal distress the pregnancy was allowed to continue until 36 weeks gestational age. Injuries to the surviving twin due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIVC) and vascular thrombosis or to anoxia and ischemia may occur when there are anastomoses between the circulatory systems of the two twins, i.e., in monochorionic pregnancies. The classically recommended strategy is to wait for adequate maturity of the surviving fetus (36 weeks). It is suggested that this attitude may be overly expectant and may deserve reappraisal.
