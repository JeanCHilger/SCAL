Results and complications of intrauterine transfusion in fetuses with and without hydrops. The group comprises 50 intrauterine transfusions in 15 patients with a severe form of foetal erythroblastosis. The authors describe the results and complications in hydropic and non-hydropic foetuses, diagnosed by ultrasound before transfusion treatment was started. In the group of non-hydropic foetuses the success rate of transfusion treatment was 90.1% and 10 neonates were born with a mean weight of 2030 g. The mean gestation period was 34 weeks. From four hydropic foetuses it proved possible to save only one, the success rate in this group was only 25%. The mean weight of hydropic foetuses was 1650 g and the gestation period at delivery 29 weeks. The rate of Caesarean sections in both groups was as high as 80%. Serious complications included thrombosis of the umbilicus, thromboembolism of the a. axillaris in a hydropic neonate and acute hypoxia of the foetus after transfusion. Four of six serious complications were recorded in hydropic foetuses.
