Ultrasonographic evaluation of pelvis minor and lower extremity veins during pregnancy and puerperium. Thrombophlebitis of iliac and lower extremity veins is still an actual diagnosis problem in obstetrics and gynaecology. Classical ultrasonography and color doppler usefulness were compared. High efficacy of both methods in early diagnosis was concluded. The color doppler method is more effective in postphlebitic syndrome recognition. Spread out of veins ultrasonography with compression test gives a possibility of early diagnosis of thrombophlebitis in the course of pregnancy and puerperium.
