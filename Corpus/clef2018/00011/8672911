Measuring the concentration of various plasma and placenta extract proteolytic and vascular factors in pregnant patients with HELLP syndrome, pre-/eclampsia and highly pathologic Doppler flow values. Impaired trophoblast invasion plays a major role in the development of preeclampsia. Therefore various factors that are involved in invasion were investigated in gestational disease.In pregnant women with HELLP-syndrome (n = 18), pre-/eclampsia (n = 21) and highly pathological Doppler flow measurements (hpD) (n = 13), plasma and placental tissue extract concentrations of uPA, uPA-receptor, tPA, PAI-1, MMP-8, MMP-9, TIMP-1, thrombomodulin, and angiogenin were measured using ELISA.In all three collectives, PAI-1 plasma concentrations were significantly higher (p < 0,05) than in normal pregnancies, in patients with HELLP-syndrome, tPA and TIMP-1 plasma levels were also elevated. MMP-9 concentrations in placental tissue extracts were lower in pre-/eclampsia than in normal pregnancies.Impaired placental implantation and remodelling in gestational disease is reflected by changes in plasma and placental tissue extract concentrations of various factors that are involved in these processes.
