Norplant subdermal contraceptive system: experience in Taiwan. From November 1988 to December 1994, a total of 567 female volunteers were enrolled in Norplant implant studies at the National Taiwan University Hospital. After a median follow-up of 29 months, only 3 of the 529 available cases became pregnant (a cumulative rate of 1.2 pregnancies per 100 users over 5 years). Chromosome analysis of 2 of the 3 abortuses revealed 46,XX/46,XX,inv(3) and 46,XX. Menstrual problems were the most common adverse effects and were also the main reason for discontinuation (65%, 108/166). The continuation rate was 90%, 78%, 70%, 61%, and 42% at the end of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after insertion, respectively. In the 21 patients who wished to become pregnant, fertility recurred soon after removal of the Norplant implants. The data suggested that the Norplant implants system is a highly effective, safe, and long-acting method of reversible contraception. It would be worthwhile to introduce this contraceptive system to Taiwan's family planning program.Between November 1988 and December 1994 health providers at the National Taiwan University Hospital enrolled 567 women aged 17-47 in the Norplant implant studies that aimed to evaluate the benefits and side effects of Norplant as another contraceptive method choice.  They followed the women for a median of 29 months.  38 cases were lost to follow-up.  The 5-year contraceptive effectiveness rate was 98.8%.  The 3 pregnancies (2 intrauterine and 1 ectopic) occurred during the 24th, 45th, and 47th months of use.  None of the women who became pregnant weighed more than 70 kg.  Two of the aborted fetuses had chromosomal abnormalities (46,XX/46,XX,inv(3) and 46,XX).  29.9% of the Norplant users had menstrual problems.  Even though irregular bleeding occurred to 19.7% of Norplant users, hemoglobin levels increased after Norplant use (p  0.05).  Triglycerides and total cholesterol levels decreased (p  0.05).  None of the women developed thromboembolism.  The Norplant continuation rate was 89.7% at 1 year, 78% at 2 years, 70% at 3 years, 61% at 4 years, and 42.4% at 5 years.  The leading reason for implant removal was menstrual problems (108).  The implants were removed during one sitting without x-ray or ultrasound identification in all 166 women who stopped using Norplant before 5 years and the 16 women who stopped using it at the end of 5 years.  78% of women who discontinued Norplant to become pregnant were pregnant within one year following removal.  All their infants were normal.  These findings suggest that Norplant is a safe, effective, and acceptable contraceptive method and that the family planning program should introduce Norplant to its contraceptive mix.
