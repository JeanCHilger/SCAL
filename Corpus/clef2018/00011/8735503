Management of suspected acute venous thromboembolism in a general and maternity hospital. A retrospective study of the management of patients with suspected acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in a general and maternity hospital was conducted over a two month period in 1992. Ninety six patients with suspected DVT/PTE were identified, of whom only two were pregnant. Forty four patients had suspected DVT and confirmatory investigations were performed in 84%. The most common risk factor for DVT was intra-venous drug (IVD) use. Unfractionated heparin was prescribed to all patients except one with acute DVT at an average daily dose of 25,000 iu. In patients receiving heparin, 68% had measurements of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio and on 38% of occasions the result was subtherapeutic. Complications of heparin therapy were infrequent. Fifty two patients had suspected PTE and 50 underwent ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scanning. No patient underwent pulmonary angiography. The management of patients with normal, low and high probability V/Q scans was in keeping with the guidelines, but only 8% [corrected] of patients with an intermediate V/Q scan result had further investigations and 33% received heparin. This study revealed suboptimal anticoagulation of patients with acute DVT and scope for improvement in the management of patients with an intermediate V/Q scan result.
