Regulation of human placental fetal vessel tone: role of nitric oxide. Factors affecting fetal vessel resistance have been studied in vitro in bilaterally perfused lobules of human placentae. Potent and efficacious constrictors in this preparation (in order of potency) include endothelin-1 > the thromboxane mimetic U46619 > endothelin-3 > prostaglandin F2 alpha. Inhibitors of eicosanoid synthesis did not affect fetal vessel basal perfusion pressure, nor did they potentiate the effects of the vasoconstrictor U46619. In contrast, the nitric oxide inhibitors N omega-nitro-L-arginine (NOLA), haemoglobin and methylene blue all increased fetal vessel basal perfusion pressure and also increased U46619-induced constriction. Similarly, NOLA markedly potentiated the constrictor effects of endothelin-1, angiotensin II, 5-hydroxytryptamine and bradykinin. These studies therefore provide evidence that NO is important in the maintenance of low basal fetal vessel impedance and also reduces the effects of a number of vasoconstrictor autacoids. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity of human placental homogenates has been measured and shown to be mainly calcium-dependent. Human placental NOS activity was not affected by labour state but was reduced in pre-eclampsia. No evidence was found that in pre-eclampsia raised concentrations of the endogenous NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine were responsible for the reduced placental NOS activity. Hence, these studies provide evidence that NO is an important endogenous dilator of the fetal vessels of the human placenta and that reduced NOS activity could contribute to the pathogenesis and/or effects of pre-eclampsia.
