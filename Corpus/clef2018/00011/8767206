Reversible cerebral MRI findings in acute microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. A case of acute microangiopathic hemolytic anemia in a 29-year-old primiparous patient is presented. Following an unsuspicuous pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery, the patient developed upper abdominal symptoms and transient psychopathologic abnormalities 2 days after delivery. Because of a series of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and respiratory distress she was admitted to the Neuro ICU. Focal neurological symptoms were absent, and CSF analysis was normal. Laboratory findings indicated hemolytic anemia with fragmented erythrocytes in smear specimens, thrombocytopenia, reticulocytosis, marked elevation of liver and pancreatic enzymes, and microhematuria. T2-weighted MR scans of the brain discluded multiple ischemic lesions of the cerebral white and gray matter, caudate nucleus and pons, displaying a hemodynamic pattern. Specific treatment included administration of corticosteroids, repeated plasmapheresis with substitution by fresh frozen plasma and antithrombin III. A control MR performed on the 3rd day of treatment demonstrated the absence of nearly all abnormal findings previously obtained. During a 3-week clinical course the patient showed full recovery, including normalization of hematologic and neuroradiologic findings. This case demonstrates ischemic cerebral lesions in acute microangiopathic hemolytic anemia to be potentially reversible if specific treatment is provided.
