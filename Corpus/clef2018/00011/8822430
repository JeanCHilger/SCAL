Laparoscopic oophoropexy for recurrent adnexal torsion. Torsion of the adnexa has traditionally been treated by adnexectomy because of the fear of emboli departing from thrombosed ovarian veins. Several recent reports have described successful conservative management with unwinding of the twisted adnexa. As the trend toward conservative management progresses, the incidence of recurrent adnexal torsion may increase. We present a case of a 33 year old gravida 3, para 2 Caucasian female who presented at 7 weeks gestation complaining of symptoms similar to those experienced during an episode of right ovarian torsion treated by laparoscopic unwinding 6 years earlier. Colour Doppler sonography revealed absent flow in the right adnexa. The twisted right adnexa containing the presumed corpus luteum of pregnancy was laparoscopically unwound. Using an extracorporeal suturing technique, a laparoscopic oophoropexy was performed to prevent any further rotatory movement. This appears to be the first reported case of laparoscopic oophoropexy for a recurrent ovarian torsion we encourage the use of this simple, minimally invasive procedure in cases of recurrent adnexal torsion.
