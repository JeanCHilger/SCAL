Prenatal diagnosis of an extensive haemangioma of the fetal leg: a case report. Extensive haemangioma with platelet consumption (Kasabach-Merritt syndrome) is rare. The lesion is usually a single cutaneous cavernous haemangioma similar to that found in our patient. Multiple superficial strawberry naevi were also seen all over the rest of the body. This condition was diagnosed antenatally in this patient with the use of colour Doppler. There is one recent report where the thrombocytopaenia was diagnosed by cordocentesis. Unfortunately the baby developed heart failure with intractable coagulopathy and died 2 days later.
