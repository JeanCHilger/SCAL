Portal vein thrombosis concomitant with thrombophilia during pregnancy. The experience with portal vein thrombosis, an uncommon cause of portal hypertension complicating pregnancy is currently too brief to form definite conclusions regarding the management. The coexistence of the manifestations of portal hypertension as hypersplenism and esophageal varices together with Protein C and S deficiencies during pregnancy presents a real dilemma for diagnosis and management. We report the clinical follow-up of a 24-year-old woman in whom Protein C was detected in her two subsequent pregnancies besides portal vein thrombosis and discuss the changing levels of these proteins during pregnancy.
