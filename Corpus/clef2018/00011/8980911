Isolation and cultivation of endothelial cells derived from human placenta. Endothelial cells were isolated from human full-term placenta by perfusion with trypsin solution via the umbilical cord vein. Human placental endothelial cells (HPEC) were successfully grown and kept in culture. HPEC exhibited endothelial characteristics as judged by morphology of confluent monolayers, staining with low density lipoprotein, binding of Ulex europaeus I lectin, and immunostaining against von Willebrand factor, alpha-thrombomodulin, VE-cadherin and a series of integrins. Different growth requirements and particular morphological characteristics indicated the different vascular origin of HUVEC and HPEC.
