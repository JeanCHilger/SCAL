Contribution of Doppler color ultrasonography to the screening and surveillance of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Color and power Doppler producing ovarian vascular mapping allows to realize a new functional approach of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHS) local vascular factors (ovarian angiogenesis, increase in cappillary permeability) released by hCG injection (LH effect) have in fact an important part in this syndrome. Vaginal Doppler sonography allows: -before induction, to predict potential risk of hyperstimulation: polycystic ovaries, spontaneous stromal hypervascularization
