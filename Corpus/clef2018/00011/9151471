Hydrops fetalis due to placental chorioangioma: report of one case. Chorioangioma is the most common tumor of the placenta. However, a large one complicated with hydrops fetalis is rare. We report a patient who had hydrops fetalis associated with placental chorioangioma. The clinical manifestations included generalized edema, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypoproteinemia and hepatosplenomegaly. The hospital course was complicated with acute renal failure and repeated pneumonia. The patient died on the 54th day of life due to persistent lung atelectasis and hypovolemic shock. The pathophysiology and management of the complications of hydrops fetalis with chorioangioma are discussed.
