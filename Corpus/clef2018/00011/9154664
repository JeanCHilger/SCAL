Early gestational hemolytic uremic syndrome: case report and review of literature. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a rare condition which most frequently follows gastrointestinal or respiratory infection episodes in young children, but it can also occur in other settings such as the postpartum period and during use of drugs such as oral contraconceptives, immunosuppressors, and antineoplastics. In early pregnancy, however, its frequency is thought to be very low. The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman who developed HUS early in her first pregnancy. She had persistent aqueous diarrhea from the beginning of the pregnancy. At the 21st week she developed hypertension which in 2 weeks was followed by seizures, oliguria, and acute pulmonary edema despite intensive medical efforts to control her blood pressure. Surgical intervention for fetal delivery was performed. The patient was initially kept on continuous hemodialysis (CVVHD) followed by an alternate-day conventional hemodialysis schedule. A peripheral blood analysis showed a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia blood coagulation tests were completely normal. A brain CT scan and an abdominal MRI showed no major abnormalities. HUS was confirmed by a percutaneal kidney biopsy, performed at the 21st day of anuria. Techniques for identification of verotoxin-producing E. coli were not available. Renal function did not recover and the patient has been undergoing regular maintenance hemodialysis for a year.
