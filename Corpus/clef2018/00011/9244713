Massive pulmonary embolism during the third trimester of pregnancy: effectiveness of thrombolytic treatment with alteplase. The authors report on a 33-year old woman with massive, life-threatening pulmonary embolism at the third trimester of pregnancy. The diagnosis was rapidly accomplished in the Emergency Department by two dimensional-Doppler echocardiography that showed signs of pulmonary hypertension as well as a large, floating thromboembolus in the right atrium. As the hemodynamic deterioration persisted after treatment with iv heparin, the patient received alteplase 50 mg as a bolus over 5 minutes. About 30 minutes later, a further 50 mg infusion of alteplase was given over 60 minutes because clinical conditions were progressively worsening. After an alteplase dose of 75 mg, the woman showed a definite improvement in clinical-hemodynamic status and echocardiography documented a reduction of right ventricular overload and atrial clot disappearance. Two hours later the patient was submitted to cesarean section, because of the onset of uterine contractions, and delivered a vital baby. The occurrence of uterine bleeding was antagonized by the infusion of fresh-frozen plasma and a moderate anemia was subsequently treated with iron preparations. The mother and her baby were discharged on 16th day in fairly good general conditions. The authors emphasize the leading role of early echocardiography in the clinical decision making and the lifesaving potential of full dose thrombolytic therapy without serious adverse effects.
