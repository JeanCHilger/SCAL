Postpartum ultrasonographic diagnosis of inferior vena cava thrombus associated with ovarian vein thrombosis. Postoperative ultrasonographic assessment as a result of unremitting fever after cesarean section depicted a large pedunculated thrombus within the inferior vena cava at the level of the right renal vein. Subsequent imaging studies revealed that this thrombus was the distal extension of right ovarian vein thrombosis into the inferior vena cava.
