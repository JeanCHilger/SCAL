Colour Doppler changes and thromboxane production after ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist. The objective of this study was to evaluate the Doppler flow variations which occur following the use of different protocols of ovarian stimulation in an IVF programme, and to investigate the thromboxane production by cultured endometrial cells and its influence on embryo implantation. A total of 60 patients underwent three different ovarian stimulation protocols: long gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a), short GnRH-a and no GnRH-a. Transvaginal ultrasonography and colour Doppler analysis were performed before and during the treatment. On the day that the Doppler examination took place, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, plasma oestradiol and thromboxane concentrations were assayed. On the day of oocyte retrieval, endometrial cells were collected and cultured, and their thromboxane production evaluated. No significant differences in hormonal, ultrasonographic or Doppler parameters were observed between the three groups. Ten out of 56 patients who had a successful embryo transfer became pregnant. In the group of pregnant women the pulsatility index values of both uterine and spiral arteries was lower than in non-pregnant patients, and was associated with significantly lower thromboxane concentrations from cultured endometrial cells. It is concluded that thromboxane plays a role in embryo implantation, and that Doppler flow analysis of uterine and spiral arteries in infertile patients may be important in the management of ovarian stimulation.
