Fetal endocardial fibroelastosis: ultrasonographic findings in two cases. EFE is a rare cardiac disorder with poor prognosis and uncertain cause. Primary and secondary forms have been described. Most authors consider that all EFE is secondary--a reactive process set off in the endocardium by stress on the myocardium. We report two cases representing the primary dilated form and the secondary contracted form. The dilated form was associated with intracavitary thrombus of the left ventricle. In both cases, an unusual presence of subendocardial calcifications was noted. The ultrasonographic findings are discussed.
