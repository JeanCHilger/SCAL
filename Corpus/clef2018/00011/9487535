Intra- and early postpartum ultrasonography: a review. Part I. The objective of this article is to review current literature pertaining to intra- and early postpartum sonography. All the manuscripts published in the English language regarding this topic were selected from a MEDLINE search from 1966 through August 1997. Additional sources were identified through cross-referencing. Currently, intra- and early postpartum sonography may be performed for either maternal or fetal indications. Maternal indications include cervical assessment in preterm labor/rupture of membranes, assessment of the lower uterine segment, size and position of uterine fibroids, guided-placement of central venous or pulmonary artery catheters, detection of intraoperative venous air embolism, deep venous thrombosis, assist management of the third-stage of labor, postpartum hemorrhage or febrile morbidity. Fetal indications include an anatomical survey in patients presenting without prenatal care, verification of fetal presentation, estimated fetal weight, assessment of the breech-presenting fetus, external cephalic version, management of delivery of the second-twin, and internal podalic version. Doppler flow velocimetry is a useful tool in depicting both maternal and fetal intrapartum physiologic changes. We conclude that intra- and early postpartum sonography is an established versatile diagnostic and interventional-guiding modality for many obstetric conditions and should be readily available on labor and delivery suites.
