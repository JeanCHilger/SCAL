Pulmonary embolus in pregnant patients: survey of ventilation-perfusion imaging policies and practices. To assess the policies and practices of nuclear medicine facilities as regards ventilation-perfusion (V-P) imaging in pregnant patients suspected of having pulmonary embolus.Surveys were mailed to physician-directors of 1,000 randomly selected facilities at which nuclear imaging studies are performed. Information gathered included use of V-P imaging in pregnant patients, written policies, informed consent procedures, and modifications of standard protocols.Of the 1,000 surveys mailed, 327 (33%) completed surveys were returned. Of these 327 respondents, 220 (67%) reported that they perform V-P imaging in pregnant patients suspected of having pulmonary embolus. Of these 220 respondents, 115 (52%) routinely obtain informed consent, and 170 (77%) modify their standard V-P imaging protocol for pregnant patients. The most common modification (135 [79%] of 170 respondents) was reduction of the perfusion agent dose. Reported practice patterns for written policies, informed consent, and modifications did not show statistically significant trends among respondents in varying practice settings or geographic locations.Most respondents perform V-P imaging in pregnant patients suspected of having pulmonary embolus, with considerable variability in their policies and practices.
