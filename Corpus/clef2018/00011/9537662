Treatment of acute superior sagittal sinus thrombosis by t-PA infusion via venography--direct thrombolytic therapy in the acute phase. Dural sinus thrombosis is a relatively rare syndrome, often with a very poor prognosis. Systemic anticoagulant therapy has produced poor results therefore rapid recanalization of the affected vessels is essential. The recent advancements in angiographic technique and catheter technology enable us to perform direct selective venography.We observed a case of acute superior sagittal sinus thrombosis in a pregnant woman. The patient's consciousness level and motor function gradually deteriorated. Direct thrombolysis was performed via venography.The patient was treated successfully by thrombolysis with infusion of t-PA via selective venography within 2 days of rapid clinical deterioration and sustained a dramatic improvement of her neurological deficits.Direct thrombolysis via selective venography is considered a safe and useful treatment for dural sinus thrombosis in the acute phase.
