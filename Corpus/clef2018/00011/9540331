Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis associated with primary antiphospholipid syndrome--case report. A 36-year-old female with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss experienced sudden onset of disturbance in consciousness, with right hemiparesis and total aphasia. Computed tomography revealed a massive hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe, and angiography showed occlusion of the anterior two-thirds of the superior sagittal sinus. Laboratory investigations detected the presence of lupus anticoagulant, elevation of the anticardiolipin beta 2-glycoprotein I complex antibody level, and a decreased protein S activity level. There were no underlying conditions, such as connective tissue disorders, malignancies, infectious diseases, and drug-induced disorders, so the diagnosis was primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome should be considered in the evaluation of patients with "idiopathic" or "primary" sinus and cerebral venous thrombosis.
