Axillary vein thrombosis during pregnancy in association with a lupus anticoagulant. A 42-year-old multiparous pregnant woman presented with swelling and pain of the left arm at 34 weeks gestation. She had no discoloration of her arm nor a loss of radial pulse. Duplex scanning demonstrated a thrombosis in the axillary vein. She was found to have a positive circulating lupus anticoagulant. Intravenous heparin was administered and resulted in resolution of discomfort and swelling on day four of therapy. The patient was maintained on therapeutic doses of subcutaneous heparin until vaginal delivery at 39 weeks. Prenatal course was complicated by a resolving infection believed to be due to cat-scratch disease which produced a five centimeter cystic lesion in the left axillae which was removed in the first trimester. Titers for cat-scratch disease were positive for mother and infant at delivery but infant titers were negative at six weeks. Axillary vein thrombosis in pregnancy can be complicated by pulmonary embolism and should be treated by heparin.
