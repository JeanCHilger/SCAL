Massive pulmonary embolism in late pregnancy. To describe the management problems presented by a case of acute massive pulmonary embolism in a labouring woman.A case of massive pulmonary embolism is described in a woman who presented in early labour at thirty-eight weeks gestation. Immediate management involved the administration of oxygen and intravenous heparin, and transfer to the regional cardiothoracic centre. Pulmonary angiography confirmed the diagnosis of massive pulmonary embolism, but attempts at percutaneous catheter disruption of the clot were of only temporary benefit. The patient subsequently underwent Caesarean section under general anaesthesia, followed minutes later (because of an abrupt deterioration in her condition) by surgical pulmonary embolectomy. The outcome was successful for both mother and child.In cases of acute massive pulmonary embolism presenting in late pregnancy and in labour, the risks and benefits of surgical embolectomy, pharmacological thrombolysis, or attempts at mechanical clot disruption have to be weighed on an individual basis. Management at the referral centre was facilitated by having cardiothoracic and obstetric facilities on the same site.
