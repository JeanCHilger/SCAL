Lipoma of the corpus callosum in a newborn infant: misinterpretation of cranial ultrasound by coincidence with thrombocytopenia. Among the very rare intracerebral lipomas, those of the corpus callosum are the most frequent. Due to the advanced technology and the frequent use of ultrasonography these lesions are diagnosed more and more often. A female neonate was admitted to our hospital because of a progressive thrombocytopenia. Pregnancy was complicated by an autoimmune thrombocytopenia of the mother. While there were no remarkable findings on clinical presentation, a sonogram of the brain revealed an area of increased echogenicity in the midline which was interpreted as an intracerebral hemorrhage. In absence of any respective clinical signs a magnet-resonance-tomography of the brain was performed leading to the hypothesis of a lipoma of the corpus callosum (LCC) that could be verified by a densitometry in a cranial computer tomography (CT). Obviously, the initially performed sonogram was misinterpreted as an intracerebral hemorrhage due to the coincidence with the thrombocytopenia. At last the discrepancy of clinical and ultrasonographical findings led to the diagnosis by magnet-resonance-tomography and CT scan. Knowledge of the typical sonographic appearance of an LCC may be helpful for the differential diagnosis of this rare lesion even in fetal ultrasound.
