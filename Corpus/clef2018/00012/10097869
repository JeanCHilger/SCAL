Bilobar liver hematoma and spontaneous rupture after cesarean section. A 25-year-old woman delivered a healthy baby in the 34th week of gestation by caesarean section due to placental abruption and fetal bradycardia. On the following day she developed dyspnea, tachycardia, hypotension and rising serum transaminase levels. After exclusion of a pulmonary embolism, the abdominal CT scan and cavography revealed a subcapsular hematoma of the entire dorsal liver surface and compression of the retrohepatic vena cava. During laparotomy a spontaneous rupture of the liver capsule with intraperitoneal hemorrhage was found. The dorsal liver was decapsulated and the subcapsular hematoma completely removed. The postoperative course was uneventful.
