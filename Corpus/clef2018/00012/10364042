Primary hepatic lymphoma associated with primary biliary cirrhosis. We report a case of primary hepatic lymphoma in a 55-yr-old female patient with primary biliary cirrhosis and Sj√∂gren's syndrome. On July 1994, a tumor measuring 11 mm in diameter was detected in the right lobe of the liver by abdominal ultrasonography. A needle biopsy specimen showed the lesion to contain small- and medium-sized lymphoid cells without obvious atypia, and a provisional diagnosis of pseudolymphoma was made. About 2 yr later, the tumor increased to 15 mm in diameter, necessitating a second needle biopsy. Histological and genetic examinations confirmed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of diffuse, mixed small and large cell, B-cell type. However, the size of the tumor remained almost stable (16 mm in diameter) over a period of 7 months after diagnosis, without any treatment for lymphoma, indicating a low grade malignancy. We document hepatic lymphoma as an additional complication of primary biliary cirrhosis.
