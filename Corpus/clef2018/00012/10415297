Recanalization of a portal-vein thrombosis and partial resolution of biliary cirrhosis following cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis in an infant. Cholelithiasis in infants and children is unusual and is reputedly associated with underlying hemolytic disorders, total parenteral nutrition, ileal disease, and congenital anomalies of the biliary tree. We report a case of cholecystitis with pigmented stones in a 3-month-old infant associated with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and biliary cirrhosis without the above-mentioned causes. Recanalization of the PV and partial resolution of the cirrhosis was observed following cholecystectomy. To our knowledge, cholelithiasis associated with PVT and cirrhosis in an infant has not been reported in the literature.
