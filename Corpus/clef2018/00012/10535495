Aged Budd-Chiari syndrome attributed to chronic deep venous thrombosis with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare disease, but there are many known causes. Recent studies showed that it can be an acquired lesion resulting from thrombosis in some elderly patients. We report a 74-year-old man with Budd-Chiari syndrome attributed to chronic deep venous thrombosis and alcoholic liver cirrhosis. When he was aged 45 years, stasis ulcers of the lower extremities appeared. Cerebral infarction and left hemiparesis occurred at age 71. Ultrasonography, venacavography, and three-dimensional-magnetic resonance imaging on admission demonstrated total obstruction of the inferior vena cava with several massive thrombi and developed collateral vessels. Although the etiology of the thrombosis remained obscure, we made some speculative assumptions that chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (which is frequently observed in cirrhosis) or hereditary coagulopathy could be involved, from his familial history of thrombotic phenomena and a severe deficiency of clotting inhibitors. Despite the high mortality of untreated Budd-Chiari syndrome reported in previous studies, this patient had been alive for about 30 years from the suspected onset.
