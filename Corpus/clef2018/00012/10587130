Correlation between the blood supply and grade of malignancy of hepatocellular nodules associated with liver cirrhosis: evaluation by CT during intraarterial injection of contrast medium. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the intranodular blood supply revealed by CT during intraarterial injection of contrast medium, mainly using helical CT, and the grade of malignancy of hepatocellular nodules associated with liver cirrhosis as classified by the International Working Party of the World Congress of Gastroenterology.We studied 201 histologically proven nodules (101 resected and 100 biopsied nodules), including 47 low-grade dysplastic nodules (low-DNs), 56 high-grade dysplastic nodules (high-DNs), 24 well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (wd-HCCs), and 74 moderately or poorly differentiated HCCs (mp-HCCs), in 139 cirrhotic patients. Findings on CT during arterial portography (n = 201) and CT during hepatic arteriography (n = 74) were reviewed and compared with the histologic diagnosis.CT findings were classified into four types relative to the surrounding liver: type A (isodense), type B (slightly hypodense), type C (partially hypodense), and type D (markedly hypodense) on CT during arterial portography and type I (isodense), type II (hypodense), type III (partially hyperdense), and type IV (hyperdense) on CT during hepatic arteriography. On CT during arterial portography, the distributions of each type were low-DN (n = 47 [A, n = 36 B, n = 8Findings on CT during arterial portography and CT during hepatic arteriography correlated positively with histologic grading when overlap in appearance between dysplastic nodules and HCCs occurred. The concept revealed in this study can apply to diagnoses made on the basis of Doppler sonography, dynamic CT, and MR imaging.
