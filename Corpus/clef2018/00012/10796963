Superior vena cava thrombosis after in vitro fertilization: case report and review of the literature. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a rare complication of fertility medication. A 33 year old female with OHSS with thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, and superior vein cava underwent in vitro fertilization following stimulation with a GnRH analog with successful implantation. The patient developed abdominal distention and dyspnea, with persistent symptoms that resulted in a 20 lb weight loss. As pregnancy progressed, edema, pain, and tingling sensations developed by the ninth week at which time a CT scan confirmed thrombus with the right internal jugular and subclavian vein and a free floating tip in the superior vena cava. Following treatment with intravenous heparin therapy and subcutaneous low-molecular weight heparin until delivery her symptoms improved. While optimal treatment remains unclear, treatment strategies remain conservative. Identifying the risk factors that lead to the development of OHSS including the identification of those patients at risk for developing OHSS, more extensive investigation of potential underlying coagulopathy in severe or recurrent cases, and consideration of prophylactic subcutaneous heparin or IV albumin supplementation, will facilitate prevention in the high risk population.
