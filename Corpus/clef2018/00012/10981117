Hypertension in pregnancy: new recommendations for management. Hypertension in pregnancy is a frequent complication that has substantial adverse perinatal outcomes. Hypertension may be preexisting (chronic) essential or secondary hypertension a second entity is pregnancy induced (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia). Recent advances have identified newer markers for pregnancy hypertension: several potential candidate genes may explain the apparent family inheritance of preeclampsia, and some thrombophilic markers have been associated with the condition. Management options for mild to moderate hypertension include a short hospital stay to exclude ongoing severe hypertension and to ascertain fetal well-being. Outpatient care with appropriate maternal and fetal surveillance, including umbilical artery doppler velocimetry, is recommended for better perinatal outcomes. Acute care for severe hypertension includes the use of magnesium sulfate to prevent eclampsia and antihypertensive medication. Expeditious delivery is recommended when the maternal or fetal states cannot be stabilized. Follow-up after delivery allows the uncovering of any other coexisting hypertensive or cardiovascular disorder.
