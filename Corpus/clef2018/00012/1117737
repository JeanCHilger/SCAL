Extracorporeal perfusion for acute respiratory failure: recent experience with the spiral coil membrane lung. Selection criteria, clinical data, and physiological measurements obtained during five extracorporeal membrane lung perfusions for acute respiratory insufficiency are presented. Four patients died and 1 survived. A new technique of femoral artery cannulation to allow aortic arch perfusion is described. When properly monitored, this route provides improved oxygen delivery to the brain during venoarterial (VA) perfusion. The importance of monitoring the equivalent of carotid artery Po2 during VA perfusion is emphasized. Recognition of the effects of high cardiac output in limiting the quality of extracorporeal perfusion, plus the use of hypothermia to reduce output, are stressed. We have confirmed that perfusion can be accomplished with small quantities of heparin, so that bleeding is reduced, but thrombocytopenia and occasional hemorrhage continue to be persistent problems.
