Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: clinicopathological profile. To evaluate clinicopathological spectrum of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) METHODOLOGY: Total 210 patients with chronic liver disease were evaluated. Detailed history has taken with clinical examination, laboratory investigations, radiological findings and liver biopsy whenever possible.From 210 patients of chronic liver disease, 13 (6.19%) were diagnosed to have NASH (M:F = 9:4, age range 37-72 years, mean age 55.4 +/- 9 years). Of 13 patients, four were referred for asymptomatic enzyme elevation, nine had right hypochondriac pain. Risk factors were diabetes in four cases, obesity four, steroid treatment two and hyperlipidemia in three cases. Laboratory investigations showed abnormal liver enzymes in all the cases. Ultrasonography and CT scan was helpful in predicting fatty liver. Liver biopsy showed steatosis with inflammation in all, fibrosis in two and cirrhosis in one patient.NASH is an important form of chronic liver disease, and is characterised by hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes. It is essential to diagnose this condition due to its progression to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in some patients.
