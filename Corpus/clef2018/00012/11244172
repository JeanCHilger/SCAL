Acute changes in cerebral blood flow and metabolism during portasystemic shunting. This report describes the instantaneous changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), determined by intravascular ultrasound and Doppler, in a patient with cirrhosis undergoing placement of a transjugular intrahepatic stent-shunt for uncontrolled variceal bleeding. Acute changes in CBF were observed during and after portasystemic shunting, which culminated in cerebral edema and cerebral herniation.
