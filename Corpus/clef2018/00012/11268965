Percutaneous ethanol injection in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis. In this study we discuss and evaluate the use of percutaneous ethanol injection for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis.Percutaneous ethanol injection was performed under ultrasound guidance, with multiple sessions at an outpatient department or with "single-session" technique under general anesthesia, according to the size and number of the lesions.In our patients with Child A (293), B (149), or C (20) cirrhosis and single hepatocellular carcinoma 5 cm or smaller, the 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 98, 79 and 47%, 93, 63 and 29%, and 64, 12 and 0%, respectively. In our 108 patients with larger hepatocellular carcinoma, 1- and 3-year survival rates were: 72 and 57% in single, encapsulated tumors, 73 and 42% in single infiltrating or multiple encapsulated tumors, and 46 and 0% in symptomatic or with advanced portal thrombosis tumors.Percutaneous ethanol injection proved to be a safe, effective, repeatable, easy and low-cost therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Survival after percutaneous ethanol injection was comparable to that after surgical resection, probably because of a balancing between greater complete ablation rate of surgery versus absence of early mortality and liver damage of percutaneous ethanol injection. On the basis of the percutaneous ethanol injection rationale, other ablation techniques were proposed using radiofrequency, laser or acetic acid. Their initial results are promising.
