Hemangioma-like lesions in chronic liver disease: diagnostic evaluation in patients. To quantify the risk of misdiagnosis of focal hepatic lesions manifesting at ultrasonography (US) as typical hemangiomas in a population at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to identify the most effective approach to their diagnostic evaluation.A total of 1,982 patients with newly diagnosed cirrhosis underwent US and serum alpha-fetoprotein determinations for early detection of HCC. Focal lesions with typical features of hemangioma were evaluated with confirmatory findings of contrast material-enhanced dynamic or spiral computed tomography (CT) and/or single photon emission CT with technetium 99m-labeled red blood cells and, in the absence of confirmatory imaging findings, US-guided fine-needle biopsy. Patients whose initial US scan depicted no lesions or hemangiomas were enrolled in a US follow-up program. All hemangioma-like lesions detected during follow-up were evaluated, or biopsy was performed.US depicted hemangioma-like lesions in 44 of 1,982 patients: 22 hemangiomas and 22 HCCs. Hemangioma-like lesions detected during follow-up in 1,648 patients were HCCs (n = 22) or dysplastic nodules (n = 4). Only 85 (22%) of 383 patients with HCC had alpha-fetoprotein levels suggestive of the diagnosis. The probability of a diagnosis of HCC (or preneoplastic lesion) is 100% for hemangioma-like lesions depicted on subsequent US scans.If initial US examination of a cirrhotic liver depicts a hemangioma, confirmatory findings of imaging studies are necessary since 50% of hemangiomas in this study were hyperechogenic HCCs. US-guided biopsy can be safely performed, and its findings can be used to confirm the diagnosis.
