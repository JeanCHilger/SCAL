Ultrasonography-guided percutaneous alcohol injection for hepatocellular carcinoma in the cirrhotic patient. The present study, performed in the Department of Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology of Policlinico of Modena, shows the results of the treatment with percutaneous ethanol injection of cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In the period between June 1991-May 1998, 37 nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma, in 26 cirrhotic patients, were treated with ethanol injection under the ecographic guidance the total number of sessions was 179. Ten lesions were recurrences (local or distant) in patients already treated. These patients were excluded from surgical treatment because of the high age, the high surgical risk or patient's choice. "Therapeutic success", defined as radiologic (TC or RM) demonstration of complete necrosis at the end of the first cycle of treatment, was achieved in 22/27 nodules after the first treatment (81.5%). Therapeutic success of the recurrence (second treatment) was achieved in 7/10 nodules (70%). In treated patients, survival probability (obtained with Kaplan Meier method) was 84.5%, 73.0%, 50.0%, 38.5%, 26.9%, respectively at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year. After a total number of 179 sessions, there were no relevant complications. The results obtained in our experience prove the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic technique in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
