Eight multicentric hepatocellular carcinomas occurring in the same segment of the liver. We present a rare case of eight multicentric hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) occurring in the same segment of the liver. In a 66-year-old Japanese man, multiple liver tumors were detected during follow-up of chronic hepatitis C infection, and he was admitted to our hospital in 1995. Ultrasonography (US) showed eight tumors, each measuring between 10 and 15 mm in diameter, in the right lobe, and a 10-mm tumor in the left lobe. Angio-ultrasonography (US) showed no enhancement of the tumors, and multicentric occurrence was suspected. Portal angio-US showed eight tumors in the right lobe located in the anterior segment. Accordingly, anterior segmentectomy and partial resection of the S3 subsegment were performed, in December, 1995. On histological examination, all eight tumors in the anterior segment and the tumor in the S3 subsegment were well differentiated HCC. The liver parenchyma showed cirrhosis. The grade and stage of hepatitis did not differ between the anterior segment and the S3 subsegment, but irregular regeneration of hepatocytes was more prominent in the anterior segment. The multicentric occurrence of HCCs in the anterior segment may be related to the more severe damage caused by chronic hepatitis in the anterior segment than in the left lobe of the liver.
