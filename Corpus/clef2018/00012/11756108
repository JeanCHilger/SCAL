Preliminary results of a new expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stent-graft for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedures. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and the safety of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) with a new expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stent and the influence of the covering on occlusion rate.Twenty cirrhotic patients (57 +/- 11 years old) admitted with a history of esophageal variceal bleeding (n = 11), refractory ascites (n = 5), or both (n = 4) were included. Five of the patients were treated for TIPS revision, and 15 as de novo TIPS placements. The endoprostheses used were composed of a 2-cm noncovered nitinol stent and a 4- to 8-cm expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene graft covering, and were placed from the portal vein to the ostium of the hepatic vein. Patients underwent Doppler sonography at discharge and again at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months and underwent venography with portosystemic pressure gradient measurement at 6 months and whenever necessary.At the time of this writing, complications included three TIPS restenoses and one recurrent ascites successfully treated by balloon dilation, two cases of segmentary liver ischemia, and one patient with encephalopathy that required shunt reduction. After TIPS placement, the portosystemic pressure gradient dropped from 18 +/- 5 to 5 +/- 4 mm Hg. Primary and secondary patency rates were 80% and 100%, respectively, at 387 days.These results clearly show the feasibility of TIPS placement with the Gore TIPS endoprosthesis stent-graft and its improved patency compared with results in the literature for bare stents. These preliminary results must be certified further with randomized comparative trials between covered and noncovered TIPS stents.
