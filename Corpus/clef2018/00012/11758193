Diagnosis and surgical treatment of peripheral intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. To summarize the experience in diagnosis and surgical treatment of peripheral intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (PICC).Clinicopathological features, surgical treatment and prognosis of 20 patients with PICC treated in our hospital from 1970 to 1999 were retrospectively analyzed.The patients lacked typical clinical manifestations and some had a history of hepatitis B (35%), cirrhosis (45%), and elevation of serum alpha-fetaprotein (AFP) (25%). The diagnostic rates of ultrasound examination (BUS), CT, MRI and emission computerized tomography (ECT) were 90% (18/20), 94% (17/18), 100% (3/3) and 100% (4/4), respectively. However, the liver lesions detected by these methods needed to be differentiated from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), metastatic neoplasm and liver cyst, etc. In all the patients, the resection rate was 60% (12/20) and postoperative overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 55% (11/20), 35% (7/12) and 20% (4/20), respectively. The liver resection rates were 83% (11/12), 58% (7/12) and 33% (4/12), respectively. Of the 4 patients who had survived for more than 5 years, 3 had a small liver carcinoma with a diameter less than or equal to 3 cm and one had large nodular liver carcinoma with intact capsule. After operation, all the patients received selective hepatic artery perfusion chemotherapy.PICC patients lack specific serum tumor marker can achieve good survival after early detection and curative resection with adjuvant therapies.
