Post-infantile giant cell hepatitis associated with autoimmune hepatitis and polyarteritis nodosa. We report the case of a patient with corticosteroid-responsive giant cell hepatitis associated with typical manifestations and changes of polyarteritis nodosa from the kidney and central nervous system. Initially, the patient presented with transient right hemiparesis, followed by spontaneous remission without any abnormalities on computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid examination. A few months later he was admitted to our clinic because of icterus, peripheral oedema and abdominal distension. He was found to have clinical signs of active cirrhosis. Serological tests for hepatitis B, C and HIV virus were negative. Serum ceruloplasmin. a1-AT and ferritin levels were within normal limits. Antinuclear antibodies were positive (1: 160). Liver biopsy showed micronodular cirrhosis with many eosinophils in the portal tracts and giant hepatocytes with multiple nucleoli in the lobule. Fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for autoimmune hepatitis, he was started on treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine, resulting in both clinical and biochemical responses. Four years later he presented with severe pain at the right costovertebral angle. Ultrasonography revealed a haematoma at the right kidney, and selective angiography of the abdominal aorta, renal arteries and hepatic artery documented microaneurysms in both kidney and liver arteries. Because of severe haemorrhage, right nephrectomy was performed. Histology of kidney specimen showed characteristic lesions of polyarteritis nodosa. Several months later, while on treatment with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide, the patient experienced a fatal episode of brain haemorrhage. An association between autoimmune hepatitis, polyarteritis nodosa and postinfantile giant cell hepatitis has not been reported previously.
