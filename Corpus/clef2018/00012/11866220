Doppler in hepatic cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis. Doppler ultrasound and color Doppler are being used routinely in the study of vascular structures of the abdomen, and more particularly the liver. Reports published in the literature to date have shown that all patients with hepatic cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis should be studied in the first stage of their illness and in follow-up by using Doppler techniques. With new ultrasound software and the latest generation of contrast agents, we can obtain a better and more complete vascular study of the liver, which previously could be achieved only with triple-phase CT. Therefore, hepatic cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis, as well as their vascular complications, can be followed up more closely. The vascular complications include flow alterations in the hepatic artery and veins, portal hypertension, portal vein thrombosis, portosystemic shunts, and vascularization associated with liver tumors.
