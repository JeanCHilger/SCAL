Cholelithiasis in a child--an unusual presentation of Wilson's disease. A nine year old mentally retarded girl with moderate splenomegaly and ascites presented with chronic cholelithiasis. The presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and low serum ceruloplasmin level confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Cirrhosis of liver and recurrent episodes of hemolysis--these two common complications of Wilson's disease make an ideal setting for gall stone formation. Only three such cases have been reported worldwide and ours is the first case report from India. We suggest that cholelithiasis and splenomegaly in a child without evidence of congenital hemolytic disease should be taken as a suspect of Wilson's disease.
