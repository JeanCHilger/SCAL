Diagnosis of gastroesophageal varices and portal collateral venous abnormalities by endosonography in cirrhotic patients. The role of endosonography (EUS) in the management of portal hypertension is not well defined. We aimed to study the use of a new generation video-echo endoscope in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal varices (GEV) and extraluminal venous abnormalities in cirrhotic patients.Cirrhotic patients were studied by echo endoscopy to assess esophageal varices endoscopically, and gastric varices and extraluminal venous abnormalities sonographically. The results were compared with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) examination. Dyspeptic patients served as controls.A total of 52 cirrhotic and 166 dyspeptic patients were studied. EUS identified esophageal varices (EV) endoscopically in 28 patients (53.8 %), which showed a good correlation with EGD findings (r = 0.855, P < 0.001). The red color sign and portal hypertensive gastropathy were diagnosed in six and seven patients, respectively, by both methods. EUS detected gastric varices sonographically in 16 patients (30.8 %), compared with detection in nine patients by EGD. Extraluminal venous abnormalities were detected in 48 cirrhotic patients (92 %) and in only nine dyspeptic patients (5.4 %) (P < 0.001). The size of extraluminal adventitial venous dilatation was significantly correlated with the severity of GEV and cirrhosis (P < 0.001). Perforating veins were identified in all patients with GEV.The new generation video-echo endoscope could be used as a single investigation in assessing both the intraluminal GEV and extraluminal venous abnormalities in cirrhotic patients. It may improve the management of patients with portal hypertension.
