Liver, gallbladder, and spleen. Ultrasonic imaging is a successful method of evaluating upper abdominal anatomy. The size, shape, and contour of the liver, spleen, and gallbladder can be adequately defined. Ultrasound is a major tool in the diagnosis of jaundice for it can differentiate between extrinsic jaundice in patients who may require surgical intervention and intrinsic jaundice in a patient who requires only medical attention. The diagnosis and location of cysts, abscesses, and solid masses can be determined by echography with a high degree of accuracy. In patients with abdominal disturbances ultrasonic imaging is more than just an extension of the physical examination, it is a means of further refining the probabilities in the diagnosis of disease entities. It should no longer be considered a mere curiosity, but a unique diagnostic tool in the armamentarium of the modern physician.
