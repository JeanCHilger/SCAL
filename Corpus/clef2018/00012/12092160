Portal hypertension in liver cirrhosis. Portal hypertension is a dramatic complication in liver cirrhosis by efraction of the varices localized more frequently in the esophagus. It has been an actual subject due to physiopathological research (endotelin system, nitric system etc), diagnosis (echoendoscopy, color Doppler), and therapeutically progress. Propranolol, available at a low cost, is efficient and unanimously accepted in the prophylactic treatment of medium and large varices which have never bled as well as in the hemorrhage due to variceal efraction which stopped therapeutically or spontaneously. This drug diminishes the risk of rebleeding. Besides the pharmacological treatment, terlipresine, octreotid, sclerotherapy and bandlegation are used in active hemorrhage due to variceal efraction. If this fails other methods for haemostasis are used: portosystemic transjugular shunt, mechanical tamponade, selective surgery and ideally hepatic transplant. Except for the hepatic transplant, none of the mentioned methods can improve the rate of survival in-patients, which depends on the state of the hepatic failure.
