Inferior mesenteric arteriovenous fistula eight years after sigmoidectomy. We report a 69-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in whom iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) developed after sigmoidectomy. A soft mass with bruit led to the diagnosis of inferior mesenteric AVF. Most mesenteric AVF cases have portal hypertension, but this patients showed none of the usual symptoms of portal hypertension however, she had a splenomegaly that became worse after sigmoidectomy. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of AVF in patients with a history of abdominal surgery.
