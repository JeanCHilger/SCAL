Increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been noted recently. Only in year 2000 seven new cases of HCC in HCV-positive patients were diagnosed. In all cases liver tumors were found in cirrhotic patients and they were at advanced stage (multiple or large in size) precluding successful therapy. More than half of HCC cases related to HCV infection were connected with blood transfusion(s) in the past. Patients transfused a few decades ago should be screened for HCV infection and those with liver cirrhosis require careful and regular monitoring including ultrasound and a-fetoprotein examinations in order to detect focal lesions at less advanced stage making medical intervention possible.
