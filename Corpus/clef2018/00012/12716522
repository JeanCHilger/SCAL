Screening and evaluation of non-invasive diagnosis markers for compensated liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B. To evaluate the diagnostic value of liver fibrosis markers and ultrasonic examination for determining compensated liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and screen applicable non-invasive diagnostic marker for compensated liver cirrhosis.Serum hyaluronic acid (HA), Type III procollagen (PCIII), laminin (LN) and Type IV collagen (CIV) were measured from 350 patients with chronic hepatitis B, who were also detected with liver biopsy and ultrasonography. To determine the cut-off value of every serum liver fibrosis marker for diagnosing compensated liver cirrhosis, data was analysed with clinical epidemiology methods. Then evaluated and compared all the markers.85 out of 350 patients were diagnosed as compensated liver cirrhosis by liver biopsy, and 81 had liver cirrhosis images by ultrasonic examination. HA achieved the biggest area under the ROC curve. The cut-off values with best sensitivity and accuracy of HA, PCIII, LN and CIV were 154.35 microg/L, 198.44 microg/L, 137.58 microg/L and 100.80 microg/L respectively. The related diagnostic sensitivities of HA, PCIII, LN and CIV were 82.4%, 63.5%, 57.3% and 70.6%, specificities were 79.3%, 54.0%, 56.8%, 68.3%, and accuracies were 80.0%, 56.3%, 56.9%, 68.9%, respectively. Parallel tests could increase the diagnostic sensitivity, but decreased specificity and accuracy accordingly. Compared with other non-invasive diagnostic methods, HA was the best marker (mu > or =1.814, P<0.05). The level of HA at 119.17 microg/L was suitable for determining compensated cirrhosis, with a 87.1% sensitivity, 67.6% specificity, 72.3% accuracy, 46.25% positive predictive value and 94.7% negative predictive value.Among the non-invasive serum diagnostic markers for liver fibrosis and ultrasonic examination for cirrhosis image, HA is the best marker for diagnosing compensated liver cirrhosis.
