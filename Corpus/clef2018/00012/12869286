Ultrasonography in the study of hepatocellular carcinoma in woodchucks chronically infected with WHV. The woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV)/woodchuck system is studied as animal model of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) induced by chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The aim of the present study was the evaluation of ultrasound (US) liver examination in woodchuck as a routine method to detect HCC nodules and to follow their growth. Sixteen woodchucks were included in the study. US liver examination was carried out in all animals using a 5 MHz convex scanner. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations were performed to evaluate the US findings. The lower limit of nodule detection by US examination was a diameter of 5 mm. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations confirmed US findings in 14 of 16 animals (86.6%). No false negative results were obtained. Increase of nodule size was faster in the early phase of tumour growth. Small nodules (16 +/- 5 mm) appeared as hypoechoic lesions with well-defined margins and homogeneous structure. Large nodules (42 +/- 19 mm) appeared as hyperechoic lesions with irregular margins, heterogeneous or of mixed pattern microscopical examination showed different degrees of necrosis, inflammation and fibrosis inside these latter neoplasms. The hepatitis reaction was conspicuously more severe around HCC nodules. No fibrosis and/or cirrhosis were found in normal liver parenchyma surrounding tumour nodules. On the whole, US appears to be helpful in the diagnosis of woodchuck HCC even at an early stage. Serial US evaluation can be used to study the growth rate of tumour nodules during natural history or experimental HCC treatments in woodchuck.
