Congenital intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt. An asymptomatic case of intrahepatic shunt between a portal and hepatic vein is presented. Ultrasound examination combined with Doppler sonography showed a communication between a dilated portal vein and a hepatic vein. Computed tomography and angiography confirmed the findings. Porto-hepatic venous shunting is very rare and has previously been reported in association with cirrhosis. The vascular malformation we present is believed to be a congenital anomaly, as no signs of cirrhosis or trauma were found.
