Clinical utility of quantitative assessment of liver haemodynamics in cirrhosis provided by dynamic hepatoscintigraphy. Interrelationships between quantitative assessment of portal (%Qp) and arterial (%Qa) components of hepatic blood supply obtained by dynamic hepatoscintigraphy, and clinical variables characterizing the severity of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension were studied in 25 cirrhotic patients. The variables, clinical state, size of oesophageal varices, ascites accumulation, sonographic stigmata of portal hypertension, liver mass and elimination rate of lidocaine and antipyrine were studied. The %Qa rose in proportion to the severity of liver injury estimated from the Child-Turcotte and McCormick grading scores. The mean %Qa for patients with Child A cirrhosis was significantly higher than that for 8 healthy subjects (34.8 +/- 7.9% vs 18.1 +/- 4.0 P < 0.01). The %Qp values showed relationship with the size of esophageal varices, provided discriminatory data with respect to the ascitic fluid accumulation and the development of intraabdominal collateral circulation. The liver mass had no impact on hepatic dual blood supply pattern, but was linked with the rate of antipyrine clearance. Neither antipyrine clearance nor lidocaine elimination rate corresponded to alterations of hepatic dual blood supply. The %Qp showed a negative correlation with the initial half-life of lidocaine, which was referred to lowered hepatic uptake of the drug. It is concluded that the quantitative assessment of %Qp and %Qa reflect the advancement of portal hypertension better than liver function failure does.
