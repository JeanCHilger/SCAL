Doppler evaluation of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts are becoming an increasingly popular technique for the treatment of portal hypertension and its complications. However, to maintain patency, revisions are periodically required to treat stenosis and thrombosis. At many centers, Doppler sonography is used for routine follow-up. A variety of hemodynamic parameters, including main portal vein velocity, maximum stent velocity, minimum stent velocity, velocity gradient in the stent, temporal changes in stent velocity, flow direction in the intrahepatic portal and hepatic veins, and pulsatility of flow in the stent can be used. Many studies have confirmed that Doppler sonography is a valuable, noninvasive means of detecting stent malfunction, although the criteria vary somewhat at different institutions.
