Ultrasound study in the diagnosis of primary Budd-Chiari syndrome (obstruction of the inferior vena cava). Primary Budd-Chiari syndrome, obstruction of the hepatic portion of the inferior vena cava (IVC), is a rare disorder, but relatively prevalent in the Far East, northern India and Africa. Ultrasound examination was carried out on 9 patients with primary Budd-Chiari syndrome. There were 5 men and 4 women aged 27-60 years. In all the 9 cases, the diagnosis was confirmed by cavography and liver histology. Moreover, 7 of the 9 subsequently underwent radical operation using a patch graft. Ultrasonic study showed several characteristic findings suggestive of the syndrome, and frequencies of the main findings were as follows: 1) an echogenic obstructing membrane 22.2%, 2) segmental obstruction of the IVC
