Neoplastic seeding complicating percutaneous ethanol injection for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. The authors describe a case of subcutaneous neoplastic seeding in the abdominal wall in a 67-year-old man with posthepatitic liver cirrhosis complicated by a single nodule of well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. He was treated with percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) performed under ultrasound guidance. The neoplastic seeding developed along the needle track used to carry out fine-needle biopsy and PEI and was diagnosed 6 months after the beginning of treatment.
