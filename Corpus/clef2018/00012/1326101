Highly differentiated cancer or adenoma of the liver: diagnostic approach in highly differentiated epithelial tumors of the liver. High-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (h-d HCC) is a not frequent hepatic tumour but its outcome may be beneficial when treated properly. Two cases of h-d HCC recognized on the basis of postoperative histopathology are reported. We have discussed the role of fine needle biopsy in distinguishing h-d HCC from liver adenoma, and we have attempted to outline the diagnostic approach in clinically silent hepatic tumours which are not associated with cirrhosis or elevated alfa-fetoprotein plasma level.
