Mini-review: the ultrasonographical and serological changes and their improvement after praziquantel treatment in Schistosoma japonicum infected patients in Leyte, Philippines. We have identified the specific ultrasonographical (US) changes in Schistosoma japonicum infected patients with the serological changes in general liver function markers. The US examination with the following haematological and biochemical serum analysis was performed on 102 patients in Schistosomiasis Hospital, Leyte, Philippines. The US liver images were classified into 4 patterns according to the development of periportal fibrosis and the patterns of echogenic bands. Among various haematological and biochemical serum parameters of liver damage. The serum levels of total bile acid (TBA) and procollagen-III-peptide (P-III-P) correlated well with the development of hepatic fibrosis and the portal hypertension. These patients were subsequently treated with praziquantel (3 x 20 mg/kg), and the improvement of the thickening of the portal vein wall and the intensity of the echogenic band formation was detected 6 months after treatment. The significant US changes could not be detected in the patients with severe hepatic fibrosis caused in the long term infection. The results revealed that the US examination with the serum TBa level would provider a sensitive tool to monitor the severity of the infection and also the improvement occurred shortly after praziquantel treatment.
