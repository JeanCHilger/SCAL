Hepatic resection for a hepatocellular carcinoma larger than 10 cm. Twenty-one patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) larger than 10 cm diameter were treated during the 18 year period from 1971 to 1988. The mean tumor size was 13 cm (range 10-18 cm). Nineteen patients (90.5%) had subjective symptoms. Eight patients (38.1%) had alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels over 10,000 ng/ml, and in 18 patients (85.7%) the levels were over 20 ng/ml. Nevertheless, only three (14.3%) were detected by AFP. Scintigraphy before 1981 and ultrasonography after 1982 appears to be most helpful for detection of HCC. Nineteen lesions (90.5%) were localized in the right hepatic lobe. Large HCC showed a low incidence of histologically verified concomitant cirrhosis (33% 7 of 21) and a relatively well preserved hepatocellular function (indocyanine green test
