The diagnostic use of laparoscopy in liver pathology in light of the evolution of imaging diagnosis. We considered 87 patients suffering from chronic hepatic pathology. 62 patients have resulted suffering from cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis, 25 from neoplasias. In the patient's group with chronic liver disease the humoral tests were not able to differentiate between cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis. In the present retrospective experience echography showed sensibility 0.53 and specificity 0.91. In cirrhosis group, sensibility 0.5 and specificity 0.60 in chronic active hepatitis, sensibility 0.8 and specificity 0.95 in the neoplasia group. Peritoneoscopy showed sensibility 0.97 and specificity 0.93 in the cirrhosis group and sensibility 0.90 and specificity 1.00 in the neoplasia group. We had one case of major complication: hemoperitoneum from tear of adhesion secondary to previous laparotomy. We can conclude that peritoneoscopy is an useful procedure in the study of liver chronic disease and it still finds indication in selected cases of focal illness.
