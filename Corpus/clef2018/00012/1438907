Complications of liver biopsy in ultrasonic evaluation. Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant was performed in 261 patients just before and 2-4 h after liver biopsy (Menghini needle 1.4 mm). Serious complications were not seen. 9 patients had ultrasound-detected small hepatic hematomas (1 x 1 cm - 4 x 3 cm) 2-4 h after liver puncture, clinically however irrelevant. Follow-up ultrasound at 24 h and 48 h showed complete resolution of hematomas that had been detected previously (5 patients and 4 patients resp.). The results of our study indicate that intrahepatic hematomas are uncommon after liver biopsy lesions disappear spontaneously within 24-48 h and that is why ultrasound detection of all post-biopsy intrahepatic hematomas should be performed at 2-4 h. If major complications are not seen a 4 h length of post-biopsy bed rest seems us as sufficiently for all the patients.
