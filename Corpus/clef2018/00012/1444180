Measurement of impedance of hepatic tissue transformed by pathological process. A preliminary communication. Intrahepatic impedance was measured using a special electrode in 44 patients, 38 of whom identified abnormalities of the hepatic parenchyma. Impedance values were compared with ultrasound findings and with the histological results of needle biopsy. Impedance was relatively unaffected in the presence of cirrhosis (n = 7) or chronic hepatitis (n = 5). It was markedly decreased in the presence of cysts (n = 4) and of hepatocarcinoma (n = 4). Values were variable in secondary carcinoma of the liver (n = 16). This preliminary study suggests that the measurement of intrahepatic impedance could contribute to the etiological diagnosis of hepatic tumour lesions.
