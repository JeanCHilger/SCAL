Laparoscopic staging and tumor ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma in Child C cirrhotics evaluated for orthotopic liver transplantation. Surgical resection and liver transplantation remain the only treatments that offer cure for hepatoma, but are limited to those with early stage disease. Prelisting radiological staging is not always definitive. In this study, we sought to delineate the role of laparoscopy for clarification of staging in advanced cirrhotic patients when radiological assessment during evaluation for orthotopic liver transplants (OLTx) is equivocal.Over a 3-year period, 18 patients with advanced liver insufficiency being evaluated for OLTx listing underwent laparoscopic staging when the following criteria were met: (1) lesion(s) with indeterminate size/borders, (2) an indeterminate number of lesions, or (3) lesion(s) and alpha-fero protein (AFP) less than 100 ng/ml. Patients underwent exploratory laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound with biopsy, with or without ablation of lesion(s).Laparoscopic staging was initiated in 18 patients four of the first six patients were converted to open procedures. Twelve patients were restaged as a result of the procedure: six down-staged and six up-staged. Stage changes were based on laparoscopic visualization of advanced disease in two, ultrasonographic clarification of tumor size/number in seven, and biopsy in three. Twelve of the 14 laparoscopic procedures included laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation while one received ethanol ablation. One patient required 2 units of red blood cells. One patient died on postoperative day 7 because of gastrointestinal bleeding. Four of the six down-staged patients underwent liver transplant, and pathological staging of the explants agreed with laparoscopic staging in all cases.Laparoscopic staging for HCC in advanced cirrhosis can clearly characterize tumor burden when preoperative radiological assessment is equivocal.
