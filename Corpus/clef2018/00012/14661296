Case report: Membranous obstruction of the inferior vena cava associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. The incidence of membranous obstruction of the inferior vena cava is rare, but the diagnosis is essential because of the association of this lesion with portal fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In membranous obstruction of the inferior vena cava, the hepatic segment of the inferior vena cava is obstructed by a fibromuscular membrane or replaced by a cordlike fibrous tissue. We report the computed tomography and ultrasound findings of a 45 year old patient with membranous obstruction of the inferior vena cava and hepatocellular carcinoma.
