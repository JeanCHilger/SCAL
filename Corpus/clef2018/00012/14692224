Warfarin embryopathy. A 34-year-old gravida 2 para 1 (1001) mother was on prophylactic anticoagulation therapy because of pulmonary emboli postabdominal surgery. The pregnancy was terminated at 25 weeks' gestation after ultrasound examination showed a mild hydrocephalus and a cardiac structural defect. Congenital abnormalities of the delivered fetus included nasal hypoplasia, earfold atresia, bilobled lungs, coarctation of the aorta, ventricular septal defect, gastrochisis, and radiographic skeletal stippling. The radiological and physical findings were consistent with warfarin embryopathy.
