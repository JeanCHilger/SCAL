Total fibrous obliteration of main portal vein and portal foam cell venopathy in chronic hepatic allograft rejection. Chronic hepatic allograft rejection is characterized by arteriopathy and bile duct loss. Pathology of the portal vein or its branches is not considered to play a major role in chronic rejection.A recent case of chronic rejection with total fibrous obliteration of the portal vein at the hilum and graft loss prompted us to retrospectively analyze cases of failed allografts for portal vein changes.Six cases of failed hepatic allograft recorded in our files from 1994 to 1998 were selected for the study. For comparison, 4 cases of hepatitis C cirrhosis were included. Clinical features, including arteriograms or Doppler studies, were reviewed whenever available. Sections taken from the hilum and random parenchyma stained with routine hematoxylin-eosin, elastic van Gieson, and Masson trichrome were examined by 3 experienced liver pathologists in a randomized, blinded fashion.Significant hepatic artery occlusion with foam cell change and bile duct loss was seen in all cases of chronic rejection (3/3), but not in the other cases. Foam cell change in the portal vein at the hilum (3/3) and occasionally into the distal branches (2/3) with variable occlusion of the lumen was seen only in cases of chronic hepatic allograft rejection. Mild luminal narrowing was observed in all the cases of cirrhosis (4/4) as a result of phlebosclerosis, most likely representing a change secondary to portal hypertension. Total obliteration of the portal vein at the hilum was seen in the index case (case 1) only.Portal venopathy can be a significant finding in chronic hepatic allograft rejection and may contribute to graft dysfunction or failure. Two-vessel disease must be considered in cases of chronic hepatic allograft rejection, and pathologists should thoroughly examine the hilum in explanted hepatic allografts.
