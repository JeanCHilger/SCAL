Accidental electric shock in pregnancy and antenatal occurrence of maternal deep vein thrombosis. A case report. Even low-voltage electric shock can initiate late vascular thromboses. We present the first reported case of antenatal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in a pregnant woman that could be attributed to the electric shock she accidentally received several weeks prior to the DVT.A 19-year-old primigravida presented to the office at 29 weeks of gestation with signs and symptoms of DVT. A magnetic resonance imaging revealed an occluding thrombus involving the entire left common iliac and external iliac vein. She tested negative for all the biochemical abnormalities that could lead to a hypercoagulable state. Her prior pregnancy course had been unremarkable with the exception of an electric shock she had had secondary to touching exposed electric wires at home at 22 weeks of gestation.Pregnant women exposed to electric shock should be carefully monitored for such complications as DVT during the weeks following the exposure.
