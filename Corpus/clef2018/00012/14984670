Presence of equinocyte in the preeclampsia-eclampsia syndrome. Is this a subclinical manifestation of the syndrome?. To determine the relationship between erythrocyte deformations and preeclampsia-eclampsia syndrome before presentation of the triad high blood pressure-edema-proteinuria.Aleatory study. A total of 308 patients were studied without evidence of preeclampsia, with negative erythrocyte deformation smear, between 12 and 18 weeks of pregnancy. Monthly laboratory samples were performed including arterial blood pressure monitorization, weight, and periphery blood smear considered as positive with presence of 50% of morphologic changes of erythrocyte (equinocyte) deem in 10 fields, with light microscopic and oil immersion at 100X. Statistical studies were performed to determine relative risk (RR), sensitivity (S), and specificity (E), and positive and negative predictive values.A total of 308 patients were studied 36 patients (100%) had a positive smear, nine (25%) had preeclampsia. Erythrocyte deformation was seen at between 22 and 26 weeks of pregnancy in all patients before onset of high blood pressure, edema, and proteinuriaThere is a close relationship between erythrocyte deformations with onset of preeclampsia-eclampsia syndrome prior to presentation of the triad high blood pressure-edema-proteinuria.
