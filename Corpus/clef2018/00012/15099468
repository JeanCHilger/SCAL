The relationship among the counts of platelet, thrombopoietin and spleen index in patients with liver cirrhosis. To determine the reason of thrombocytopenia in patients with liver cirrhosis, we studied the relationship among platelet counts, serum thrombopoietin (TPO) level and spleen index.Serum TPO, platelet counts and spleen index were measured in 71 cirrhotic patients. TPO was measured with ELISA method, spleen index were measured on ultrasonography by the same doctor.Platelet counts in patients with cirrhosis were lower than that of healthy group [(109.20+/-53.39) vs (169.63+/-26.60) x 10(12)/L, P<0.05]. Serum thrombopoietin level in patients with cirrhosis was similar to that of healthy group [(436.42+/-258.97) vs (412.63+/-132.80) pg/ml, P>0.05]. However, serum thrombopoietin level decreased as liver disease aggravated, [(526.13+/-317.44) pg/ml in Child-Pugh grade A, (445.22+/-214.90) pg/ml in grade B and (311.45+/-182.66) pg/ml in grade C, grade A vs. Grade C, P<0.05]. However, decline in platelet counts was accompanied with incline in spleen index coordinately. 35 of 71 cirrhotic patients had normal platelet counts whereas 36 of them had thrombocytopenia. Thrombopoietin levels were higher in non-thrombocytopenia group than in thrombocytopenia group [(529.43+/-282.64) vs. (351.27+/-228.25)pg/ml, P<0.01] but spleen index of two groups showed no difference [(29.65+/-12.00) vs. (36.35+/-12.68) cm2, P>0.05]. Correlation was found between thrombopoietin level and platelet counts (r=0.252, P=0.025)The decline serum TPO levels might play an important role for thrombocytopenia in patients with liver cirrhosis.
