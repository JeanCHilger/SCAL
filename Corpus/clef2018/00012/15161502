Clinical study of renal blood flow and endothelin in cirrhotic patients. To find the relationship between hepatic dysfunction and renal blood flow (RBF).49 patients with hepatic cirrhosis were studied via Color-Coded Duplex Ultrasonography detecting the pulsatile index (PI), resistive index (RI), peak systolic velocity (PS), peak diastolic velocity (PD) and peak systolic velocity/peak diastolic velocity (PS/PD) in the interlobar and arcuate arteries. The plasma endothelin (ET) levels were also evaluated.According to a modified Child's classification which assesses the severity of liver cirrhosis, we compared different groups and found that the worse the function of liver appeared coincidently with the higher PI and RI, especially RI (0.60+/-0.09, 0.66+/-0.06, 0.72+/-0.07, respectively, P < 0.01) The results also indicated that PI, RI increased obviously followed by the rise of ascites (PI: 1.14+/-0.20, 1.31+/-0.29, 1.42+/-0.36, respectivelyIn patients with cirrhosis, RBF is directly correlated with the hepatic function. The correlation between ascites and RBF is also discovered. In patients who have liver cirrhosis, the plasma ET level obviously increased, indicating that ET probably is one of the active factors of renal vascular contraction.
