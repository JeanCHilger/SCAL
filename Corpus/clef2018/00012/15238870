The role of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma. The incidence of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing in Occident, as well as in France. Primary prevention is the only solution for early detection. The combination of ultrasound (US) and alphaFP each 4 to 6 Months dosage has many limitations. The sensitivity of US examination is rather poor (less than 70% for lesions below 2 cm in diameter) and serum alphaFP values remain normal in almost 50% of HCC. US contrast agents (USCAs) with perfluorocarbon gases increase the backscattered signals during all phases of the liver transit, including arterial, portal and delayed phases. Hepatocellular lesions exhibit a specific kinetics with strong enhancement during arterial phase, and rapid wash-out during portal and delayed phases. USCAs increase the detection of HCCs and allow characterization of additional focal lesions found in cirrhotic livers (regenerative and dysplastic nodules, haemangiomas.). Indeed, regenerative nodules contrast uptake is synchronous to the surrounding parenchyma, and usually disappear during portal and delayed phases. However, US in cirrhosis remains a difficult examination, with limitations due to limited access to sub-diaphragmatic localization, attenuation of the ultrasound beam and shortness of the arterial phase.
