Effects of terlipressin on systolic pulmonary artery pressure of patients with liver cirrhosis: an echocardiographic assessment. Portopulmonary hypertension is a serious complication of chronic liver disease. Our aim was to search into the effect of terlipressin on systolic pulmonary artery pressure among cirrhotic patients.Twelve patients (6 males and 6 females) with liver cirrhosis were recruited in the study. Arterial blood gas samples were obtained in sitting position at rest. Contrast enhanced echocardiography and measurements of systolic pulmonary artery pressure were performed before and after the intravenous injection of 2 mg terlipressin.Of 12 patients studied, the contrast enhanced echocardiography was positive in 5, and the positive findings in contrast enhanced echocardiography were reversed to normal in two after terlipressin injection. The mean systolic pulmonary artery pressure was 25.5+/-3.6 mmHg before terlipressin injection, and was 22.5+/-2.5 mmHg after terlipressin (P=0.003). The systolic pulmonary artery pressure was above 25 mmHg in seven of these 12 patients. After the terlipressin injection, systolic pulmonary artery pressure was <25 mmHg in four of these cases (58.3% vs 25%, P=0.04).Terlipressin can decrease the systolic pulmonary artery pressure in patients with liver cirrhosis.
