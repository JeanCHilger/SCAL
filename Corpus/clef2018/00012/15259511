Therapeutic management algorithm in cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients in primary or secondary liver masses. The treatment of hepatic tumors in cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients still represents a major issue in decision making for oncologists and surgeons. The high mortality of open liver surgery, particularly in cirrhotic patients, has pushed physicians to research new modalities. In this review paper we summarize the available and alternative methods for the treatment of liver masses using new modalities and a minimally invasive approach, which will benefit the quality of life of the patients. We also outline therapeutic plan options.
