Screening and treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become routine despite a lack of evidence of efficacy. Suitable candidates for surveillance include patients with cirrhosis and some subsets of noncirrhotic chronic hepatitis B carriers. The best surveillance testis ultrasonography at 6- to 12-month intervals. Serological tests are less effective. Defining an abnormal result is difficult in the cirrhotic liver. Diagnosis requires radiological investigations and may require a biopsy if the lesion is between 1 and 2 cm in diameter. In the face of an abnormal surveillance test and failure to confirm the diagnosis initially, enhanced follow-up is required. HCC can be treated for cure by liver transplantation, resection, or local ablation. For patients with suitable lesions, liver transplantation offers the best form of therapy. Chemoembolization offers increased survival over no therapy. Several experimental therapies are being investigated.
