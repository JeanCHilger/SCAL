Congenital hepatic fibrosis. Report of five cases. Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) is an autosomic dominant disease that has been associated with polycystic kidney disease.To describe the medical management of 5 children with CHF and to evaluate the presence and extension of the associated renal disease.Retrospective review of the medical charts of 5 children with CHF, aged 2 to 14 years.Three children presented autosomic recessive polycystic kidney disease, which was diagnosed before the appearance of liver disease manifestations. They presented a more severe liver damage, with a more aggressive clinical course requiring use of transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunts (TIPS) or surgical porto-systemic shunts to control portal hypertension. The other two children, in whom the diagnosed was based on asymptomatic hepatomegaly, had normal renal function and structure with a more benign clinical course.The diagnosis of CHF should be suspected not only in children with polycystic kidney disease but in those children with persistent, hard consistency, left lobe predominance hepatomegaly.
