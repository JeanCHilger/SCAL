Intraoperative ultrasonography in patients who undergo liver resection or transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma. Careful staging of hepatic tumors forms the basis of appropriate selection of, and is a precondition for, customized treatment. Advances in radiodiagnostic technology have increased the sensitivity of noninvasive liver staging by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and helical CT (HCT). Nevertheless, surgical exploration and intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) are considered the "gold standard." The value of HCT and IOUS was investigated in patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) (group A n=23) or hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (group B
