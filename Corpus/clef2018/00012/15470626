Effect of propranolol on renal hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis: assessment with Doppler US. To determine the renal resistive index profile in cirrhotic patients before and after propranolol treatment and assess the effects of propranolol on renal hemodynamics.Thirty-six patients with cirrhosis and ascites (decompensated group), 39 patients with cirrhosis but no ascites (compensated group) and 25 patients with normal renal and hepatic functions (control group) were studied. All had normal blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. The renal resistive index was calculated in all patients before and after oral propranolol treatment.Resistive index was significantly higher in the decompensated group (p<0.05) than in other groups. After propranolol treatment, resistive indices decreased in the compensated patients (p<0.05) but increased in the decompensated group (p<0.05). There was a slight but statistically insignificant increase in the control group.In patients with cirrhosis renal failure is a significant risk factor for liver transplantation. In these patients, Doppler sonography provides early detection of renal dysfunction even before renal function tests are abnormal. Doppler sonography is a useful noninvasive method to evaluate the effects of drugs on renal hemodynamics.
