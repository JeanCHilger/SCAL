Value of portal hemodynamics and hypersplenism in cirrhosis staging. To determine the correlation between portal hemodynamics and spleen function among different grades of cirrhosis and verify its significance in cirrhosis staging.The portal and splenic vein hemodynamics and spleen size were investigated by ultrasonography in consecutive 38 cirrhotic patients with cirrhosis (Child's grades A to C) and 20 normal controls. The differences were compared in portal vein diameter and flow velocity between patients with and without ascites and between patients with mild and severe esophageal varices. The correlation between peripheral blood cell counts and Child's grades was also determined.The portal flow velocity and volume were significantly lower in patients with Child's C (12.25+/-1.67 cm/s vs 788.59+/-234 mm/min, respectively) cirrhosis compared to controls (19.55+/-3.28 cm/s vs 1254.03+/-410 mm/min, respectively) and those with Child's A (18.5+/-3.02 cm/s vs 1358.48+/-384 mm/min, respectively) and Child's B (16.0+/-3.89 cm/s vs 1142.23+/-390 mm/min, respectively) cirrhosis. Patients with ascites had much lower portal flow velocity and volume (13.0+/-1.72 cm/s vs 1078+/-533 mm/min) than those without ascites (18.6+/-2.60 cm/s vs 1394+/-354 mm/min). There was no statistical difference between patients with mild and severe esophageal varices. The portal vein diameter was not significantly different among the above groups. There were significant differences in splenic vein diameter, flow velocity and white blood cell count, but not in spleen size, red blood cell and platelet counts among the various grades of cirrhosis. The spleen size was negatively correlated with red blood cell and platelet counts (r = -0.620 and r = -0.8.34, respectively).An optimal system that includes parameters representing the portal hemodynamics and spleen function should be proposed for cirrhosis staging.
