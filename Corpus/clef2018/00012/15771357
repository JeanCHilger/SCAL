Diagnosis of suspected deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism during pregnancy. Venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) is a frequent clinical problem during pregnancy and post-partum. Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains the most common cause of mortality during pregnancy and post-partum in western countries. In the majority of cases, DVT may be diagnosed by non-invasive tests such as clinical probability, D-dimer measurement and venous compression ultrasonography. In contrast, at least one irradiating invasive exam is necessary in suspected PE. The lung scan, the most validated diagnostic test for PE during pregnancy and fetal irradiation is quite low, in particular if only perfusion lung scan is used. Helical computed tomography (hCT) has widely replaced lung scan in the diagnostic approach of suspected pulmonary embolism. However, it has never been validated in pregnant women.
