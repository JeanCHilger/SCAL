Obstetric and neonatal outcomes in apparently isolated mild fetal ventriculomegaly. To determine obstetrical and neonatal outcomes in referrals of apparently isolated mild ventriculomegaly following routine ultrasound scan, over the period 2001-2003. Specialist ultrasound and other investigations were performed. Neonatal examination and postnatal ultrasound findings were collected and local neurodevelopmental follow-up was obtained.30 cases of suspected isolated mild ventriculomegaly (posterior horn of lateral ventricle 10-15 mm at diagnosis) were identified. There were two abnormal karyotypes, no abnormal TORCH screens, and only one false-positive alloimmune thrombocytopenia screen. In 21 cases, isolated ventriculomegaly was confirmed following specialist investigation. In 11 of 21 cases, ventriculomegaly resolved during antenatal follow-up, and in one case it progressed. Six of 21 had ventriculomegaly confirmed on postnatal ultrasound and lissencephaly was diagnosed in one following postnatal MRI. Of the 11 infants with antenatal resolution of ventriculomegaly, 2 have delayed development. The infant with progressive ventriculomegaly has severe developmental problems.
