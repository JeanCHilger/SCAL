Ureteric obstruction by the right testicular vein: CT diagnosis. The close relationship of the ureter and gonadal blood vessels is often clearly demonstrated by computed tomography (CT). A case of ureteral obstruction in a man possibly caused by the crossing testicular vein is presented. Unlike the ovarian vein syndrome in women, which is often related to pregnancy and/or venous thrombosis, no predisposing factors were found.
