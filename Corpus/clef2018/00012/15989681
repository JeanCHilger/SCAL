Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease presenting as adrenal insufficiency: case report. This is the first reported case of lymphoproliferative disease presenting with adrenal insufficiency after liver transplantation. A 38-year-old white man was admitted 8 months after transplantation for cryptogenic cirrhosis with fever (38-39 degrees C), chills, cough, and dyspnea. His blood pressure was 100/70 mm Hg, there was pallor of the conjunctiva, and a lymph node was palpable in the left groin. Laboratory analyses revealed the following values: serum sodium concentration (112 mmol/L), potassium (5.4 mmol/L), hemoglobin (7.8 g/L), white blood cell count (7.7 x 10(9)/L), glucose 3.9 (mmol/L), and mildly elevated liver functions. Abdominal ultrasound showed multiple hypoechoic solid-appearing lesions throughout the liver and spleen. Results of a biopsy specimen of the groin node confirmed polymorphic B-cell lymphoma. A negative Epstein- Barr virus screen before transplant became positive. The patient's fever increased to 40 degrees C. He subsequently developed sepsis and later, multiple organ failure. Autopsy confirmed extensive abdominal disease. The adrenal glands had been completely replaced by the tumor. Primary Epstein-Barr virus infection is associated with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. Replacement of the adrenal glands with a tumor produces a clinical picture of adrenal insufficiency.
