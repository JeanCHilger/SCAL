1166C mutation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene is correlated with umbilical blood flow velocimetry in women with preeclampsia. To ascertain the frequency of polymorphic variants of the gene coding for angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) and its correlation with umbilical artery (UA) blood flow velocity in a group of women with preeclampsia (PE).AT1 polymorphism, pulsatility index (PI) in UA, and perinatal outcome in 47 women with PE and in 113 healthy pregnant women were investigated. Investigation of AT1 receptor genotypes was performed by PCR/RFLP assays. PI value has been measured by Doppler velocimetry technique.The overrepresentation of CC homozygotic genotype in PE group (6.4% vs. 2.7%) and the overrepresentation of mutated C allele in the PE group were observed (28.7% vs. 23.0%). Analyzing PI index we observed statistically significant differences between PE and control groups. Comparing PI values in PE group between genotypes: AA vs. AC + CC statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) have been observed.Observed overrepresentation of mutated C allele of the AT1 gene was correlated with increased blood flow in umbilical artery in women with preeclampsia. Doppler velocimetry might be a useful tool for indication in the high-risk group with overrepresentation of C alleles.
