MRI in detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the commonest malignancy of the liver and is usually due to cirrhosis. Early detection of HCC and the premalignant dysplastic nodules has implications on the management options of tumor ablation, liver resection and transplantation. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful for the detection and characterization of lesions, in the identification of dysplastic nodules and their malignant transformation into HCC.
