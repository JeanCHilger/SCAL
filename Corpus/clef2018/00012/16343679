Primary prophylaxis with nadolol in cirrhotic patients: Doppler patterns of splanchnic hemodynamics in good and poor responders. We aimed to characterize by echo-color-Doppler the splanchnic hemodynamics of patients good and poor responders to primary prophylaxis with nadolol.Thirty cirrhotic patients (Child-score 7.0+/-1.8) with medium/large esophageal varices without previous bleedings were consecutively enrolled. At inclusion and after 3 months of treatment with nadolol, they underwent a splanchnic echo-color-Doppler study and a measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG).Nadolol (60+/-36 mg/day range 20-160) induced a significant reduction of HVPG (16.6+/-6.1 vs. 19.4+/-4.6 mmHg, P < 0.0001). 13 patients (43.3%) were hemodynamic responders. Responders and Poor-responders had similar baseline clinical characteristics. Poor-responders at baseline were characterized by lower impedance indexes in superior mesenteric artery (SMA) (PI 2.29+/-0.45 vs. 2.74+/-0.46Cirrhotic patients poor-responders to nadolol show a pronounced arterial splanchnic vasodilatation at a baseline echo-color-Doppler study. This can be considered a non-invasive clue for the a priori identification of this subgroup of patients.
