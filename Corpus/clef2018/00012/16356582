Management of hepatocellular carcinoma in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resulting from chronic infection with hepatitis B or C virus (HBV, HCV) is a significant health problem. Concurrent infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may accelerate the progression from cirrhosis to HCC. Current guidelines advise screening patients with cirrhosis at 6-month intervals using ultrasonography and measurement of alpha-fetoprotein levels. In early-stage HCC, resection and liver transplantation are curative, as is percutaneous ethanol injection for small tumours in patients who are not candidates for surgery. HIV-infected patients do not qualify for liver transplantation. For late-stage HCC, chemoembolization can improve survival. Prevention of hepatitis and cirrhosis are key goals in reducing the impact of HCC. Numerous issues in HCC prevention, diagnosis, and management still remain to be resolved through large-scale, randomized clinical trials.
