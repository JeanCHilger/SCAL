Diastolic dysfunction in liver cirrhosis. The presence of a hyperdynamic circulation in cirrhotic liver is currently a well established concept. The first studies of cardiac function in patients with cirrhosis suggested the existence of an alcoholic cardiomyopathy. More recently, altered left ventricular response to physiological and/or pharmacological stimuli in patients with post-viral liver cirrhosis has been established, and clinically insignificant diastolic cardiac function has also been observed. Neurohumoral hyperactivity and hyperdynamic circulation, which are associated with chronic exposure to the cardiodepressant substances present in advanced liver disease, play a decisive role in the genesis of this process. The lack of relaxation of the left ventricle and alteration in the pattern of transmitral flow, both of which are characteristics of this clinical entity, are easily detected by echocardiography. The growing evidence of diastolic dysfunction in liver cirrhosis, particularly in decompensated cirrhosis, suggests the clinical importance of the problem, thus introducing the concept of "cirrhotic cardiomyopathy". Greater insight into this phenomenon could help to decrease cardiovascular risk, especially during maneuvers commonly used in the treatment of the complications of liver cirrhosis, such as paracentesis, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt stent implantation, and liver transplantation.
