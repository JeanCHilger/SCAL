Cytological diagnosis from fine needle aspiration biopsy of the liver. One hundred and six fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB) of the liver were performed on 99 patients to rule out hepatic malignancy. Biopsies were performed with CT guidance (60), ultrasonography (40), fluoroscopy (3), by direct palpation (2) and intra-operatively (1). The smears and cell blocks were reviewed and the cytologic diagnoses were made after clinicopathologic correlation. Eight cases were excluded (six non-diagnostic and two mislaid). Fifty-two were positive, 2 suspicious and 44 negative for malignancy. There were no false positive results. The sensitivity for malignancy was 84.4%, the specificity was 100% and the predictive value of positive results was 100%. The false negative rate was ten out of 44 cases (22.7%). Of the malignant aspirates, there were 27 hepatocellular carcinomas, 21 metastases and four carcinomas of unknown histogenesis. Common benign lesions included abscesses, cysts, cirrhosis and steatosis. For FNAB to be an effective diagnostic procedure, adequate representative sampling, cell block preparation for appraisal of histological architecture and experience in cytomorphologic interpretation are necessary to increase yield and enhance precision of diagnosis.
