Gene expression profiling of human placentas from preeclamptic and normotensive pregnancies. The aim of this study was to investigate patterns of gene expression in placental samples from patients with preeclampsia (PE), persistent bilateral uterine artery notching (without PE), and normal controls. This study included placental tissue from nine women with PE, seven with uncomplicated pregnancies and five with bilateral uterine artery notching in Doppler velocimetry tracings. Human cDNA microarrays with 6500 transcripts/genes were used and the results verified with real-time PCR and in-situ hybridization. Multidimensional scaling method and random permutation technique demonstrated significant differences among the three groups examined. Within the 6.5K arrays, 6198 elements were unique cDNA clones representing 5952 unique UniGenes and 5695 unique LocusLinks. Multidimensional scaling plots showed 5000 genes that met our quality criteria among these, 366 genes were significantly different in at least one comparison. Differences in three genes of interest were confirmed with real-time PCR and in-situ hybridization
