Hepatic vein transit time of SonoVue: a comparative study with Levovist. To prospectively compare transit times of Levovist and SonoVue in healthy volunteers and patients with biopsy-proved hepatitis C-related liver disease.Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. Forty patients and 25 healthy volunteers were examined. Subjects fasted, a bolus of SonoVue (0.6 mL) was injected into a cubital fossa vein, and hepatic venous time-intensity profiles were measured with spectral Doppler tracing. This was repeated with two injections of Levovist (2 g) and another injection of SonoVue. Time-intensity curves of spectral Doppler signals of right and middle hepatic veins were analyzed. A sustained signal intensity increase of 10% above baseline levels indicated hepatic vein transit time (HVTT). Carotid artery audio intensity was measured in volunteers. Analysis of variance and t tests were used for statistical analysis.Twelve patients had mild hepatitis 18, moderate or severe hepatitisHVTT was significantly shorter with SonoVue than with Levovist there was no significant difference in cardiopulmonary transit time.
