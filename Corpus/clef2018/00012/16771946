Is congenital hepatic fibrosis a pure liver disease? An association between congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) and several different conditions is being increasingly recognized. We aimed to investigate, prospectively, these associated disorders and the clinical consequences for patients with CHF.CHF was diagnosed using liver biopsy, abdominal ultrasound (US), Doppler US, upper endoscopy, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) in 19 patients (13 women, 6 men). CT portography and splenoportography with digital subtraction angiography were performed if indicated. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed to investigate the extent of portal vein involvement of the common bile duct if it existed, to remove a stone located in the common bile duct when documented, and to confirm the diagnosis of Caroli's syndrome. Cranial MRI was done when clinical findings suggested brain involvement.The mean age of the patients was 29.47+/-12.06, ranging from 13 to 57. CHF-associated diseases were Caroli's syndrome, polycystic kidney disease, cavernous transformation of the portal vein, Joubert's syndrome, von Meyenburg complex, polydactyly, medullary sponge kidney, and pancreatic duct atrophy. In two cases, cholangiocarcinoma had developed. There was only one case with pure CHF. Portosystemic shunt, TIPS, or splenectomy were performed in some cases to control bleeding from esophageal varices. Papillotomy and stone extraction from the common bile duct were performed in four patients with Caroli's syndrome complicated by cholangitis. Three patients died of complications of CHF. Two patients with Caroli's syndrome underwent liver transplantation.In this prospective study, it seems that CHF is not a pure liver disease but rather a multiorgan disorder involving the brain, portal vein, kidneys, and bile ducts. In most cases, the clinical picture includes other organ involvement, rather than purely the liver parenchyma.
