Texture features' extraction of B-scan schistosomial fibrosis images using the Peleg method. In this paper, the Peleg Method is used to calculate the fractal dimension of 5 normal images and 5 schistosomial fibrosis images in order to extract the texture features of B-Scan liver images based on a fractal model. The result indicates that this fractal dimension could be an effective parameter to distinguish the pathologic changes of the disease.
