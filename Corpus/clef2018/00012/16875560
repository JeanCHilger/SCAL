Chronic hepatic damage in acute promyelocytic leukemia patients treated with tetra-arsenic tetra-sulfide. To investigate the chronic hepatic damage in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients long-term treated with tetra-arsonic tetra-sulfide (As(4)S(4)).The periodical liver biochemical examinations and ultrasonography results and hepatic fibrosis indicators (P III NP and type IV collagen) of patients were analysed.106 APL patients treated with As(4)S(4), the median follow-up time was 36 months (6 - 72). The HCV(-) group includes 84 APL patients. During the first course the abnormal rate of the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 16.7% and 14.5% (higher than the two times of the normal value), the ALT, AST, gamma-glyoxylate aminotransferase (GGT) levels during the first course were statistically higher than As4S4 treatment before (P < 0.05). There were no statistically differences between the ALT, AST, GGT levels after and before treating with As(4)S(4) in half a year, one year, two year, more than three years (P > 0.05). Other biochemical indicators such as ALP, LDH, TBIL, DBIL, TP, ALB, A/G, BUN, CRE, there were no significantly differences before and after As(4)S(4) treatment (P > 0.05). The HCV(+) group includes 22 APL patients, during the first course, the abnormal rate of the ALT, AST were 63.6% and 59.1%, but at the 2 year, more than 3 years there were no significantly differences compared with As(4)S(4) treatment before (P > 0.05). 42 APL patients were treated with As(4)S(4) more than 3 years, in 33 HCV(-) APL patients, two APL patients had splenomegaly, one APL patient's breadth of the portal vein was wider than 1.4 cm, 21 APL patients had fatty liver (63.6%). The hepatic fibrosis indicators of the 16 APL patients were all normal. In 9 HCV(+) APL patients, 4 APL patients had splenomegaly, 2 APL patients, breadth of portal vein were wider than 1.4 cm, 6 APL patients had fatty liver (66.7%). 6 patients were examined with the hepatic fibrosis indicators, 2 patients, were higher than the normal value.Long term As(4)S(4) treatment for APL patients had no obvious effects on hepatic function, no obvious hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension signs at more than 3 years, excepting for the rate of fatty liver was high.
