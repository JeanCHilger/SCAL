Out of hospital treatment with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin in patients with acute deep-vein thrombosis: a prospective study in daily practice. Clinical trials have demonstrated that initial outpatient treatment is safe and effective in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Considering the relative lack of literature-based evidence on outpatient low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment in daily practice this study prospectively evaluated the implementation of a protocol for full outpatient treatment of DVT in a non-teaching hospital.Consecutive patients with objectively demonstrated DVT were treated on an outpatient basis with subcutaneous nadroparin injections for at least 5 days and oral anticoagulant treatment for at least 3 months.In 294 of 309 (95%) consecutive patients with proven DVT, nadroparin could be started on a fully outpatient basis. During initial LMWH treatment one patient had to be hospitalized because of objectively proven pulmonary embolism (PE), and one patient developed a major bleeding complication. Overall, during 3 months follow-up recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurred in nine patients (3.1% 95 CI 1.1 to 5.1), four patients experienced a major non-fatal hemorrhage (1.4%Out of hospital initiation of anticoagulant treatment with LMWH is safe and effective in the overall majority of patients (95%) with objectively proven DVT. We believe that these results are relevant to both clinicians and health care providers in view of the feasibility of home treatment in nearly all patients.
