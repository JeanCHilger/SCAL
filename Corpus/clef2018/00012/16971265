Hepatocellular carcinoma. The number of patients who have hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is expected to more than double over the next 1 to 2 decades. Patients who have cirrhosis, regardless of cause, are at the highest risk for developing HCC. This article discusses surveillance of these patients for HCC by alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasound, evaluation using imaging, classification of HCC using the Barcelona staging classification, and treatment. Resection, transplantation, and percutaneous ablation are considered curative interventions and are applied to about 30% of all patients who have HCC. Currently, there is no standard therapy for advanced HCC.
