Ultrasonic liver discrimination using 2-D phase congruency. In this paper, we present an experiment to extract liver features using two-dimensional phase congruency, which is invariant to changes in intensity or contrast, to try to avoid the influence of machine settings. The effectiveness of our method was tested on three classes of liver images and shows the potential for physicians to quantify liver pathology in clinical diagnosis.
