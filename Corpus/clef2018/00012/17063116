Surveillance program for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan: results of specialized department of liver disease. Surveillance of cirrhotic patients enables early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and possibly prolongs survival. The aim of this study was to explore whether early-stage HCC can be detected earlier at a specialized department of liver disease than in other institutions.The study subjects were 574 patients with HCC. Patients were subdivided into 3 groups according to the manner of HCC detection: group A, HCC was detected in 91 patients during periodic examination at Kurume University School of Medicine group B, HCC was detected in 301 patients during periodic examination at other institutionsThe HCC detected in group A was significantly of smaller size (20.4 mm) compared with groups B (27.1 mm, P<0.0001) and C (57.8 mm, P<0.0001). The frequency of receiving treatment (surgery or local ablation therapy) was significantly higher in group A (73%) than in groups B (52%, P=0.002) and C (26%, P<0.0001). The 5-year survival rates were 52% for group A, 40% for group B, and 23% for group C, respectively. The survival of group A was significantly better than that of groups B (P=0.0157) and C (P<0.0001).Surveillance for HCC at specialized Department of Liver Disease can detect early-stage HCC, resulting in a higher chance of receiving promising treatment.
