Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease decrease in obese adolescents after multidisciplinary therapy. Despite the increasing prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, its pathogenesis and clinical significance remain poorly defined and there is no ideal treatment.The aim of this study was to assess the short-term (12-week) multidisciplinary therapy on visceral adiposity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease control.We evaluated and compared the distribution of visceral adiposity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, by ultrasonography, in 73 post-puberty obese participants (17.01+/-1.6 years old body mass index 36.54+/-2.86 kg/m), submitted to a multidisciplinary treatment without medications, at the beginning and after 12 weeks of intervention. Descriptive and one-way analysis of variance, and paired t-test were performed.The results indicated that after intervention the adolescents had a significant reduction in visceral adiposity (4.05+/-1.55 to 3.37+/-1.44) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease prevalence (from 52 to 29% on the right side and from 48 to 29% on the left side). It is a positive result because nonalcoholic fatty liver disease can progress to cirrhosis, even in children and adolescents.The short-term treatment suggests a profound impact on the control of obesity-related co-morbidities in young people.
