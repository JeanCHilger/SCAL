Hemodynamic effects of terlipressin in patients with bleeding esophageal varices secondary to cirrhosis of liver. To study the hemodynamics of terlipressin in bleeding esophageal varices due to cirrhosis of the liver.A quasi-experimental study.Medical-ICU, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi from February to July 2005.Seventy-eight consecutive patients with bleeding esophageal varices were evaluated. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on history, physical examination, laboratory data and abdominal ultrasound. Blood-pressure and pulse rate were monitored. Injection terlipressin 2 mg intravenous bolus was given followed by 2 mg i/v 6 hourly. Intravenous plasma expanders, whole blood, fresh frozen plasma and platelet concentrates were transfused as needed. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed for evaluation and grading of varices, detection of portal gastropathy, and banding. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied as applicable.Seventy patients of either gender, aged 18 - 95 years were included in the study. Systolic blood-pressure(SP) increased by 7.77 mmHg (mean SP: 108.1 mmHg, SD + 9.84, 95% CI: 105.77 - 110.43 mmHg p-value: 0.0002)Terlipressin had an overall benefit in significant number of patients with bleeding esophageal varices in this series and only a few adverse effects when given at recommended doses.
