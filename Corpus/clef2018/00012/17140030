The role of lamivudine in the treatment of HBe antigen negative liver cirrhosis. Lamivudine is effective in suppressing hepatitis B virus replication and hepatic necroinflammatory activity. Patients with HBV-related chronic liver disease often present with hepatic decompensation and are not eligible for interferon therapy. The effectiveness of antiviral therapy in preventing disease progression in patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of lamivudine treatment in patients with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis B.The study included 24 patients with cirrhosis B. During one year, all of them were treated with Lamivudine (100 mg/day). All patients underwent routine laboratory tests and abdominal ultrasound. After that, they were followed-up from 1-15 months.Most patients presented with improved general condition. We also noticed a reduction in SBP, ALT level, bilirubin level, hepatic encephalopathy and ascites. Five patients died, due to HCC, and two due to variceal bleeding. There was no significant improvement in liver synthetic function.Lamivudine is highly effective in reducing viral load in HBeAg-negative patients significantly improving the clinical and biochemical status of liver functions.
