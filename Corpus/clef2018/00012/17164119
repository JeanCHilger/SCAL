Diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection leads to the development of hepatic fibrosis. No single test for diagnosing liver fibrosis is completely optimal. The ability to assess the extent and progression of fibrosis is important in the clinical setting, especially in the context of current treatments and therapeutic trials. More accurate and noninvasive methods to diagnose and monitor fibrosis are needed, because these trials will require serial evaluations of liver fibrosis to assess a compound's antifibrotic effect.
