Interequipment variability of Doppler ultrasonographic indices in patients with liver cirrhosis. Doppler ultrasongraphy is used to evaluate hemodynamic alternations in patients with liver cirrhosis. Purpose of this study was to determine the interequipment variability of Doppler indices in portal and splenic vein in cirrhosis.Blood velocity, diameter, flow and congestive index in portal and splenic vein were measured by Doppler ultrasonography in 30 patients with cirrhosis using two different machines.Portal venous velocities measured by HDI-5000 and SSD-5000 were 8.72+/-3.69 cm/sec, 12.21+/-2.84 cm/sec, respectively which showed significant difference (P<0.001). Measured portal blood flows and congestive indices also had significant difference between HDI-5000 and SSD-5000 (P<0.01). Splenic venous velocity by HDI-5000 was 8.55+/-2.71 cm/sec, which was lower than that of 12.32+/-3.11 cm/sec by SSD-5000 (P<0.001). Splenic blood flows measured by HDI-5000 and SSD-5000 were 390.73+/-260.98 mL/min, 595.01+/-346.53 mL/min, respectively, showing significant difference (P=0.015). However, no differences were in the diameters of portal and splenic vein between HDI-5000 and SSD-5000.Doppler indices in portal and splenic vein showed significant interequipment variability. Therefore, in liver cirrhosis, hemodynamic investigations using different Doppler ultrasonographic machines is inappropriate.
