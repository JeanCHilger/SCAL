Technology insight: advances in liver imaging. The role of diagnostic imaging in the assessment of liver disease continues to gain in importance. The classic techniques used for liver imaging are ultrasonography, CT and MRI. In the past decade, there have been significant advances in all three techniques. In this article, we discuss the advances in ultrasonography, CT and MRI that have improved assessment of focal and diffuse liver disease, including the development of hardware, software, processing algorithms and procedural innovations.
