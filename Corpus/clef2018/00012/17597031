Giant right atrial myxoma mimicking hepatic cirrhosis: a case report. Cardiac myxomas are rare benign tumors of the heart. The growth rate of these tumors remains unknown. Right atrial myxoma can simulate nonspecific constitutional symptoms, such as remittent or lasting fever, weight loss, and chronic anemia, and may escape timely diagnosis until the development of severe complications such as pulmonary hypertension due to embolism from fragments originating from the tumor mass or blockage of the right atrioventricular ostium or Budd-Chiari syndrome with acute abdominal pain. We present a case of a giant right atrial myxoma mimicking hepatic cirrhosis in a 52-year-old man.
