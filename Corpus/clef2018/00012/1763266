The role and limits of Doppler studies of the uterine arteries. DÃ¶ppler study of the uterine arteries investigates the utero-placental vascular bed. It can be used to identify a population at risk of vascular complications, in particular retroplacental hematoma. This type of study is indicated when there is a history of a vascular problem during pregnancy, as well as following the onset during pregnancy of hypertension, pre-eclampsia, delayed intrauterine growth or thrombocytopenia. The measurement technique avoids neighbouring vessels. An abdominal or vaginal approach may be used. The quality of the signal recorded and compliance with practical technical aspects enable long term prediction of the course of the pregnancy and the organisation of appropriate obstetric monitoring.
