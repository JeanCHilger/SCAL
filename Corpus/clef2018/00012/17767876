A cross-sectional study on liver diseases in the rural residents in southern Guangxi, China. To study the epidemiological characteristics of liver diseases in a rural population in Southern Guangxi, China.The enzyme immunoassays was used to detect of HBsAg and AFP. AFP positive serum samples were further examined for concentration of AFP by using a radio immunoassays. Liver morphological changes were measured with ultrasonography of type B.The positive rates of HBsAg in the studied population was 17.8% (2800/15,701). The prevalence rates of viral hepatitis B, cirrhosis, primary liver cancer, clonorchiasis, fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease were 1.1% (173/15,701), 0.4% (63/15,701), 299.3 per 100,000 (47/15,701), 6.6% (1036/15,701), 4.8% (754/15,701) and 0.3% (47/15,701), respectively. The positive rates of HBsAg and the prevalence rates of viral hepatitis B, cirrhosis, primary liver cancer, clonorchiasis, fatty liver disease in male were significantly higher as compared with those in female (5.98 < or = chi(2) < or = 394.78, P < 0.01). No difference was observed in the prevalence rates of liver cavernous hemangioma and hepatic cysts between male and female. The prevalence rates of intrahepatic bile duct stones was significantly higher in female than in male (chi(2) = 30.80, P < 0.01). The positive rates of HBsAg and the prevalence rates of viral hepatitis B and clonorchiasis were decreased with age. But the prevalence rates of cirrhosis, primary liver cancer, fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, liver cavernous hemangioma, hepatic cysts and intrahepatic bile duct stones were increased with age.The rural areas in the southern Guangxi are high prevalence regions of liver illness, and the male resident are even at high risk.
