Right liver lobe/albumin ratio: contribution to non-invasive assessment of portal hypertension. To study the value of biochemical and ultraso-nographic parameters in prediction of presence and size of esophageal varices.The study includes selected cirrhotic patients who underwent a complete biochemical workup, upper digestive endoscopic and ultrasonographic examinations. Albumin/right liver lobe diameter and platelet count/spleen diameter ratios were calculated. The correlation between calculated ratio and the presence and degree of esophageal varices was evaluated.Ninety-four subjects (62 males, 32 females), with a mean age of 52.32 +/- 13.60 years, were studied. Child-Pugh class A accounted for 42.6%, class B 37.2%, whereas class C 20.2%. Esophageal varices (OE) were not demonstrated by upper digestive endoscopy in 24.5%, while OE grade I was found in 22.3% patients, grade II in 33.0%, grade III in 16.0%, and grade IV in 4.3%. The mean value of right liver lobe diameter/albumin ratio was 5.51 +/- 1.82 (range from 2.76 to 11.44), while the mean platelet count/spleen diameter ratio was 1017.75 +/- 729.36 (range from 117.39 to 3362.50), respectively. Statistically significant correlation was proved by Spearman's test between OE grade and calculated ratios. The P values were 0.481 and -0.686, respectively.The right liver lobe diameter/albumin and platelet count/spleen diameter ratios are non-invasive parameters providing accurate information pertinent to determination of presence of esophageal varices, and their grading in patients with liver cirrhosis.
