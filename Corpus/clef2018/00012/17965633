Non invasive markers using for the assessment of fibrosis in hepatitis C. Non invasive fibrosis markers, recently developed, are now an interesting alternative to liver biopsy in order to appreciate the severity of chronic hepatitis C. Serological markers, especially Fibrotest and Fibrometer, have a good diagnostic accuracy to discriminate patients with mild fibrosis to those with severe fibrosis. For intermediate stages, the discordance is very important and often justifies liver biopsy or using of several markers. Transient elastography (Fibroscan) is a new non invasive method subject to good conditions of utilisation. Diagnostic accuracy is improved by the using of all the markers, especially of Fibrotest. Transient elastography is also a promising method for assessing the severity of cirrhosis.
