Management of hepatitis C among drug user patients. Opiate substitution treatments radically changed the care management of HCV among drug user patients. Thanks to substitution, it is possible to treat HCV among these patients even with ongoing drug abuse. Overall, in terms of response to treatment, observance, adverse side effects and premature interruptions of treatment, the results are comparable with those observed among non drug addict patients. It is advisable nevertheless to create specific conditions which favour this total care management. The non-invasive fibrosis tests largely improve access to care as compared to liver biopsy. A multidisciplinary team is essential in addressing the associated problem of addiction, hepatitis C and psychiatric co-morbidities. HCV prevails strongly among patients in centres for drug users. These structures are particularly adapted to the management of HCV with the assistance of multidisciplinary teams and access to the non-invasive tests.
