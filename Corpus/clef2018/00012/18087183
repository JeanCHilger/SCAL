Superiority of CT arterioportal angiography to contrast-enhanced CT and MRI in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in nodules smaller than 2 cm. To evaluate the effectiveness of computed tomography (CT) arterioportal angiography in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in nodules smaller than 2 cm, we compared the findings of CT during arteriography (CTA) and CT during arterial portography (CTAP) with those of enhanced CT and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Sixty-eight nodules smaller than 2 cm in 53 patients with liver cirrhosis were classified into three groups of CTA and CTAP: (group 1) hyperattenuation on CTA, and hypoattenuation on CTAP (56 nodules, 41 patients) (group 2) hypoattenuation on CTA, and hypoattenuation on CTAP (10 nodules, 10 patients)
