Acute viral hepatitis increases liver stiffness values measured by transient elastography. Liver tissue alterations other than fibrosis may have an impact on liver stiffness measurement. In this study we evaluated 18 patients without a previous clinical history of liver disease, consecutively admitted for acute viral hepatitis. In each patient, aminotransferase determination and liver stiffness measurement were performed on the same study day, at 3 different points: (1) peak increase in aminotransferase (2) aminotransferase 50% or less of the peak
