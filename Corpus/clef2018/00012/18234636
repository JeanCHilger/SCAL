Color Doppler velocity profile and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in assessment of liver cirrhosis. This study was designed to probe the clinical value in assessing the degree of liver cirrhosis by using the arrival time of contrast agent in the right portal vein in contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, as well as the velocity and flow volume in the right portal vein using the color Doppler velocity profile technique.Twenty-eight patients with HBV post-hepatic cirrhosis were grouped into compensated (13 patients) and decompensated cirrhosis (15) 30 patients without hepatic cirrhosis served as controls. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. All the patients with hepatic cirrhosis were pathologically confirmed by percutaneous biopsy. SonoVue was injected to detect the arrival time in the right portal vein. The velocity and flow volume in the right portal vein were measured. The value of each parameter was compared for correlation analysis.The arrival time in the right portal vein in the cirrhosis group was much longer than that in the control group (24.92+/-1.34 vs. 20.81+/-0.55 sec, respectively, P<0.01). The mean velocity, maximal velocity and flow volume in the cirrhosis group were much lower than those in the control group (10.64+/-0.84 vs. 14.78+/-0.71 cm/sec, 13.68+/-1.02 vs. 17.30+/-0.68 cm/sec and 358.72+/-23.63 vs. 438.61+/-16.86 ml/min, respectively, P<0.01). With the development of cirrhosis, the arrival time in the right portal vein was longer (P<0.05), and the velocity and flow volume was lower (P<0.01). There was a negative correlation between arrival time and mean velocity, maximal velocity and flow volume in the right portal vein in the cirrhosis group (r=-0.547, P<0.01 r=-0.508, P<0.05With the development of liver cirrhosis, the arrival time of contrast agent in the right portal vein is gradually prolonged, whereas the velocity and flow volume in this vein decreases markedly, and there is a negative correlation between the results of the two methods.
