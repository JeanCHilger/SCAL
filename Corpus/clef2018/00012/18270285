Transcatheter embolization of a pseudoaneurysm of the inferior epigastric artery with N-butyl cyanoacrylate. A 41-year-old man presented with alcoholic liver cirrhosis with ascites and clotting abnormality. After therapeutic paracentesis, haemoperitoneum ensued without colour Doppler ultrasound or CT evidence of pseudoaneurysm or haematoma at the site of paracentesis. However, an angiogram of the inferior epigastric artery revealed an obvious small pseudoaneurysm arising from its small muscular branch, and this pseudoaneurysm was successfully treated by transcatheter embolization with N-butyl cyanoacrylate. Transcatheter embolization with N-butyl cyanoacrylate is useful treatment for pseudoaneurysms arising from the small muscular branch of the inferior epigastric artery, which cannot be catheterized superselectively close to the pseudoaneurysm.
