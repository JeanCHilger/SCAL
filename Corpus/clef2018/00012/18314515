Three-dimensional sonographic volumetry of the gestational sac and the amniotic sac in the first trimester. The purpose of this study was to measure the volumes of the gestational sac and amniotic sac in normal pregnancies during the first trimester with 3-dimensional sonography to prepare nomograms.One hundred fifty-one patients between 6 and 12 weeks' gestation were studied. Nine aborted and were excluded, leaving 142 patients for evaluation. Inclusion criteria were a singleton viable pregnancy shown by transvaginal sonography and continuation of the pregnancy beyond 24 weeks. Women with known thrombophilia or fetal malformations were excluded. In all patients, gestational sac and amniotic sac volumes were measured by 3-dimensional transvaginal sonography with virtual organ computer-aided analysis software.The mean gestational sac volume was 20.35 mL (range, 0.7-113 mL) and correlated closely with the gestational age (GA) (r2 = 0.769 P < .001) and crown-rump length (CRL) (r2 = 0.823Gestational sac and amniotic sac volumes show excellent correlation with the GA and CRL and hence may be used for determining the GA. Larger studies are needed to determine the importance of these volumes in predicting normal pregnancy outcomes and whether these volumes can be used in the management of pregnancies at risk for abortion.
