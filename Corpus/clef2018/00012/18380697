Prenatal thrombosis of torcular Herophili with spontaneous resolution and normal outcome. Prenatal thrombosis of torcular Herophili is a rare condition. It may be suspected during the routine ultrasonographic follow-up of the fetus, but MRI is necessary to establish the diagnosis. There are 7 reported cases with various results.We report a case of prenatal torcular Herophili thrombosis. We present 2 series of fetal MRIs. The first one was performed at 21 and the second at 37 weeks' gestation.The second MRI revealed a total resolution of the thrombus. The product was a neurologically intact infant with normal development.This is the fourth reported case of fetal torcular Herophili thrombosis with normal outcome. There are no sufficient data regarding the best management of this rare condition however, following up with fetal MRIs seems to be the most rational choice.
