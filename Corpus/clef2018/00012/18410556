Prospective evaluation of transient elastography for the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis in Asians: comparison with liver biopsy and aspartate transaminase platelet ratio index. Transient elastography (TE) is a reliable non-invasive predictor of hepatic fibrosis, but data on TE in Asians are limited.To evaluate prospectively the accuracy of TE for diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis in Asians compared with APRI (aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index).One hundred and twenty consecutive patients who underwent liver biopsy were enrolled. TE (Fibroscan) was performed by two independent operators. Fibrosis was graded by two independent pathologists using the METAVIR classification. Area under receiver operating curves (AUROC) were used to evaluate the accuracy of TE and APRI in diagnosing significant fibrosis (F >or= 2) and cirrhosis (F4).Predominant aetiologies were hepatitis B (48%), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (14%) and hepatitis C (8%). TE was unsuccessful in five patients (4.2%) because of small inter-costal space (three patients), obesity and ascites. There was good correlation between TE and fibrosis (r = 0.606). AUROC for diagnosis of significant fibrosis was 0.856 (95% CI 0.779-0.932) for TE and 0.673 (95% CI 0.568-0.777) for APRI. AUROC for diagnosis of cirrhosis was 0.924 (95% CI 0.857-0.990) for TE and 0.626 (95% CI 0.437-0.815) for APRI. Optimal TE value was 9.0 kPa for diagnosis of significant fibrosis and 16.0 kPa for cirrhosis with specificity/sensitivity/PPV/NPV/accuracy of 82.6%/85.2%/80.9%/86.7%/84.1% and 88.9%/82.7%/32.0%/98.8%/83.2%, respectively.Transient elastography is a reliable predictor of hepatic fibrosis in Asians. Failure of TE in Asians is commonly because of small inter-costal space. TE is superior to APRI for non-invasive diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.
