Amniotic fluid embolism. Diagnostic criteria in two fatal cases. Amniotic fluid embolism still remains an important cause of maternal mortality. We present information obtained by echocardiography and right cardiac catheterization of two patients who developed amniotic fluid embolism and died from shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation despite intensive medical treatment. Although the pathophysiology remains controversial, amniotic fluid embolism can be presumptively diagnosed and managed with hemodynamic values and echocardiography.
