Hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic liver disease: functional computed tomography with perfusion imaging in the assessment of tumor vascularization. Our goal was to prospectively determine the value of perfusion computed tomography (CT) in the quantitative assessment of tumor-related angiogenesis in cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Forty-seven patients met all the following inclusion criteria: 1) Child-Pugh class A or B liver cirrhosis 2) presence of a single lesion suspected as HCC at screening ultrasound examinationHCC was diagnosed in 21 of the 47 patients in the remaining 26, HCC was not found at contrast-enhanced ultrasound and multidetector 16-slice computed tomographic study. The values of perfusion parameters measured within tumor tissue were: P (ml/s/100 g): median = 47.0 (first quartile = 36.0, third quartile = 61.4)In cirrhotic patients with HCC, perfusion computed tomographic technique can provide quantitative information about tumor-related angiogenesis.
