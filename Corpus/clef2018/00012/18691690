A history of preeclampsia identifies women who have underlying cardiovascular risk factors. The objective of this study was to prospectively assess physical and biochemical cardiovascular risk markers in women who had developed preeclampsia (PE) at 1 year postpartum.Following an overnight fast, previously PE (n = 70) and normotensive women (n = 70) had weight and blood pressure recorded and levels of morning blood for insulin, glucose, C-reactive protein, lipids, cholesterol, and urine for microalbumin and creatinine measured. Body mass index, homeostatic model assessment index, and incidence of metabolic syndrome were determined.At 1 year postpartum, markers of cardiovascular disease were different between the groups. There were also differences in the number of women with abnormal values. Mathematical modeling of cardiovascular event risk suggests that PE increases the risk by 2- to 3-fold the risk was greatest for women with severe PE.The development of PE is 1 of the earliest clinically identifiable markers of a woman's heightened risk of cardiovascular disease.
