Transient elastography for diagnosing liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis is a known complication to chronic liver diseases. The reference method for diagnosing and assessing the progression of fibrosis or cirrhosis is histological examination of liver tissue. Since there is a slight but significant risk from every invasive procedure, a non-invasive method has been sought. Transient elastography is a new noninvasive method of assessing fibrosis by measuring liver stiffness. The method is described in the article, as well as its diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, and the reproducibility is briefly discussed by evaluating some studies.
