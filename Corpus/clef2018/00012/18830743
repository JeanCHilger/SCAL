Acute increase in hepatic arterial flow during TIPS identified by intravascular flow measurements. The purpose of this study was to investigate alterations of hepatic arterial flow during transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPS) applying intravascular Doppler sonography. This prospective monocenter study included 25 patients with liver cirrhosis (alcohol induced [n = 19], chronic hepatitis associated [n = 3], primary biliary cirrhosis associated [n = 1], and cryptogenic [n = 2]) successfully treated with TIPS. All patients underwent intravascular hepatic arterial flow measurements during TIPS using an endoluminal flow sensor. The average arterial peak velocity (APV) and the maximum arterial peak velocity (MPV) were registered. Twenty-two patients (88%) showed increased APV, one patient (4%) showed unaffected APV, and two patients (8%) showed decreased APV after TIPS. The average portosystemic pressure gradient decreased significantly, from 22.0 +/- 5.1 mmHg before TIPS to 11.0 +/- 4.1 mmHg after TIPS (-50.0% p < 0.0001). The average APV increased significantly, from 41.9 +/- 17.8 cm/s before TIPS to 60.7 +/- 19.0 cm/s after TIPS (+44.9%
