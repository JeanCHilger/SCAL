Focal nodular hyperplasia-like lesion with venous washout in alcoholic liver cirrhosis. A case of 22 mm hypervascular nodule in segment two of the liver but without hepatitis B or C virus infection in a 32-year-old Japanese woman with a history of alcohol abuse is presented. Imaging studies such as contrast-enhanced ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed hypervascularity in the early phase and venous washout in the late phase. Histologically, stellate scar-like fibrous septa, pericellular fibrosis, fatty change, neutrophilic infiltration, slight increase of cell density, and diffuse capillarization of the sinusoids together with small unpaired arteries were observed. The nodule was diagnosed as focal nodular hyperplasia-like lesion in alcoholic liver cirrhosis.
