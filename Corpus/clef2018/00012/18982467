Internal radiotherapy using 32P colloid or microsphere for refractory solid tumors. The aim of this work was to study the effectiveness of 32P colloids or microspheres, by arterial interventional administration or stromal injection in the treatment of refractory solid tumors.By arterial intervention, under the guidance of computerized tomography, X-ray, ultrasonogram, or under direct vision of the surgical field, 32P microspheres (259-685 MBq) or radioactive colloid (281-666 MBq) was administered to 60 cases with refractory solid tumors. Tumor inhibition rate, side effects, survival period, and so on were observed.The tumor growth was obviously inhibited after the intratumoral injection of 32P colloid. The average survival time in the 60 cases was 35 months with a high tumor inhibition rate (93.4%). Thirty-one cases were completely relieved (51.7%), and 25 cases achieved partial remission (PR, 41.7%). One case with right lobe hepatocellular carcinoma has survived 90 months. The drug was ineffective only in four cases, including one patient who died of gastrointestinal hemorrhage and three of hepatic failure. No other obvious side effects were observed. Intratumoral necrosis, intense fibrosis in the tumor mass, and an integrated capsule encompassing the tumor were revealed by histological examination.Arterial interventional administration or stromal injection with 32P microspheres or colloid revealed a very fair clinical effectiveness in the treatment of refractory solid tumors. The range of safe effective dosage for 32P glass microspheres and 32P chromic phosphate in one treatment course is 555-740 MBq and 185-370 MBq, respectively.
