Primary liver carcinoma in the Subotica City Hospital 1962-1990. The authors have presented their observations in 108 pathologically processed cases of primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC). The material includes the period from 1962 to 1990. The most frequent form of PHC was hepatocellular (67.5%), the cholangiocellular (29.5%) and rarest, the mixed hepato-cholangiocellular form (2.9%). X-ray diagnostics were applied (celiacography, arteriography), laparoscopy, ultrasonography, aimed and blind aspirational biopsy, and laboratory examinations (alkaline phosphatase, transaminases, bilirubin, gamma-CT and so on). Somewhat more attention is given to the problem of HBV infection as the cause of primary hepatic carcinoma development. Pre-existing liver tissue diseases are also pleaded for (chronic aggressive hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, ect.). Beside the many diagnostic procedures, the diagnosis of primary hepatic carcinoma is usually established too late, and the therapy still remains unsatisfactory.
