Ultrasound attenuation and texture analysis of diffuse liver disease: methods and preliminary results. A study was performed to find and test quantitative methods of analysing echographic signals for the differentiation of diffuse liver diseases. An on-line data acquisition system was used to acquire radiofrequency (RF) echo signals from volunteers and patients. Several methods to estimate the frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient were evaluated, in which a correction for the frequency and depth-dependent diffraction and focusing effects caused by the sound beam was applied. Using the estimated value of the attenuation coefficient the RF signals themselves were corrected to remove the depth dependencies caused by the sound beam and by the frequency-dependent attenuation. After this preprocessing the envelope of the corrected RF signals was calculated and B-mode images were reconstructed. The texture was analysed in the axial direction by first- and second-order statistical methods. The accuracy and precision of the attenuation methods were assessed by using computer simulated RF signals and RF data obtained from a tissue-mimicking phantom. The phantom measurements were also used to test the performance of the methods to correct for the depth dependencies. The echograms of 163 persons, both volunteers and patients suffering from a diffuse liver disease (cirrhosis, hepatitis, haemochromatosis), were recorded. The mutual correlations between the estimated parameters were used to preselect parameters contributing independent information, and which can subsequently be used in a discriminant analysis to differentiate between the various diseased conditions.
