Liver histology according to the presence of metabolic syndrome in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease cases. To investigate the histologic features of the liver in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) cases according to the presence of metabolic syndrome or its individual components.We enrolled 81 patients (40 male, 41 female) who were diagnosed with fatty liver by ultrasonographic scan and fulfilled the inclusion criteria. First anamnesis, anthropometric, clinical, laboratory and imaging features of all participants were recorded and then liver biopsy was performed after gaining consent from patients. Diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was dependent on patients having 3 or more out of 5 risk criteria defined by the WHO. Biopsy specimens were assessed according to Brunt et al's classification.Sixty-nine of the 81 patients had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 11 had simple fatty liver and 1 had cirrhosis according to histologic evaluation. Comparisons were made between two groups of NASH patients, those with and without metabolic syndrome. We did not detect statistically significant differences in liver histology between NASH patients with and without metabolic syndrome.NASH can progress without metabolic risk factors or the presence of metabolic syndrome.
