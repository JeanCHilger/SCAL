N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide as a diagnostic test in cirrhotic patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The aim of this study was to assessed the correlation of N-terminal natriuretic peptide type B (NT-proBNP) with echocardiographic and hemodynamic indexes of right ventricular (RV) function and to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of Doppler echocardiography in the diagnosis of portopulmonary hypertension.All patients underwent liver transplantation for cirrhosis. We obtained clinical data, NT-proBNP levels, echocardiography, and right heart hemodynamic measurements before transplantation.Patients with pulmonary hypertension displayed significantly higher levels of NT-proBNP. They also showed higher model for End-stage Liver Disease scores and higher indices of RV overload on cardiac hemodynamics. The negative predictive value of echocardiography to identify pulmonary hypertension was 83%. A correlation was not observed between systolic pulmonary artery pressures measured by the two methods however, NTproBNP showed a trend toward a significant correlation with mean pulmonary pressure as determined by hemodynamics (r = .3We concluded that NT-proBNP values showed significant correlations with pulmonary hypertension that could assist in a noninvasive diagnoseis for this group of patients.
