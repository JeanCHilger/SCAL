Liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C and persistently normal liver enzymes: influence of HIV infection. Liver fibrosis progress slowly in patients with chronic hepatitis C and persistently normal alanine aminotransferase (PNALT) compared to subjects with elevated aminotransferases. Differences in liver fibrosis according to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status in this population have not been examined. All patients with serum hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA and PNALT who underwent liver fibrosis assessment using elastometry since 2004 at three different European hospitals were evaluated. Patients previously treated with interferon were excluded. PNALT was defined as ALT below the upper limit of normality in at least three consecutive determinations within the last 12 months. Fibrosis stage was defined as mild (Metavir F0-F1) if stiffness < or =7.1 kPa moderate (F2) if 7.2-9.4 kPa
