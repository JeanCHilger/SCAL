Parametric exploration of the liver by magnetic resonance methods. MRI, as a completely noninvasive technique, can provide quantitative assessment of perfusion, diffusion, viscoelasticity and metabolism, yielding diverse information about liver function. Furthermore, pathological accumulations of iron and lipids can be quantified. Perfusion MRI with various contrast agents is commonly used for the detection and characterization of focal liver disease and the quantification of blood flow parameters. An extended new application is the evaluation of the therapeutic effect of antiangiogenic drugs on liver tumours. Novel, but already widespread, is a histologically validated relaxometry method using five gradient echo sequences for quantifying liver iron content elevation, a measure of inflammation, liver disease and cancer. Because of the high perfusion fraction in the liver, the apparent diffusion coefficients strongly depend on the gradient factors used in diffusion-weighted MRI. While complicating analysis, this offers the opportunity to study perfusion without contrast injection. Another novel method, MR elastography, has already been established as the only technique able to stage fibrosis or diagnose mild disease. Liver fat content is accurately determined with multivoxel MR spectroscopy (MRS) or by faster MRI methods that are, despite their widespread use, prone to systematic error. Focal liver disease characterisation will be of great benefit once multivoxel methods with fat suppression are implemented in proton MRS, in particular on high-field MR systems providing gains in signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution.
