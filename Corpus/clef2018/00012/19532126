The use of E/A ratio as a predictor of outcome in cirrhotic patients treated with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. The clinical significance of diastolic dysfunction in cirrhosis, a feature of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of E/A ratio, an indicator of diastolic dysfunction, to predict ascites clearance and mortality after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPS) insertion.A total of 101 cirrhotic patients who received TIPS had pre-TIPS assessments of demographics, severity of liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores), renal function, hemodynamics, and cardiac function (two-dimensional echocardiography). An E/A ratio of < or =1 was used to indicate diastolic dysfunction. Patients were followed-up for a mean period of 24.6+/-2.4 months post TIPS.A total of 41 patients with an E/A ratio of < or =1 (group A), and 60 patients with an E/A ratio of >1 (group B) were studied. Group A had significantly higher MELD scores (14.0+/-1.0 vs. 11.4+/-0.8 P=0.03), because of higher serum creatinine levels (107+/-5 vs. 86+/-6 micromol/lDiastolic dysfunction, indicated by reduced E/A ratio, is prevalent in advanced cirrhosis and is associated with reduced ascites clearance and increased mortality post TIPS, possibly related to worsening of hemodynamic dysfunction in the post-TIPS period.
