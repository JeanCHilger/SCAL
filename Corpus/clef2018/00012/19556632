Venous thrombotic complications in pregnancy: way of prophylaxis and therapy. The aim of this investigation was to study various aspects of hereditary thromboses in pregnant women with gene anomalies (considering regulatory role of genes in hemostasis in norm and in hereditary diseases that disturb blood coagulation). In comparative aspect frequency of occurrence of hereditary thrombogenic anomalies (F-V-L, F-II-20210, MTHFR) in healthy women during and after pregnancy, in pregnant women with thrombosis and in those who had thrombosis in previous pregnancy was studied. Patients were divided into four groups. The first group included 103 pregnant women with signs of a thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, varicose veins expansion of lower limbs etc. in anamnesis. The second group was composed of 110 women with surface varicose veins expansion of lower limbs during the pregnancy. The third group consisted of 90 not pregnant women with varicose veins expansion. The fourth group (control) consisted of 76 pregnant women without thrombogenic anomalies. All the examinations were performed by a standard technique (three-dimensional color Doppler sonography. Pregnant women were treated with direct action anticoagulants in case of thrombotic and prethrombotic conditions. A policy for individualized treatment is needed in pregnant women with hereditary thrombogenic anomalies to determine the doses and the period of anticoagulant therapy.
