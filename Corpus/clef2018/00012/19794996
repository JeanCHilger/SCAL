Increased transforming growth factor-beta1 in alcohol dependence. Ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde increase transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) expression in animal studies. TGF-beta1 is related with the hepatic stellate cell (the key element of hepatic fibrogenesis) and the radial glia (the key element of neuronal migration). Blood samples were collected from 41 patients with alcohol dependence, TGF-beta1 levels measured by ELISA were compared with 41 normal subjects. Plasma TGF-beta1 levels in the patients with alcohol dependence (1,653.11+/-532.45 pg/mL) were significantly higher than those of healthy subjects (669.87+/-366.53 pg/mL) (P=0.000). Patients with or without liver pathology showed no difference in TGF-beta1 (P=0.36). Increased TGF-beta1 may mediate deleterious effect of alcohol such as hepatic fibrosis and suppressed neuronal developments in alcohol dependence patients.
