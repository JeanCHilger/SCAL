Transient elastography assessment of the liver stiffness dynamics during acute hepatitis B. The diagnostic accuracy of transient elastography (TE) for assessment of hepatic fibrosis is hampered by several factors, including acute parenchymal injury. Evaluation of liver stiffness (LS) using TE during acute hepatitis B may help to assess chronic hepatitis B patients with flares.Twelve patients consecutively referred for acute hepatitis B, underwent sequential examinations with TE and laboratory examinations for 24 weeks.On admission, aminotransferase ranged from 487 to 6067 IU/l (median=2590 IU/l) and LS ranged from 7.1 to 57 kPa (median=15.6 kPa) with nine (75%) patients showing LS greater than 11.9 kPa, that is, the predictive cutoff for cirrhosis. LS levels correlated significantly with bilirubin, only (r=0.58, P<0.05). During follow-up, LS declined from 15.6 to 5.2 kPa at week 24, with a significant reduction being observed at week 2 for aminotransferase (from 2590 to 452 IU/l, P<0.0001) and at week 6 for both LS (from 15.6 to 6.0 kPa, P=0.008) and bilirubin (from 10.7 to 0.95 mg/dl, P<0.01). Median decline of LS significantly correlated with bilirubin decline (rs=0.70, P<0.05). At week 24, 10 (83%) patients showed LS of less than 7.9 kPa and two (17%) patients had LS values between 7.9 and 11.9 kPa, including the only patient who developed chronic hepatitis B.In patients with acute hepatitis B, the initial high values of LS mimicking LS cutoff of cirrhosis, likely reflect the liver cell inflammation, oedema and swelling as they progressively taper down during hepatitis resolution.
