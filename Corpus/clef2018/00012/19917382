Single-center experience of 253 portal vein thrombosis patients undergoing liver transplantation in China. We sought to review the etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and surgical options for 253 patients with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) to assess the the impact of PVT on outcomes.We retrospectively analyzed the data from 2508 adult patients undergoing 2614 OLTs in our center from September 1998 to July 2007. PVT was scored according to the operative findings and Yerdel grading of PVT. No prisoners were used as donors for this study.Two hundred fifty-three patients were diagnosed with PVT (10.09%): there were 104 grade I 114, grade IIOLT was successfully performed for PVT patients. The grade of PVT decided the surgical strategy. Similar 1-year survival rates were attained between PVT patients and controls undergoing OLT.
