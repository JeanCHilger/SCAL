Feline cholangitis/ chonlangiohepatitis complex secondary to Platynosomum fastosum infection in a cat. Platynosomiasis has been associated with cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis complex in domestic cats. Despite being typically asymptomatic, some individuals may develop severe disease resulting in hepatic cirrhosis. Definitive diagnosis by means of parasite eggs direct visualization is not always possible and complementary tests should be associated. This paper reports a case of a three-year-old female cat with anorexia and jaundice. Ultrasound and biochemistry laboratory findings as well as liver biopsy were not conclusive. Definitive diagnosis of intense Platynosomum fastosum infestation was only possible through direct examination of biliary fluid at necropsy, stressing the importance of including platynosomiasis, commonly an underdiagnosed disease, among differential diagnoses of feline liver diseases.
