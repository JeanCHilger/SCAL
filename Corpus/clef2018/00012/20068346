Non-invasive evaluation of hepatic fibrosis for type C chronic hepatitis. The aim of this study was to investigate liver fibrosis using non-invasive Real-time Tissue Elastography (RTE) and transient elastography (FibroScan) methods.RTE, FibroScan and percutaneous liver biopsy were all performed on patients with chronic liver disease, particularly hepatitis C, to investigate liver fibrosis.FibroScan and RTE were compared for fibrous liver staging (F stage), which was pathologically classified using liver biopsy. In FibroScan, significant differences were observed between F1/F3 and F2/F4, but no such differences were observed between F1/F2, F2/F3 and F3/F4. In RTE, significant differences were observed between F1/F2, F2/F3 and F2/F4. But for F3/F4, no significant differences were observed.FibroScan and RTE correlated well with F staging of the liver. In particular RTE was more successful than FibroScan in diagnosing the degree of liver fibrosis.
