Early detection of hepatobiliary involvement in children with mucoviscidosis using duplex sonography of the portal system. To investigate early signs of hepatobiliary disease in CF, we measured portal, splenic, superior mesenteric vein and hepatic artery diameters, maximal flow velocity (Vmax) and time average velocity (TAV) in 25 males and 17 females with CF. Hepatic artery resistance, regional blood flow and liver perfusion were calculated. According to liver enzyme data (aminotransferases raised greater than 30 U/l) and sonographic findings (nodular changes), there were 17 CF-patients (mean age 11.4 yrs range 0.75-31) with and 25 CF-patients (mean age 7.8 yrs
