Complication rate of percutaneous liver biopsies among persons with advanced chronic liver disease in the HALT-C trial. Although percutaneous liver biopsy is a standard diagnostic procedure, it has drawbacks, including risk of serious complications. It is not known whether persons with advanced chronic liver disease have a greater risk of complications from liver biopsy than patients with more mild, chronic liver disease. The safety and complications of liver biopsy were examined in patients with hepatitis C-related bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis who were enrolled in the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment against Cirrhosis trial.Standard case report forms from 2740 liver biopsies performed at 10 study sites between 2000 and 2006 were reviewed for serious adverse events, together with information from questionnaires completed by investigators about details of biopsy techniques used at each hospital.There were 29 serious adverse events (1.1%) the most common was bleeding (16 casesApproximately 0.5% of persons with hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis experienced potentially serious bleeding after liver biopsy risk increased significantly in patients with platelet counts of 60,000/mm(3) or less.
