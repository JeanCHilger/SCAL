Cholangiocarcinoma in Italy: A national survey on clinical characteristics, diagnostic modalities and treatment. Results from the "Cholangiocarcinoma" committee of the Italian Association for the Study of Liver disease. Very few studies assessed cholangiocarcinoma clinical characteristics.To evaluate the clinical characteristics of intra-hepatic (IH) and extra-hepatic (EH)-CCA.We performed a national survey based on a questionnaire.218 cholangiocarcinomas were observed (47% EH-CCA, 53% IH-CCA) with an age at the diagnosis higher for EH-CCA. Coexistence of cirrhosis or viral cirrhosis was more frequent in IH-CCA than EH-CCA. An incidental asymptomatic presentation occurred in 28% of IH-CCA vs 4% EH-CCA whilst, 74% EH-CCA vs 28% IH-CCA presented with jaundice. 91% of IH-CCA presented as a single intra-hepatic mass, whilst 50% of EH-CCA was peri-hilar. In the diagnostic work-up, 70% of all cholangiocarcinoma cases received at least 3 different imaging procedures. Tissue-proven diagnosis was obtained in 80% cholangiocarcinoma. Open surgery with curative intent was performed in 45% of IH-CCA and 29% EH-CCA. 18% IH-CCA vs 4% EH-CCA did not received treatment.In Italy IH-CCA is managed as frequently as EH-CCA. In comparison to EH-CCA, IH-CCA occurs at younger age and is more frequently associated with cirrhosis and with an incidental asymptomatic presentation. In contrast, most EH-CCAs are jaundiced at the diagnosis. Cholangiocarcinoma diagnostic management is cost- and time-consuming with curative surgical treatment applicable more frequently in IH-CCA.
