Effect of the administration of statins in non-cardiac critical disease. Administration of statins has been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality. Their benefit could expand towards other areas of intensive medicine, it being possible to decrease mortality of the critically ill patient. There are several studies, although without a high level of evidence, that have detected a possible benefit when they are administered as well as clinical deterioration when they are discontinued, compared to those patients who had previously taken them. Even though most of the patients who had previously taken statins did so as primary or secondary prevention, thus having greater comorbidity, overall, a decrease is detected in the mortality of these subgroups. This benefit could be generalized to all the critical conditions, although studies with a higher level of evidence are needed for their adequate comparison.
