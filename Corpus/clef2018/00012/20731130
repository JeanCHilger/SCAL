Splenoportal blood flow with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of this study was to characterise by duplex Doppler sonography the splenoportal venous and arterial blood flow in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) depending on the grade of biopsy proven steatosis.37 patients with NAFLD were examined: 22 female and 15 male average age 46,8 +/- 10,2 (29-62), with IBM 33,5 +/- 4,8 (28-42). The grade of steatosis was estimated by morphological investigation according to Brunt classification (1999). Colour Doppler sonography was performed by the same researcher using Doppler system Vivid-pro-7, USA with a 3,5 MHz convex probe.Alterations were detected in the following parameters: increase of portal and splenic vein diameters, slow-down of blood flow velocity in the portal and splenic veins, increase of the congestion index, decrease of systolic and diastolic blood flow velocity in the common hepatic and splenic artery, increase of pulsatility and resistance indexes of these arteries, increase of portal hypertensive index and decrease of liver vascular index according to the progression of steatosis with maximal negative dynamics of all characteristics in patients with III grade of steatosis. The closest correlative connections were revealed between the grade of steatosis and congestion index (r = 0.81), portal hypertensive index (r = 0.79), and negative connection--with liver vascular index (r = -0.69).Using Doppler sonography we have detected a deterioration of venous and arterial splenoportal hemodynamics in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in connection with the progression of steatosis, therefore this method may be used as a noninvasive way to estimation the grade of steatosis, establish the diagnosis of portal hypertension and detect the formation of liver cirrhosis.
