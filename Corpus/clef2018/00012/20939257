Screening of chronic diseases and chronic disease risk factors in two rural communities in Kosovo. A cross-sectional study was carried out in Velika Hoca and Orahovac, two rural communities in Kosovo and Metohia, with the aim of assessing the prevalence of chronic diseases and associated risk factors.The study involved 423 (180 male) adult inhabitants aged 51 +/- 16 years and included an interview, medical documentation, physical, ultrasound, laboratory examinations and ECG.Hyperlipidemia was the most frequent (70%) risk factor followed by alcohol consumption (47%), hypertension (42%), smoking (36%) and obesity (32%). Ischemic heart disease was diagnosed in 25 patients, hypertensive cardiomyopathy in 17, other cardiomyopathies in 5 and arrhythmia in 20 patients. Nine persons had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Previously diagnosed liver cirrhosis occurred in 5 and chronic hepatitis in 8 subjects, while liver steatosis with elevated serum transaminases (22 persons), elevated transaminases with normal ultrasound (20 persons), tumor or suspected tumor (7 persons) were detected in the survey. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most prevalent but peptic ulcer and gastritis had been previously diagnosed in 64 and 47 patients. Kidney and urinary tract diseases were known for 52 patients (12 with chronic renal failure and 4 on hemodialysis) and 46 more were detected in the study. Among them in 22 patients with markers of kidney disease and unclear diagnosis 12 had a positive family history, 8 low-grade proteinuria, 14 tubular dysfunctions and 7 eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2.In the Serbian enclave of Velika HoEa and Orahovac the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases was similar to that of gastrointestinal, liver and kidney diseases. This differs from other parts of Serbia where cardiovascular disorders are the leading cause of disease burden.
