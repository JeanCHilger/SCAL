Transient elastography for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis. Transient elastography (FibroScan(Â®)) is a noninvasive method proposed for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases by measuring liver stiffness. It can be easily performed at the bedside or in the outpatient clinic with immediate results and good reproducibility. FibroScan is validated for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis C, in recurrence of hepatitis C after liver transplantation, in co-infected HIV-HCV patients, in chronic hepatitis B, in chronic cholestatic diseases, in alcoholic disease and in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. FibroScan is an excellent tool for the early detection of cirrhosis and for the evaluation of portal hypertension, and may have prognostic value in this setting. FibroScan evaluates liver stiffness, which is related to fibrosis, but also inflammation and portal hypertension. Therefore, FibroScan values have to be interpreted according to clinical, biological and morphological data.
