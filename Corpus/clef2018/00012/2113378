Turtleback liver on CT and ultrasound: Schistosoma japonica revisited. Schistosomiasis in its many forms still presents a major public health challenge. Its tendency to cause dystrophic calcification makes it ideal for radiologic study. With population movement the disease may be encountered in unexpected countries especially with the sensitivity of CT to the presence of calcium. S. japonica produces pathognomonic "turtleback" calcification in the liver, in association with hepatic fibrosis but not necessarily cirrhosis. This paper illustrates a classic case and reviews the literature.
