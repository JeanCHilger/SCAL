Cervical varices complicated by thrombosis in pregnancy. We present a case of a 36-year-old pregnant woman with varicose veins of the uterine cervix diagnosed during the second trimester. The cervical tissue was completely replaced with dilated venous plexus. Therapeutic decisions were further complicated by the presence of blood clots within the dilated vessels. Pregnancy proceeded uneventfully, no bleeding occurred and the patient underwent a planned Cesarean delivery. This is the first reported case in the medical literature where the rare phenomenon of cervical varices was accompanied by thrombosis.
