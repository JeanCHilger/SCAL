Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and systemic inflammatory reaction in hepatic cirrhosis patients. To develop criteria of early diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in hepatic cirrhosis (HC).Clinical symptoms of SBP including systemic inflammatory reaction were analysed in 286 patients. The count of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PNL) in ascitic liquid (AL), microbiological study of the blood and AL were made. Ultrasound investigation assessed acoustic homogeneity of AL. Blood serum (BS) and AL were tested for cytokines content: interleukine-1beta, TNF-alpha, interleukine-4, transforming growth factor beta, C-reactive protein. Gas chromatography--mass spectrometry (GC-MC) estimated quantity and quality of chemical components--markers of potential infectious agents of AL.Three groups of patients were identified: group A (a classic SBP) consisted of 23 patients with clinical symptoms of SBP and PNL content > 0.25 x 10(9)/l group B (control) consisted of 19 patients free of SBP symptoms and PNL content < 0.25 x 10(9)/lPatients of group C with SIR, elevated CRP, changed cytokine status, high content of chemical markers of AL infection by GC-MC are at high risk of SBP. Such patients need adequate and early antibacterial therapy.
