Liver fibroelastometria in the elderly patients. To reveal the influence of age-related changes in the liver and elasticity according to fibroelastometria to determine the effectiveness of this method in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis in chronic diffuse liver diseases in the elderly patients.The study included 431 patients with chronic diffuse liver diseases (HDLD) aged 60 to 74 years. Of these, 56 patients had chronic liver disease. All patients underwent comprehensive clinical, instrumental and laboratory examination, indirect ultrasonic liver elastometry (fibroelastometria).All patients were identified in 5 groups (g): I gr. had HDLD viral etiology (n = 84), II gr--alcoholic etiology (n = 38), III gr.--non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (n = 206) - IV gr.--chronic cholestatic hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis (n = 38), V gr. (n = 65), patients that after full thorough examination of data for chronic liver disease hadn't received. According to the results of fibroelastometria elasticity of the liver in group V corresponded to METAVIR F0 and amounted to 4.9 +/- 1.3 kPa. The highest efficiency of liver fibroelastometria was obtained in the determination of stage 4 fibrosis METAVIR in I-IV grams, while the accuracy of the method was 92% with a sensitivity of 100%.Age-related changes in the liver in the absence of HDLD in elderly patients have no significant effect on its elasticity. The obtained data allow to evaluate the results of liver fibroelastometria in elderly patients with various etiologies of HDLD on the same criteria as for patients of younger age groups.
