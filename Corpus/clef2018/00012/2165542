Relationship between ultrasound-findings of low-echoic nodule of hepatic parenchyma in liver cirrhosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. We investigated development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 90 patients with liver cirrhosis by follow up study for a period from 6 months to three and half years, making special reference to ultrasound-findings of the parenchyma of the liver. Liver cirrhosis was classified into four types and two, non-nodular and nodular, groups according to low-echoic nodules distributed in the parenchyma. The development of HCC was higher at the rate of incidence in patients of the nodular group than those of the non-nodular. It was more closely related with the male in patients of the non-nodular group, and both the old age and the advanced hepatic injury in those of the nodular group. A rise of the level of serum AFP during a period of the follow up was not observed in relation to the development of HCC and seemed to be ineffective for detection of carcinoma small sized. The echo-types of the parenchyma in liver cirrhosis were most significantly correlated with the development of HCC in comparison with the other etiologic factors.
