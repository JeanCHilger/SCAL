Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and eclampsia: a descriptive study of 13 cases in Morocco. The occurrence of posterior reversible encephalopathy in eclampsia is a rare but known event. We propose to describe the clinical and radiological features and the outcome.A retrospective study was conducted from January 2005 to April 2010 including all cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) occurring on eclampsia in patients hospitalized in the obstetrical intensive care unit, University Hospital of Casablanca.Thirteen cases of PRES on eclampsia were collected, the average age was 29 years (18-42). Systolic pressure and diastolic blood pressure at admission were higher than 150 mmHg and 100 respectively in 10 cases. The signs found were: a regressive blindness in five patients and focal signs in four. The complications were thrombocytopenia in 10 patients, abnormal liver function in eight, Hellp syndrome in nine, and acute renal failure in two. The brain regions most commonly affected were the parietal and occipital areas (13 patients), followed by temporal regions, frontal, and basal ganglia (eight patients each). Five patients required assisted ventilation (AV) over 24 hours. Death complicated the outcome in four of our patients, but no deaths were directly attributable to PRES itself, and all four patients had Hellp syndrome and required AV greater than 48 hours. In the other patients, total regression of neurological signs was noted.This study emphasizes the severity of the Posterior 'reversible' encephalopathy syndrome on eclampsia.
