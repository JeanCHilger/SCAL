Ultrasonographic findings in horses with cholelithiasis: eight cases (1985-1987). Cholelithiasis and/or obstructive biliary tract disease was diagnosed ultrasonographically in 8 horses, 5 to 15 years old. Ultrasonographic findings revealed greater than normal amount of hepatic parenchyma in the right side of the abdomen in 8 horses and in the left side in 3 horses. The echogenicity of the liver was greater than normal, and thick distended bile ducts were seen in all horses. Choleliths were imaged ultrasonographically in 6 horses. Subsequently, postmortem findings in 6 horses revealed periportal and intralobular fibrosis, moderate bile duct dilatation, proliferation, and cholestasis. One or more choleliths were found in all horses. Ultrasonographic findings accurately depicted the histologic changes in the hepatic parenchyma in horses with cholelithiasis.
