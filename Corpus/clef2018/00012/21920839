The controlled attenuation parameter (CAP): a novel tool for the non-invasive evaluation of steatosis using Fibroscan. Steatosis is a reversible and benign condition. However, in a few cases, steatosis is associated with inflammation and hepatocyte changes, and is then defined as steato-hepatitis. Steatosis can also be a co-factor in many chronic liver diseases that can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Although an important parameter, until now, evaluation of steatosis by non-invasive methods has remained challenging. In this paper, we report on the use of a novel non-invasive methodology called a controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). This is based on signals acquired by the Fibroscan, which was developed to specifically assess liver steatosis concomitant to liver stiffness measurements (LSM). CAP's performance from published articles and communications is also reported.
