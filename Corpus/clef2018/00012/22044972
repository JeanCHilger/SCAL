Recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma successfully treated with laparoscopic thermal ablation. Aggressive treatment of intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) increases patients' survival. This study aimed to evaluate laparoscopic thermal ablation (TA) in the treatment of intrahepatic HCC recurrences.A retrospective analysis was performed on 88 patients (REC group) who underwent laparoscopic TA after prior TA (66 patients.) or partial hepatic resection (HR) (22 patients) as initial local treatment. Another 170 patients with primary HCC tumors (PRIM group) were regarded as the control group.The postoperative morbidity rates were similar for the patients with prior TA (18%) and those with prior HR (21%) (nonsignificant difference [NS]). The overall survival rates were not significantly different between the two groups (3-year survival rates of 59 and 78%, respectively P = 0.1662). Moreover, the disease-free survival (DFS) rates did not differ significantly between the patients with prior TA and those with prior HR (3-year DFS of 21 and 8%, respectivelyLaparoscopic TA can be performed safely and may be effective for intrahepatic HCC recurrence after prior TA or HR. It leads to survival and DFS rates similar to those obtained using laparoscopic TA for primary HCC without increasing morbidity. Laparoscopic TA could be proposed as first-line treatment of intrahepatic HCC recurrence for selected patients.
