Aneurysmal intrahepatic porto-capsular vein anastomosis. Two cases of intrahepatic porto-capsular vein anastomosis are described, both of which were complicated by liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In both cases a branch of the portal vein in the posterior segment of the liver was markedly dilated and directly anastomosed at its periphery with the liver's capsular vein, then connected with the inferior vena cava. One of the two cases underwent partial hepatectomy. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen did not reveal any direct relation between the shunt and the carcinoma. The shunting in both cases appeared to have resulted from portal hypertension complicated by liver cirrhosis.
