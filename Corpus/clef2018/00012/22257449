Usefulness of transient elastography (Fibroscan®) in the assessment of fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease. The prognosis and management of chronic liver disease largely depends on the extent and progression of liver fibrosis. Unfortunately, liver biopsy, an invasive and painful technique with several limitations, continues to be the gold standard for the staging and grading of fibrosis. Therefore, accurate noninvasive tests for liver injury are urgently needed. During the last years, transient elastography (Fibroscan®) has been proposed for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease, by measuring liver stiffness. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness, objectivity and safety of this technique. We included 68 patients who underwent a liver biopsy in the last 18 months with a wide spectrum of chronic liver diseases. All procedures as well as the liver biopsies according to the METAVIR scoring system were analyzed by the same sonographer and the same specialist in pathology, respectively. Median value of stiffness with none or mild fibrosis (F0 and FI), and severe fibrosis or cirrhosis (F3 and F4) was 6.8 ± 3.0 kPa and 21.0 ± 15.1 kPa, respectively, with a significant difference between them (p < 0.01). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves showed the optimal liver stiffness cut-off values for each group. We found also a positive correlation between liver stiffness found by transient elastography and fibrosis stage on biopsy in all patients, independently of the liver disease etiology. Fibroscan® is an easy, quick to perform and safe non-invasive method, reliable for assessing liver fibrosis.
