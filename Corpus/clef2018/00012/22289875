Efficacy and safety of anticoagulation on patients with cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a frequent event in patients with cirrhosis it can be treated with anticoagulants, but there are limited data regarding safety and efficacy of this approach. We evaluated this therapy in a large series of patients with cirrhosis and non-neoplastic PVT.We analyzed data from 55 patients with cirrhosis and PVT, diagnosed from June 2003 to September 2010, who received anticoagulant therapy for acute or subacute thrombosis (n = 31) or progression of previously known PVT (n = 24). Patients with cavernomatous transformation were excluded. Thrombosis was diagnosed, and recanalization was evaluated by using Doppler ultrasound, angio-computed tomography, and/or angio-magnetic resonance imaging analyses.Partial or complete recanalization was achieved in 33 patients (60% complete in 25). Early initiation of anticoagulation was the only factor significantly associated with recanalization. Rethrombosis after complete recanalization occurred in 38.5% of patients after anticoagulation therapy was stopped. Despite similar baseline characteristics, patients who achieved recanalization developed less frequent liver-related events (portal hypertension-related bleeding, ascites, or hepatic encephalopathy) during the follow-up period, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = .1). Five patients developed bleeding complications that were probably related to anticoagulation. A platelet count <50 Ã— 109/L was the only factor significantly associated with higher risk for experiencing a bleeding complication. There were no deaths related to anticoagulation therapy.Anticoagulation is a relatively safe treatment that leads to partial or complete recanalization of the portal venous axis in 60% of patients with cirrhosis and PVT it should be maintained indefinitely to prevent rethrombosis.
