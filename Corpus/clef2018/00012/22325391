Portal venous pressure in biliary atresia. Biliary atresia (BA) is characterized by a variable degree of fibrosis within the liver, causing portal hypertension sometimes evident at the time of presentation.The aims of this study are to measure portal venous pressure (PVP) at time of Kasai portoenterostomy (KP) and to investigate the value of surrogate indices.At the time of KP and before any liver manipulation, an attempt was made to recanalize the umbilical vein, allowing a catheter to be sited. Preoperative noninvasive variables included maximum splenic diameter (on ultrasound) platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubinPortal venous pressure measurements were available in 61 infants, who underwent a KP during the period February 2007 to October 2010. Median age at KP was 52 (19-151) days. Median PVP was 9 (3-26) mm Hg and was significantly lower in those with isolated (n = 47) BA vs cytomegalovirus-associated BA (n = 6) (8 vs 17 mm Hg P = .02). Overall, PVP correlated with spleen size (r(s) = 0.38Portal venous pressure is a key variable in the assessment of the BA liver, and differences can be shown depending on underlying cause (eg, cytomegalovirus status). Furthermore, it has modest correlation with noninvasive indices (eg, spleen size and APRi) but appears of limited use when used as prognostic index of outcome and indeed in the later development of varices.
