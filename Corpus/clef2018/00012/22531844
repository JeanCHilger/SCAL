Assessment of metabolic syndrome in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic, progressive liver disease with elevated serum lipids. It remains unclear if hyperlipidemia increases the risk for atherosclerosis in PBC patients. Metabolic syndrome (MS) promotes the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease due to abdominal obesity and insulin resistance.The aim of this study was to assess incidence and parameters of MS, as well as subcutaneous and visceral fat using noninvasive ultrasonographic measurement in patients with PBC in our population.We included 55 patients with PBC and 44 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (CG-control group). Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, and waist circumference), age, sex, and body mass index were recorded for patients and controls. Laboratory tests for assessing MS and liver function tests were analyzed. We used ultrasonography to determine subcutaneous and visceral fat diameter and area (SF, VF and SA, VA, respectively), as well as perirenal fat diameter (PF).Patients with PBC had significantly higher levels of cholesterol and liver function tests. There were no statistically significant difference in serum insulin and HOMA levels, as well as incidence of MS was diagnosed in 30.9 % (17/55) PBC patients and 43.2 % (19/44) controls. We registered lower amount of VF (PBC:10.92 ± 3.63 mm, CG:16.84 ± 5.51 mm,p < 0.001), VA (PBC:403.64 ± 166.97 mm(2), CG:720.57 ± 272.50 mm(2),p < 0.001), and PF (PBC:7.03 ± 1.82 mm, CG 10.49 ± 2.70 mm,p < 0.001) in patients with PBC.MS is not more frequent in patients with PBC compared with healthy volunteers in our population. Lower amount of VF could be related to lower risk for cardiovascular events in PBC patients.
