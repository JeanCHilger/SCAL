Longitudinal changes in serum ferritin levels correlate with measures of hepatic stiffness in transfusion-independent patients with β-thalassemia intermedia. Despite evidence of considerable iron overload in transfusion-independent patients with β-thalassemia intermedia, data on hepatic outcomes remain scarce. We analyzed data from a cohort of 42 β-thalassemia intermedia adults followed for four years (median age 38years), and evaluated the association between longitudinal changes in serum ferritin levels and transient elastography values, a measure of hepatic stiffness predictive of fibrosis. We observed a significant increase in both serum ferritin levels (+81.2 [μg/l]/year) and transient elastography values in non-chelated patients (n=28) (+0.3kPa/year), with two patients worsening their fibrosis stage. Chelated patients (n=14) had a significant decrease in both measures (-42.0 [μg/l]/year and -0.9kPa/year, respectively), with two patients improving their fibrosis stage. There was a strong correlation between the rate of change in serum ferritin level and the rate of change in transient elastography value (R(2): 0.836, p<0.001) noted in both non-chelated and chelated patients. An association between iron overload status and hepatic disease merits further evaluation in this subset of transfusion-independent patients.
