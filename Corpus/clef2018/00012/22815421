Predicting portal hypertension as assessed by acoustic radiation force impulse: correlations with the Doppler ultrasound. The purpose of this study was to assess the value of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) for evaluating portal hypertension by correlating the elasticity of liver cirrhosis, as measured by ARFI, with haemodynamic indices measured by Doppler ultrasound.We evaluated the data of a total of 154 prospectively enrolled patients who underwent both duplex Doppler ultrasound and ARFI imaging. The duplex Doppler ultrasound indices, including the mean portal vein velocity, splenic index (SI) and splenoportal index (SPI) were evaluated to determine the statistical correlation with shear wave velocity (SWV) of ARFI. We also analysed the differences in the correlations between the SI, SPI and SWV of the group who had varices. The correlations were assessed with Spearman's rank correlation coefficients.There was an increase of SWV in parallel with the increase of the SI (ρ=0.409, p<0.01) and SPI (ρ=0.451, p<0.01). In the patient group who did not have varices (n=74), the Doppler indices were found to be more correlated with the SWV (SI: ρ=0.447, SPI: ρ=0.552, p<0.01). However, the group with varices showed no correlation between the SWV and the Doppler parameters.SWV of ARFI was well correlated statistically with Doppler parameters, but is of limited value in predicting portal hypertension directly owing to great variability of Doppler parameters. By evaluating the correlation between ARFI and Doppler ultrasound, we suggest that the SWV might be a non-invasive supplementary tool for predicting portal hypertension.
