Hepatopulmonary syndrome among cirrhotic candidates for liver transplantation. This study assess of hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) prevalence and the influence of etiology among cirrhotic patients due to an alcoholic or viral etiology. We examined the records of patients were distributed as Group 1, alcoholic (n = 40) and Group 2, hepatic cirrhosis of viral etiology (n = 35). Hepatic cirrhosis status was estimated by CHILD and MELD scores. Presence of clinical ascites spell out was noted as well as size and diastolic functions of the cardiac chambers using two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography in M mode and by Doppler. HPS was studied with agitated saline serum and intravenous contrast administration. HPS was considered to be present when serum or contrast passed to the left chamber before the 5th cardiac cycle. There was no significant differences among related to sex, age, cirrhosis status or ascites. HPS frequency was 35% in Group 1 versus 64.7% among Group 2-Patients (P = .01). Taking into account the results, we concluded that HPS frequency was related to cirrhotic etiology. Upon multivariate analysis a patients with cirrhosis from viral etiology showed significantly increased HPS frequency compared with those displaying cirrhosis of an alcoholic etiology.
