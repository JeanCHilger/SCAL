A case of primary osteosarcoma of the liver. The authors report a case of primary osteosarcoma of the liver in a 75 year-old man with post hepatitic B cirrhosis. The hepatic tumor was discovered on ultrasound and computed tomography. Angiography showed a hypervascularized tumor. The patient died rapidly. Diagnosis of primary osteosarcoma of the liver was established through histopathological examination of post mortem specimens and was confirmed by immunohistochemical study. From this and two other previously reported cases the authors describe the different primary hepatic tumors mimicking osteosarcoma.
