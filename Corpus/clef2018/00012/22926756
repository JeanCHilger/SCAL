Multimodality, anatomical, and diffusion-weighted fetal imaging of a spontaneously thrombosing congenital dural sinus malformation. We report on the conventional and diffusion-weighted (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of a partially thrombosed torcular Herophili dural sinus malformation. DWI confirmed the intralesional partial thrombosis/blood clot characterized by restricted diffusion. In addition, focal or global intracerebral complications were excluded by fetal DWI. Our findings suggest that DWI is a valuable adjunct to the standard T1- and T2-weighted fetal MRI sequences.
