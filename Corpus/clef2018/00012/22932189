Contrast-enhanced ultrasound of hepatocarcinogenesis in liver cirrhosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often occurs in association with liver cirrhosis. A stepwise carcinogenesis for HCC has been proposed. The purpose of this study was to observe the enhancement pattern of hepatocellular nodules in cirrhotic patients using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and to correlate patterns of enhancement at CEUS with the diagnosis of hepatocellular nodules using pathologic correlation as the gold standard.Ninety-three cirrhotic patients with indeterminate hepatocellular nodules at ultrasound, underwent biopsy of each indeterminate nodule. Patients with nodules found to have pathologic diagnoses of regenerative nodules (RNs), dysplastic nodules (DNs), or DNs with focus of HCC (DN-HCC), were enrolled in this study. Enhancement patterns of all nodules were examined throughout the various vascular phases of CEUS and classified into five enhancement patterns: type I, isoenhancement to hepatic parenchyma at all phases type II, hypoenhancement in the arterial phase, and isoenhancement in the portal venous phase and late phaseTotally 132 lesions were examined with CEUS in 93 patients. Pathologic diagnoses included 45 DN, 68 RN, and 19 DN-HCC. The enhancement patterns observed were as follows: type I, 49 (37.1%) type II, 27 (20.5%)Pattern of enhancement at CEUS correlates with the pathologic diagnosis of hepatocellular nodules in liver cirrhosis, and may be helpful in predicting the progress from RN to HCC nodules.
