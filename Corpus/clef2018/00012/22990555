Association between liver histology, carotid ultrasonography and retinal vascular changes in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing all over the world. NAFLD has been demonstrated to be associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis, evaluated using the intima-media thickness (IMT). In this article, we focused on the association between NAFLD, carotid parameters such as: intima-media thickness (IMT), pulsatility index (PI) and resistivity index (RI) as markers of subclinical atherosclerosis and the presence of retinal vascular disorders.We compared carotid IMT, pulsatility and resistivity index evaluated by ultrasonography, in 10 patients with histological-proven NAFLD and retinal vascular changes (retinophotographies).The degree of hepatic steatosis, necroinflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD patients was strongly associated with the value of carotid IMT and also with PI and RI. Moreover, there seems to be a connection between the degree of NAFDL and the retinal vascular changes in patients with carotid atherosclerosis.These results suggest that the severity of liver histopathological lesions among NAFLD patients is strongly associated with carotid parameters: IMT, IP, IR and also with retinal vascular changes. Further controlled studies are needed to confirm the results.
