Endovascular treatment of a congenital thoracic aortic aneurysm in a premature newborn. Congenital aortic aneurysms are a rare, life-threatening disorder that present complex treatment challenges. The authors describe a congenital thoracic aortic aneurysm treated by endovascular means with stent-assisted coil deployment. Because of rapid in utero aneurysm growth and cardiac dysfunction, a 2.6-kg male was delivered expeditiously by Cesarean section at 35(2)/(7) weeks' gestation. On day of life 1, bilateral femoral arterial access was used to deliver a balloon-expandable stent across the wide-necked aneurysm. Microcoil embolization of the aneurysm via a prepositioned microcatheter was then performed. The child had an uncomplicated hospital course and is asymptomatic 5 months later, with complete aneurysm thrombosis.
