Association between anthropometric parameters and measurements of liver stiffness by transient elastography. We investigated the association between anthropometric parameters and results of liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) by transient elastography in healthy subjects and patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).We analyzed anthropometric and LSM data from 658 healthy subjects (37% male mean age, 47 ± 11 yearsLSMs were slightly higher among healthy subjects with BMIs ≤ 18.5 kg/m(2) (n = 84, 4.8 ± 1.5 kPa) and BMIs of 25-29.9 kg/m(2) (n = 76, 5.3 ± 2.2 kPa) than those with BMIs of 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2) (n = 492, 4.5 ± 1.9 kPa P = .16 by analysis of variance). Among patients with NAFLD of Brunt fibrosis stage 0 or 1, LSMs were lowest among those with BMIs of 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2) (stage 0: n = 34, 5.5 ± 2.2 kPaBMI ≥30 kg/m(2) is associated with higher LSMs in patients with NAFLD, after adjusting for fibrosis stage.
