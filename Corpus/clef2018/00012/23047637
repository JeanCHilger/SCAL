A case of primary biliary cirrhosis with systemic lymph node enlargement. A 40's woman was hospitalized with cervical lymph node enlargement. Laboratory examinations showed elevated serum bile duct enzymes and the presence of anti-mitochondrial antibody. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography showed enlargement of not only perihepatic lymph nodes, but also axillary and cervical lymph nodes. FDG-PET showed intense uptake concordant with these lymph nodes. We performed endoscopic ultrasonographic fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a perihepatic lymph node, but detected no malignant cells. We then performed liver biopsy, and obtained a histological diagnosed primary biliary cirrhosis. Systemic lymph nodes decreased together with serum bile duct enzyme levels during treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid.
