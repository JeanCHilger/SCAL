Imaging of acute pulmonary embolism. Acute pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) is a cardiovascular emergency associated with significant morbidity and a 5-35 % mortality for untreated pulmonary embolism. If promptly diagnosed and treated, the mortality rate can be significantly reduced. Diagnosis of acute PE continues to be a clinical challenge, with diagnostic imaging playing an important role. This review discusses the clinical challenges of diagnosing acute PE, presents an evidence-based review of the current tests and ever-evolving imaging technology, and highlights special considerations related to radiation dose, contrast media use, and pregnant patients.
