Magnetic resonance elastography for staging liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C. We evaluated the use of magnetic resonance (MR) elastography (MRE) for staging liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C and compared the ability of MRE and serum fibrosis markers for discriminating each stage of fibrosis.We evaluated 114 patients with chronic hepatitis C in whom the pathological fibrosis stage was determined (fibrosis stage 0 [F0], 3 F1, 15The mean stiffness values of the liver increased with stage of fibrosis: F0, 2.10±0.10 kPa F1, 2.42±0.29 kPaMRE is a reliable technique for staging liver fibrosis and discriminating liver fibrosis stages in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
