Modeling and real-time simulation of a vascularized liver tissue. In Europe only, about 100,000 deaths per year are related to cirrhosis or liver cancer. While surgery remains the option that offers the foremost success rate against such pathologies, several limitations still hinder its widespread development. Among the limiting factors is the lack of accurate planning systems, which has been a motivation for several recent works, aiming at better resection planning and training systems, relying on pre-operative imaging, anatomical and biomechanical modelling. While the vascular network in the liver plays a key role in defining the operative strategy, its influence at a biomechanical level has not been taken into account. In the paper we propose a real-time model of vascularized organs such as the liver. The model takes into account separate constitutive laws for the parenchyma and vessels, and defines a coupling mechanism between these two entities. In the evaluation section, we present results of in vitro porcine liver experiments that indicate a significant influence of vascular structures on the mechanical behaviour of tissue. We confirm the values obtained in the experiments by computer simulation using standard FEM. Finally, we show that the conventional modelling approach can be efficiently approximated with the proposed composite model capable of real-time calculations.
