Feasibility and reliability of the FibroScan S2 (pediatric) probe compared with the M probe for liver stiffness measurement in small adults with chronic liver disease. The success of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography (TE, FibroScan) is influenced by anthropometric factors. In smaller adults, the M probe may fail due to narrow intercostals spaces and rib interference. We aimed to compare LSM using the FibroScan S2 (pediatric) probe with the M probe in small adults with chronic liver disease.In this prospective study, 41 liver disease patients and 18 controls with a thoracic perimeter ≤ 75 cm underwent LSM using the FibroScan M and S2 probes. TE failure was defined as no valid LSMs and unreliable examinations as < 10 valid LSMs, an interquartile range (IQR)/LSM > 30%, or success rate < 60%.TE failure was not observed and reliability did not differ between the M and S2 probes (86% vs. 95% P = 0.20). Liver stiffness measured using the M and S2 probes was highly correlated (ρ = 0.81The FibroScan S2 probe does not improve the feasibility of LSM in adults of smaller stature and may overestimate liver stiffness compared with the M probe. The FibroScan M probe should remain the preferred tool for LSM in small adults with chronic liver disease.
