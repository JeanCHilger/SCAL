Non-invasive fibrosis biomarkers - APRI and Forns - are associated with liver stiffness in HIV-monoinfected patients receiving antiretroviral drugs. HIV-monoinfected patients are susceptible to liver injury by different factors and may develop liver fibrosis, which requires adequate clinical management in terms of therapy and disease monitoring. We aimed to evaluate the presence of liver fibrosis identified by transient elastography (TE), its relationships with indirect biochemical markers [the aspartate aminotransferase/platelet ratio index (APRI), the Forns index and FIB-4] and its predictive factors in HIV-monoinfected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).Seventy-two HIV-monoinfected patients underwent TE and were evaluated using APRI, Forns and FIB-4. The clinical, immunological, virological and other biochemical characteristics were evaluated at the time of TE, together with their history of ART.Seven patients (10%) had liver stiffness (LS) values predicting cirrhosis, and 12 (17%) had values predicting significant or advanced fibrosis. Higher indirect biochemical scores of liver fibrosis were significantly associated with higher LS values [APRI rs  = 0.4296 (P < 0.001) Forns rs  = 0.4754 (P < 0.001)Indirect fibrosis biomarkers may increase the probability to detect liver injury enhancing a specific diagnostic workup and so contribute to improving the clinical management of HIV-monoinfected patients with clinically suspected liver disease.
