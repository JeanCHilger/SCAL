Liver stiffness values in HIV-infected patients with isolated anti-hepatitis B core antibodies. Hepatitis B reactivation has been observed in HIV-infected patients with isolated anti-HBc. However, the impact of isolated anti-HBc on liver fibrosis is not known in this population.We investigated liver stiffness values (LSV) in a population of HIV-infected patients with isolated anti-HBc, and attempted to identify risk factors for high values.Fifty-one out of 69 patients (74%) had low LSV (â‰¤7.1 kPa). In univariate analysis, high LSV (>7.1 kPa) were associated with HCV coinfection, the duration of HIV infection, the duration of antiretroviral therapy and lipodystrophy. In age-adjusted multivariate analysis, HCV coinfection (OR 11.5 95% CI, 3.0-62.9Lipodystrophy was the only factor associated with high liver stiffness values in our population of HIV-infected patients with isolated anti-Hbc and extensive exposure to antiretroviral drugs active on HBV, apart from HCV coinfection Our study correlates to recent studies the results of which have shown that lipodystrophy, and more generally mitochondrial toxicity, was associated with advanced liver fibrosis in HIV/HCV co-infected patients.
