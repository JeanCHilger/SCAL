Real-time elastography applications in liver pathology between expectations and results. Real time elastography has very good results in differentiating tumors of the breast, thyroid, prostate, pancreas and lymph nodes. Because liver biopsy is invasive and has complications, the method has been tried in diffuse or localized liver pathology in the hope of similar results. However, the published studies are isolated and performed on small groups of patients and the working methodology differs from author to author, without a consensus regarding the establishing of the area of interest, the recording and data analysis. The appearance of the elastography software on the convex probe with high penetration, the possibility for elastography to visualize the liver entirely and the development of elastography measurement information programs opened new perspectives in the noninvasive assessment of liver pathology.
