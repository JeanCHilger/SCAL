Liver fibrosis progression in chronic hepatitis B patients positive for hepatitis B e antigen: a prospective cohort study with paired transient elastography examination. Chronic hepatitis B patients in immune-reactive hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive phase may have more rapid progression than those in immune-tolerant phase. We aimed to evaluate the risk of liver fibrosis progression in HBeAg-positive patients at different phases.Two hundred forty-seven HBeAg-positive patients without advanced fibrosis at baseline underwent liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography in 2006-2008 and again in 2010-2012. Liver fibrosis progression was defined as increase in LSM by 30% or more to levels suggestive of advanced fibrosis at the second assessment.At baseline, the mean age was 38 ± 11 years, 58% were males, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 65 ± 52 IU/L, hepatitis B virus DNA was 4.2 ± 1.2 log IU/mL, and LSM was 6.3 ± 2.1 kPa. At an interval of 42 ± 6 months, 13 patients (5.2%) developed liver fibrosis progression, and 106 patients (42.9%) required antiviral therapy. None of the clinical parameters (e.g., gender, age, ALT, hepatitis B virus DNA, hepatitis B surface antigen level, etc.) was associated with liver fibrosis progression. Among 74 and 137 patients in immune-tolerant and immune-reactive phase, 4.1% and 6.6% had liver fibrosis progression, and 12.2% and 67.2% received antiviral therapy respectively (P = 0.45 and P < 0.001). Immune-tolerant patients with low-normal (< 0.5× upper limit of normal) or high-normal ALT (0.5-1× upper limit of normal) also had similar risk of liver fibrosis progression (5.7% vs. 2.6% P = 0.49).Liver fibrosis progression is uncommon in HBeAg-positive patients. Patients in immune-reactive phase treated with antiviral therapy did not have increased risk of liver fibrosis progression.
