Magnetic resonance elastography for the detection and staging of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B. We measured the accuracy of magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) for the detection and staging of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and compared it with serum fibrosis markers.Prospective comparison of MRE and routine serum fibrosis markers, namely serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ALT/AST ratio (AAR), AST to platelet ratio index (APRI) and prothrombin index (PI), was performed in 63 consecutive CHB patients who underwent MRE and histological confirmation of liver fibrosis within a 6-month interval. Diagnostic performance of MRE and serum markers for staging fibrosis (≥F1), significant fibrosis (≥F2), advanced fibrosis (≥F3) and cirrhosis (F4) was compared.The study group comprised 63 patients (19 female mean age ± SD, 50 ± 11.9 years). MRE (ρ = 0.94, P < 0.0001), APRI (ρ = 0.42, P = 0.0006), PI (ρ = 0.42, P = 0.0006) and AST (ρ = 0.28, P = 0.028) results correlated significantly with fibrosis stage. MRE was significantly more accurate than serum fibrosis markers for the detection of significant fibrosis (0.99 vs. 0.55-0.73) and cirrhosis (0.98 vs. 0.53-0.77). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values for MRE for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis were 97.4 %, 100 %, 100 % and 96 %, and 100 %, 95.2 %, 91.3 % and 100 %, respectively.MRE is an accurate non-invasive technique for the detection and staging of liver fibrosis in CHB.• Magnetic resonance elastography is accurate for liver fibrosis detection and staging. • MR elastography is more accurate than serum tests for staging liver fibrosis. • MR elastography can potentially replace liver biopsy in chronic hepatitis B.
