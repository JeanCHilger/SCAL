Thickened stomach--an ultrasound sign of portal hypertension. Congestive gastrophy occurs with portal hypertension and is associated with vascular changes including dilatation and tortuosity of the submucous veins. Transabdominal ultrasound measurements of the stomach were made to determine whether these changes resulted in increased thickness of the stomach in patients with established cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Mean thickness of the antrum and body was 22.15 mm (range 13-31 mm) and 22.2 mm (range 13-31 mm) respectively in patients with portal hypertension: in the control group measurements of the antrum and body were 13.8 mm (range 8-20 mm) and 14.05 mm (range 11-19 mm) respectively (P less than 0.01 for both antrum and body). A thickened stomach may indicate the presence of portal hypertension.
