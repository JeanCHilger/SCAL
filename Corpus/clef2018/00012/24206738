Fibroscan of chronic HCV patients coinfected with schistosomiasis. Both hepatitis C virus (HCV) and schistosomiasis are highly endemic in Egypt and coinfection is frequently encountered. Such coinfection is responsible for leading to a more severe liver disease. Hence, the aim of the study was to assess the fibroscan in chronic HCV patients coinfected with Schistosoma.This study included 231 chronic HCV patients. Routine pre-treatment work-up was done including anti-schistosomal antibodies. Liver stiffness measurements using fibroscan and reference needle-liver biopsy were done. Patients were categorised into two groups: HCV patients with positive schistosomal serology and HCV patients with negative schistosomal serology.Anti-schistosomal antibody was positive in 29% of the studied population. Positive schistosomal serology status was significantly associated with the disagreement between the results of liver biopsy (Metavir) and the fibroscan results (p value=0.02), which was more obvious in F2 and F3 fibrosis stages. The sensitivity of fibroscan for the detection of the F2 stage decreased from 64% among negative schistosomal serology patients to 30.8% among positive schistosomal serology patients, and for the F3 stage it decreased from 43.8% to 21.4%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression showed that fibrosis stages (F0-F1 and F4) were the most independent factors that were associated with the agreement between fibroscan and liver biopsy (odds ratio (OR) 3.4, 7.12 and p value <0.001, <0.001, respectively).Although the sensitivity of fibroscan for the detection of fibrosis stages (F2 and F3) was impaired in patients with positive schistosomal serology, fibrosis stages (F0-F1 and F4) were the most independent factors associated with the agreement between fibroscan and liver biopsy.
