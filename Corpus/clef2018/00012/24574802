Factors correlating with acoustic radiation force impulse elastography in chronic hepatitis C. To investigate the factors other than fibrosis stage correlating with acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastograpy in chronic hepatitis C.ARFI elastograpy was performed in 108 consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis C who underwent a liver biopsy. The proportion of fibrosis area in the biopsy specimens was measured by computer-assisted morphometric image analysis.ARFI correlated significantly with fibrosis stage (β = 0.1865, P < 0.0001) and hyaluronic acid levels (β = 0.0008, P = 0.0039) in all patients by multiple regression analysis. Fibrosis area correlated significantly with ARFI by Spearman's rank correlation test but not by multiple regression analysis. ARFI correlated significantly with body mass index (BMI) (β = -0.0334, P = 0.0001) in F 0 or F 1, with γ-glutamyltranspeptidase levels (β = 0.0048, P = 0.0012) in F 2, and with fibrosis stage (β = 0.2921, P = 0.0044) and hyaluronic acid levels (β = 0.0012, P = 0.0025) in F 3 or F 4. The ARFI cutoff value was 1.28 m/s for F ≥ 2, 1.44 m/s for F ≥ 3, and 1.73 m/s for F 4.ARFI correlated with fibrosis stage and hyaluronic acid but not with inflammation. ARFI was affected by BMI, γ-glutamyltranspeptidase, and hyaluronic acid in each fibrosis stage.
