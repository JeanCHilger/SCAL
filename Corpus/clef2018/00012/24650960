Liver stiffness measured by transient elastography in patients with acute pancreatitis. Alcohol abuse constitutes a risk factor for acute pancreatitis and liver cirrhosis, and cirrhosis in turn may delay the recovery from pancreatitis. We evaluated the occurrence and significance of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis in patients with acute pancreatitis by applying transient elastography (TE).TE was carried out in 78 patients with acute pancreatitis. Comparisons were made to the severity and recurrence of pancreatitis, to biological markers for fibrosis (APRI test), alcohol intake (AST/ALT ratio, AUDIT), and prothrombin time (TT-SPA). A cut-off value of ≥7.5 kilopascals (kPa) was set for increased liver stiffness, and ≥10 kPa for significant fibrosis.The aetiology of pancreatitis was alcohol intake in 62 patients, gallstones in 11, idiopathic in 3, tumour in 1 and medication in 1. TE was successful in 64 out of 78 patients. The median TE value was 6.5 kPa (range 2.5-61.1) 22 (35%) had values ≥7.5 kPa and 7 (11%) ≥10 kPa. Values ≥7.5 were associated with older age, higher APRI ratio, and lower TT-SPA. It did not predict the length of hospitalization or the recurrence of pancreatitis. Increased AST/ALT ratio was associated with high TE values, whereas AUDIT values were not. Values ≥10 kPa seemed to indicate manifest cirrhosis, hepatitis or subsequent development of diabetes.TE values ≥7.5 kPa did not predict the length of hospital stay or recurrence of pancreatitis but there were some findings of impaired liver function. Values ≥10 kPa may indicate subsequent development of diabetes and a more severe course of acute pancreatitis.
