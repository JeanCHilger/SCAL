Strategy for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Two hundred and eighty-two patients with HCC including 89 with tumors 2 cm or smaller in size and 193 of 2-5 cm were studied on clinical and pathological findings and correlated with the value of various diagnostic imaging modalities. There were apparent differences in histological findings of HCC between 2 cm or smaller in size and larger ones the former had much less invasion of malignant cells to the extracapsule and portal vein neighbouring the HCC than the latter. In 83 patients with HCCs 2 cm or less in diameter AFP level was normal (less than 20 ng/ml) in 39.8%, 20-200 ng/ml in 44.6% and more than 200 ng/ml in only 15.6%. Detectability of HCC measuring 2 cm or less by various imaging modalities was as follows: 97.8% by US, 54% by X-ray computed tomography (CT), 61.6% by magnetic resonance imaging (MR) and 75.4% by angiography. There was considerable limitation of imaging modalities in making a definitive diagnosis of the smaller HCCs, particularly in the differentiation from regenerative nodules of liver cirrhosis. Tissue biopsy under ultrasound control provided a correct diagnosis in 36 out of 41 patients (87.8%) with HCCs 2 cm or less in size, a better ratio than for aspiration biopsy.
