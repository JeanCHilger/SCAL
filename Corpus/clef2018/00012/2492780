Characteristic sonographic pattern of schistosomal hepatic fibrosis. The hepatic sonographic patterns from 50 patients undergoing operations for bleeding esophageal varices were compared with the interpretation of the histological findings in a hepatic wedge biopsy obtained during surgery. The sonographic pattern for schistosomiasis periportal fibrosis is characteristic and is not mimicked by other hepatic diseases we have studied. Sonography agreed with pathology in 44 out of 50 patients. Schistosomiasis could be separated from cirrhosis, as well as from combined lesions. Where there was a discordance, we believe that sonography gave a more accurate diagnosis.
