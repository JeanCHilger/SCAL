Postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis in a 29-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis. A 29-year-old woman with known ulcerative colitis developed a right-sided abdominal pain a day after preterm vaginal delivery at 30 weeks. She did not have any nausea, vomiting and had normal bowel movements. The observations were within normal limits and white cell counts were marginally elevated with a normal C reactive protein. A large ovarian vein thrombosis on the left side was an incidental finding on a CT of the abdomen and pelvis undertaken to establish the cause for abdominal pain. The patient was managed by a multidisciplinary team and was treated with anticoagulants for 6 months. This case illustrates that the incidence of pelvic venous thrombosis may be higher in pregnancy and puerperium.
