Pathogenesis and clinical aspects of primary liver cell carcinomas. The hepatocellular carcinoma is the most frequent primary liver cell carcinoma. On account of its geographical distribution with preferential occurrence in China, SE Asia and South Africa, exogenic causes are thought to be mainly responsible for its aetiopathogenesis. Besides mycotoxins, the hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) is particularly important. Integration of HBV-DNS into the hepatic cell DNS is considered to be an initiatory step in hepatocarcinogenesis. Clinically the tumour usually becomes manifest by upper abdominal complaints. Curative treatment can be promising only with very small tumours which can be detected most safely via ultrasound examination and alpha-1-fetoprotein determination.
