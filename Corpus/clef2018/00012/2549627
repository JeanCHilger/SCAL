Sonographic diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Results of a retrospective study 1983-1989. In a retrospective study of our hospital of the years 1983 to 1989 we diagnosed a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 30 patients. The diagnosis was confirmed by histology or cytology, ultrasound and clinical symptoms. The tumours presented sonomorphologically different patterns. Some were hypoechoic (n = 9), some hyperechoic (n = 16) and 5 had a mixed pattern. Nine of the hyperchoic lesions looked like a metastasis with a halo. 13 patients had multiple tumours or diffuse infiltration of the liver. Due to the variable sonomorphology only 16 patients were assumed to have a HCC, no definite diagnosis by ultrasound being possible. The concomitant cirrhosis of the liver was sonomorphically detected in 19 patients and was suspected in 2 further patients. Four patients had no cirrhosis in 3 patients, the available information was insufficient. Because of the variable sonomorphology of HCC no definite diagnosis by ultrasound can be achieved. The combination of liver tumour and cirrhosis or elevated serumfetoprotein leads to the diagnosis. The diagnosis of HCC must be confirmed by histology.
