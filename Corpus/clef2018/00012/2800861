2 cases of the diffuse form of Caroli disease. Report of two cases. The authors report two observations in what concern the diffused form of the Caroli's disease, one pure, the other mixed associating the congenital dilatation of the intra-hepatic bileducts with lesion of congenital hepatic fibrosis. They emphasize the efficiency of the echographia and computed tomography in diagnosing Caroli's disease. The surgical treatment of these diffused forms often complicated by acute recurrent cholangitis used with some success various methods of biliary drainage. But the radical treatment seems to be obliged to turn itself more likely toward liver transplantation.
