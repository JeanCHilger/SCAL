Comparison of pulsed Doppler sonography and angiography in patients with portal hypertension. Pulsed Doppler sonography and liver panangiography were performed in 43 patients with cirrhosis. Fourteen patients were evaluated preoperatively, and 28 patients were evaluated after a variceal decompressive shunt. One patient was studied before and after undergoing a shunt. The direction of portal blood flow by Doppler sonography was compared with both the grading pattern and direction of flow by angiography. When portal blood flow was determined to be antegrade by Doppler sonography, angiography showed antegrade flow in 84% (grade I, II, or III portal venous pattern). Six percent had retrograde flow (grade IV), and 10% had portal vein thrombosis. When the portal blood flow was determined to be retrograde by Doppler sonography, angiography showed retrograde flow (grade IV portal venous pattern) in 80% and antegrade flow (grade I, II, or III) in 20%. When an inadequate Doppler tracing was obtained from the portal vein, angiography showed either grade I, II, or III in 38% grade IV in 50%, and portal vein thrombosis in 13%. There was poor correlation between the calculated mean flow rates, as determined by Doppler sonography, and the angiographic grade. We conclude that pulsed Doppler sonography is accurate in determining the direction of portal flow when an adequate tracing is obtained (36 of 44 studies). When an inadequate tracing is obtained, retrograde portal flow or portal vein thrombosis is likely.
