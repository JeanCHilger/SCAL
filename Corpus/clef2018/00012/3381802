Role of intrahepatic portal-systemic shunts in the reduction of portal blood supply to liver cells in cirrhosis. To assess the role of intrahepatic portal-systemic shunts in the reduction of portal blood supply to the liver cells in cirrhosis, we measured portal venous flow (blood flow in the portal trunk) by the pulsed Doppler flowmeter and intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt index from the counts over the lungs and liver in both the anterior and posterior projections after instillation of 99mTc-macroaggregated albumin in the portal vein, and calculated portal sinusoidal flow (blood flow into the sinusoids via the portal vein), using the equation, (sequence see text) in 47 patients with posthepatitic cirrhosis, and measured portal venous flow in 63 healthy adults in whom portal sinusoidal flow should be comparable to portal venous flow. Portal sinusoidal flow was significantly reduced in cirrhotics with an intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt index averaging 24%, whereas portal venous flow was similar in the cirrhotics and control. There was a significant inverse correlation between intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt index and portal sinusoidal flow. When cirrhotics were divided into three stages, based on Child's grading, intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt index was significantly increased in the group order of Child's A (8 +/- 9%), Child's B (27 +/- 22%), and Child's C patients (46 +/- 19%), and portal sinusoidal flow was decreased in the same order. Portal sinusoidal flow was significantly reduced in Child's B and Child's C patients, but not in Child's A patients, compared with the control. In conclusion, intrahepatic portal-systemic shunts may play a role, at least in part, in the reduction of portal blood supply to the liver cells in patients with advanced stage of posthepatitic cirrhosis when large intrahepatic portal-systemic shunts develop.
