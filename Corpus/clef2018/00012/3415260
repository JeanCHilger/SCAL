Intraarterial chemo-embolization with adriamycin containing albumin microspheres. For local treatment of inflammatory breast cancer and recurrent breast cancers with liver metastasis, we applied intraarterial infusion chemoembolization therapy utilizing albumin microspheres containing adriamycin (ADM-ms), which was developed by Morimoto. In this study, there were 2 cases of inflammatory breast cancer and 3 cases of recurrent breast cancers with liver metastasis. Arterial canulation of primary breast cancer were made through both arteries, the internal mammary artery and lateral thoracic artery, which were feeding arteries of the breast. ADM-ms was injected into both arteries and its tumor effect was evaluated clinically and histologically. Remarkable reduction in tumor size was recognized. Histologic examination of resected specimens revealed extensive fibrosis in the center of the primary tumors. A few cancer cells, degenerated in various degrees, were found remaining in the periphery of the necrotic mass. Local side effects of the microspheres were skin disturbances such as pain, redness and blistering. ADM-ms was injected into the hepatic artery for the liver metastatic cases, and its antitumor effect was evaluated by CT scan or echography. Effective reduction in tumor size was only recognized in one case. No serious systemic side effects, not recognized in any case. Our report reviews the effectiveness of this therapy as a preliminary procedure for surgical treatment of inoperable inflammatory breast cancer.
