Diffuse liver diseases: possibility or limitations of echography?. Reports on echography as a diagnostic tool in diffused liver diseases are quite numerous in the literature. As it is shown by the analysis of such reports there is no general agreement as far as including echography into the diagnostic protocol of liver diseases is concerned. Reliability of echography for the assessment of fat liver is quite ascertained, while its role in the diagnosis of acute and chronic hepatitis is still quite controversial. On the basis of personal experience, percent incidence of the most relevant echographic features is checked retrospectively and their diagnostic reliability is evaluated. The role of echography in the follow-up of sclerotic liver diseases is discussed as far as the evaluation of parenchymal structure, of associated features and of complications is concerned. Echographic data should always be completed by clinical data, laboratory tests and histological examination, during diagnosis and follow-up of patients with liver diseases.
