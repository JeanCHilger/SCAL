Evaluation by computerized axial tomography of eclamptic women with seizures refractory to magnesium sulfate therapy. Over a 1-year period, seven eclamptic patients with repetitive seizures while receiving therapeutic levels of intravenous magnesium sulfate were evaluated by computerized axial tomography. In five patients brain abnormalities were identified, which included diffuse cerebral edema (one), cerebral venous thrombosis (two), and low density white matter (two). Clinical management of eclamptic women on the basis of structural central nervous system abnormalities documented by computerized tomography appears to warrant further investigation.
