Effects of esophageal transection combined with splenectomy on portal hemodynamics. Portal hemodynamics were studied in 69 patients with cirrhosis and 29 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension to investigate the effects of an operative procedure for varices that consists of transabdominal esophageal mucosal transection, paraesophagogastric devascularization, pyloroplasty, and splenectomy. Portal venous flow measured by the pulsed Doppler flowmeter in 14 patients with cirrhosis and nine patients with idiopathic portal hypertension, who underwent operation 2-5 yr earlier, was significantly reduced compared with that in unoperated 49 patients with cirrhosis and 17 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension who had esophageal varices (410 +/- 158 versus 660 +/- 263 ml/min in cirrhosis 443 +/- 185 versus 912 +/- 189 ml/min in idiopathic portal hypertension). In nine patients (six cirrhosis, three idiopathic portal hypertension), portal venous flow and portal vein pressure were measured before and after operation. In patients with cirrhosis, portal vein pressure did not change significantly postoperatively even though portal venous flow was reduced. In contrast, portal vein pressure decreased in two patients with idiopathic portal hypertension in whom portal venous flow was reduced. Portal vein pressure was elevated in one patient with idiopathic portal hypertension in whom portal venous flow was increased postoperatively as a result of resection of a large gastro- and splenorenal shunt conducted additionally.
