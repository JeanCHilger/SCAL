Cystic fibrosis: ultrasonographic findings in the pancreas and hepatobiliary system correlated with clinical data and pathology. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed on 35 adult patients with proven cystic fibrosis. Thirty-three patients showed pancreatic abnormalities. The most marked ultrasonographic features were increased parenchymal echogenicity, atrophy, non-visualisation of the duct and cyst formation. There was no correlation between these features and the severity of the pulmonary disease, the age of the patient, weight or glucose intolerance. Abnormalities of the biliary tract were demonstrated in nine (26%) patients and were associated with poor nutritional status. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant association between the following: hepatomegaly, increased liver echogenicity, splenomegaly, biliary disease secondly, between lung function and serum albumin. Ultrasonography is useful in showing organ morphology but not in assessing disease severity.
