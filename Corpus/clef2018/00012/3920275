Diagnostic accuracy of computerized B-scan texture analysis and conventional ultrasonography in diffuse parenchymal and malignant liver disease. The use of a diagnostic system for ultrasonic liver tissue characterization based on computerized B-mode image analysis is clinically tested and compared with the results of conventional realtime and static grey scale liver ultrasound as independently assessed by three experienced observers. The diagnostic classes, normal, diffuse parenchymal and malignant disease, are clearly differentiated by computerized image analysis which is superior to subjective evaluation of liver echograms. Computerized analysis also renders a reliable and clinically useful diagnostic subclassification of diffuse parenchymal disease into echopattern changes prevalent in chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis/fibrosis, fatty infiltration and a mixed state of cirrhosis/fibrosis with fatty infiltration which cannot be achieved by conventional liver ultrasound.
