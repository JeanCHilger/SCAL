Fast, low-temperature preparation of carrier-free 17-123I-heptadecanoic acid applied for liver and heart scintigraphy. A high-yield method for labelling 17-I-heptadecanoic acid with 123I is described, and a clinical evaluation of the radiopharmaceutical is given. The labelling procedure is based on the use of a conventional ultrasonic bath. It was found that the addition of thiosulphate to the reaction medium avoids the formation of labelled side products and increases the yield considerably. The carrier-free 17-123I-heptadecanoic acid (2 mCi) in 6% human serum albumin was injected IV for heart and liver studies on selected patients with cirrhosis (alcoholic, post-necrotic) and diabetes.
