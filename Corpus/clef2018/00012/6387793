Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis mansoni: ultrasound manifestations. Ultrasound (US) was performed in 103 patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis mansoni. The abnormal US findings are reported and correlated with the pathologic and anatomic characteristics. The main US findings are periportal fibrosis, left lobe hypertrophy, thickening of the wall of the gallbladder, granulomas, splenic nodules, and widening of the portal vessel system. Frequent but nonspecific findings include splenomegaly and the presence of collateral vessels. Portal vein thrombosis was present in a few cases. It is concluded that US is a major tool in the diagnosis of this disease.
