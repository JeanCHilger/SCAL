Ultrasonography in the diagnosis of fatty liver (author's transl). Diagnostic relevance of ultrasonography was studied prospectively and controlled by peritoneoscopy and biopsy. 310 cases were investigated, 126 of these had fatty infiltration of the liver between 5% and 95%, which was diagnosed correctly in 92% of the cases by ultrasonography on the basis of increased reflexes. The incidence of correct diagnoses was 95% resp. 100% in cases with more than 10% resp. 50% fatty infiltration of the liver. Thus, diagnosis of fatty liver can be achieved with high sensitivity (fat infiltration of more than 10% may be recognized) and high specificity (only 4.35% false positives) by ultrasonography. Ultrasonography is a simple, non-invasive, and fast method suited for screening and follow-up in this condition.
