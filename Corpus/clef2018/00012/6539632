Sonographic detection of large spontaneous spleno-renal shunts and its clinical significance. The ultrasonographic findings of large spleno-renal shunts seen in five patients with liver cirrhosis and confirmed by CT and/or portography, are described. These spleno-renal shunts were seen in the left inter- or subcostal sections as transonic, mass-like lesions located between the splenic hilum and the left kidney, and by continuous scanning, they were found to be part of a tortuous, large tubular structure. Oesophageal varices were absent or minimal in these patients, and none of them had ever bled.
