Hepatic biloma complicating sickle cell disease. A case report and a review of the literature. Previously reported hepatobiliary complications of sickle cell disease include cholelithiasis, intrahepatic cholestasis, cirrhosis, hepatic crisis, abscess, and infarction. We present a case of right upper quadrant pain, fever, and jaundice in a patient with sickle cell disease. An expanding intrahepatic bile-filled cyst ("biloma") was demonstrated as a possible consequence of hepatic infarction. The literature regarding the possible pathogenesis of this entity is reviewed.
