Constrictive pericarditis: techniques for differential diagnosis. Although the incidence of constrictive pericarditis is low, the increasing number of patients receiving chronic dialysis, aggressive radiotherapy, or cardiovascular surgery has caused an increase in the iatrogenic incidence. The most common symptoms are dyspnea, fatigue, weight gain, peripheral edema, and abdominal swelling and discomfort. They may be present for years before the diagnosis is made. Physical examination, x-ray studies, electrocardiography, echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and angiography are all helpful in the differential diagnosis. Pericardiectomy, the only treatment, has a success rate of up to 90%. Untreated, the condition progresses to an incapacitating state.
