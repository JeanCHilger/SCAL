Pancreatic sonography in cystic fibrosis. Sonographic examination of the abdomen was performed in 20 patients with cystic fibrosis aged 3--41 years. The predominant acoustic architecture of the pancreas was one of moderate to markedly increased echogenicity when compared to the liver at the same depth. Increased echogenicity of the pancreas was independent of the presence of malabsorption. The usual reduced echo pattern associated with pancreatic inflammation was seen in only one of five cystic fibrosis patients with clinical evidence of pancreatitis. Other pancreatic abnormalities included pancreatic calcifications in one child with pancreatitis and a pseudocyst in an adult with pancreatitis. Eight patients had hepatosplenomegaly and gallstones were seen in two one had a markedly contracted gallbladder. Sonography offers an effective method of following patients with cystic fibrosis.
