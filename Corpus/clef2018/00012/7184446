Liver cirrhosis and liver cancer--types, clinical courses, and progress in their treatment. There have been several controversies about classification of liver cirrhosis between Western countries and Japan. By the follow-up studies for 5 years on 478 cirrhotic patients diagnosed in Osaka area, relatively higher survival rates were found in cases without HBs-antigen and in heavy drinkers, whereas cases of cryptogenic type showed poor prognosis. The most marked progress in diagnostic procedures in this field seems to be several imaging techniques such as scintiphotography, U.S. echography and computed tomography. Analysis obtained by serial observations on imaging films would be valuable in differentiation between hepatoma and liver cirrhosis. Remarkable improvement has been shown in examinations on etiologic factors, degree of impairment of liver cell functions and precise evaluation of pathophysiological status of patients. Although it is our great regret that radical procedure to cure patients suffering from liver cirrhosis or hepatoma has not yet been known, several palliative treatments have become practical in recent years. For example, percutaneous transhepatic portal occlusion or injection of sclerosing agents for bleeding esophageal varices, parenteral feeding using adjusted amino acids pattern solution for impending coma and selective arterial embolization by sponges or coils infused with anticarcinogenic drugs for inoperable hepatoma have been used and effective to prolong survival period of these patients.
