A new method in differential diagnosis of the liver: identification of liver pulsating activities by spectral analysis of radio-isotope counts during liver scan. Comparative studies by ultrasonography. Liver scanning with 99mCi 99Tc sulphur-colloid was practiced in 50 patients: 30 suffering from malignant tumors, 10 from hepatic cirrhosis and 10 from pyrexia of unknown origin. Liver radioactivity was recorded by a gamma-camera connected to a computer, 1 frame each 10 seconds for 15 minutes. The spectral analysis of the radioactivity counts taken in different region of interest, showed evidence of a periodic fluctuation, with a period value around 1 minute. Comparative ultrasonographic dynamic study showed evidence of the same phenomena in 16 examined patients. The period of pulsation was found different in each of the following groups: normal liver, cirrhotic, metastatic and infectious diseases.
