Detection of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae in patient with cirrhosis by contrast 2D echocardiography. A case of multiple pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae associated with cirrhosis of the liver is described. The diagnosis was made by contrast two-dimensional echocardiography and confirmed by cardiac catheterisation and pulmonary angiography. As it is a sensitive and non-invasive technique, contrast two-dimensional echocardiography may be a useful screening test in cyanotic patients with liver disease in whom the presence of pulmonary fistulae is suspected.
