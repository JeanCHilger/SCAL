Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension: 2-year results. We performed transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in 25 patients with liver cirrhosis who developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension. The procedure was successful in 23 patients, in whom portal pressure decreased by 51%. Bleeding was stopped in all 5 emergency for whom other treatments, including sclerotherapy, had failed. During the follow-up period (mean: 367 days), shunt dysfunction due to stenosis was observed in 75% of the patients. However, by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, the patency could be maintained in 85% of the cases after 1 year and 73% of the cases after 2 years. Re-bleeding was observed in 13% of the cases after both 1 and 2 years. Color Doppler ultrasonography was useful for detecting shunt dysfunction. TIPS seems to be an effective treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension.
