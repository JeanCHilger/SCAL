Patients with ultrasonic coarse-nodular cirrhosis who are anti-hepatitis C virus-positive are at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. The relationship between echosonographic patterns of patients with cirrhosis who are antihepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive, the DNA synthesis of hepatocytes, and the risk for HCC were studied.Thirty-eight patients with anti-C-100 antibody-positive and Child's grade A posthepatitic cirrhosis were studied. DNA synthesis activity was measured by a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, a thymidine analogue)-labeling index (LI), using the BrdU-anti-BrdU in vitro method, and the patients were followed prospectively by frequent liver ultrasonography for 3 years. The ultrasound patterns were classified into fine, coarse, and coarse-nodular (CN) patterns, and the reproducibility of the classification in practical use also was confirmed.Of the 21 patients with high DNA synthesizing cirrhosis (BrdU LI > or = 1.5%), 10 (48%) showed coarse-nodular, 5 (24%) coarse, and 6 (29%) fine pattern in ultrasonography. Conversely, of the 17 patients with low DNA synthesizing LC (BrdU LI < 1.5%), only 1 (6%) showed coarse-nodular, 2 (12%) coarse, and 14 (82%) fine pattern. A significant relationship was found between the two groups of BrdU LI and ultrasound imaging patterns (P < 0.05). The incidence of CN pattern was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in the high DNA synthesizing group than in low DNA synthesizing group. Of the 11 patients with CN pattern by ultrasound imaging, 10 (91%) were in the high DNA synthesizing group, and 9 (82%) developed HCC during the follow-up period, compared with 3 of 7 (43%) with coarse, and only one of 20 (5%) with fine pattern developed HCC. The incidence of HCC was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in patients with a CN cirrhosis pattern than in those with a fine pattern.In patients with cirrhosis who are anti-HCV-positive, the CN pattern by ultrasound imaging indicates increased DNA synthesis of hepatocytes and a high risk for developing HCC.
