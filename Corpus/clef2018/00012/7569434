Late manifestation of congenital intrahepatic portacaval shunt in a healthy liver. We report the discovery of a congenital intrahepatic portocaval shunt during heart failure in a 68 year-old woman, without cirrhosis or portal hypertension. She had hepatic encephalopathy. Only 17 such cases have been reported. Their physiopathology remains unclear. Reasons for late revelation are debated. Color doppler imaging is very useful for diagnosis following and treatment of these shunts. Therapeutic options are presented.
