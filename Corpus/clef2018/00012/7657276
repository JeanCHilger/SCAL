Cerebral blood flow autoregulation and transcranial Doppler sonography in patients with cirrhosis. Impairment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation may have serious implications for patients with cirrhosis if arterial hypotension occurs during coma, anesthesia, bleeding, or sepsis. In this study, CBF autoregulation was investigated in patients with cirrhosis with no or mild encephalopathy. Ten patients (median age, 45 years range, 30 to 61 years) and six healthy volunteers (median age, 30 years
