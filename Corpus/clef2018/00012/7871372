Effects of dobutamine on hepatosplanchnic hemodynamics in patients with chronic liver disease. It is said that catecholamines increase hepatic blood flow in patients without liver diseases, although several reports have suggested a blunted response to catecholamines in patients with liver cirrhosis.We investigated changes in splanchnic blood flow distribution induced by the infusion of dobutamine into peripheral veins of healthy adults (NC group), patients with chronic hepatitis (CH group), and patients with liver cirrhosis (LC group), using a Doppler duplex system (protocol 1). We also investigated changes in hepatic hemodynamics induced by dobutamine infusion in patients with liver cirrhosis (cirrhosis group) and patients without liver diseases (control group), using hepatic catheterization (protocol 2).In protocol 1 the average increase in portal venous blood flow during dobutamine infusion was significant in the NC and CH groups but was not significant in the LC group. Changes in the blood flow in the splenic artery and vein, superior mesenteric artery and vein, and femoral artery were similar to those in the portal vein in each of the three groups. Infusion did not cause a change in the common hepatic arterial flow in any of the three groups. In protocol 2 the portal venous flow, cardiac index, and hepatic venous pressure gradient increased significantly during dobutamine infusion in both the cirrhosis and the control groups. Hepatic vascular resistance in the cirrhosis group increased slightly, whereas, in contrast, that in the control group increased significantly. The rate of change in almost all variables was lower in the cirrhosis group than in the control group.These results indicate that dobutamine has less effect on hepatic circulation in patients with liver cirrhosis than in those without liver diseases, indicating that the value of dobutamine in increasing hepatic blood flow in cirrhotic patients is very limited.
