Postprandial vascular response in patients with cirrhosis. Short-term effects of propranolol administration. Systemic and portal hemodynamic parameters were evaluated in eight cirrhotic patients in basal conditions and after food intake and placebo. Following seven days of oral propranolol administration, hemodynamic parameters were reevaluated in the fasting and postprandial states under similar conditions. Cardiac output and portal blood flow were measured by Doppler technique. Intraobserver variability of repeated measurements was less than 10%. Food intake caused a significant increase of portal blood flow (+28%, P < 0.05). No significant changes were observed in the other hemodynamic parameters studied. Propranolol at doses achieving effective beta blockade (84 +/- 14 mg/day) (mean +/- SD) reduced portal blood flow (-24%, P < 0.05). Food intake caused a significant increase in portal blood flow (+35%, P < 0.05) in propranolol treated patients. However, in absolute values, postprandial portal blood flow during propranolol treatment was significantly lower (986 +/- 402 ml/min) than that obtained after the initial food intake (1214 +/- 537 ml/min, P < 0.05). Placebo administration had no significant hemodynamic effects in either group. This study demonstrates that chronic propranolol administration could protect from portal hemodynamic changes following food intake. Doppler technique is a reliable technique to evaluate changes on portal and systemic hemodynamic parameters during a short period of time in patients with cirrhosis.
