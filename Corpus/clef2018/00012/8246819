Pathophysiological characteristics of cutaneous microcirculation in patients with liver cirrhosis: relationships to cardiovascular hemodynamics and plasma neurohormonal factors. To elucidate pathophysiological characteristics of the peripheral circulation in liver cirrhosis, cutaneous microcirculation was analyzed at the finger, palm, toe, and arch of the foot using laser Doppler spectroscopy in 19 patients with liver cirrhosis, and the results were correlated with cardiovascular hemodynamics (n = 10) and plasma neurohormonal factors (n = 8). Cutaneous blood flow at each area was all significantly reduced (P < 0.001, < 0.05, < 0.01, < 0.001, respectively) in patients with liver cirrhosis compared to those in normals (n = 20). Cutaneous blood mass was also significantly reduced (P < 0.05, < 0.01, < 0.001, respectively) except at the arch of foot in patients with liver cirrhosis. There were significant correlations between finger cutaneous blood flow and systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.73, P < 0.05), plasma norepinephrine level (r = -0.84, P < 0.01), plasma renin activity (r = -0.77, P < 0.01), plasma concentrations of aldosterone (r = -0.76, P < 0.05) and angiotensin II (r = -0.76, P < 0.05), between palm blood flow and plasma vasoactive intestinal polypeptide concentration (r = 0.83, P < 0.05). From these results and our previous data demonstrating increased forearm muscular blood flow in patients with liver cirrhosis, increases in arteriovenous anastomotic flow and the contribution of neurohormonal factors will represent pathophysiological mechanisms for these changes.
