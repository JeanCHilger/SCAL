Reproductive condition, glomerular adenosine diphosphatase activity, and platelet aggregation in the rat: effect of endotoxin. In experiment A, the activity of the glomerular antithrombotic enzyme adenosine diphosphatase (ADPase) and the sensitivity of this enzyme for endotoxin (1.0 microgram/kg BW) in various reproductive conditions of female rats were studied through use of enzyme histochemical methods. In experiment B, the effect of this dose of endotoxin on the thrombotic tendency of the glomeruli in pregnant (Pr) and pseudopregnant (PSP) rats was studied by means of ex vivo alternate perfusion of the kidneys with human platelets and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). In experiment A, cyclic (C), ovariectomized (OVX), Pr, and PSP rats were infused with endotoxin or saline. Three days later (for Pr and PSP rats, Day 8), animals were killed. In intact rats (C, Pr, PSP), the activity of glomerular ADPase was the same however, the activity decreased after OVX. Endotoxin decreased the activity of glomerular ADPase in Pr rats only. In endotoxin-treated Pr rats, spontaneously formed platelet microaggregates were present in a few glomeruli
