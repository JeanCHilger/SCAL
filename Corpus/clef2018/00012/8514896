Ultrasonographic changes of early liver cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B: a longitudinal study. Ultrasonography of prospectively followed chronic hepatitis B patients who developed liver cirrhosis were reevaluated in order to identify the ultrasonographic changes of early cirrhosis. Ultrasonographic features of 29 patients before and after cirrhosis were as follows: portal vein diameter--1.20 cm/1.29 cm (NS) cirrhosis score--5.69/7.52 (p < 0.01)
