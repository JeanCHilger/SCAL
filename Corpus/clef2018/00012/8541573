Portal venous blood flow unaltered in cirrhotic patients given metoclopramide injections. The effects of metoclopramide on blood flow in portal and left gastric veins and cardiovascular haemodynamic variables were studied in 30 patients with both liver cirrhosis and oesophageal varices. Measurements were made under baseline conditions and after the intravenous administration of saline, metoclopramide 10 mg, and metoclopramide 20 mg. Portal haemodynamics, including portal and left gastric veins were studied using pulsed Doppler ultrasound. In all groups, the blood flow and the maximal diameter of portal and left gastric veins, and heart rate remained unchanged. However, metoclopramide 10 mg significantly decreased the mean arterial pressure 15 minutes after administration while metoclopramide 20 mg decreased it 30, 45 and 60 minutes after administration. Therefore, metoclopramide apparently does not alter the blood flow of the portal venous system in these patients.
