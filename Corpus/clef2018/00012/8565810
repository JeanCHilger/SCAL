Duplex sonographic studies on the pathogenesis of splenic hemodynamics in liver cirrhosis. The haemodynamic role of the spleen in portal hypertension remains unclear. Duplex sonography was undertaken prospectively to discover the relationship of splenomegaly and splenic vein flow to type and severity of liver cirrhosis and portal vein flow, as well as to the degree of oesophageal varices.89 patients (54 men, 35 women mean age 52 [26-81] years), diagnosed in the second half of 1993 as having liver cirrhosis were consecutively included in the study. In 40 patients the cirrhosis was in stage A (according to Child-Pugh classification), in 31 in stage B and in 18 in stage C.Portal vein flow fell significantly with increasing degree of cirrhosis (stage A: 8.29 cm/s stage B 7.03 cm/sThe results may be explained by the presence of collateral circulations and by the differing pathophysiological part played by the spleen in liver cirrhosis of different aetiologies.
