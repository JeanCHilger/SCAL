Large spleno-caval shunt not accompanied by cirrhosis or encephalopathy. A 40-year-old man with a large spleno-caval shunt through the azygos vein is described. This was considered a rare case, because the patient had no accompanying advanced liver disease, or episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. During checks after abnormal liver function test results, a shunt vessel was detected incidentally by ultrasonography. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography demonstrated that it was a large shunt between the splenic vein and superior vena cava through the coronary and azygos veins. The patient was a hepatitis B virus carrier and was positive for anti-HBe, and had a history of heavy drinking. However, on laparoscopic examination, the liver was not cirrhotic and the biopsy revealed only mild chronic hepatitis without bridging fibrosis. There were no esophageal varices or hepatosplenomegaly. On hemodynamic evaluation, the wedge hepatic vein pressure was slightly elevated and hepatic blood flow was reduced to half the normal value. Despite the large portal-systemic shunt, the patient had no history or signs of hepatic encephalopathy. The clinical features of this rare case are discussed.
