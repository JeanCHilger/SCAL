Middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity in patients with cirrhosis. Brain dysfunction is common in patients with advanced liver disease it is often manifested as hepatic encephalopathy, but its cause is not clearly understood.Intracranial blood flow velocity parameters, including peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity and mean velocity of both middle cerebral arteries were measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography in 37 patients with cirrhosis without encephalopathy (16 Child's A, 10 Child's B and 11 Child's C) and 12 normal controls. The cause was alcohol-related in 24 and non-alcohol-related in 13.No significant differences in any of the Doppler parameters were detected in Child's group A when compared with controls. However, a statistically significant decrease in middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity was evident when Child's B and C patients without clinically apparent encephalopathy were compared with controls irrespective of the cause. Our results demonstrate that intracranial blood flow is abnormal in patients with advanced liver disease without clinically apparent encephalopathy.
