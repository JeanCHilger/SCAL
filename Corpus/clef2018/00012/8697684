Hepatic perfusion scintigraphy. Relationship of liver perfusion and ascites in patients with liver cirrhosis. Radionuclide studies were performed on 38 patients with biopsy proven liver cirrhosis in an attempt to evaluate the interrelationship between liver perfusion and ascites in cirrhotic patients. Quantitative hepatic scintigraphy was used to evaluate the relative contribution of hepatic arterial and portal venous blood flow to the hepatic circulation. Using a gamma camera and on-line computer system, a bolus of 370 MBq Tc-99m pertechnetate was injected intravenously. Time activity curves of the abdominal aorta and right lobe of the liver were obtained using a region of interest analysis where arterial and portal components were calculated. Ascites was determined by clinical examination and by ultrasonography. Of 38 patients, 10 patients (26.3%) showed normal liver perfusion (group A), 22 patients (58%) showed reduced portal venous perfusion (group B), and 6 patients (15.7%) showed pure arterial hepatic perfusion (group C). The incidence, as well as the advancement, of ascites were significant (P < 0.05) and were most frequent in group C, frequent in group B, and less frequent in group A. The results of this study suggest that the development of ascites in patients with liver cirrhosis is closely correlated with the reduction in portal blood perfusion.
