Vasopressin plus oxygen vs vasopressin alone in cirrhotic patients with portal-hypertensive gastropathy: effects on gastric mucosal haemodynamics and oxygenation. The effects of vasopressin plus oxygen and vasopressin alone on gastric mucosal perfusion and oxygenation were studied using reflectance spectrophotometry and laser Doppler velocimetry in 23 cirrhotic patients with portal-hypertensive gastropathy. The measurements were performed under basal conditions and after double-blinded administration of placebo (n = 7), vasopressin (0.3 U/min n = 8) or vasopressin (0.3 U/min) plus nasal oxygen (4 L/min
