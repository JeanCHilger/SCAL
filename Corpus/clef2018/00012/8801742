The effectiveness of reaferone in chronic myeloid leukemia assessed with ultrasonic and histomorphologic examination. The effectiveness of reapherone administration for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia has been studied using sonography of the liver and spleen as well as morphometry of histological patterns of the bone marrow. The study group included 17 patients (chronic disease-16 progressing disease-1). Ten patients received reapherone and 7-myelosan. Dynamic evaluation of scanning evidence for liver and spleen proved instrumental in assessing the effect of reapherone therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia. Similar tendencies were identified by sonography and morphometry applications: reapherone-treated patients revealed decreased liver and spleen, foci of fibrosis dissolving while the morphometric findings pointed to the decreasing indices of collagenous fibrosis and megacariocytic source of the bone marrow. It is suggested that reapherone acts upon the hemopoietic tissue indirectly-via endosal cells of the bone marrow stroma.
