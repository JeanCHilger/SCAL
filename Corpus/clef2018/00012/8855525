Transmesenteric-transfemoral method of intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement with minilaparotomy. To determine whether the transmesenteric-transfemoral method of intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (IPS) placement is safer and more efficient than the transjugular method.Sixty-six consecutive patients with cirrhosis and bleeding varices underwent 67 IPS procedures. Sixty-one of these procedures were performed using a combination of transfemoral access to the hepatic vein with transmesenteric access to the portal system provided by means of minilaparotomy. Follow-up days were collected periodically by means of clinical evaluation and duplex sonography of the shunt. Angiographic evaluation was performed when necessary.No technical failures or periprocedural deaths occurred. The radiologic and surgical portions of the procedure were accomplished within 45 and 55 minutes, respectively. In cases without portal thrombosis, maximum fluoroscopy time was 12 minutes. During follow-up (mean, 16 months), eight shunt revisions including one additional shunt placement were necessary.Transmesenteric-transfemoral IPS placement requires surgical participation but may offer improved efficiency and safety compared with regular transjugular IPS placement.
