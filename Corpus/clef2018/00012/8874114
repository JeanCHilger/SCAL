Renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia: an autosomal recessive disorder with renal and hepatic failure. We report two brothers with renal dysplasia and congenital hepatic fibrosis. One patient died shortly after birth of lung hypoplasia. The second developed end-stage renal failure at 14 months. The hepatic fibrosis progressed to cirrhosis and hepatic failure. Pancreatic function was normal, but increased echogenicity was seen on ultrasound. At age 3 years and 9 months a successful combined liver-kidney transplantation was performed. The features of our patients are compatible with the "renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia" syndrome.Renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia is an autosomal recessive disorder with variable expression. Combined liver-kidney transplantation offers a new therapeutic option.
