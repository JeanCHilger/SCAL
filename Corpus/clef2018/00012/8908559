Endosonographic evaluation of the venous anatomy around the gastro-esophageal junction in patients with portal hypertension. Para-esophageal venous collaterals and perforating veins have recently been suspected to play an important role in the development of esophageal varices and their recurrence after initial obliteration in patients with portal hypertension. We undertook this study to look at the cross-sectional venous anatomy around the gastro-esophageal junction, with special attention to those venous structures, using the Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) in patients with different grades of esophageal varices.EUS examination was performed on the upper stomach, GE junction, and lower esophagus in 50 patients with liver cirrhosis, 20 of whom had small (grades 1 & 2) and 30 had large (grades 3 & 4) esophageal varices.Esophageal varices could be detected in all the 30 (100%) patients with large, but in 9 (45%) of patients with small varices. Gastric Varices were detected significantly more often by EUS (33 66%) compared with endoscopy (17Perforating veins connecting the paraesophageal with the submucosal veins (varices) in the lower esophagus, demonstrated for the first time by EUS, may have an important role in the development of varices and in their recurrence after sclerotherapy.
