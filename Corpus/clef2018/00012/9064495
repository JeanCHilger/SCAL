Prenatal detection of a cyst in the liver hilum. Interpretation for an adequate treatment. The diagnosis assigned to a cystic collection of liver hilum (CCLH) detected by means of prenatal ultrasonography is usually that of choledochal cyst (CC) thus carrying a good prognosis. The aim of this work is to state more precisely the significance of such CCLH, from a review of our experience. Files of children treated in our institution for either CC or biliary atresia (BA) with bile duct cysts have been screened for prenatal detection of CCLH. From 1985 to 1994, seven children have been referred to our institution, all after birth, all after prenatal detection of CCLH between 22 and 38 weeks of pregnancy (median = 33 weeks). Postnatal diagnosis, established by means of percutaneous cholangiography, was CC in 5 children without any evidence of cholestasis, and BA in 2 children with alcoholic stools and hepatomegaly. The 5 CC patients have been submitted to successful surgery at age 16 days to 10 months. The 2 BA patients have been operated at age 23 and 111 days, the latter unfortunately with gross cirrhosis and portal hypertension. An accurate prenatal diagnosis had been done by previous investigators only in 3 of the 7 cases, all 3 being CC cases. A review of the literature confirms that prenatal detection of a CCLH occurs mostly during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and that of the postnatal diagnosis is almost always CC. Nevertheless the diagnosis of BA, requiring an early surgical procedure is also possible. We recommend that prenatal detection of a CCLH should result at least in referring the baby soon after birth to a team skilled in hepatobiliary pathology.
