Plasma concentration of endothelin-1 does not reflect renal vasoconstriction as estimated by duplex ultrasonography in cirrhosis. Endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor, is thought to play a role in liver cirrhosis-related functional kidney failure. Our aim was to investigate the correlation between renal vasoconstriction, as detected by a Doppler ultrasound technique, and plasma concentrations of endothelin in cirrhotic patients. Fifty cirrhotic patients underwent Doppler examinations to detect renal vasoconstriction. The plasma concentration of endothelin was measured in 10 patients who exhibited vasoconstriction of the renal microvessels diagnosed by Doppler waveform analysis and was compared to that of patients in whom there was no sign of such vasoconstriction. No difference was observed in the plasma concentration of endothelin between patients in whom renal vasoconstriction was diagnosed and those in whom it was not. Our results suggested that the circulating endothelin does not reflect renal vasoconstriction, at least in the early phase of the functional renal failure associated with cirrhosis of the liver.
