Superiority of laparoscopy compared to ultrasonography in diagnosis of widespread liver diseases. The aim of the study was to compare the results of ultrasonography (US) and laparoscopy in a series of 210 patients referred to our institution for the diagnosis of widespread liver diseases. Among 205 patients, laparoscopy revealed cirrhosis in 114, chronic widespread disease in 70 (chronic persistent hepatitis in 21, chronic active hepatitis in 28, steatosis in 14, acute hepatitis in 5, fibrosis in 2), and absence of liver disease in 21. Four of these cases had minor complications. A corroborative diagnosis was obtained in 122 patients (59.5%). Overall sensitivity of US was 84% with a low specificity due to the high rate of false negatives. From the results of this study we conclude that laparoscopy is a safe and essential diagnostic tool in the final diagnosis of widespread liver diseases and that US is not a reliable screening method because of its incidence of false negatives.
