Ovarian vein thrombosis during cesarean section. A report of two cases. Puerperal ovarian vein thrombosis occurs in 0.2-0.5% of deliveries. It is usually thought to result from infection, but it has been hypothesized that thrombosis may occur as a primary event, and radiologic studies raise the possibility that ovarian vein thrombosis may occur quite frequently.Case 1 had right ovarian vein thrombosis diagnosed at the time of nonemergency cesarean section for placenta previa. This was treated with ligation of the infundibulopelvic ligament above the level of the clot. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging showed contralateral ovarian vein thrombosis, and therefore anticoagulant therapy was begun. The patient was asymptomatic. Case 2 had right ovarian vein thrombosis extending to the inferior vena cava diagnosed at elective repeat cesarean section. She was heparinized in the recovery room subsequent ventilation/perfusion scan showed a probable pulmonary embolism. Both patients recovered uneventfully.These two cases demonstrate that ovarian vein thrombosis may occur as a primary event, in the absence of infection, and result in pulmonary embolism. Individualized management based on operative findings is recommended.
