Three decades' experience in surgery of hepatocellular carcinoma. In the author's institution, 2254 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been treated during 1958-1994. The overall 5-year survival increased from 5.4% (1958-1970), to 11.9% (1971-1982), to 46.2% (1983-1984), which correlated well with the increasing proportion of small HCC in the series (2.6%, 12.1%, and 33.4%, respectively) with the increasing percentage of limited resection (3.1%, 32.2%, and 58.3%)
