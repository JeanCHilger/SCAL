Phase shift of the hepatic vein flow velocity waveform in chronic liver disease: experimental and clinical studies. We examined animal models and studied patients with chronic liver disease to evaluate phase shift of the flow-velocity waveform of the hepatic vein (HV). We decided the Doppler-Pressure (DP) ratio using electrocardiography, the HV Doppler waveform and HV pressure curves, and we calculated the DP ratios. In animal models, the mean DP ratio was 1.04 in controls, 0.68 in cirrhosis, and 1.22 in fatty liver. There were significant differences among these groups (p < 0.005). In the clinical study, the mean DP ratio was 1.03 in controls, 0.95 in chronic hepatitis and 0.79 in cirrhosis. The DP ratio in the Cirrhosis Group was significantly different from that in the Control Group (p < 0.001) and that in the Chronic Hepatitis Group (p < 0.05). We conclude that the DP ratio is decreased in certain hepatic disease states.
