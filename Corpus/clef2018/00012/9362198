Splanchnic hemodynamic pattern and liver function in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal or gastric varices. This study was designed to characterize the splanchnic hemodynamic pattern and liver function in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal or gastric varices.Forty control subjects and 112 patients with cirrhosis were studied. Portal inflow (the sum of superior mesenteric arterial and splenic arterial flows), portal venous flow, and collateral flow (the difference between portal inflow and portal venous flow) were measured using duplex ultrasonography. Endoscopic examination showed that 45 patients had no varices or small esophageal or gastric varices, 49 had large esophageal varices, and 18 had large gastric varices. Liver function was assessed by Pugh-Child score.Portal inflow was significantly greater in patients with large esophageal varices or large gastric varices than in control subjects and patients with no varices or small esophageal or gastric varices. Portal venous flow was significantly lower in patients with large gastric varices than in the other three groups. Collateral flow was significantly greater in patients with large gastric varices than in patients with large esophageal varices. The Pugh-Child score was significantly higher in patients with large gastric varices than in patients with large esophageal varices. The Pugh-Child score was also inversely correlated with portal venous flow (r = -0.35, p < 0.01) and directly correlated with collateral flow (r = 0.59, p < 0.01).Both patients with esophageal varices and those with gastric varices have increased portal inflow. However, patients with gastric varices, in contrast to patients with esophageal varices, have a reduced portal venous flow associated with an increased collateral flow. Such a portal outflow pattern may contribute to the worse liver function seen in patients with gastric varices.
