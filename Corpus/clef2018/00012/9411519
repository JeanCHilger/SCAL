Diagnostic imaging in the selection of candidates to orthotopic transplantation of the liver. Experience at a hospital lacking a transplantation department. We report the experience of our general hospital in selecting the patients for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Fifty-one patients with cirrhosis were examined and 20 of them submitted to OLT from August, 1992, to November, 1995. For liver studies, the 20 transplant recipients were examined with US and plain and dynamic CT 15/20 were submitted to CTAP, 10/20 to Lipiodol CT and 17/20 to angiography. The accuracy of these techniques in HCC detection was assessed by correlation with resected whole livers. The accuracy of duplex Doppler and color flow Doppler for portal and/or mesenteric vein thrombosis was evaluated by correlation with resected livers, CT and angiographic findings. Pathologic examinations diagnosed HCC in 5/20 transplant recipients: 2 lesions (1.5 cm and 2 cm
