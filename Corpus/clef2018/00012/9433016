Ultrasonography, biochemical and hematological profiles in liver disease caused by intravenous administration of dimethylnitrosamine in dogs. The results of liver function tests and ultrasonographical findings were analysed in 7 dogs that were intravenously injected dimethylnitrosamine (DMNA 2 mg/kg body weight) on 2 consecutive days each week for 10 weeks. Typical clinical signs and similar changes in liver enzyme concentrations that develop in dogs with natural cirrhosis were observed in this canine model. Severe anaemia and a significant reduction in the platelet numbers occurred in the dogs that died in the 5th week, while in all the other dogs these parameters decreased slightly. Serum total protein and the albumin/globulin ratio decreased gradually while the alkaline phosphatase, alanine amino transferase, aspartate amino transferase and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase activities increased significantly (p < 0.05) in all dogs after beginning the administration of DMNA. Ultrasound findings of a coarsened and heterogeneous echo pattern with increased echogenicity that are characteristic of canine cirrhosis were noticed at the same time when the changes in liver enzymes became evident. Present results suggest that ultrasonography in conjunction with liver function tests may be useful in the evaluation of experimentally induced liver cirrhosis.
