Spontaneous portasystemic shunt in liver cirrhosis: imaging with color-coded duplex ultrasonography. To demonstrate the usefulness of B-scan ultrasonography and color Doppler ultrasonography (CCDS) in the diagnosis of lumbal and splenorenal collateral veins in patients with liver cirrhosis.46 patients with histologically proven liver cirrhosis were examined by means of B-scan ultrasonography. CCDS was used to demonstrate the vascular character of mass-like lesions or tortuous tubular structures. Esophageal varices were demonstrated in 23 (50%) and ascites in 6 patients (13%).In 5 out of 46 patients (10.9%) we demonstrated lumbal and splenorenal portosystemic venous collaterals by B-scan- and CCDS. In 2 patients localized venous collaterals were demonstrated. No ascites was found in patients with accessory portosystemic shunts. CCDS showed the patency of these spontaneous portosystemic shunts.In patients with chronic liver disease CCDS is a noninvasive method to demonstrate spontaneous portosystemic shunts due to portal hypertension. The method provides information concerning patency and flow direction of the collateral veins.
