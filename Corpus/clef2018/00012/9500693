Splenic impedance indices: a useful method to monitor patients after liver transplantation? Splenic Doppler impedance indices are influenced, in portal hypertensive patients, by the resistance of the portal system. The aim of the study was to verify the usefulness of these indices in evaluating the presence of a pathological increase in portal resistance in patients with complications after liver transplantation. Splenic impedance indices have been evaluated in 46 patients before orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), and 2 days, 1, 4, 8, and 12 to 18 months after transplantation. The results showed that spleen size slowly decreased after liver transplantation. From a baseline longitudinal diameter value of 18.0+/-3.6 cm (M+/-SD), the decrease was by 0%+/-3%, 8%+/-8%, 13%+/-9%, 15%+/-11%, and 14%+/-11% at 2 days and 1, 4, 8, and 12 to 18 months after liver transplantation. Splenic impedance indices-resistance index = (peak systolic - end diastolic) / peak systolic velocity pulsatility index = (peak systolic - end diastolic) / mean velocity-which were increased before liver transplantation, showed a rapid decrease to normal values: resistance index: from 0.62+/-0.08 to 0.55+/-0.08 after 2 days, and to 0.49+/-0.09, 0.51+/-0.10, 0.54+/-0.10, 0.55+/-0.11 after 1, 4, 8, 12-18 months
