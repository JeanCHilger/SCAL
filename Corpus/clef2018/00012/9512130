Portal hemodynamics by duplex Doppler sonography in different grades of cirrhosis. Not much is known about the relationship between portal hemodynamics and the grades of cirrhosis. Using pulsed Doppler ultrasonography, we studied portal vein diameter, portal flow velocity, and portal blood flow rate in 37 patients with liver cirrhosis (11 Child's A, 13 Child's B, and 13 Child's C) and 10 healthy controls. There was no difference in the maximum inner diameter of the portal vein in cirrhotics and controls. However, there was a significant decrease in the portal flow velocity in patients with Child's C cirrhosis, as compared to controls and patients with Child's A and Child's B cirrhosis. The portal blood flow rate in Child's B and Child's C cirrhosis was also significantly less as compared to controls and patients with Child's A cirrhosis. Patients with ascites and encephalopathy had significantly lower portal flow velocities and blood flow rate as compared to those without ascites and encephalopathy, respectively. This study indicates that portal flow significantly decreased in cirrhotic patients with worsening Child's grade of cirrhosis.
