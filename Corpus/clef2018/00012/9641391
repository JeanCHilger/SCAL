Sonographic findings in noncirrhotic portal fibrosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sonographic appearances of noncirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF).Between 1983 and 1996, 12 patients between the ages of 16 and 60 years were diagnosed with NCPF on the basis of medical history and clinical, imaging, and biopsy findings.Sonograms for all patients showed hyperechoic bands surrounding the portal vein branches, which were separated from adjacent liver parenchyma by a hypoechoic stripe. All liver biopsy specimens showed nonspecific changes and no cirrhosis. Histologic findings included fibrosis and some obliteration of the intrahepatic portal veins.If sonography of the liver shows increased echogenicity of the walls of the portal vessels with a hypoechoic stripe between the wall and the adjacent liver parenchyma in a patient who has portal hypertension and normal liver function tests, NCPF should be considered.
