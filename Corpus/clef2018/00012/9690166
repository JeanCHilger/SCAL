Fetal renal venous thrombosis: a typical ultrasonographic aspect. We report a case of RVT, diagnosed at 34 weeks' gestation in a case of fetal distress occurring four days after an acute maternal gastroenteritis. The typical ultrasonic pattern included renal enlargement, with parenchymal hyperechogenicity and venous echoic streaks, loss of the cortico-medullary boundary and lack of definition of renal sinus echoes. Color Doppler velocimetry confirmed the absence of venous flow with an increased vascular resistance in the renal artery. After delivery by an emergency caesarean section the infant had a full anatomical and functional recovery of his affected kidney at the seventh day of life.
