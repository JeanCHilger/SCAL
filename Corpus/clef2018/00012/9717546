Echo-guided radiofrequency percutaneous ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis using a cooled needle. Radiofrequency hyperthermia using the newly-developed "cooled-tip" needle is one of the latest US-guided percutaneous treatments of hepatocellular carcinoma arising in cirrhosis. The continuous cooling of the needle tip allows tissue heating and necrosis far from the electrode without tissue charring, which was the major drawback of the old monopolar technique. Herein we report our preliminary results on feasibility and effectiveness of the thermoablation of mono- or paucifocal hepatocellular carcinoma with the cooled-tip needle.November, 1996, to January, 1998, we treated thirteen cirrhotic patients (mean age 69.5 yrs, 10 men, 12 HCV-positive 11 in Child's Class A and 2 in Class B) with 19 hepatocellular carcinoma nodules (mean diameter: 27 mmIn all, 31 thermal injuries (at 1000-1200 mA for 10-15 minutes) were caused in 21 sessions in the 19 hepatocellular carcinoma nodules (mean: 1.5 lesions per nodule and 1.6 sessions per patient). Complete necrosis as assessed at dynamic CT (no enhancement during the arteriographic phase) was achieved in 16 of 19 nodules (84%). No side-effects occurred. During the follow-up (median: 11 months) no death occurred and five patients had recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma appearing either as single nodule or as multinodular liver involvement.In our experience radiofrequency hyperthermia with the cooled-tip needle permits effective and safe percutaneous ablation of HCC in cirrhosis. In addition, treatment time is short and lesions > 3 cm can be treated. Further experience is needed to better define the role of percutaneous thermoablation in the treatment strategy of hepatocellular carcinoma.
