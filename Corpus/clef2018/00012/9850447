The middle colic vein: an alternative source of portal inflow in orthotopic liver transplantation complicated by portal vein thrombosis. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) was previously considered a contraindication to orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) since adequate portal blood supply is mandatory for graft function and patient survival. Improvements in surgical technique, however, have meant that this problem now can be circumvented in most instances. Nevertheless portal vein thrombosis remains an obstacle in OLT and is associated with increased incidence of primary non-function and long-term liver failure.A 55-yr-old patient underwent OLT for secondary biliary cirrhosis associated with hepatitis C infection and complicated by long standing PVT. Involvement of the portal, mesenteric, and splenic veins prevented standard portal venous reconstruction. Portal inflow was accomplished by a side-to-end anastomosis between the middle colic vein and the donor portal vein.Hepatic reperfusion and subsequent liver function were excellent. Portal blood flow, as measured by color-enhanced Doppler ultrasound, was normal following surgery until discharge. The post-operative course was complicated by abdominal wound dehiscence and recurrent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The patient was discharged in good clinical condition, with excellent liver function and patent portal vein 89 d after OLT.The middle colic vein is a novel, not previously described, source of portal venous inflow for OLT complicated by extensive splanchnic venous inflow thrombosis.
