Primary biliary cirrhosis with sarcoid-like infiltrations in the lung. A women, 50 years old, has been observed for 4 years because of recurrent infiltrations in both lungs. Biopsy of those lesions revealed sarcoid-like granulomas. Tubercle baccilli were not present in those lesions nor in the sputum or bronchial washings. Anti-tuberculosis therapy was without effect. On admission to our hospital she was in good performance state. There was an infiltration in the base of the left lung. Hepatosplenomegaly was observed on USG examination. Aspartate aminotransferase was 49 UI/l, alanine aminotransferase 70 UI/l. Alkaline phosphatase was 167 UI/l and the titer of antimitochondrial antibodies was 1:2000. Primary biliary cirrhosis was suspected, but the patient refused liver biopsy. Prednisone in the dose of 60 mg per day was given to suppress the granuloma formation in the lungs. During this treatment there was a decrease in size of liver and spleen, lung lesion disappeared and the titer of antimitochondrial antibodies decreased to 1:40. After 3 months of treatment the dose of prednisone was reduced gradually. When she was receiving 15 mg of prednisone every other day the titer of antimitochondrial antibodies rose to 1:8000 and the activity of alkaline phosphatase to 448 UI/l. At this time she accepted liver biopsy. Primary biliary cirrhosis was diagnosed. The possible connection between sarcoid-like granulomas in the lungs and the primary biliary cirrhosis is discussed.
