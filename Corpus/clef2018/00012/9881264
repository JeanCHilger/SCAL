Hepatodiaphragmatic portosystemic shunt in cirrhosis. A case of an unusual form of hepatodiaphragmatic portosystemic shunt arising from the periphery of left posterosuperior portal vein branch, running beneath the inferior aspect of left hemidiaphragm and draining into the left lateral abdominal wall is demonstrated and assessed with digital subtraction portography, maximum-intensity-projection images reconstructed from helical CT during arterial portography and pulsed Doppler sonography with flow velocity measurement. This is a reported case of this unusual intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and discussion on the utility of current radiological techniques.
