Evaluation of contrast echocardiography and lung perfusion scan in detecting intrapulmonary vascular dilatation in normoxemic patients with early liver cirrhosis. Intrapulmonary vascular dilatations (IPVD) are extrahepatic complications occurring in liver transplant candidates, that can result in severe hypoxemia. The aim of this study was to compare the use of two diagnostic modalities, contrast echocardiography and lung perfusion scan, in detecting IPVD in normoxemic patients with early liver cirrhosis.Fifty-six consecutive outpatients with biopsy-proven cirrhosis had contrast-echocardiography, a lung perfusion scan, pulmonary function tests, and arterial blood gas estimations. All patients were grade A or B according to the Child-Pugh classification. Patients with chronic intrinsic lung disease, heart failure or malignancy were excluded from the study.All patients had normal arterial blood-gas analyses. Eight out of 56 patients (14.3%) had a positive contrast echocardiogram, all with a decreased diffusion capacity (DLCO < 75% of the predicted value). An isolated DLCO impairment was observed in 40% of the patients with normal spirometry. None of the patients with echocardiography-proven IPVD had a positive lung perfusion scan (p<0.005).In normoxemic cirrhotic patients, subclinical pulmonary vasodilatation and gas-exchange abnormalities can occur. Contrast-enhanced echocardiography is the most valuable screening test in detecting IPVD in the early stages of hepatic insufficiency.
