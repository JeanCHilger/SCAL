Percutaneous ethanol injection under general anesthesia for hepatocellular carcinoma: 3 year survival in 112 patients. percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) under general anesthesia (One Shot PEI) is a new therapy for large and multiple hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by the injection of large amount of ethanol in the tumor. We report our results with 3 years survival rates in patients with HCC on cirrhosis treated with One Shot PEI.between October 1992 and July 1996, 112 cirrhotic patients (79 males age: 45-80five patients died within 7 h-10 days after the treatment for rupture of esophageal varices in three cases, rupture of subcapsular HCC in one case and liver failure in one case. In the remaining 107 patients, dynamic CT or spiral CT, performed 72 h-1 month after the treatment, showed complete necrosis in 76 cases (71%) and incomplete necrosis (although always ?50%) in 31. Survival rates at 1, 2, 3 years in all 107 patients were 88, 76, and 76% respectively. Survival rates in Child A Class patients were 100, 92, 92% and in Class B patients were 84, 72, and 72% at 1, 2, 3 years respectively in Class C were 70 and 40% at 1 and 2 years respectively (P=0.01). Survival rates in patients with single nodule were 95, 82 and 82% at 1, 2 and 3 years, while in patients with multiple nodules were 80, 68 and 58% at 1, 2 and 3 years respectively (P=n.s.). During the follow-up (6-46 months) 48 patients showed intrahepatic recurrencesPEI One Shot is more aggressive than traditional PEI. Survival rates of PEI One Shot seems similar to those obtainable by conventional PEI and even better than surgery.
