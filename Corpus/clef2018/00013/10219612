Hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis: semeiology and performance of magnetic resonance imaging and lipiodol computed tomography. a) Describe hepatocellular semiology in magnetic resonance imaging and lipiodol computerized tomography in patients with cirrhosis, who are candidates for surgery b) Clarify the respective roles of magnetic resonance imaging and lipiodol computerized tomography in hepatocellular detection.Twenty four patients with suspected hepatocellular carcinoma underwent successive magnetic resonance imaging and lipiodol computerized tomography. Thirty-four of the 67 lesions seen by lipiodol computerized tomography and 28 of 52 lesions seen by magnetic resonance imaging were confirmed histologically.In lipiodol computerized tomography, 44% of hepatocellular carcinomas had a dense and homogeneous pattern 24% had a homogeneous but slightly dense pattern. Sixteen distinct deposits were described: 4 were confirmed as hepatocellular carcinoma and 12 were not controlled histologically. In magnetic resonance imaging 57% of hepatocellular carcinomas have a high intensity on T1 and T2 weighted spin echo images, 38% were hyperintense on T2 and hypo or isointense on T1 weighted images. Eighty-six percent of hyperintense T1 and T2 weighted images were hepatocellular carcinoma. When the gold standard was histology, lipiodol computerized tomography sensitivity (81%) was higher than magnetic resonance imaging (68%). When the gold standard was lipiodol computerized tomography, the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging was 47 +/- 12%.a) The sensitivity of lipiodol computerized tomography was better than resonance magnetic imaging b) the homogeneous and slightly dense pattern corresponded to a hepatocellular carcinoma in 50% of cases
