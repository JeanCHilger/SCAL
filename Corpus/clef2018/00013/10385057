Cholestasis of pregnancy. Cholestasis of pregnancy is the commonest liver disease unique to pregnancy and is characterized by pruritus in the mother in late pregnancy, without any skin rashes. This is accompanied by an elevation of the serum bile acids. Liver function test abnormalities may occur. Abdominal pain is not a feature and liver failure does not occur. The diagnosis is made by a suggestive history and exclusion of other causes by the history, serology and an upper abdominal ultrasound. All symptoms and signs should disappear within 4 weeks post-partum prolonged post-partum courses should prompt a search for other causes, such as primary biliary cirrhosis. The syndrome is associated with a five-fold increased incidence of stillbirth, intra-partum foetal distress and pre-term labour. The reason is not clear and not predictable. The accepted management is induction or delivery at 38 weeks, which has led to a reduction in poor foetal outcome. Preliminary studies using ursodeoxycholic acid show symptomatic and biochemical improvement in most women treated. There is also a suggestion of an improved foetal outcome and treatment should be considered in women who present with the condition earlier in pregnancy.
