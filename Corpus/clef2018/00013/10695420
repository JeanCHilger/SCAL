Effect of hepatitis C virus coinfection on liver function of patients infected with HIV. Both the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) share similar routes for their transmission, encouraging the possibility of a coinfection with the two viruses in some individuals. We wanted to find out the prevalence of HCV in patients infected with the HIV virus.We tested 57 HIV positive patients for anti-HCV antibodies. Liver functions tests, ultrasound abdomen and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were carried out in the anti-HCV positive patients.Coinfection with HCV was seen in 5.3% of patients. Of these 2 had acquired the infections through blood transfusions and one through heterosexual contact. One patient had cirrhosis with portal hypertension and one had raised alkaline phosphatase as the only abnormality on liver function tests.Because HCV is more infectious by the parenteral route, the incidence of coinfection is lower in our population possibly due to the fact that majority of our HIV positive patients acquire infection through heterosexual contact.
