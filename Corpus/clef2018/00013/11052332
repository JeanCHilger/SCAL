Clinical significance of patent paraumbilical vein in patients with liver cirrhosis. A patent paraumbilical vein (PUV) is a frequent finding in patients with cirrhosis when studied by duplex Doppler ultrasound. There is controversy regarding the clinical significance of this finding. We studied 50 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension as evidenced by the demonstration of esophageal varices on endoscopy. All 50 patients were evaluated for a significant PUV (diameter of > or =3 mm) using duplex Doppler sonography. The patients were divided into two groups based on the size of esophageal varices (group A with small varices, N = 30 group B with large varices, N = 20). A significant PUV was seen in 21 (42%) patients. The patients with portosystemic encephalopathy had a significantly greater prevalence of PUV (70%) than those without (32%, P < 0.02). Of the group with large esophageal varices, 6 (30%) had a significant PUV, while in the group with small varices, 15 (50%) had a significant PUV (P > 0.05). In no patient with large varices did the PUV diameter exceed 6 mm, while in as many as six patients with small varices, the PUV diameter exceeded 6 mm. A significantly enlarged PUV seen on duplex Doppler ultrasound in cirrhotics may have important hemodynamic consequences. Besides predisposing the patient to portosystemic encephalopathy, it may also offer some protection against formation of large varices. In particular, a very large patent PUV (> or =6 mm) might identify a subgroup of patients with small varices and thus a lesser likelihood of variceal bleeding.
