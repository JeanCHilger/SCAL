Intrahepatic hemodynamic changes following portal vein embolization: a prospective Doppler study. The aim of this study was to describe the intrahepatic hemodynamic modifications induced by right portal vein embolization (RPVE) using Doppler ultrasound. Eighteen patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 8), liver metastases (n = 9), or multiple adenomas, underwent RPVE 1 month before right hepatectomy in order to increase the size of future remnant liver. Doppler ultrasound was performed before and 1 month after RPVE. The portal vein flow and the hepatic artery resistive index in right and left lobes (segments V and III) were calculated. We recorded simultaneously artery and portal vein of segment III to measure the arterioportal ratio calculated as follows: (maximal arterial systolic velocity minus maximal portal vein velocity)/maximal arterial systolic velocity. Results were compared in cirrhotic patients (group A) and in healthy liver patients (group B). In both groups, portal flow was not significantly modified following RPVE. In the left lobe, in both groups the hepatic artery resistive index was not significantly modified. In group B, the arterioportal ratio decreased significantly (0.71 +/- 0.18 and 0.42 +/- 0.23, respectively, before and after embolization p < 0.01), whereas it was not statistically modified in group A (0.75 +/- 0.17 and 0.69 +/- 0.14, respectively, before and after embolization). The right hepatic arterial resistive index decreased significantly in both groups after embolization (0.74 +/- 0.07 to 0.66 +/- 0.07, p<0.05
