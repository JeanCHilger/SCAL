Color and pulsed Doppler ultrasound findings in normally functioning transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts. To evaluate blood flow changes inside normally functioning transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS), using color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) and pulsed Doppler ultrasound (PDUS).A total of 72 patients (mean age 54, range 36-78 years) underwent TIPS placement, portal angiography, CDUS and PDUS examinations. Measurements inside the stent were taken at the portal side, at the central part and at the venous end of the TIPS.In well functioning TIPS the mean peak velocity (PV) on the portal side was 37 m/s (range 22-65 cm/s), in the area of the incoming intrahepatic portal branch the mean PV was 59 cm/s (range 40-95 cm/s) and at the side of the incoming hepatic vein the mean PV was 135 cm/s (range 88-220 cm/s). In the punctured hepatic and portal veins the mean PV was 25 cm/s (range 15-30 cm/s) and 18 cm/s (10-22 cm/s), respectively. The flow increase from the portal to the mid part (P less than or = 0.001) and to the venous side was statistically significant (P less than or = 0.001).A velocity gradient between the portal and the venous side of a TIPS is a normal finding caused by branches of the portal and hepatic vein joining the TIPS from the side and it is characteristic of a normally functioning TIPS.
