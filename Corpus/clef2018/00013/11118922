Ultrasound-guided percutaneous ethanol injection under general anesthesia for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhosis: long-term results in 268 patients. Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) under general anesthesia (One-shot PEI) is a therapy for large and multiple hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by the injection of a large amount of ethanol into the tumor. We report our results with 5-year survival rates in patients with HCC on cirrhosis treated with One-shot PEI.From October 1992 to March 1998, 268 cirrhotic patients (age 42-82 years 191 malesCT showed complete necrosis in 357/506 nodules (70%). Five patients (1.8%) with nine nodules died as a result of the procedure (variceal bleeding in three cases, liver failure in one and hemoperitoneum in one). The overall survival rates were 93, 83, 74, 65 and 59% at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively. Survival rates were 90, 84, 82 and 82% at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months, respectively, in patients with a single nodule less than or = 5 cm, and 97, 71, 59, 59 and 59% at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months, respectively, in patients with single nodule >5 cm. Patients with multiple nodules had survival rates of 97, 89, 75, 60 and 60% at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months, respectively.PEI of large and multiple HCC showed survivals similar to conventional PEI for patients with smaller tumors.
