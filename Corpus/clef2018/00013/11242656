Complete response of a massive hepatocellular carcinoma with lung metastasis to UFT (DPD inhibitory fluoroprymidines: DIF). A 77-year-old man was referred to our hospital because a periodic examination for hepatitis C cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus at a nearby clinic had revealed an elevated AFP level. Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan revealed a giant tumor in the right hepatic lobe, and a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was made with a biopsy. A pulmonary CT scan also revealed a diffuse granular shadow in the right lung field, leading to a diagnosis of multiple pulmonary metastases from the hepatocellular carcinoma. Arterial infusion chemotherapy was performed, but was ineffective. Thus, the administration of 600 mg/day of UFT was initiated. Both the AFP and PIVKA-2 levels, which had been increasing, returned to normal 3 months later. Ultrasound and CT scan showed that the hepatocellular carcinoma and lung metastatic foci had disappeared completely. The administration of UFT therefore appears promising for the treatment of hepatocelluar carcinoma and can be used safely, even with patients in poor general condition.
