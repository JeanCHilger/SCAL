Clinical observation on the long-term therapeutic effects of traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver fibrosis. 48 patients with liver fibrosis due to hepatitis B were treated for 2 years with the drugs for tonifying the kidney, supplementing qi, cooling and invigorating the blood and detoxification. The symptoms were markedly improved, and serum ALT and bilirubin were recovered and kept normal in most of the cases. The mean levels of serum hyaluronic acid, procollagen peptide III and circulating immune complex were decreased and returned to normal after the treatment. B-ultrasonography showed that the portal vein kept in normal size in 82% of the patients, the enlarged portal vein diminished in diameter, and the enlarged spleen reduced.
