The methods of mean scatterer spacing estimation and its application. Ultrasonic Backscattered Signal(UBSS) from tissues is fundamentally a statistical signal. The statistics of UBSS provide information relating to the number, mean spacing and the scattering cross sections of the scatterers constituting the tissue. Mean scatterer spacing(MSS) is an important parameter for describing the biological tissues microstructural features and tissues ultrasonic scattering characteristics. This paper reviews the methods of MSS estimation as well as ultrasonic imaging based on the scatterer spacing.
