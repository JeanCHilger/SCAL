Renal Doppler ultrasonography and its relationship with the renal function in patients with liver cirrhosis. To relate the renal hemodynamic changes, as assessed by Doppler ultrasonography,with the development of ascites, renal function, and endogenous vasoactive systems in patients with liver cirrhosis.60 cirrhotic patients were studied prospectively, 31 of these compensated and 29 with ascites. The renal resistive index, renal function and plasmatic levels of renin, aldosterone, noradrenaline and ADH activity were determined.The renal resistive index was significantly higher in the cirrhotic patients with ascites (0.68) than in the compensated cirrhotics (0.63) and was significantly correlated with the serum levels of creatinine,urinary excretion of sodium, plasmatic renin activity and plasmatic concentration of aldosterone.The renal resistive index, study by means of Doppler ultrasonography, shows progressively increased levels with the evolution of the disease, with the deterioration of the renal function and with the activation of the endogenous vasoactive systems.
