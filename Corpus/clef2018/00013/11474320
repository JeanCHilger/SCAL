Ectopic hepatocellular carcinoma arising in the left chest wall: a long-term follow-up. We report the case of a 66-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C and a slowly growing left chest wall mass. Two years after the patient first noticed the mass, it was resected. A diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was established. The liver was studied by ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography, but no mass was found. Blind liver biopsy showed mild chronic hepatitis without cirrhosis or HCC. Three years after the discovery of the chest wall HCC, no liver mass had appeared at CT and MRI. We conclude that solitary extrahepatic HCC (i) may arise in ectopic liver tissue (ii) should not be considered as a metastasis of an occult HCC
