Fatal liver infarction after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure. Hepatic infarction is a rare disease. We describe here a cirrhotic patient with end-stage renal failure and recurrent tense ascites with fatal hepatic infarction after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. Abdominal ultrasound, radionuclide liver scan, abdominal computed tomography scan, and finally liver biopsy established the diagnosis. The mechanism causing the infarct is not clear. However, as the infarct appeared after the patient had an episode of shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation, it could well be that the concomitant hepatic arterial insufficiency contributed to the infarct. Physicians should be aware of this possible catastrophic complication.
