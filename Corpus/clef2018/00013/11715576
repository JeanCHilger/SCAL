Diagnostic imaging in liver cirrhosis. For the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography are recommended as imaging modalities. Ultrasound of the liver is used as a screening imaging tool in cases of patients suspicious for diffuse liver disease and is helpful in the term of follow-up examinations. Computed tomography is mainly performed to clarify the presence of liver disease detected by ultrasound. In this context, accurate examination of the vascular structures of the liver as well as extrahepatic situation, is of the essence. Diagnosis of diffuse liver disease and characterization of morphologic changes is improved using contrast-enhanced MR imaging with liver specific contrast media. Combined magnetic resonance imaging can provide comprehensive evaluation of cirrhosis. An improved detection rate and characterization of regenerating nodules can be achieved compared to imaging modalities such as ultrasound and computed tomography. MR imaging can be performed in a one-stop-technique using unenhanced and liver-specific-contrast-enhanced sequence protocols to evaluate the liver parenchyma itself, MR cholangiography to verify the bile duct system, and MR angiography to specify the vascular situation. This technique is the optimal protocol for diagnostic imaging in patients suffering from liver cirrhosis and the method of choice to reach the final diagnosis.
