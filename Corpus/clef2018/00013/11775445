Results of surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma. The overall prognosis of HCC is very poor because most patients are unresectable at the time of initial evaluation. Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for HCC, however the recurrence rate after resection remains high as well. Utilizing screening protocols which incorporates the use of hepatic ultrasound and biochemical markers, HCC can be identified earlier and enable the patient to withstand surgical resection. Morbidity and mortality after resection is multifactorial and relates to HCC itself, underlying liver disease and comorbid conditions. Utilizing tests such as ICG R15, Redox Tolerance Index and Tc-GSA to define the functional status of the liver and staging systems helps define who will tolerate hepatic resection. Morbidity and mortality from hepatic resections has also improved with minimizing intraoperative blood loss and minimizing the amount of functional tissue resected. The use of maneuvers such as total vascular exclusion with or without venovenous bypass has expanded the indications for surgery. Utilizing therapeutic combinations, including TAE, portal vein embolization or ablative therapies widens the indications for resection of HCC. Since there are no chemotherapeutic regimens that have been found to prolong survival, surgical resection remains the procedure of choice for treating HCC.
