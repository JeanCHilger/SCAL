Control of intraoperative bleeding during liver resection: analysis of a questionnaire sent to 231 Japanese hospitals. To determine the safest and most efficient way of performing hepatectomy, the differences in methods employed by Japanese surgeons were examined. In November 1998, a questionnaire on bleeding control during hepatectomy was sent to 270 hospitals located throughout Japan. The answers from 231 hospitals (85.6%) were analyzed. Surgical apparatus such as an ultrasonic dissector (USD) was used in 203 hospitals. Pringle's maneuver was performed routinely in 25%, for segmentectomy and subsegmentectomy in 25%, for lobectomy in 9%, depending on the situation in 34%, and never in 7%. In 135 hospitals (60%), hemostatic materials such as fibrin glue were always applied to the cut surface after hepatectomy. The USD was chosen and widely accepted by the hospitals studied. As Japanese patients with hepatoma often have liver cirrhosis, intermittent occlusion and the selective clamping of hepatic inflow were considered preferable to persistent inflow occlusion. The gentle exposure of hepatic venous branches, careful hemostasis during hepatectomy, and accurate location of the hepatic vein by intraoperative ultrasonography were all considered to be extremely important.
