Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver in a young female. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) of the liver is a lesion characterized by a well circumscribed region of hyperplastic liver tissue with stellate fibrosis. The pathogenesis of FNH is unknown but various authors consider that this lesion may be a response to a preexisting vascular abnormality. A 27-year-old woman was referred because of large liver lesion detected by ultrasound abdominal examination. Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance suggested this was FNH. The patient was conducted to resection of the tumor because of size of the tumor and presence of clinical signs and symptoms. Pathological examination of the surgical resection confirmed diagnosis of FNH. Follow-up after 1 and 2 years showed that the patient remained well but she complained of general weakness and we found unexplained elevation of GGT. Liver biopsy was performed 1 year after resection of the tumor and histopathological examination showed only minimal reactive changes.
