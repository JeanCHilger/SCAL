Close association between high serum alanine aminotransferase levels and multicentric hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with hepatitis C virus-associated cirrhosis. Multicentric development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a characteristic feature of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated cirrhosis (HCV-LC). In this study, the objective was to determine whether the persistent elevation of the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, which represents the inflammatory necrosis of hepatocytes, is correlated with the multicentric development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with early-stage HCV-LC.Ninety-three consecutive patients with biopsy proven HCV-LC (Child Stage A) who had been followed for > 5 years for the development of HCC were studied. They were subdivided into three groups according to their serum ALT level: Group A included 33 patients with annual average serum ALT levels that were persistently high (> or = 80 IU high ALT group), Group B included 41 patients with annual average serum ALT levels that were persistently low (< 80 IUIn Group A, 27 patients (81.8%) developed HCC. Seventeen of 27 patients (63.0%) had multiple nodules. In contrast, in Group B, only 12 patients (29.3%) developed HCC, and only 1 of these 12 patients (8.3%) had multiple nodules. There was a significant difference between Groups A and B in the incidence of developing HCC (P < 0.001) and developing multiple nodules (P = 0.006). In addition, among the male patients, the incidence of developing multiple HCC nodules in Group A (12 of 19 patients 63.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) compared with the incidence in Group B (0 of 6 patientsThese results showed a close correlation between multicentric hepatocarcinogenesis and sustained necroinflammation of the liver in patients with HCV-LC.
