Main characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis and therapeutic approaches. Between 1995 and 1997 we studied 100 patients with hepatocarcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis. Of these 74 were males and 26 females with a mean age of 66 years. 13% patients were only HbsAg positive, 75% only anti-HCV positive, 6% HbsAg and anti-HCV and the etiology in 6% of cases was alcoholic. Alpha-foetoprotein was >400 ng/ml in only 18% of cases and portal thrombosis was present in 12%. Mononodular HCC was observed in 63% of cases (small HCC in only 38%) and in 79% was localized to the right lobe. Of the mononodular types, 70% were shown by echography to be hypoechoic, 6% hysoechoic, 6% hyperechoic and 17% mixed patterns. Histologically, 49% were well-differentiated, 45% moderately-differentiated and 6% poorly-differentiated. No correlation was found between histologic pattern and number of nodules. Well-differentiated HCC was found in 51% of mononodular types and in 46% of multinodular types. Moderately-differentiated HCC was detected in 46% and 43% respectively and poorly-differentiated HCC in 3% and 11% respectively. No correlation was found between number of nodules and the degree of Edmonson.
