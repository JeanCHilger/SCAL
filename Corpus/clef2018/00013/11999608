Anaesthetic management and outcome in right-lobe living liver-donor surgery. We reviewed retrospectively the anaesthetic management and perioperative course of eight right hepatectomies for living liver donation.After preoperative psychiatric evaluation, eight ASA I-II individuals donated the right lobe of their liver to a family member. A graft-recipient body weight ratio of 0.8-1.0% was required for patient selection. Indications for liver transplantation were: hepatitis C viral-related cirrhosis in six patients combined hepatitis C and B viral cirrhosis in one patientData are presented as mean (range). There was no morbidity or mortality and no periods of intraoperative hypotension or haemodynamic instability. The operation time averaged 619 (525-780)min. Four donors were extubated in the operating room immediately after surgery the others were extubated in the intensive care unit, where the mean extubation time was 16.3 (5-25)h after arrival. The estimated blood loss was 967 (550-1,600)mL. No homologous blood was administeredThe study demonstrates that right-lobe living-donor surgery was well tolerated, without intraoperative hypotension or haemodynamic instability, without perioperative anaesthetic or surgical complications, and with an excellent general outcome.
