Hemodynamics in the microvasculature of thioacetamide-induced cirrhotic rat livers. To evaluate the hepatic microcirculatory changes in liver cirrhosis, in vivo microscopic findings were assessed quantitatively in cirrhotic rats.Using in vivo microscopy, the blood flow velocity through terminal portal venules and terminal hepatic venules, and their diameters were measured. The rats were classified into a normal group, fibrosis group, and cirrhosis group, histopathologically. To estimate intrahepatic blood flow of the liver surface, laser-Doppler flowmeter was used for the three groups, and portal venous pressures were measured.Blood flow velocity through terminal portal venules increased significantly in cirrhosis rats. However, among the three groups, there were no significant differences with blood flow velocity through terminal portal venules, diameters of terminal portal venules and terminal hepatic venules. Portal venous pressure and intrahepatic blood flow of the liver surface increased significantly.These data indicate that pre-sinusoidal alterations to hemodynamics become manifest in the liver cirrhosis, which might be related to intrahepatic shunt formation.
