Management of hepatocellular carcinoma: advances in diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Since the major causes of hepatocellular carcinoma are hepatitis viruses, the difference and similarity of clinical features in relation to the causative virus may indicate that persistent inflammation of the liver is a major role in hepatocellular carcinoma development in both HBV and HCV infection. However, there is a variety of molecular products of virus-inducing mutagenesis, especially in HBV. An advance in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is imaging modality to detect hemodynamics of hepatocellular carcinoma with noninvasive methods of ultrasonography and tumor markers. Chemoprevention using synthetic retinoid is another important issue for the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma development, as well as viral eradication and suppression of inflammation in the liver using interferon and other drugs.
