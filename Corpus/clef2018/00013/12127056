Ultrasonographic evidence of phenotypic instability during hepatocarcinogenesis in N-nitrosomorpholine-treated rats. Carcinogen-induced hepatoma in immunocompetent animal models has shown a progress similar to the clinical course of human hepatoma. Ultrasonography (US) was used for consecutive evaluation of the phenotypic changes in Sprague-Dawley rats exposed for 8 weeks to N-nitrosomorpholine (NNM, 200 mg/L). Three distinctive US findings were ascites, coarseness (defined as small and heterogeneously widespread increased echogenecity), and nodularity (defined as a >0.6-cm-sized echogenic region and clearly showing a tumor-like mass). Abdominal ascites was observed in 5 of 26 rats at week 8 NNM posttreatment and the number of rats showing ascites gradually increased. Coarseness (22 of 26 rats) and nodularity (1 of 18) appeared at weeks 8 and 17 NNM posttreatment, respectively. The gross and histological findings indicated that coarseness and nodularity shown in US reflected fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiofibroma, respectively. The computer-aided quantification of coarseness and nodularity showed that the regression-linked phenotypic instability was present in coarseness but not in nodularity. We conclude that the heterogeneity of preneoplasia in NNM-treated rats might be induced by phenotypic instability rather than random initiating events of preneoplastic lesion.
