Effects of somatostatin, octreotide and pitressin plus nitroglycerine on systemic and portal haemodynamics in the control of acute variceal bleeding. To examine the haemodynamic effects of somatostatin (SS) and octreotide (OC) versus pitressin plus nitroglycerine (PN) in the control of variceal bleeding, 224 patients with acute oesophageal and gastric variceal haemorrhage were randomly divided into three groups and treated with SS, OC and PN they also had their Doppler ultrasound parameters measured before, during and after treatment. The success rates of bleeding control in the SS (80.9%, 86.8% and 89.7%, p<0.001) and OC (75.3%, 80.8% and 84.9%, p<0.01) groups were significantly higher than in the PN group (51.8%, 59.0% and 65.1%) at 24, 48 and 72 hours respectively, and the average duration of SS (12.7 + 6.8 h) and OC (13.8 + 8.0 h) was significantly lower than that of PN (24.6 + 15.4 h, p<0.001). Side-effects of SS (7.4%) and OC (8.2%) were less than those of PN (41.0%, p<0.001 and p<0.01). The diameter of portal vein (PVD), velocity of portal vein (PVV), volume of portal blood flow (PVF) and hepatic artery pulsatility index (HA-PI) in all three groups decreased significantly during initial treatment, but recovered when treatment was stopped. Heart rate and cardiac output decreased significantly in patients treated with SS and OC
