Pulmonary arterial hypertension in cirrhosis. Pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH is one of the rare expressions of cirrhosis and defined by a pressure more than 30 mmHg. We report our results in a Tunisian Seria results: 21 cirrhotic patients (19M/12F) with a median age of 60 years (22 to 85) explored by cardiac echographic with measures of PAH. We observe an elevated PAH in 31% of cases. Conclusion elevated PAH is relatively frequent during the evolution of cirrhosis. This symptom needs to be systematically explored in patients proposed for liver graft because increased PAH is a contraindication for liver transplantation.
