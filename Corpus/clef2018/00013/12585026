Highly well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma and benign hepatocellular lesions. Can they be distinguished on fine needle aspiration biopsy? To determine whether highly well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma can be distinguished from benign hepatocellular lesions on fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB).Ninety-five FNABs from 88 patients with hepatic masses/diffuse conditions were reviewed according to new cytologic criteria established by Takenaka et al. They were classified into well-, moderately and poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (W-, M- and P-HCC) and benign aspirates and histologically verified.There were 21 W-HCC, 39 M-HCC, 10 P-HCC, 3 problematic and 22 benign aspirates. The most useful criteria for diagnosing highly W-HCC were architectural features on the smears/cell block sections, including hypercellularity arborescent, cohesive clustersExperience, attention to architectural and cytologic details in smears/cell blocks and clinicopathologic correlation should reduce the number of indeterminate reports. However, there will always remain some cytohistologically challenging cases.
