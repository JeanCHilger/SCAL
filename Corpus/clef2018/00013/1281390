Screening of hepatocellular carcinoma in the middle of a high risk population in Cameroon. We undertook a prospective study of cancerous lesions of the liver in 163 patients (136 males and 27 females) considered to be on high risk. These patients were, healthy carriers of HBs Antigen (n = 70), had chronic hepatitis (n = 45) or cirrhosis (n = 48). The screening was done from two main tests: liver ultrasound and blood alphafoetoprotein. Amongst the 163 patients, malignancy was diagnosed in 29 (22 males and 7 females) giving a prevalence of 17.8 percent: 9 cancers were diagnosed in the group with chronic hepatitis (20 percent), 20 in the group with cirrhosis (41.6 percent) and none in the group of healthy carriers. These results show that in Cameroun, cirrhosis is the most frequent abnormality associated with development of hepatocarcinoma. Thus the strategy against liver cancer should be oriented towards two main objectives vaccination of children after eliminating healthy carriers and a regular follow-up of patients at risk.
