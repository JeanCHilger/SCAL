Percutaneous alcoholization of a small hepatocarcinoma. Twenty-nine small hepatocellular carcinomas (sHCCs) less than 5 cm in diameter were treated with percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) under US guidance in 24 cirrhotic patients. The nodules were treated on an outpatient basis with 6-18 ethanol injections the total amount of alcohol delivered to each lesion was 10-103 ml. Twenty-seven of the 29 HCCs (93.1%) showed no evidence viable neoplastic tissue at a dynamic CT scan combined with multiple fine-needle biopsies performed one month after the end of treatment
