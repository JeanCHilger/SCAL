Comparison of echo-Doppler and splenoportography in the hemodynamic evaluation of the portal system. The Authors discuss the instrumental diagnosis of portal hypertension, comparing echo-Doppler and splenoportography by celiac artery catheterization, performed on 42 patients with cirrhosis. From the data obtained, there may be observed a clear correlation between angiographic and echographic criteria, correlated to the degree of illness. In particular echo-Doppler whether it possible, in a non-invasive way, to control the evolution of progressive haemodynamic resistance, and hepatic and splenic parenchyma, leaving to splenoportography the role to depict anatomic characteristics of portal circulation for a correct surgical program.
