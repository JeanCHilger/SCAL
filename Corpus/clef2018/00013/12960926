Acute portal hemodynamics and cytokine changesfollowing selective transarterial chemoembolization in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Altered portal hemodynamics and inflammation may occur following transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), but early biological and portal perfusion changes are not well characterized when this procedure is performed selectively.We studied variations in portal flow velocity (PFV) using Doppler ultrasonography, as well as serum TNFa, vCAM-1, and E-Selectin at 2 and 24 hours after supraselective TACE in 15 consecutive patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.Variations in PFV occurred both in the embolized and non-embolized liver lobe. PFV increased significantly at 2 hours in the right and left portal vein. At 24 hours, right PFV remained elevated. Serum TNFa increased significantly at 2 hours, but VCAM-1 and E-Selectin levels remained unchanged. Changes in right and left PFV showed a positive correlation (r=0.9, p<0.001). No correlation could be observed between biological and Doppler changes in portal veins.In patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, PFV increased in both liver lobes 2 hours after supraselective TACE, in association with high serum TNFa. Diffuse changes in PFV after TACE suggests that mechanisms involved in the regulation of portal and hepatic arterial hemodynamics are present in patients with cirrhosis. A major role for TNFa in acute portal flow velocity variations is unlikely in this situation.
