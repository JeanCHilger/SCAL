Spontaneous regression of hepatocellular carcinoma. We report a 65-yr-old man with hepatitis B virus-related liver cirrhosis and biopsy-proven hepatocellular carcinoma who has undergone spontaneous regression. The tumor became impalpable, and was no longer detectable by ultrasonography and computed axial tomography, 5 and 30 months later. The alpha-fetoprotein level also decreased to normal range. The clinical course is silent, and the patient is alive and well 37 months after the initial diagnosis.
