Improvements in hepatocellular carcinoma resection by intraoperative ultrasonography and intermittent hepatic inflow blood occlusion. From September, 1989, to December, 1990 (late period), intraoperative ultrasonography (IOU) and intermittent hepatic inflow blood occlusion were introduced in hepatectomy. Compared with the early period from January, 1983, to August, 1989, the resectability of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) increased from 12.1 to 62.1% (P less than 0.0001). More resections on cirrhotic patients (P less than 0.05) and more combined resections with other organs (P less than 0.005) were carried out. Although the operation time was longer (P less than 0.01), less blood loss during surgery and fewer perioperative blood transfusions (P less than 0.001) were found during the late period. Since the rate at which classical resections were performed has reduced (P less than 0.001), postoperative morbidity has also decreased (P less than 0.05). Although the surgical mortality did not differ between the two periods, most deaths in the early period were caused by postoperative hepatic failure which was not found in the late period. Since IOU can clarify the intrahepatic vasculature and identify impalpable and invisible tumors, more precise resections can now be carried out. Intermittent hepatic inflow occlusion reduces blood loss during surgery without increasing risk. We suggest both techniques should be mandatory in hepatectomy for HCC in order for the safety range of resections to be broadened.
