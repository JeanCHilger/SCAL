Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver. For several weeks a 27-year-old man had experienced a pressure sensation and noticed a spherical area of resistance in the epigastrium. On physical examination the firm, elastic tumour seemed most likely to be arising from the liver. Sonography recorded a 7.4 x 10.5 cm echo-poor structure. Computed tomography demonstrated in the tumour a central star-like, hypodense zone which filled with contrast medium, a finding typical of focal nodular hyperplasia. Functional hepatobiliary scintigraphy and histological examination of a fine-needle biopsy from the tumour (slightly enlarged hepatocytes, portal reticular fibrosis, ductular proliferation) confirmed the diagnosis. As there was no danger of rupture and no sign of local compression surgical intervention was not indicated, but regular ultrasound monitoring is planned.
