Effect of verapamil on portal blood flow in patients with liver cirrhosis. The effect of acute (80 mg orally) and prolonged (240 mg orally daily for 2 weeks) verapamil administration on portal blood flow was studied in 12 patients with histologically proved alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Portal hemodynamics were examined by the ultrasonic duplex Doppler system. Thirty minutes after acute verapamil administration, the following parameters remained unchanged: (1) cross-sectional area of the portal vein, from 1.52 +/- 0.41 to 1.51 +/- 0.43 cm2 (2) portal blood velocity, from 13.2 +/- 1.6 to 13.4 +/- 1.6 cm/s
