Percutaneous transhepatic coronary vein occlusion to treat esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage. To observe the effects and safety of percutaneous transhepatic coronary vein occlusion under ultrasound type B and X-ray guiding to treat esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotic patients.Eighteen cirrhotic patients suffering from esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage were treated with percutaneous transhepatic coronary vein occlusion under ultrasound type B and X-ray guiding. Among them, 8 patients were treated during emergency bleeding and another 10 patients after hemorrhage.Seventeen patients were successfully treated with coronary vein occlusion. One patient rebled after 6 hours of the treatment and was treated successfully with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. The emergency hemostatic treatment efficacy was 87.5%, and successful occlusion occurred in 94.4%. All patients were followed up for 1 to 24 months. There were 4 patients who suffered from rebleeding, 2 patients from hepatic failure and 2 patients from hepatocellular carcinoma. There were 12 patients survived during the follow-up.Percutaneous transhepatic coronary vein occlusion under the type B ultrasonography and X-ray guiding is safe and efficient to treat esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotic patients
