Imaging diagnosis of schistosomiasis japonica--the use in Japan and application for field study in the present endemic area. For detecting lesions-related schistosomiasis japonica, X-rays, scintillation scanning, ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) and endoscopic examinations with biopsies have been used in Japan. Liver fibrosis and calcified changes are detected by US and CT. Most of the lesions that are detected by endoscopic examinations are due to deposited ova of Schistosoma japonicum. Portal hypertension is detected by US, CT and gastroscopic examination. Because schistosome infection decreased rapidly in Japan, most of the studies on imaging diagnosis were performed on chronic lesions or sequelae of schistosomiasis. Most of the techniques were used on admitted patients in well-equipped hospitals. US was introduced in the 1970s as a safe, rapid, non-invasive and inexpensive technique and has been used for diagnosis in hospitals and screening in the fields. As a typical US image of the liver, septal formation by high echogenic bands like mosaic was described, and this network pattern was reported in the other endemic countries China and Philippines. As an appropriate technique, US has been broadly used in developing countries. Not only for diagnosis in a hospital, but also for monitoring changes of morbidity, US is used in the community level. Network pattern related to the severity of S. japonicum infection, has not been described in S. mansoni or S. haematobium infection. Appearance of network pattern depends on pathological changes such as periportal fibrosis, postnecrotic fibrosis and calcified ova. For advanced studies on morbidity of schistosomiasis japonica, further research on pathological basis of network pattern and standardization of US diagnosis are necessary.
