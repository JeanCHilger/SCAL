Combined intraarterial 5-fluorouracil and intramuscular interferon-alpha therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. We report the case of a 66-year-old man with hepatic cirrhosis and multiple hypervascular tumors in both lobes of the liver as well as tumor thrombi in the portal vein. After unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed, transcatheter arterial embolization was considered to be difficult, because he had major portal vein thrombosis. Conventional ultrasonically-guided local treatments, such as percutaneous ethanol injection therapy and radiofrequency ablation, were also of no value because the tumors were huge and multiple. Ultimately, he was treated with a combination of intraarterial 5-fluorouracil and intramuscular interferon-alpha. After treatment, the multiple tumors became non-enhancing on contrast computed tomography scans and showed a marked decrease in size. There were no serious adverse effects (such as myelosuppression or hepatotoxicity) during treatment or follow-up and the patient is doing well at present. In conclusion, a combination of intraarterial 5-fluorouracil with intramuscular interferon-alpha appears to be useful for the management of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, especially in patients for whom more aggressive treatment is not acceptable.
