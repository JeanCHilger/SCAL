Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma: report of a case. We report a case of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, which occurred in a 58-year-old man with normal liver function. Preoperative ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging depicted a large tumor in the left lateral segment, which was compatible with the typical radiological features of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. He underwent left lobectomy and no lymphadenopathy or distant metastasis was demonstrated. Macroscopic findings of the resected liver demonstrated a well-defined whitish-yellow tumor with a central scar. Microscopic findings of the tumor showed cords of tumor cells, which were surrounded by abundant collagenous fibrous tissue arranged in a lamellar distribution. He has been doing well for approximately one year since the surgery without any signs of recurrence. In addition, we discuss the clinicopathological features of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma based on a review of 22 Japanese patients who have been previously reported.
