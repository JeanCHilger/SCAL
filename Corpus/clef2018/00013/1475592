Conventional spectral Doppler and color Doppler ultrasound imaging. Principles, limitations, artifacts and clinical indications in hepatology. The physical principles, limitations, errors and indications of conventional Doppler and color encoded Doppler sonography are reviewed and their applications in the investigation of liver, spleen, portal and suprahepatic portal venous circulation are analysed. The actual possibilities and advantages of Doppler imaging, both in normal conditions and in pathologic ones, such as portal hypertension, portal venous thrombosis or cavernous transformation, liver cirrhosis, hepatoma and liver transplantation are discussed.
