Cryptogenetic ascites. Attempts at original pathophysiologic explanation of a monomorphic sonographic image pattern. In 15,645 consecutive ultrasound examinations of the abdomen (1986 to 1988), free fluid in the peritoneal cavity was found in 247 patients by internal trial during 397 sessions (= 2.5%). Most frequent basic diagnosis for the reason of this symptom were tumorous diseases (99 patients corresponding to 40.1%), cirrhosis of the liver (52 patients corresp. to 22.1%) and heart failure (31 patients corresp. to 12.6%, among these complex gayprooft myocardial insufficiency 24, right heart failure 7). Ovarian cysts or cystomas (7), acute/chronic-recurrent pancreatitis (6), Crohn's disease (3), infections (3), rheumatoid disorders (3), nephrotic syndrome (2), and extra-uterine pregnancy (2) were more rarely represented. In 23 patients (corresp. to 9.3%) the cause of an ascites remained obscure. Among these, a high prevalence of the female sex in the premenopausal age was remarkable with a score of 20:3 (statistically significant difference in terms of the other patients of our group). This observation suggests that an ovarian factor plays a role in the development of ascites in the absence of other evident causes. The literature implies that endometriosis is rather prominent, followed by oligosymptomatic infections or inflammatory diseases.
