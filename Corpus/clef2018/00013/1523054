Intrahepatic biliary stones in children. Intrahepatic biliary stones in seven non-Oriental patients were studied in all by sonography, in four patients by computed tomography and in four patients by percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. For patients had extrahepatic biliary atresia treated with portoenterostomies, one patient had undergone partial liver transplantation and of the remaining two, one had cystic fibrosis and the other immunodeficiency syndrome. All sonograms were abnormal and showed echogenic foci within the liver, with or without associated signs of biliary tract dilatation. CT confirmed the biliary tract dilatation yet calculi were identified in one patient only. PTC was particularly helpful in the patient with immunodeficiency in whom features typical of sclerosing cholangitis were found. This report emphasizes the variable radiological appearance of bile stones which to our knowledge have rarely been described in children with entities other than Oriental cholangitis.
