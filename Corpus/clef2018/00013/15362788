Combination treatment of partial splenic embolization, endoscopic embolization and transjugular retrograde obliteration for complicated gastroesophageal varices. The treatment of complicated gastroesophageal varices with a gastrorenal shunt and portal hypertensive gastropathy has not yet been established. We were able to control a case of complicated large gastroesophageal varices with gastrorenal shunt and portal hypertensive gastropathy using a combination treatment of partial splenic embolization, endoscopic embolization and transjugular retrograde obliteration. We first applied partial splenic embolization to reduce the hyperdynamic cycle of portal hypertension and to treat thrombocytopenia. We secondarily applied endoscopic embolization for the esophageal varices. Transjugular retrograde obliteration was performed for the gastric varices 14 days after endoscopic embolization. The wedged hepatic venous pressure had not changed after transjugular retrograde obliteration. After the combination treatment, the gastroesophageal varices were successfully obliterated, but portal hypertensive gastropathy did not worsen. The platelets count, arterial ketone body ratio and ICGR15 were improved. Partial splenic embolization was useful to protect side effects of endoscopic embolization and transjugular retrograde obliteration. We conclude that the combination treatment of partial splenic embolization, endoscopic embolization and transjugular retrograde obliteration is a rational, effective and safe treatment for complicated gastroesophageal varices with gastrorenal shunt and portal hypertensive gastropathy.
