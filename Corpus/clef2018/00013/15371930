The wide spectrum of steatohepatitis: a report of four cases and a review of the literature. We report on four cases displaying the wide range of aetiological risk factors (presence or absence of family history of dyslipidaemia and cryptogenic cirrhosis, from subnormal body mass index through morbid obesity, from absent through hepatotoxic alcohol consumption), laboratory test results (from subnormal through elevated uric acid and ferritin values), ultrasonographic changes (from normal findings through 'bright liver' with or without attenuation of ultrasound beam and absence/presence of focal lesions), and histological severity of steatohepatitis (fibrosis appearing to be inversely related to the amount of liver fat but zone 3 accentuation of lesions and ballooning being observed in all cases). Cases illustrate the concepts of overlapping aetiologies of steatohepatitis (hepatitis C, diabetes and lipodystrophy) the relationships between cryptogenic cirrhosis, familial cirrhosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma
