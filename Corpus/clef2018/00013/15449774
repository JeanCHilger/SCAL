Comparative effectiveness of different methods of diagnosis and correction of impaired portal circulation. The diagnostic effectiveness of X-ray radionuclide and ultrasound determination of portal blood flow and the impact of different treatments on the blood flow were evaluated in 76 patients with hepatic cirrhosis. The treatment regimens were used propranolol (Group 1), isosorbide-5-mononitrate (monosan) (Group 2), and a combined therapy with propranolol in combination with diuretics and a course of intravenous laser irradiation (Group 3). In terms of both clinical and laboratory parameters and the status of portal circulation, the highest effect was observed in the patients receiving the combined therapy.
