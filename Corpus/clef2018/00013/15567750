A modified rat model for hepatocellular carcinoma. Rat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model which has a high analogy to clinical liver cancer is of great value in understanding the pathogenesis and evolution of liver cancer, in searching effective anti-cancer treatments (drug, hepatectomy and liver transplantation), and designing cancer prevention strategies. In this study we established a modified rat model of hepatocellular carcinoma to enhance rats' physique and surgical endurance.Wistar rats were fed with diethylnitrosamine (DENA) by three methods for evaluation of general conditions for 130 days: Doppler ultrasonographic measurement, laparotomy and histopathological examination.No rat died in control group (group A) and modified DENA-induction-HCC group(group C), but 6 deaths in classical DENA-induction-HCC group (group B) (survival rate 80%). All survived rats in groups B and C developed diffusive hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis. General appearance of rats in the group C was better than that in the group B.With good general conditions for surgery, the modified rat model for hepatocellular carcinoma has a high carcinogenic rate and a high survival rate.
