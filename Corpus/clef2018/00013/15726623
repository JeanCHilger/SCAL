Survival and intra-hepatic recurrences after laparoscopic radiofrequency of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with liver cirrhosis. The optimal treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is surgical resection. However, only a small percentage of patients are operative candidates. Percutaneous radiofrequency interstitial thermal ablation proved to be effective, too. Our objective was to assess a novel operative combination of laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) with laparoscopic radiofrequency (LRF) in the treatment of HCC not amenable to liver resection.One hundred and four patients with HCC in liver cirrhosis were submitted to laparoscopic LRF. A LRF was indicated in patients not amenable to liver resection that had at least one of the following criteria: (a) severe impairment of the coagulation tests (b) large tumors (but <5 cm) or multiple lesions requiring repeated puncturesThe LRF procedure was completed in 102 out of 104 patients (98% feasibility rate). LUS identified 26 new malignant lesions (25%) undetected by pre-operative imaging. There was no operative mortality. Seventy-six patients had no complication (73%). At 1-month computed tomography (CT) evaluation, a complete response with a 100% necrosis was achieved in 88 out of 101 patients (87%). During the follow-up (mean follow-up: 22.5 +/- 15.9 months), 55 patients (54%) developed new malignant nodules (42% of these recurrences were localized in the same segment of the HCC treated).LRF of HCC proved to be a safe and effective technique at least in the short and mid-term: in fact it permits to treat lesions not treatable with the per cutaneous approach, to detect 25% of new HCC nodules and it has a low morbidity rate.
