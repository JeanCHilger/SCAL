From gene to disease PKHD1 and recessive polycystic kidney disease. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a severe form of polycystic kidney disease characterised by enlarged kidneys and congenital hepatic fibrosis. The disease has an incidence of 1:7000-:20,000 and is caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene, which under normal conditions produces the protein fibrocystin, also named polyductin. This protein may be a transmembrane receptor or ligand that plays a role in collecting duct and biliary differentiation. The major site of expression is the primary cilium, and in particular the basal body of the cilium, underlining a link between aberrant cilial function and cystogenesis. Prenatal diagnostics is possible using DNA analysis or ultrasonography.
