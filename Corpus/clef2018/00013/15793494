Stent-graft treatment of complete acute aortic transection complicated by intussusception and pseudo-coartaction. Aim of the study was to validate the use of endoluminal stent-graft treatment as an alternative to conventional surgery in patients affected by blunt chest trauma and aortic disruption with multiple associated lesions. We report the case of a young female admitted with diagnosis of descending thoracic aortic transection and multiple traumas following a car accident. Spiral computed tomography revealed circular disruption of thoracic aorta immediately after isthmus region with intussusception of leaflets and pseudo-coartation. Doppler analysis showed a 70 mmHg transaortic gradient. The hemodynamic evaluation confirmed the existence of severe transaortic gradient. A Gore-TAG endoprosthesis (26 x 100 mm) was selected. Intraoper-ative transesophageal echocardiography assessment was performed to monitoring the entire procedure. The final arteriogram showed an optimal sealing at proximal and distal site without endoleak with complete readjustment of intimal leaflets to the aortic wall and disappearance of transaortic gradient related to the pseudo-coartation. No complication was observed in the early postoperative and patient was discharged one month later once complete rehabilitation of associated lesion was obtained. Computed tomography scan performed before discharge revealed persistency of patent lumen of aorta with fibrosis of readjusted circumferential intimal flap. In conclusion endovascular repair of complete aortic transection may result safe and effective particularly in patients with extensive associated injuries. Indeed the severity of coexisting non-aortic lesions could be adversely affected by conventional surgery in consideration of high surgical morbidity due to open thoracotomy. Stent-graft repair allows the patient to timely undergo medical or surgical management of associated lesions and a prompt rehabilitation with shorter hospital stay.
