Circulating markers of oxidative stress and liver fibrosis in Sudanese subjects at risk of schistosomiasis and hepatitis. Epidemiological studies in the developing world are frequently biased by the simultaneous presence of several infectious pathogens. In the present study, we examined the usefulness of circulating markers of oxidative stress and liver fibrosis to investigate the distinct forms of chronic liver inflammations associated with schistosomiasis and viral hepatitis, respectively. The study was performed in a Sudanese population exposed to Schistosoma. Circulating hyaluronic acid (HA) was used as a marker of liver fibrosis the severity of schistosomiasis was determined by ultrasonic examination
