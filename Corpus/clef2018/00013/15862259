Radiofrequency ablation for hypersplenism in patients with liver cirrhosis: a pilot study. Radiofrequency ablation is a relatively new technique used for local ablation of unresectable tumors. We investigated the feasibility and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation for hypersplenism and its effect on liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Nine consecutive patients with hypersplenism due to cirrhotic portal hypertension underwent radiofrequency ablation in enlarged spleens. The ablation was performed either intraoperatively or percutaneously. Patients are followed up for over 12 months. After treatment, between 20% and 43% of spleen volume was ablated, and spleen volume increased by 4%-10.2%. White blood cell count, platelet count, liver function, and hepatic artery blood flow showed significant improvement after 1-year follow-up. Splenic vein and portal vein blood flow were significantly reduced. Only minor complications including hydrothorax (three of nine patients) and mild abdominal pain (four of nine patients) were observed. No mortality or other morbidity occurred. Radiofrequency ablation is a safe, effective, and minimally invasive approach for the management of splenomegaly and hypersplenism in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Increased hepatic artery blood flow may be responsible for sustained improvement of liver condition. Radiofrequency ablation may be used as a bridging therapy for cirrhotic patients waiting for liver transplantation.
