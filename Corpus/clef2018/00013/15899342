Doppler and gray-scale ultrasound evaluation of morphological and hemodynamic changes in liver vascualture in alcoholic patients. The aim of this study is to search sonographically for morphological and hemodynamic changes in hepatic and splanchnic vasculature of alcoholic patients having no signs of hepatic damage, and compare these with normal healthy subjects.Thirty alcohol-dependent patients and 30 control subjects with no alcohol problem or hepatic impairment were included in the study. All patients were evaluated by gray-scale and spectral Doppler ultrasound. The diameter of the portal vein, portal venous velocity, peak systolic and end diastolic velocities of hepatic and superior mesenteric arteries were assessed. RI, PI and systolic/diastolic velocity ratios were also calculated.Portal vein cross-sectional area was greater in alcoholic patients compared to control group (P = 0.0012). Portal vein velocity, hepatic artery peak systolic and end diastolic velocity, superior mesenteric artery peak systolic and end diastolic velocity were significantly greater in alcoholic patients than in control group (P < or = 0.001). No statistically significant difference was detected between other parameters evaluated.In alcohol-dependent patients, some hemodynamic and morphologic changes occur in hepatic and splanchnic circulation, even before the signs of hepatic damage develop. These changes can be detected by means of Doppler and gray-scale sonogrsphy.
