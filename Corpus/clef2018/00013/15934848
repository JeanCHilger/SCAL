Adverse effects associated with SonoVue use. Conventional ultrasonography (US) has limited accuracy in the detection and characterisation of solid focal liver lesions (FLL). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) significantly improves the diagnostic performance of US in the assessment of FLL. Rare reports of serious adverse events have been reported with CEUS. The rates of adverse reactions reported from the use of ultrasound contrast agents seem comparable to, or lower than, those observed for other imaging modalities that use contrast agents such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Improved diagnostic results and diagnostic confidence achieved in conventional CEUS studies of the liver and during the investigational use in the intraoperative CEUS exploration appear to justify the use of this promising modality.
