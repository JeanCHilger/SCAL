Cirrhosis in children with celiac disease. Liver involvement represents an extra-intestinal feature of celiac disease (CD) and shows a clinical spectrum varying from nonspecific reactive hepatitis to cirrhosis. Here we report the association of cirrhosis with CD in 5 children.The mean age of the patients was 9.4 +/- 2.8 years. Viral, metabolic, and autoimmune etiology of liver disease was ruled out. Intestinal and liver biopsies were performed to confirm the histologic diagnosis in all subjects.Three of the patients had chronic diarrhea and hepatosplenomegaly in whom diagnoses of CD and cirrhosis were established at presentation simultaneously. In the other 2 patients, CD was diagnosed following an initial diagnosis of cirrhosis. At diagnosis, alanine aminotransferase (range, 64-271 IU/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (range, 90-225 IU/L) values were elevated. After 1 to 5 years of a gluten-free diet (GFD), normalization of serum aminotransferase levels and clinical improvement were observed in 3 patients with strict GFD. The other 2 patients without improvement of the liver disease had poor dietary compliance.CD may be associated with severe hepatic damage in children and strict GFD may have beneficial effect on the course of liver disease. Serologic screening of CD should be included in differential diagnosis of chronic liver disease of unknown origin.
