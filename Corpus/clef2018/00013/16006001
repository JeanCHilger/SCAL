Genotype C hepatitis B virus infection is associated with a higher risk of reactivation of hepatitis B and progression to cirrhosis than genotype B: a longitudinal study of hepatitis B e antigen-positive patients with normal aminotransferase levels at baseline. Longitudinal studies on the relationship between hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and reactivation of hepatitis B and progression to cirrhosis were very rare.Liver biochemistry, virological markers and ultrasound were monitored in 202 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients with normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at baseline for 3-20 (average 10.8) years, and the outcome was correlated with HBV genotypes.There were 150 genotype B and 52 genotype C patients. Hepatitis activity during the HBeAg-positive phase showed no significant difference. However, genotype B was associated with a significantly earlier and higher rate of HBeAg seroconversion. HBeAg seroconversion correlated with age at entry for genotype B and with ALT levels for genotype C. Reactivation of hepatitis B was significantly more common in genotype C patients. Five genotype B and 10 genotype C patients progressed to cirrhosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that genotype C (P = 0.03) and reactivation of hepatitis B (P = 0.0004) were independent factor predictive of cirrhosis.Rate and factors of HBeAg seroconversion, and rate of reactivation of hepatitis B differed between genotype B and genotype C patients. Genotype C and reactivation of hepatitis B were associated with increased risk of cirrhosis.
