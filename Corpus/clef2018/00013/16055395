Multiple intrahepatic vascular shunts causing hyperammoniaemic encephalopathy in a patient without liver cirrhosis. The very rare case of a non-cirrhotic patient with multiple intrahepatic portosystemic and arteriosystemic vascular shunts, presenting with hyperammoniaemic type B encephalopathy and hypoalbuminaemia due to proteinuria, is reported. The correct diagnosis, suspected by abdominal ultrasound and colour-Doppler imaging, was confirmed by hepatic and superior mesenteric angiography. A comparison with the few similar cases existing in the literature is offered.
