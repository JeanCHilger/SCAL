A study on the relationship between ultrasonographic score and clinical score (MELD, CPT) in cirrhosis. This article aimed to compare ultrasonography score with CTP score and MELD score, as well as, describe the possibility of a noninvasive diagnosis of the degree of hepatic fibrosis using the various imaging techniques and provide suggestions for daily clinical practice.A total of 53 patients (33 male and 20 female) admitted to our Hospital between March 2004 and March 2005, were included in this preliminary study. Twenty-five age-matched healthy persons (17 male, 8 female) served as controls. The ultrasound quantitative scoring system was applied in this test which was established according to the previous researcher. All the patients and control group underwent ultrasonography and CT examination. CTP and MELD score were calculated using standard formula.The ultrasound quantitative scoring system, as well as CTP, and MELD score had a higher relativity to pathological stage. Correlations between ultrasonography score, CTP, and MELD score were assessed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficient was 0.784, and 0.768 respectively.Ultrasound can be recommended as one of the choices for noninvasive diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis for its advantages. Increasing CTP (less than 10) and MELD score correlated with progressive impairment of liver function as evaluated by means of a blood flow-dependent quantitative liver function test.
