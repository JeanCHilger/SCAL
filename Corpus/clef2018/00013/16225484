Ultrasonographic and biochemical parameters in the non-invasive evaluation of liver fibrosis in hepatitis C virus chronic hepatitis. Prior studies suggest that platelet counts of <140 000/microL can discriminate patients with different stages of fibrosis.To determine the added value of abdominal ultrasound analysis of morphological liver features in increasing the diagnostic accuracy of platelet counts for the prediction of liver fibrosis at histology.In a retrospective study, clinical records of 1143 chronic hepatitis C patients at their first presentation, naives to both liver biopsy and anti-viral treatment, were reviewed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios of following indices were evaluated singularly or in combination: platelet counts <140 000/microL nodular liver surface, spleen and portal vein size.All indices had specificity rate of > or =90% in excluding bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis, whereas sensitivity was acceptable (51%) for only platelet counts <140 000/microL. None of the ultrasonographic parameters singularly evaluated and reached an acceptable sensitivity rate. For ruling cirrhosis in or out, specificity rate was > or =82% for all tests, with the highest value reported by portal vein size. Low platelet counts plus nodular liver surface had the best sensitivity.No additional significant predictive value was given by adding ultrasonographic parameters to low platelet counts, whereas only a mild non-significant improvement in sensitivity was obtained combining platelet counts <140 000/microL with the presence of nodular liver surface. The platelet counts <140 000/microL showed the best predictive value for including both significant fibrosis and cirrhosis.
