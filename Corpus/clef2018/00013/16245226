Gamna-Gandy bodies: a sign of portal hypertension. Gamna-Gandy bodies (siderotic nodules) represent organized foci of hemorrhage in the spleen that is caused by portal hypertension. Gamna-Gandy bodies contain hemosiderin, fibrous tissue, and calcium. Magnetic resonance imaging has been approved as the most sensitive imaging modality for the detection of these nodules due to their iron content. Computerized tomography and ultrasonography also help in the detection and characterization of these lesions. We report here a case of portal hypertension due to cryptogenic liver cirrhosis with Gamna-Gandy bodies, and characteristic features of ultrasonography, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance.
