Color Doppler ultrasonography is reliable in assessing the risk of esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis. The aim of the study was to examine the role of Doppler ultrasonography of the portal vein in predicting esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension by comparing the ultrasound data to the endoscopic findings.99 patients with liver cirrhosis and esophageal varices underwent color Doppler ultrasonography and esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The following portal hemodynamic parameters were analyzed: diameter and cross-sectional area, mean blood flow velocity, blood flow volume, perfusion pressure gradient, congestion index, and platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio. Variceal characteristics, the size and the presence of red signs, were determined by endoscopic examination.Patients with variceal red signs had significantly higher values of portal diameter (1.538 +/- 0.246 vs. 1.243 +/- 0.167), cross-sectional area (1.286 +/- 0.448 vs. 0.945 +/- 0.256), blood flow volume (965.520 +/- 432.728 vs. 625.117 +/- 320.999) and congestion index (0.165 +/- 0.068 vs. 0.126 +/- 0.051) than patients without red signs, while the perfusion pressure gradient (0.260 +/- 0.087 vs. 0.447 +/- 0.271) and the platelet-to-spleen ratio (522.424 +/- 222.823 vs. 708.921 +/- 230.769) were lower. The same pattern of differences between the ultrasound parameters was found in patients with large varices comparing ones with red signs to the ones without them (diameter, 1.567 +/- 0.234 vs. 1.258 +/- 0.175 cross-section, 1.313 +/- 0.455 vs. 1.061 +/- 0.264Results suggest that color Doppler ultrasonography is a useful noninvasive method for evaluating the risk of esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis.
