Prevalence and prognosis of intrapulmonary shunts in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. We investigated the prevalence of intrapulmonary shunts in 82 patients with hepatic cirrhosis referred for echocardiography as part of liver transplantation evaluation. Intrapulmonary shunts were present in 49 of 82 patients (60%). Baseline characteristics were similar in patients with and without intrapulmonary shunts. Mean follow up was 41 +/- 15 months in patients with intrapulmonary shunts and 42 +/- 15 months in patients without intrapulmonary shunts (P not significant). At follow up, 8 of 49 patients (16%) with intrapulmonary shunts and 4 of 33 patients (12%) without intrapulmonary shunts had died (P not significant).
