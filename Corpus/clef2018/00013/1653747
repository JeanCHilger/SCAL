Fibrolamellar carcinoma of the liver--a case report. A 36-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of general fatigue. The physical and laboratory findings on admission revealed splenomegaly, pancytopenia, hypocoagulopathy, liver hypofunction with a hepaplastin test of 55% and ICG Rmax of 0.6 mg/kg/min. Diagnostic imaging showed a hypoechoic mass 1.5 in diameter a low density area on the CT scan and a faint tumor stain on the AAG in the posterior inferior area of the liver. On a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma with liver cirrhosis and hypersplenism, partial hepatectomy and splenectomy were performed. The resected hepatic specimen revealed a small liver cancer of 1.9 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm with liver cirrhosis. The specimen consisted of a firm rubbery mass. Macroscopically, the tumor appeared oval and was lobulated with a thin capsule. A fibrous scar was observed in the central area. Microscopically, malignant hepatocytes showed various shapes, ranging from polygonal to spindle form, with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and were surrounded by abundant fibrous stroma. Orcein stain, revealed that these malignant hepatocytes contained many black granules of copper-binding protein. Immunoperoxidase staining for alpha 1-antitrypsin was also positive in the malignant hepatocytes. However, within this lamellar fibrous regions, there were many cords of tumor cells in which nucleoli were absent and abortive biliary differentiation was suggested. Consequently this tumor was diagnosed as an atypical fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. We think that this case is the 3rd case reported in Japan and the 2nd case in a Japanese person.
