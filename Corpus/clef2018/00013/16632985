A case of Salmonella liver abscess. Liver abscess can be caused by bacterial, parasitic, or fungal infection. Amebic abscesses are more common, but pyogenic abscesses account for three quarters of hepatic abscess in developed countries. Most common pathogens of the pyogenic liver abscess are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides, Enterococci, Streptococci, and Staphylococci. However, liver abscess caused by Salmonella species has rarely been reported. We experienced a case of Salmonella liver abscess which improved after antibiotic therapy and percutaneous drainage. The patient was 52 years-old man who had an episode of intermittent fever, chills and epigastric pain for 2 weeks. He was diagnosed as liver cirrhosis eight years ago and diabetes three years ago. Salmonella group D, non-typhi was cultured from blood and pus from the liver respectively at the same time. With percutaneous drainage and susceptible antibiotic therapy, liver abscess decreased in size with improvements in fever and abdominal pain.
