Diagnostic particularities in primitive diffuse form hepatocellular carcinoma associated with portal vein thrombosis. The diagnosis of primitive hepatocellular carcinoma, infiltrative form, arose on liver cirrhosis is often difficult because the imagistic investigations could not relevate the tumoral formation. We are presenting the case of a 56 years patient, diagnosed with viral B liver cirrhosis, in which the clinical symptomatology and laboratory investigations were leading to hepatocellular carcinoma, but the ultrasonography and CT scan could not confirm the malignant transformation. In these conditions we performed ultrasonographically guided biopsy from the liver parenchyma and visualized thrombus in portal vein lumen. Histopathological exam from the thrombus tissue samples confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis.
