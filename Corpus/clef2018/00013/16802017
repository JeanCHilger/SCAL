Ultrasonography contribution to the detection and characterization of hepatic restructuring: is the "virtual biopsy" taken into consideration? Generally, the evolution of diffuse liver diseases is variable but quite long. Even the severe types of chronic hepatitis have a slow progression which implies decades, often over 20-30 years. Cirrhosis is the principal long time complication of chronic hepatopathies. It represents a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Ultrasonography plays an important role among the methods used for detecting diffuse liver diseases, for placing them and identifying supplementary risk factors for carcinogenesis and of hepatocellular carcinoma itself. The two- and especially the three-dimensional exploration allow the characterization of hepatic texture and the identification of certain changes which may suggest hepatic restructuring.
