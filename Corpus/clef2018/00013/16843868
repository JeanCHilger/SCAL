Outcome using hemihepatic vascular occlusion versus the pringle maneuver in resections limited to one hepatic section or less. Consensus is lacking concerning how to manage afferent vessels during hepatectomy, particularly as to the Pringle maneuver vs. selective hemihepatic clamping. Data for 81 hepatocellular carcinoma patients with chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis whose liver resection was limited to one section or less, including intraoperative data and postoperative liver function data, were analyzed retrospectively to compare two strategies. No significant differences of intraoperative data or postoperative clinical course were seen between the two groups, even in patients with chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis whose postoperative deterioration of liver function could be expected to be more than patients with a normal liver. The difference was evident only in serum alanine aminotransferase level on postoperative day 10 (mean +/- SEM, 64.5 +/- 5.1 IU in the Pringle group vs. 51.6 +/- 4.4 IU in the selective clamping group P < 0.05). During liver resection limited to one section or less, even with underlying chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, intermittent use of the Pringle maneuver preserved liver function to the same extent as selective clamping.
