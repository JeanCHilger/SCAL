Successful aortic valve replacement for infective endocarditis in a patient with severe liver cirrhosis. Patients with liver cirrhosis are prone to the development of severe complications associated with high mortality rates after major surgery, especially cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We report the case of a 65-year-old man with acute infective endocarditis and aortic valve perforation, complicated by non-cardiac liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B). After careful preoperative anti-inflammatory and systemic support treatment, we successfully treated infective endocarditis-induced aortic valve perforation by performing aortic valve replacement (AVR).
