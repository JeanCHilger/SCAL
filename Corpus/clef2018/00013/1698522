Diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of single-nodular minute hepatocellular carcinoma. This article presents 14 patients of single-nodular minute hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC less than or equal to 2 cm) with coexisting cirrhosis. Of these nine patients were discovered by alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) mass screening or health check-up and five by follow-up observations of chronic liver disease. All the 14 patients received radical resection with no operative mortality. The 1-5 year survival rates after resection were 100% (14/14), 100% (12/12), 100% (11/11), 100% (9/9), and 100% (7/7), respectively. This study demonstrates that the key point of further improvement in the detection of minute HCC lies in the establishment of diagnosis at a relatively low AFP level (less than 200 ng/ml). Realtime ultrasonography is the diagnostic modality of first choice in screening and monitoring. Surgery is strongly indicated for minute HCC with compensated liver function
