Transient elastography (FibroScan) for non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis. (1) Liver fibrosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The major cause is hepatitis C, which affects 240,000 Canadians. (2) Assessing the degree of liver fibrosis is critical to its management. Liver biopsy, an invasive procedure, is considered to be the diagnostic gold standard. (3) FibroScan is a rapid, non-invasive technology that uses low frequency vibration and ultrasound to assess the stiffness of liver tissue. (4) The diagnostic performance of FibroScan is good for identifying severe fibrosis or cirrhosis, but it is less accurate for milder presentations. (5) FibroScan is a promising technology, but large multi-centre trials comparing a range of emerging non-invasive fibrosis staging technologies are required.
