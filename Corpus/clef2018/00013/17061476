Liver functional test (LFT) and ultrasound (US) usefulness in the diagnostic of non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH). To investigate the Liver Functional Test (LFT) and hepatic ultrasound (US) usefulness in the diagnostic of NASH.NASH is part of NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), this condition can lead to cirrhosis it is associated with others frequents diseases in Mexico such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Unfortunately the diagnosis of NASH is not easy, since it must be confirmed by an hepatic biopsy and this requisite can conditionate a subnormal register. Until now, we don't have programs oriented to detect this diseaseWe compared the results of LFT and hepatic US often patients with NASH and ten healthy volunteers. Both groups where matched the sensibility (S), specificity (Sp) and predictive values (PV) of each test were established. Student t test was used in the statistic analysis.The tests with the most notable difference were aminotransferases (AST, ALT), indirect billirubin (IB) and the US with S of 100% to IB and USLFT and US are useful to detect NASH, the periodic testing of subjects with type 2 diabetes and overweight in risk of NASH is proposed as an effective tool of detection for the cases that require a subsequent study by a gastroenterologist.
