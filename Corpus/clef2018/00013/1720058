Relationship between alpha-fetoprotein serum levels, tumour volume and growth rate of hepatocellular carcinoma in a western population. In order to detect a possible relationship between alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, total tumour volume at the moment of the discovery and the tumour volume doubling time, we studied a population of 138 patients, affected by Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) discovered at abdominal ultrasound (US) examination and confirmed by liver biopsy in all cases. In each patient the serum AFP level was determined within a week before or after the US examination. A small therapy-free subgroup of 23 patients, was also serially observed for a mean period of 4 months, so making possible the evaluation of the tumour volume doubling time and its relationship with the initial value of AFP. In 81 patients (58.7%) the serum AFP resulted less than 20 ngr/ml in 21 (15.2%), between 20 and 200 and in 36 (26.1%) greater than 200ngr/ml. No statistical correlation was found between the tumour volume calculated on the basis of the US image at the moment of the discovery and the AFP level, even though very high levels (greater than 3000) were found only in large tumours. Furthermore the tumour doubling time was not correlated with the initial value of AFP.
