Treatment by danaparoid sodium for portal venous thrombosis. We report a case of hepatitis B type liver cirrhosis with portal venous thrombosis in which danaparoid sodium was very effective. The portal venous thrombosis in this case disappeared 2 weeks commencing after administration of danaparoid sodium. The patient had not adverse effects or complications such as hemorrhage, and the clinical course was good. We consider that danaparoid sodium is an anticoagulant unlikely to cause adverse effects such as hemorrhage, and that it might be effective for treatment of portal venous thrombosis. We intend to examine the indications of treatment with danaparoid sodium, clarify the best administration method, and establishment of maintenance therapy by investigating more cases.
