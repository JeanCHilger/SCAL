Hepatic echography. There are 2 kinds of echographic investigations: those which are only complementary and those which are specific by themselves. To improve this latter category, we would like to emphasize two useful echographic signs. First, the attenuation sign, which indicates the fibrotic nature, therefore practically speaking, the cirrhotic nature of a diffuse echogenic pattern. Secondly, the posterior echo accumulation sign, which indicates the liquid nature, and therefore in general the cystic nature of a localized sonolucent pattern.
