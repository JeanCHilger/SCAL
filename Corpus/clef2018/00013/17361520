Effects of Shehuang Paste on hemodynamics, endotoxin, nitric oxide and endothelin-1 in patients with refractory cirrhotic ascites. To explore the influence of Shehuang Paste (SHP) to the hemodynamics, endotoxin, nitric oxide (NO), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in patients with refractory cirrhotic ascites.Fifty-nine cases of refractory cirrhotic ascites were randomly assigned to two groups, 32 cases in the treatment group and 27 cases in the control group. The basic treatment was the same for both groups, including liver protecting medicines, diuretics and supportive drugs, but SHP navel sticking was applied for the treatment group additionally once a day. A course of one month of treatment was applied and the general efficacy on ascites was observed by the end of the therapeutic course. Before and after the treatment, examinations by limulus lysate chromogenic test was conducted to measure plasma endotoxin content colorimetry to measure plasma content of NO indirectly, radioimmunoassay to measure plasma ET-1 contentThe total effective rate on ascites was 84.4% in the treatment group, and 48. 1% in the control group, with significant difference shown between them (P<0.01). In the treatment group the blood flow of portal vein and splenic vein, contents of endotoxin, NO and ET-1 all got significantly reduced after treatment ( P<0.05 or P<0.01) while these indexes in the control group were not significantly changed ( P 0.05). Moreover, it was found that in the treatment group, the blood flow of portal vein and splenic vein had a positive correlation to the levels of NO, ET-1, and endotoxin, either before or after treatment.Application of SHP navel sticking could clearly reduce the blood flow of portal vein and splenic vein, and lower the content of endotoxin, NO and ET-1. The blood flow of portal vein and splenic vein in the treatment group showed a positive correlation with the contents of endotoxin, NO and ET-1. liver cirrhosis, refractory ascites, vasoactive substance, hemodynamics
