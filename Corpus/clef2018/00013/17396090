Stomal varices treated by glue embolization. In patients with cirrhosis and enterostomy, although bleeding stomal varices are rare, they can been severe and difficult to be treat. We report the first two cases of bleeding stomal varices treated by cyanoacrylate embolization, in patients with cirrhosis and colostomy. In each case, after pharmacological treatment of portal hypertension (propranolol) failed, embolization of the stomal varices by transdermal injection of biological glue effectively stopped the bleeding, without recurrence or side effects, after 8 and 16 months of follow-up. The embolization of stomal varices by biological glue is a safe, easy and efficient treatment for bleeding stomal varices.
