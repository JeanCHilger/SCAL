The effect of a silybin-vitamin e-phospholipid complex on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a pilot study. Oxidative stress leads to chronic liver damage. Silybin has been conjugated with vitamin E and phospholipids to improve its antioxidant activity. Eighty-five patients were divided into 2 groups: those affected by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (group A) and those with HCV-related chronic hepatitis associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (group B), nonresponders to treatment. The treatment consisted of silybin/vitamin E/phospholipids. After treatment, group A showed a significant reduction in ultrasonographic scores for liver steatosis. Liver enzyme levels, hyperinsulinemia, and indexes of liver fibrosis showed an improvement in treated individuals. A significant correlation among indexes of fibrosis, body mass index, insulinemia, plasma levels of transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, degree of steatosis, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was observed. Our data suggest that silybin conjugated with vitamin E and phospholipids could be used as a complementary approach to the treatment of patients with chronic liver damage.
