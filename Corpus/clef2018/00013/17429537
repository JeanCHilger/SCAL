A clinical study on combined serum hepatic fibrosis-related markers and ultrasound parameters to diagnose hepatic fibrosis. This study attempted to explore the value of combining serum hepatic fibrosis-related markers and ultrasound parameters together on diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis.Six serum markers and 8 ultrasound parameters were measured from 100 patients with chronic hepatitis B or cirrhosis. The results of the serum hepatic fibrosis-related markers and ultrasound in disease group were analyzed and compared with the findings of hepatic pathology.By filtrating,the group of platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) plus hyaluronic acid (HA) plus echo characteristics of liver parenchyma (LPEC) plus length of spleen (SL) had the highest Se and Spe, which were 90.7% and 85.4% respectively.The advantageous combination of serum markers and ultrasound parameters can significantly improve Se and Spe, which is superior to any single serum index or ultrasound parameter. And it was a better non-invasive method for diagnosing hepatic fibrosis.
