Evaluation of endosonography in sclerotherapy of esophageal varices. During intravariceal sclerotherapy of esophageal varices with polidocanol in 32 patients with portal hypertension due to liver cirrhosis of various etiologies, endosonographic assessment of both esophageal and gastric intramural vessels was carried out in order to evaluate the usefulness of endosonography in the follow-up of the variceal status. In all cases endosonography demonstrated esophageal and gastric varices in contrast, only five cases of gastric varices could be demonstrated by endoscopy. Furthermore, different stages of variceal obliteration following sclerotherapy could be demonstrated by means of endosonography, and it was possible to identify incomplete obliteration in about one-third of the patients in whom inadequate sclerotherapy was suspected endoscopically. In addition, the status of gastric varices during sclerotherapy was demonstrated by means of endosonography. Only in cases of adequate sclerotherapy of esophageal varices, as assessed by both endoscopic and endosonographic criteria, were gastric varices plugged. On the basis of these findings endosonography would appear to be a useful technique for the diagnosis and follow-up of esophageal and gastric varices during intravariceal sclerotherapy.
