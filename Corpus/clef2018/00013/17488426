Right atrial metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma. A 65-year-old patient with a past medical history of hypertension, alcoholism, micronodular cirrhosis, and coronary artery bypass grafting 10 years ago developed a hepatocellular carcinoma, treated by chemoembolization. One month after treatment, thoracoabdominal CT scan showed no residual hepatic tumor, but tumoral aspect in the right atrium with extension into the inferior vena cava. The patient being asymptomatic, cardiac ultrasound confirmed the presence of a free, mobile, pediculated tumor in the right atrium. Surgical exploration found a well-circumscribed mass, attached to the atrial wall by a 1.5-cm diameter pedicle implanted near the inferior vena cava ostium, moving freely in the right atrial cavity. The tumor was easily resected by section of the pedicle and its surrounding parietal implantation zone. No complications occurred postoperatively, and the patient was discharged on the 10th postoperative day. Three years after, the patient is in good health and is asymptomatic cardiac ultrasound showed no tumor recurrence.
