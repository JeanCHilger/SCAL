Budd-Chiari syndrome: etiology, pathogenesis and diagnosis. Budd-Chiari syndrome is a congestive hepatopathy caused by blockage of hepatic veins. This syndrome occurs in 1/100000 in the general population. Hypercoagulable state could be identified in 75% of the patients more than one etiologic factor may play a role in 25% of the patients. Primary myeloproliferative diseases are the leading cause of the disease. Two of the hepatic veins must be blocked for clinically evident disease. Liver congestion and hypoxic damage of hepatocytes eventually result in predominantly centrilobular fibrosis. Doppler ultrasonography of the liver should be the initial diagnostic procedure. Hepatic venography is the reference procedure if required. Additionally liver biopsy may be helpful for differential diagnosis. The prognosis of the chronic form is acceptable compared to other chronic liver diseases.
