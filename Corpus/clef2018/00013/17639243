Assessment of the age-specific disability weight of chronic schistosomiasis japonica. To estimate the age-specific disability weight of chronic schistosomiasis japonica in China.Between October 2004 and January 2005, residents from two schistosome-endemic counties were screened for Schistosoma japonicum infection using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Disability and morbidity were assessed in seropositive individuals using the European quality of life questionnaire with an additional cognitive dimension (known as the "EQ-5D plus") and ultrasonography. The age-specific disability weight of chronic schistosomiasis was estimated based on participants self-rated health scores on the visual analogue scale of the questionnaire the relationships between health status, morbidity and disability weight were explored using multilevel regression models.Of 2843 seropositive individuals, 1419 (49.9%) were classified as having chronic schistosomiasis. Hepatomegaly was found in 76.3% (1082/1419) hepatic fibrosis was found in 73.3% (1040/1419)The disability weight attributable to chronic schistosomiasis japonica is high and increases with age. Our findings call for a reappraisal of the disability weights due to chronic schistosomiasis mansoni and schistosomiasis haematobia as well as a re-estimation of the global burden of schistosomiasis.
