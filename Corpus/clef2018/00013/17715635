Hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension: what's new? Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is found in 4-47% of patients with cirrhosis and is characterized by intrapulmonary vascular dilatations especially in the basal parts of the lung. Liver injury and/or portal hypertension trigger the release of endothelin-l, TNF-alpha, cytokines and mediate vascular shear stress and release of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, all contributing to intrapulmonary vasodilation. Severe HPS increases mortality (30%) after liver transplantation, especially if Pa O2 is below 50 mmHg. The diagnosis is made by calculating the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and by performing a contrast echocardiography. Medical therapy fails and the only long-term treatment available is liver transplantation. More than 85% experience significant improvement or complete resolution in hypoxaemia, but this may take more than 1 year. Portopulmonary hypertension (PPHT) occurs in 2-8% of the patients with cirrhosis. Imbalance between vasodilating (decreased pulmonary expression of eNOS and prostacyclin I2) and vasoconstrictive agents (increased expression of ET-1 and angiotensin 1) may be responsible for misguided angiogenesis and pulmonary hypertension. The diagnosis is made by performing an echocardiography and a right heart catheterisation when systolic pulmonary artery pressure is higher than 30 mmHg on echocardiography. Although prostacyclin analogues are efficacious, adverse effects in terms of safety, tolerability and drug delivery occur. Bosentan is probably the therapy of choice for patients with PPHT because it decreases pulmonary but can also diminish portal hypertension. Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor is used for idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, however, it should be used cautiously in patients with portal hypertension as it may increase portal hypertension by splanchnic vasodilation.
