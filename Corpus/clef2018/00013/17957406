Acute liver failure after a late TIPSS revision. We report a rare case of late transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) occlusion due to progressive stent protrusion into the periportal liver parenchyma, which was a result of delayed liver shrinkage 2 years after TIPSS. The initial TIPSS procedure had been carried out in a 52-year-old man as a bridge for liver transplantation because of post-alcoholic liver cirrhosis. We describe the applied TIPSS recanalization and revision technique. Immediately after TIPSS revision acute liver failure developed, which required emergency liver transplantation.
