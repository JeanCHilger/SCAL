Pulmonary complications of hepatic cirrhosis: portopulmonary hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome. The paradox of pulmonary vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Cardiopulmonar complications in chronic liver diseases were described 100 years ago. Altough both hepatopulmonary sindrome and portopulmonary hypertension originates from liver damage, clinical findings and diagnosis are very different.

These complications,under the cornerstone of portal hypertension are characterized by pulmonary constriction and dilatation, respectively.
