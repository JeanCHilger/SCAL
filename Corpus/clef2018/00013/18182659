High viral load and hepatitis B virus subgenotype ce are associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to investigate the impact of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and HBV genotypes/subgenotypes on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).A prospective cohort of patients infected with chronic HBV in a surveillance program for HCC since 1997 was studied. Ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein evaluation were regularly performed to detect HCC. Risk factors for HCC and the relationship between HBV DNA and HBV genotypes were determined.Among 1,006 patients with a median follow-up of 7.7 years, 86 patients (8.5%) developed HCC. With reference to the low HBV DNA stratum (log HBV DNA </= 4.5 copies/mL), the hazard ratio for HCC of the intermediate HBV DNA stratum (log HBV DNA > 4.5 to 6.5 copies/mL) was 1.62 (95% CI, 1.05 to 2.48 P = .027) and that of the high HBV DNA stratum (log HBV DNA > 6.5 copies/mL) was 2.73 (95% CI, 1.76 to 4.25High HBV DNA level and HBV genotype C, particularly subgenotype Ce, increased the risk of HCC in chronic hepatitis B.
