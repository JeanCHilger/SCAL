Assessment of graft fibrosis by transient elastography in patients with recurrent hepatitis C after living donor liver transplantation. Transient elastography (FibroScan) is a simple and noninvasive method to assess liver fibrosis by measuring liver stiffness and therefore can be a promising tool to evaluate liver fibrosis and avoid liver biopsy. We prospectively assessed the performance of transient elastography in patients with recurrent hepatitis C virus after living donor liver transplantation, in comparison with the surrogate serum markers.Fifty-six patients with recurrent hepatitis C virus after living donor liver transplantation, who underwent both liver biopsy and transient elastography were included in this study. The grade of liver fibrosis (the Scheuer classification) obtained by biopsy was compared to liver stiffness measured by the transient elastography.The fibrosis grades were as follows: F0, n=22 F1, n=13These data suggest that transient elastography is a simple, noninvasive and reliable tool to assess liver fibrosis in patients with recurrent hepatitis C virus after living donor liver transplantation.
