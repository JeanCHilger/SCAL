Liver biopsy at the intersection of clinical and pathological diagnosis. Liver biopsy plays an important role in the diagnosis of liver diseases. Nowadays, biochemical, immunological, functional and molecular tests allow the etiology of many liver diseases to be clarified. The liver biopsy contributes essential information about the stage and grade of inflammatory liver diseases on the basis of consensus criteria. These data influence treatment and help to assess the prognosis. In addition, the different patterns of fibrosis allow conclusions about the cause and progress of the underlying liver disease. Hepatitis C, autoimmune hepatitis, unexplained severe course of hepatitis B, differentiation of simple steatosis from steatohepatitis, the differential diagnosis of cholestatic diseases, unclear hepatopathy, transplant pathology and last but not least, hepatic masses are the focal points of liver biopsy diagnoses. Increased risk of hemorrhage due to coagulation defects can be minimized by a transjugular biopsy. Liver masses can be effectively located and identified by radiologically or ultrasound-guided biopsy. Regular periodic conferences between clinicians and pathologists help to clarify individual problematic cases and will promote the diagnostic competence of both partners in hepatology.
