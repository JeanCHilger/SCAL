Non-invasive prediction of the degree of liver fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C using an ultrasound contrast agent. A pilot study. It has been shown that the severity of hepatic fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C can be predicted non-invasively by measuring intrahepatic circulatory time (IHCT) using a microbubble agent with spectral Doppler analysis. The aim of this study was to assess whether this technique is reproducible using a third-generation microbubble agent and contrast harmonic imaging, which are becoming the standard ultrasound techniques in all radiology departments. Twenty-three untreated patients with hepatitis C, who had undergone a recent liver biopsy, were studied prospectively. Based on their histological fibrosis score, patients were divided into four groups (fibrosis levels 1-4). Contrast harmonic imaging was carried out after an intravenous bolus of a microbubble agent (Optison Amersham Health, Milwaukee, WI, USA). IHCT was calculated by measuring the difference between the hepatic vein and hepatic artery microbubble arrival times. The IHCT was compared with the degree of fibrosis. Significant differences were shown between the groups for IHCT. There were significant differences between fibrosis levels 1 and 3 and between fibrosis levels 1 and 4. This study has shown that calculation of IHCT using a third-generation microbubble agent and contrast harmonic imaging can differentiate mild fibrosis from more severe degrees of fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C.
