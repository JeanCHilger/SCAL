Transient elastography accurately predicts presence of significant portal hypertension in patients with chronic liver disease. Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is a prognostic marker in patients with cirrhosis. Transient elastography measures liver stiffness (LS).To assess the correlation between LS and HVPG and to investigate the performance of transient elastography for the diagnosis of significant portal hypertension (PHT).Liver stiffness was measured by Fibroscan in 150 consecutive patients who underwent a liver biopsy with haemodynamic measurements. Usual clinical and biological data were collected. Significant PHT was defined as a HVPG > or = 10 mmHg.Hepatic venous pressure gradient was found to be > or = 10 mmHg in 76 patients. Cirrhosis was diagnosed in 89 patients. HVPG was found to be correlated with: LS (rho = 0.858 P < 0.001) and inversely correlated with prothrombin index (rho = -0.718Liver stiffness measurement is correlated with HVPG and transient elastography identifies patients with significant PHT.
