The stage of portal blood flow in patients with hemoblastosis combined with chronic hepatitis. 109 patients with hemoblastosis (HB) were examined. Average age was 31.8 +/- 1.4 years in group of lymphogranulomatosis patients, and 44 +/- 5.3 years in group of acute leukemia patients. Group of 46 patients with clinical laboratory signs of hepatic lesion was marked out. Since features of portal blood flow (PBF) revealed at dopplerography did not depend on hepatitis aetiology, all patients with chronic hepatitis were analyzed in one group. These patients were examined clinicobiochemically: functional hepatic tests, markers of viral hepatitis B and C, ultrasonic abdominal scanning, PBF dopplerography, puncture biopsy of hepar. All patients had PBF disturbances such as decrease of portal vein blood flow, increase of venous drainage of hepar and spleen. The degree of disturbances intensity increased depending on degree of chronic hepatitis activity (the index of histological activity) and hepatic fibrosis stage. Thus, presence of chronic hepatitis in HB patients regardless of aetiology, is the factor aggravating patients' stage and corrupting PBF. PBF disturbances (decrease of arterial and venous inflow and increase of venous outflow) and development of fibrous changes apparently related with compression of vessels by connective tissue around central veins, inside of lobules and among of hepatic cells. Consequence of it is including anastomosises in blood flow which leads to redistribution of PBF and portal hypertension forming.
