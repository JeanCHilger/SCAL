Hypercalcemia of primary hyperparathyroidism was treated by cinacalcet in a patient with liver cirrhosis. Cinacalcet is a type II calcimimetic agent which is an allosteric modulator of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) located on the surface of the parathyroid cells. Cinacalcet increases the sensitivity of CaR via binding to the transmembrane region of CaR. Increasing sensitivity of CaR causes reduced secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and suppression of serum calcium levels. Cinacalcet has recently been approved by Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism on maintenance dialysis and hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid cancer. It is used also in Europe for both indications. Several controlled studies have shown that cinacalcet is effective in normalizing serum calcium levels also in primary hyperparathyroidism. Cinacalcet is metabolized primarily in the liver by N-dealkylation leading to carboxylic acid and oxidation of naphthalene ring to form dihydrodiols. The safety and optimal dosage of the drug in hypercalcemic patients with liver impairment remains unclear. We present a patient with Child-Pugh B class primary biliary cirrhosis who presented with moderate hypercalcemia and was diagnosed as primary hyperparathyroidism. As she refused having parathyroid surgery for her parathyroid adenoma at first, her hypercalcemia was treated successfully with 30 mg/day cinacalcet for 6 months. Cinacalcet was discontinued after 6 months. Her calcium level increased gradually. As she accepted surgery this time, her parathyroid adenoma was removed by minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Parathyroid adenoma was confirmed pathologically. Her calcium levels maintained within the normal ranges after surgery.
