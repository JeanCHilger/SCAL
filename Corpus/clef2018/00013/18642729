Autologous bone marrow cells in the treatment of cirrhosis of the liver. The data characterizing tolerance and efficiency of autologous bone marrow cells in the treatment of patients with cirrhosis of the liver are presented. Injection of autologous bone marrow cells was not associated with the development of adverse reactions. Cell therapy of patients with compensated cirrhosis arrested asthenic syndrome, reduced cytolysis, increased the level of serum albumin and platelet count. Ultrasonic examination revealed reduction of portal hypertension (the area of the spleen and the portal vein lumen decreased). In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, a positive response presenting as reduction of the disease severity (by 1.9 points) was observed in 48.6% cases. Positive shifts in these patients were associated with a decrease of ALT and AST levels, reduction of laboratory signs of cirrhosis, increase in platelet count, and reduction of the asthenic syndrome. Hence, therapy with autologous bone marrow cells is safe and, according to preliminary results, can be regarded as a new approach to the treatment of patients with cirrhosis of the liver.
