Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its association with obesity, insulin resistance and increased serum levels of C-reactive protein in Hispanics. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a metabolic disorder of the liver, which may progress to fibrosis or cirrhosis. Recent studies have shown a significant impact of ethnicity on susceptibility to steatosis-related liver disease.To estimate the prevalence of NAFLD among Chilean Hispanics as well as the clinical and biochemical variables associated with the disease.Population-based study among Chilean Hispanics. The diagnosis of NAFLD was made on the basis of ultrasound evidence of fatty liver and absence of significant alcohol consumption and hepatitis C virus infection.A total of 832 Hispanic subjects were included. Ultrasound findings revealed diffuse fatty liver in 23% of the subjects. Variables associated with fatty liver in multivariate analysis were body mass index >26.9 [odds ratio (OR) 6.2 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-11.5], abnormal aspartate aminotransferase levels (OR 14Chilean Hispanics exhibit a high prevalence of NAFLD. Obesity, insulin resistance, abnormal aminotransferase levels and elevated hs-CRP were independently associated with the presence of NAFLD. ALT elevation underestimates the presence of ultrasonographical fatty liver, whereas hs-CRP is a sensitive independent marker of NAFLD, which may be useful for detecting fatty liver in the general population.
