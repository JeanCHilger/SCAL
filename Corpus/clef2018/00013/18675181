Hepatitis C, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The screening for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma is based on ultrasound sonography which should be realised in patients with post-hepatitis C cirrhosis with a delay between 3 and 6 months according to the most identified risk factors, in particular age and sex male. In the case of discovery of hypoechogen nodule < or = 1cm, a follow-up is mandatory because it is usually untypical by ultrasound sonography and to propose a liver biopsy in the case of an increasing in size is shown. The ultrasound guided cutting biopsy can precise the histological characteristics of the nodule, the grade, and indicate prognostic factors. The liver biopsy is also mandatory in the case of a nodule > 2 cm and when the ultrasound sonography is not contributive, especially when the nodule is between 1 and 2 cm in size.
