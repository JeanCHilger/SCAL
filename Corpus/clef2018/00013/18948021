Percutaneous peritoneovenous shunt for treatment of refractory ascites. To evaluate the usefulness of a percutaneously placed peritoneovenous shunt (PVS) in patients with refractory ascites.Under fluoroscopic and ultrasonographic (US) guidance, the authors placed a PVS in 55 patients (39 men and 16 women mean age, 56 years) with refractory ascites and symptomatic abdominal distention. The cause of ascites was liver cirrhosis (n = 36), carcinomatosis (n = 17), ruptured cysts with polycystic kidney disease (n = 1), and idiopathic refractory ascites (n = 1). The authors retrospectively evaluated technical feasibility, shunt patency, complications, and clinical outcomes of each patient.The technical success rate was 100%, and symptomatic improvement was achieved in all but one patient. Complications occurred in 17 of the 55 patients (31%): five patients had variceal bleeding three patients had ascites leakageThe percutaneous placement of a PVS was a technically feasible and effective method for symptomatic relief of refractory ascites.
