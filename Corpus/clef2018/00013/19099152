An ultrasound and histomorphological analysis of experimental liver cirrhosis in rats. We investigated whether liver injury by dual exposure to ethanol and carbon tetrachloride (EtOH + CCl4) for 15 weeks would persist after hepatotoxic agents were removed (EtOH + CCl4/8wR). After 15 weeks of hepatic injury with ethanol (5.5%, m/v) and carbon tetrachloride (0.05, mL/kg, ip), 5 of 11 female Wistar rats were sacrificed. The other 6 rats were maintained for an additional 8 weeks without hepatotoxic agents. Ultrasonography showed increased liver echogenicity and dilation of portal vein caliber in both groups (EtOH + CCl4: 0.22 +/- 0.01 cm, P < 0.001 EtOH + CCl4/8wR: 0.21 +/- 0.02 cm, P < 0.01) vs control (0.16 +/- 0.02 cm). Histopathology showed regenerative nodules in both experimental groups. Histomorphometry revealed increased fibrosis content in both groups (EtOH + CCl4: 12.6 +/- 2.64%, P < 0.001
