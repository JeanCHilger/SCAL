Pattern of hepatic pathology diagnosed with echography in Yaounde (Cameroon). The purpose of our study was to assess the pattern of liver diseases diagnosed by ultrasonography (US) in Yaounde (Cameroon). From a total of 1,007 consecutive US studies performed over a period of 14 months in subjects over the age of 15 years, we found 322 patients with a sonographic diagnosis of liver disease. 8 diagnoses comprised 83% of the patients. Apart from non specific homogeneous hepatomegaly these diagnoses consisted of: cirrhosis, primary liver malignancies, liver abscess, congestive hepatomegaly, secondary liver malignancies, diffuse steatosis and nodular calcifications. 30 liver abscess drainages were performed with sonographic guidance. We conclude that in our environment where Computed Tomography is scarce and expensive, US is a useful tool in the study of some of the most frequent liver diseases.
