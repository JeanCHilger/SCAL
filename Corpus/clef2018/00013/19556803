Evaluation of the hemodynamic status of focal hepatic lesions 20 mm or less in diameter by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography using Sonazoid. To clarify the validity of the evaluation of the hemodynamics of hepatic lesions < or =20 mm in diameter using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CE-US) with Sonazoid.Sixty-two hepatic lesions in 55 patients with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus were studied. We evaluated by quantitative analysis the time intensity curve (TIC) on hepatic lesion and parenchyma in the early vascular phase and Kupffer imaging in the post-vascular phase.TIC patterns were classified into those with a maximum slope (Max slope) steeper in the hepatic lesion than in the parenchyma (Pattern I), those with a Max slope similar in the hepatic lesion and parenchyma (Pattern II), and those with a Max slope gentler in the hepatic lesion than in the parenchyma (Pattern III). The blood flow was considered to be higher, the blood flow velocity to be faster, and the contrast agent to reach the lesion more rapidly in Pattern I lesions than in the hepatic parenchyma. Pattern III lesions showed that the velocity of arterial blood influx was slow.Our study suggested the possibility that the TIC allows a detailed evaluation of the hemodynamics of hepatic lesions.
