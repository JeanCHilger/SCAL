Retrospective analysis of Mr. Xie Xiliang's medical records accumulated in 30 years on direct moxibustion for treating hepatitis B. To analyze retrospectively Mr. Xie Xiliang's medical records accumulated in 30 years on direct moxibustion for treating hepatitis B, in which 86 cases were included. Before accepting direct moxibustion, 80.23% of the cases had been treated by conventional Chinese and western medicine, but no satisfactory therapeutic effects were obtained. Direct moxibustion was applied for 7-9 cones at each point selected. Point selection was related to ages. Usually, only a few points were used, and Ganshu (BL 18) and Pishu (BL 20) were used as main points. Shenzhu (GV 12) was added for children, and Zusanli (ST 36) added for adults. The improvement rate in clinical symptoms and physical signs were 100%. In the cases with hepatauxe, splenauxe, liver cirrhosis, and abdominal dropsy diagnozed by the B-ultrasonic examination, the improvement was obvious. Of the total, the rates turning to be negative in HBsAg, HBeAg and HBcAb were 28.85%, 38.46%, and 36.54%, respectively. It took some 10 days to 1 month to begin to show improvement in physical signs and hepetic functions, and about 3-6 months for their restoration. For the five items tested in type B hepatitis, it took 5 months to 1 year, even several years, to show their improvement. It is indicated that direct moxibustion is definitely effective in treating type B hepatitis. It is easy to handle and worth popularizing.
