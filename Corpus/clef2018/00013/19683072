Hepatitis B virus genotype C is associated with more severe liver fibrosis than genotype B. Histologic analyses of liver fibrosis have been limited by small sample sizes and the predominance of samples from patients with active hepatitis.We performed a prospective study of transient elastography in treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B, to investigate the relationship between hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype and liver fibrosis. A validated liver stiffness measurement algorithm was used to define insignificant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis.Of 1106 patients, 711 (64%) were older than age 40, 370 (34%) had positive test results for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and 386 (35%) had increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase. Of the patients, 524 (49%) had genotype B and 582 (51%) had genotype C HBV infection. Patients with genotype C infection had insignificant fibrosis less often (42% vs 55% P < .0001) and advanced fibrosis more often (25% vs 19%Genotype C HBV was associated with more severe liver fibrosis than genotype B HBV, probably because of delayed HBeAg seroconversion and prolonged active disease.
