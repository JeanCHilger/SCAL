Interobserver concordance in the assessment of liver fibrosis in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients using transient elastometry. Although the reproducibility of transient elastometry (TE) in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-monoinfected patients seems to be high, this may not be the case in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients because of different degrees of steatosis and/or inflammation. This study was aimed to determine the interobserver concordance of TE measurements in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients.A total of 188 patients were evaluated in a cross-sectional, prospective study in two hospitals. The interobserver variability of TE results and the rate of unequal classification of significant fibrosis (cutoff value = 7.2 kPa) and cirrhosis (cutoff value = 14.6 kPa) for two observers were evaluated.The values of liver stiffness (LS) for two observers highly correlated [intraclass correlation index = 0.976 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.968-0.982]. The kappa indexes for the concordance of patient classification were 0.60 for significant fibrosis and 0.89 for cirrhosis. Using two cutoff points to diagnose or rule out significant fibrosis (LS >or=9 kPa or <6 kPa) yielded a kappa index of 0.96, but 46% of patients were not classified. Covariables that influenced the interobserver agreement were a high interquartile range in the determination (adjusted odd ratio: 0.189TE measurement is an observer-independent method to evaluate LS in HIV/HCV coinfected patients. The concordance of the classification of mild-to-severe fibrosis is good and for the diagnosis of cirrhosis is excellent. Lower interquartile ranges and triglyceride levels lead to a higher interobserver agreement.
