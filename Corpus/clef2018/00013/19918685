Serum globulin levels and intensity of hepatic fibrosis in patients with mansonic schistosomiasis. A correlation between the levels of serum globulins and the hepatic fibrosis degree in chronic hepatitis was described, but reports in schistosomiasis mansoni have not been found.To evaluate the serum globulins and IgG levels, and periportal fibrosis intensity measured by ultrasound in patients with schistosomiasis mansoni.Between November, 2006 and February 2007, 41 patients which were eligible, filled them a questionnaire and had their levels of serum IgG measured by immunoturbidimetry and globulins indirectly measured by the Biuret method. The ultrasound was carried out by a single researcher, according to the Cairo and Niamey protocols.The average age was 41 years old and 25 female patients (61%). Ten patients (24%) from 41 showed serum globulins levels raised and 21 (51%) presented elevated IgG levels. According to the Cairo classification, 21 patients showed grade I of fibrosis, 18 grade II and 2 grade III and by the Niamey classification 8 showed standard C, 20 D, and 13 E. Those with grade II or III of fibrosis had higher IgG levels than the ones with grade I (P = 0.047), as well as those who showed standards D and E as compared to C (P = 0.011). There was no association between the globulins levels and the intensity of fibrosis.In patients with schistosomiasis mansoni, an increase of the IgG serum levels was observed according to the progression from periportal fibrosis intensity, but the same was not founded with globulins levels.
