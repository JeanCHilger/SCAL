Noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis. Serum markers and transient elastography (FibroScan). Both the prognosis and potential treatment of chronic liver disease greatly depend on the progression of liver fibrosis, which is the ultimate outcome of chronic liver damage. Historically, liver biopsy has been instrumental in adequately assessing patients with chronic liver disease. Histological assessment allows clinicians both to obtain diagnostic information and initiate adequate therapy. However, the technique is not exempt of deleterious effects. Multiple diagnostic tests have been developed for the staging of fibrosis using noninvasive methods, most of them in the setting of chronic hepatitis C. The goal of this paper is to review available data on the staging and assessment of liver fibrosis with two methods: serum markers and transient elastography (FibroScan).
