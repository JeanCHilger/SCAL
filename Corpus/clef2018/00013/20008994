Diagnosis of cirrhotic portal hypertension and compensatory circulation using transsplenic portal scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-phytate. Our objective was to investigate the diagnostic value and clinical significance of transsplenic portal scintigraphy in cirrhotic portal hypertension and compensatory circulation.Transsplenic portal scintigraphy, ultrasound, and gastroscopy were performed on 50 patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension and on 10 controls. According to the Child-Pugh classification, 15 patients with cirrhosis were Child A, 19 were Child B, and 16 were Child C.In the control group, the splenoportal vein was shaped like the letter S, and the portosystemic shunt index was 0.19 +/- 0.07. Portal hypertension portosystemic shunts were of 3 types: intrahepatic (13 patients index, 0.52 +/- 0.19), compensatory (31 patientsTranssplenic portal scintigraphy was sensitive for detecting the number and location of shunts and will allow for improved surgical planning.
