Portal vein thrombosis treated using danaparoid sodium and antithrombin III. A 45-year-old man under treatment for liver cirrhosis (LC) due to chronic hepatitis C and hemophilia A was seen in our emergency room because of a 10-kg weight gain in the previous week due to ascites. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) was detected with computer tomography (CT) and ultrasonographic (US). Danaparoid sodium (DS) and antithrombin III (AT III) were administrated and doppler US images showed improvement of portal venous blood flow. DS or AT III may be safe and alternative therapies for PVT.
