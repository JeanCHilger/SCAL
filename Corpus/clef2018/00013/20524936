Significance of serum adiponectin levels in patients with chronic liver disease. Adiponectin, which plays a pivotal role in metabolic liver diseases, is reduced in concentration in patients with NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). The aim of the present study was to determine adiponectin concentrations in patients with different forms and stages of chronic liver diseases. Serum adiponectin concentrations were measured in 232 fasting patients with chronic liver disease: 64 with NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), 123 with other chronic liver disease (e.g. viral hepatitis, n=71 autoimmune disease, n=18
