Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in asymptomatic obese women. To determine the clinical characteristics of NAFLD in asymptomatic obese women.A total of 457 asymptomatic obese women were enrolled in a cross-sectional study and allocated into groups with and without NAFLD. Irrespective of ALT levels, diagnosis of NAFLD was established by ultrasonographic findings irrespective of fibrosis, NASH was defined by hepatic histological changes.One hundred ninety five (42.7%) women had elevated ALT levels. Diagnosis of NAFLD was established in 228 (49.9%) women among women with NAFLD, 34 (14.9%) have ALT levels within the normal range. On the other hand, based on the healthy range for ALT levels (19 UI/L), 336 (73.5%) women had elevated ALT, but only 2 (0.9%) women with NAFLD exhibited ALT levels within normal healthy values. Furthermore, 93 (41%) women who had AST/ALT levels (3) 1 underwent liver biopsyResults of this study support the statement that women with NAFLD have an adverse metabolic profile. Furthermore, our results show that hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia and markers of liver injury such as AST/ALT > or = 1 may be useful for early recognition of NAFLD.
