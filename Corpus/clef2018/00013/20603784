What did we learn from the first 3,459 cases of liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography (FibroScan®)? Chronic viral hepatopathies can be evaluated through invasive or noninvasive methods. The aim of this paper was to assess the indications and results of transient elastographic (TE) evaluation of the liver in patients with chronic viral hepatitis and cirrhosis.We retrospectively assessed all the liver stiffness measurements (LSM) (FibroScan®) performed over a two-year period (2007 - 2009).3,459 TE evaluations were made mainly for the assessment of: HCV hepatitis, HBV infection (chronic hepatitis and inactive HBV carriers), biviral hepatitis (B + C or B + D), cirrhosis and in 176 normal subjects (to establish the normal values of LSM). From the 3,459 FS evaluations, we could not obtain valid LSM in 183 cases (5.3 %). 93.9 % of the patients in the failure group were overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m²). In 527 cases (16 %) the SR (success rate = number of valid measurements/total number of measurements) was < 60 %. TE reproducibility was analyzed in 287 cases. The ICCs for the three operators were 0.985, 0.949, and 0.874 respectively, and the overall ICC was 0.982. 596 cases of cirrhosis were evaluated. A cut-off value of 23.3kPa was found to predict the presence of at least grade 2 esophageal varices.LSM by means of TE is a promising noninvasive evaluation method, which can be used in numerous clinical situations, some in which its value is well established (suspicion of LC, predicting significant fibrosis) and some in which its value is less known (HBV chronic hepatitis, inactive HBV carriers or severity of portal hypertension).
