Intrahepatic transit time predicts liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B: quantitative assessment with contrast-enhanced ultrasonography. We investigated the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with quantitative measurements to assess the stages of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B. One-hundred twenty-two patients with chronic hepatitis B were divided into three groups according to the Scheuer scoring system pathologically and according to clinical evidence: mild fibrosis (S0 and S1, n = 36) moderate fibrosis (S2 and S3, n = 24)
