Progressive dyspnoea in two patients with carcinoid syndrome. In patients with carcinoid syndrome, there has always to be considered cardiac impairment. We report about two patients with hepatic and bone metastases of a neuroendocrine tumor of the midgut, who suffered from progressive dyspnea. This was caused in both cases by a right-to-left atrial shunt, in case 1 based on a patent foramen ovale (PFO), in case 2 based on a secundum atrial septal defect. Symptoms were significantly reduced by percutaneous closure of PFO and ASD, respectively. Right-to-left atrial shunt was facilitated by right-sided carcinoid induced endocardial fibrosis with the consequence of severe tricuspid regurgitation, leading to an increase of right atrial pressure.
