Peliosis hepatis of late onset in a patient exposed to vinyl chloride and treated for hepatic angiosarcoma. We report the case of a 45 year old man with asymptomatic hepatic angiosarcoma after professional exposure to vinyl chloride. Diagnosis was made with annual ultrasound examination during a medical surveillance program. Two years after surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, hepatic recurrence was treated with radiation therapy and chemoembolization. A complete response was observed. Peliosis hepatis, confirmed by liver biopsy, occurred secondarily. Eight years after initial diagnosis, the patient was asymptomatic without recurrence of angiosarcoma. The difficulty of diagnosis of angiosarcoma at an early stage, therapy modalities, and the relation between peliosis, fibrosis, and angiosarcoma are discussed.
