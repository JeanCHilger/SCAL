Steatosis and serum lipid patterns in patients with chronic viral hepatitis: differences related to viral etiology. Lipid metabolism disorders related to viral etiology are described in chronic viral hepatitis, independent of age, gender and liver synthetic function. Steatosis is present, especially in chronic hepatitis C but also in chronic hepatitis B. Although liver biopsy is the gold standard in determining presence of steatosis, its presence can be determined by ultrasonographic examination as an initial screening test. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the presence of steatosis in chronic hepatitis B and C, to determine its frequency in both hepatitis type, and to explore possible relationships between presence of steatosis, lipid metabolism disorders and viral etiology. Our study lot included 66 patients, 36 subjects with chronic hepatitis C, and 30 with chronic hepatitis B. We only encountered significant levels of steatosis in the chronic hepatitis B sub-group. We found the average age, cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-C, VLDL-C levels in the group with steatosis to be significantly higher than those in the group without steatosis (p < 0.05). Ultrasound reports of hepatic steatosis were particularly associated with histological inflammation, as well as fibrosis however, the sensitivity and specificity of steatosis on ultrasound was poor when compared to steatosis on biopsy. Hepatic steatosis was significantly more frequent in chronic hepatitis C than in chronic hepatitis B. Severe inflammation and advanced fibrosis were more frequently found in HCV-infected patients with steatosis than in patients without steatosis.
