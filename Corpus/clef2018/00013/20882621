Comparison of enhancement patterns of histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma between gadoxetate- and ferucarbotran-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. To compare enhancenent patterns of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and dysplastic nodule (DN) between gadoxetate- and ferucarbotran-enhanced MRI.Patients recruited from ultrasound surveillance for HCC in chronic liver diseases were enrolled in this prospective study approved by institutional review board. Thirty-six patients with 37 histologically proven HCC, including 22 well-differentiated HCCs (wHCC), 15 moderately to poorly differentiated HCCs (mpHCCs), and 4 DNs, underwent gadoxetate-enhanced and ferucarbotran-enhanced MRI. We compared hepatobiliary phase image of gadoxetate-enhanced MRI with ferucarbotran-enhanced MR image regarding signal intensity of HCC and DN relative to surrounding liver parenchyma. We calculated contrast ratios between tumor and liver on pre-enhancement, hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetate-enhanced MRI and ferucarbotran-enhanced MRI.On ferucarbotran-enhanced MRI, all mpHCCs showed hyper-intensity, while 14 wHCCs (14/2263%) showed iso-intensity. On hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetate-enhanced MRI, 13 mpHCCs (13/15The uptake function of hepatocytes that are targeted by gadoxetate is more sensitive than that of Kupffer cells targeted by ferucarbotran in stepwise hepatocarcinogenesis.
