Noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis with acoustic radiation force impulse imaging: increased liver and splenic stiffness in patients with liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. To evaluate acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) of the liver and spleen as a new method for the noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis (LF).Three groups of 58 examinees were studied: (A) 20 healthy volunteers (B) 18 patients with chronic viral hepatitis (CVH) B or C having liver fibrosis stages F 1 - 4 (assessed by liver biopsyHepatic ARFI measurements demonstrated a significant correlation to LB results (Spearman's ρ = 0.766 ρ < 0.001) and SWV cut-off values of 1.3 (AUC 0.96) and 1.86 (AUC 0.99) could reliably differentiate between healthy (A) and non-cirrhotic CVH (B), as well as between non-cirrhotic CVH (B) and LC (C). Splenic SWV cut-off value of 2.73 (AUC 0.82) could differentiate between the patients with LC and non-cirrhotic CVH. A significant correlation was also observed between the SAPI and liver ARFI results (ρ = 0.56The hepatic and splenic SWV measured by ARFI increase with the LF stage, and the hepatic SWV correlate well with SAPI. This new technology enables simultaneous morphological, Doppler and elastometric examinations and might improve the accuracy of noninvasive liver fibrosis assessment.
