Doppler flowmetry in the study of portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis. Qualitative and quantitative analyses. The recent development of the duplex-Doppler technique, which combined real-time US with pulsed Doppler flowmetry, has allowed the flowmetric hemodynamic study of large abdominal vessels. As yet, however, both accuracy and possible applications of this method in the study of portal hypertension have not been fully investigated. This study was aimed at assessing whether or not the combined use of Doppler flowmetry and bidimensional US is able to detect portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), and could therefore represent a valid alternative to endoscopic, angiographic, and direct pressure measurement techniques. Twenty-six patients with LC and 25 control patients were studied with a strictly standardized method portal hypertension was detected in the patients with LC by EGDS and laparoscopy. The results demonstrated pulsed duplex-Doppler US to be able to detect portal hypertension in 92.4% of LC patients, with 2 false negatives only (7.6%). The difference in the flowmetric data of normal and LC patients was highly significant (p less than 0.001 Student's t test). In conclusion, duplex-Doppler US can be considered as a valid technique to detect portal hypertension in LC patients, and can thus be used as an alternative to more invasive techniques of general use in clinics.
