Cardiac function and aminoterminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels in liver-transplanted cirrhotic patients. Cirrhosis is associated with structural and functional abnormalities of the heart. We examined the evolution of these abnormalities after liver transplantation (LT).Sixty cirrhotic patients, without cardiovascular disease, were included. Clinical data, echocardiography, and aminoterminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were analyzed before and after transplantation. Healthy controls (n = 25) were included for reference.Before transplantation, cirrhotic patients had higher left atrium diameter, left ventricular (LV) mass index, and ejection fraction than controls. After transplantation, LV mass index increased (105 ± 31 vs. 119 ± 35 g/m(2)  p < 0.05), diastolic cardiac function deteriorated, expressed as a reduction in E/A wave ratio (1.105 ± 0.295 vs. 0.798 ± 0.248In cirrhotic patients, diastolic function and cardiac structure deteriorate after LT. Compared to controls, NT-proBNP levels tend to be higher before and after transplantation. The mechanisms and consequences of these results require further study.
