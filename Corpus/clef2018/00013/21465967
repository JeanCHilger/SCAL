Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) review of initial experience at Aga Khan University Hospital. To retrospectively assess the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of transjugular intrahepafic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in patients with portal hypertension related complications.Over a period of 7.5 years 19 patients (10 males and 9 females, age range 25-69 years) were referred for TIPS at our radiology department. Thirteen patients suffered from liver cirrhosis while 6 had Budd Chiari syndrome. All patients were evaluated with colour doppler ultrasonography and cross sectional imaging. Shunt procedures were performed under sedation or general anaesthesia through internal jugular approach. Metallic self expandable uncovered stents were placed in 15 patients and covered stent in 1 patient. Follow up of patency was evaluated with ultrasound in majority and by venography in some patients. Safety of the procedure and clinical outcome were analyzed.Indications of procedure included variceal bleeding (n=8), ascites (n=4), ascites and bleeding (n=1) and Budd-Chiari syndrome (n=6). Technical success rate was 84.21%. Complication rate was 10.53%. Three days mortality was 15.79%. Mean primary shunt patency was 306.62 +/- 533 days. During follow-up stent occlusion occurred in 5 patients (31.25%). Four of these patients underwent successful reintervention. Recurrence of symptoms occurred in 68.75% patients.TIPS is useful for management of complications of portal hypertension that are refractory to pharmacological and endoscopic treatment, however shunt stenosis or occlusion may cause recurrence of symptoms. Repeated interventions are often required to maintain shunt patency.
