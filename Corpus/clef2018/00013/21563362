Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: scientific and practical achievements and prospects. We presented the results of our research in comparison with the literature on the etiology, pathogenesis and diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) at liver cirrhosis (LC), complicated by ascites. Based on these data, was proposed a classification of SBP. Were identified criteria for early diagnosis of SBP on the basis of clinical manifestations of bacterial peritonitis, systemic inflammatory response, results of studies of ascitic fluid (AF) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In accordance with the proposed criteria was proposed a scheme for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of STDs. Presents data on the effectiveness of therapy and prevention of SBP. Denote the potential major long-term trends in the treatment of SBP in cirrhosis.
