A case of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with chronic renal failure on haemodialysis. A 36 years old man with chronic renal failure on haemodialysis therapy presented with a hepatic mass which was diagnosed by ultrasonography, and was admitted to our hospital. Computer tomography and hepatic angiography revealed hepatocellular carcinoma of the right anterior superior segment of the liver. His liver function test, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in the serum were within the normal range. HBs antigen was also negative. Resection of right antero-superior segment was done following transcatheter arterial embolization. The tumor was homogeneous and light yellowish in color, and well demarcated by the capsule. Nontumorous tissue did not show either fibrosis or any inflammatory reaction. In general, hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with a positive HBs antigen and altered liver function. We here report a rare case of hepatocellular carcinoma in a man who was undergoing haemodialysis treatment for chronic renal failure with normal liver function test and negative HBs antigen.
