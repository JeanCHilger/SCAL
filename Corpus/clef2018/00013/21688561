Non-invasive markers of esophageal varices in compensated liver cirrhosis. There were 91 patients in this study, with liver cirrhosis classified as Child A, diagnosed using clinical, biological and ultrasound methods, and a control group. We used a special questionnaire and biostatistical methods in order to assess the presence of esophageal varices (EV), followed by performing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE).Models made with biostatistical methods differentiated the cases with or without EV. ROC curve showed sensitivity and specificity values of various parameters. We obtained an overall rate of correct classification of 84.62% for the presence of EV and 71.30% scale assessment.Using non-invasive tests may be useful as therapeutic and prognostic considerations, to reduce the number of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in the disease surveillance also.
