YKL-40 and transient elastography, a powerful team to assess hepatic fibrosis. Transient elastography (TE) is a non-invasive and accurate method for the diagnosis of severe hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis (F = 3 and F = 4). However, the assessment of significant fibrosis (F = 2) by TE is impaired due to a high variation in the diagnostic accuracy. Within this study, we aim to compare the diagnostic value of TE and experimental biomarkers of liver fibrosis.A total of 55 patients with chronic liver disease of different etiologies were included in the study. Among them, patients with HCV infection represented the largest cohort (n = 25). Liver fibrosis was evaluated according to the Desmet/Scheuer score. All patients received TE. Serum concentrations of YKL-40, hyaluronic acid (HA), Laminin, C-terminal procollagen I peptide, MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 complex were determined by ELISA.In the total patient population, areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) for TE were 0.798 (F ≥ 2), 0.880 (F ≥ 3) and 1 (F = 4). Among the serum markers, highest diagnostic accuracies were calculated for YKL-40 for F ≥ 2 (0.792) and F ≥ 3 (0.914) and for YKL-40 and HA for F = 4 (both 0.936). In the subgroup of HCV patients, the following AUROCs for TE were calculated: 0.802 (F ≥ 2), 0.798 (F ≥ 3) and 0.998 (F = 4). YKL-40 exhibited the highest diagnostic accuracy of all biomarkers in the HCV population (0.880, 0.854 and 0.986, respectively).YKL-40 is a powerful fibrosis marker with high diagnostic accuracy, in particular in HCV-associated liver disease. Its determination may confirm and improve the diagnostic accuracy of TE especially in early stages of liver fibrosis.
