Cross-validation of MR elastography and ultrasound transient elastography in liver stiffness measurement: discrepancy in the results of cirrhotic liver. To evaluate individual differences in liver stiffness measurement using both MR elastography (MRE) and ultrasound transient elastography (UTE) in patients with chronic liver disease.This study included 80 patients with chronic liver disease who underwent both UTE and MRE. MRE and UTE were performed using a pneumatic driver (60 Hz) and an ultrasound probe with a vibrator (50 Hz), respectively. Liver stiffness data measured using the two techniques (μ(UTE) and μ(MRE) ) were compared with respect to shear modulus. The patients were subdivided into four quartiles on the basis of average of the μ(UTE) and μ(MRE) values for each patient.The analysis of the 4 quartile groups revealed that μ(UTE) was significantly higher than μ(MRE) in the two most stiff liver groups: μ(UTE) versus μ(MRE) , 7.5 (1.2) versus 6.0 (0.72) kPa for the group with [μ(UTE) + μ(MRE) ]/2 of 5.6-8.0 kPa 15.1(4.2) versus 6.7 (1.4) kPa for the group with >8.0 kPa. However, in the least stiff liver group (i.e., the group with [μ(UTE) + μ(MRE) ]/2 < 3.2 kPa), μ(UTE) was significantly lower than μ(MRE) .The shear modulus measured by UTE and MRE are not equivalent, especially in patients with stiff livers.
