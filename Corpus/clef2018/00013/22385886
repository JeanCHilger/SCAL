Can we consider the right hepatic lobe size/albumin ratio a noninvasive predictor of oesophageal varices in hepatitis C virus-related liver cirrhotic Egyptian patients? The current guidelines recommend the screening of all cirrhotic patients by endoscopy, but repeated endoscopic examinations are unpleasant for patients and have a high cost impact and burden on endoscopic units. The aim of this study is to evaluate the optimal liver lobe size/albumin ratio and to compare this ratio with spleen size, platelet count and platelet count/spleen diameter ratio as potential noninvasive predictors of oesophageal varices in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver cirrhosis in Egyptian patients.This prospective study included one hundred patients with HCV-related liver cirrhosis. All studied subjects underwent a detailed clinical examination, biochemical workup, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound. The platelet count/spleen diameter ratio and the right liver lobe/albumin concentration ratio for all patients were calculated.The 4 predictors demonstrated a high statistically significant correlation with the presence and grade of oesophageal varices (P values<0.001). The platelet count/spleen diameter ratio had the highest accuracy, followed by the right liver lobe/albumin concentration ratio, spleen size and then platelet count.The use of the studied noninvasive predictors, especially the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio and the right liver lobe/albumin concentration ratio, can help physicians by restricting the use of endoscopic screening only to patients presenting a high probability of oesophageal varices. This is especially useful in clinical settings where resources are limited and endoscopic facilities are not present in all areas. Such is the case in Egypt, where there is a large number of patients who require oesophageal screening for oesophageal varices.
