Peritoneal pseudomyxoma presenting as ascites in a patient with cirrhosis. We present the case of a cirrhotic patient with ascites and an albumin gradient of less than 1.1 g/dl. After endoscopic tests, including upper gastrointestinal endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration, exploratory laparoscopy was performed to provide the diagnosis, revealing mucin throughout the peritoneal cavity and nodules on the parietal and visceral peritoneum. Histopathological analysis established the diagnosis as peritoneal pseudomyxoma. This uncommon entity, which has a poor prognosis without treatment, is most frequently associated with mucinous tumors of the appendix, and secondly, with tumors of the ovary.
