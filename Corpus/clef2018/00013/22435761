Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP): a noninvasive method for the detection of hepatic steatosis based on transient elastography. Accurate tools for the noninvasive detection of hepatic steatosis are needed. The Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) specifically targets liver steatosis using a process based on transient elastography.Patients with chronic liver disease and body mass index (BMI) ≥28 kg/m(2) underwent biopsy and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with simultaneous CAP determination using the FibroScan(®) M probe. The performance of the CAP for diagnosing steatosis compared with biopsy was assessed using areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC).A total of 153 patients were included: 69% were male, median BMI was 32 kg/m(2) 47% had nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)The CAP is a promising tool for the noninvasive detection of hepatic steatosis. Advantages of CAP include its ease of measurement, operator-independence and simultaneous availability with LSM for fibrosis assessment.
