Right diaphragmatic defect in hepatic hydrothorax exposed by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography after radiofrequency ablation. A 68-year-old male with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma treated by radiofrequency ablation was hospitalized for right hepatic hydrothorax and ascites. Perflubutane injected into the peritoneal cavity after an ultrasonography contrast agent revealed jet-like flow from the ascites to a pleural effusion, indicating a diaphragmatic defect. A hepatic hydrothorax was sutured under thoracoscopy and did not recur. An intraperitoneal injection of perflubutane enables a less-invasive diagnosis of a diaphragmatic defect.
