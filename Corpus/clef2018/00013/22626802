Hepatic-associated immunoglobulin-A nephropathy in a child with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Hepatic-associated immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is a relatively common condition that occurs in adults with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. However, it is rare in children. This condition is characterized by the deposition of IgA in the renal glomeruli. The present report describes a 14-year-old boy with cryptogenic liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension who presented with hematuria and proteinuria associated with histological changes of IgA nephropathy.
