Portal hemodynamics and morphological changes in patients, suffering cirrhosis. Morphometric, rheographic and ultrasonographic hemodynamical investigations were conducted in 137 patients, suffering hepatic cirrhosis. Three types of morphological signs of hepatic cirrhosis were delineated. Rheohepathographic and ultrasonographic characteristics of common hepatic blood flow, vessels and hemodynamics in a portal vein system for every type were established.
