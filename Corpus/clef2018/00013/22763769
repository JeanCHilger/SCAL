Perforation of carotid artery causing cervical hematoma. Perforation of the carotid artery is a rare, life-threatening emergency. This entity is usually caused by failed puncture of jugular veins, external trauma, or infection of the vascular wall. The existence of spontaneous rupture as a cause of vessel rupture is discussed in the literature.The case of a 57-year-old woman who suffered painful cervical swelling on the left side for 2 days is described. Six weeks prior to this, she had received transjugular intrahepatic shunt implantation (TIPS) via the jugular vein because of liver cirrhosis. Further signs were vocal cord dysfunction and Horners' syndrome on the left side. Computed tomography (CT) with contrast agent revealed a huge mass surrounding the common carotid artery. Differentiation between a solid tumor and carotid dissection was primarily not possible. Radiological considerations also comprised an abscess or even a paraganglioma. Only color duplex sonography revealed a pendular blood flow slightly caudal of the carotid bifurcation. In agreement with the CT findings, a calcified plaque appeared directly downstream of the presumed vessel injury. Operative revision was performed in collaboration with the vascular surgeon. Transluminal endarteriectomy and vessel reconstruction with patch plasty was performed.Cervical hematoma caused by carotid injury of unknown origin is a rare differential diagnosis of sudden cervical swelling. In this case, failed venous puncture in conjunction with pre-existing  arterial plaque and therewith inflammation of the vessel wall could have caused the injury and delayed carotid rupture.
