Correlation between liver sonographic findings and clinical manifestations of clonorchiasis. To study the correlation between sonographic findings of the intrahepatic bile duct and liver and clinical symptoms and signs of clonorchiasis.The data of sonographic findings of intrahepatic bile duct and liver and clinical symptoms and signs of 98 patients with clonorchiasis were collected and analyzed.There were 40 cases in light degree of the II , III intrahepatic bile duct dilatation, 27 cases in middle degree, and 31 cases in heavy degree. There were 4 cases of intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and liver patchy or nodular lesions of slightly stronger echo. The mild expansion of intrahepatic bile duct was found in the patients with no obvious clinical signs and symptoms. The middle and heavy degrees of expansion were found in the patients with obvious clinical signs and symptoms. There were significantly difference between them (chi2 = 43.57, P < 0.05). The incidence of middle and heavy degrees of expansion in patients with cholecystitis, pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma was much higher than that in patients with intrahepatic bile duct stones (chi2 = 4.873, P < 0.05).Bile duct dilatation is closely correlated with the clinical symptoms and signs. This connection helps the diagnosis of clonorchiasis.
