Novel histologic scoring system for long-term allograft fibrosis after liver transplantation in children. The existing systems for scoring fibrosis were not developed to evaluate transplanted livers. Our aim was to design and validate a novel fibrosis scoring system specifically adapted to assess liver allograft fibrosis (LAF). Clinical data, histology, transient elastography (TE) and AST/platelet ratio index (APRI) were reviewed in 38 pediatric liver transplant (LT) recipients. Protocol liver biopsies performed at 6 months and 7 years post-LT were reviewed by three pathologists who assessed LAF using the METAVIR and Ishak systems. LAF was also scored separately in portal (0-3), sinusoidal (0-3) and centrolobular areas (0-3). Scoring evaluations were correlated with fibrosis quantification using morphometry, and also with TE and APRI. Statistical correlations between morphometry and METAVIR were 0.571 (p < 0.000) and 0.566 (p < 0.000) for the Ishak system. The novel score (0-9) for separate assessment of portal, sinusoidal and centrolobular fibrosis showed a better correlation with morphometry (0.731 p < 0.000) and high intra-/interobserver agreement (0.966
