Non-invasive evaluation of hepatic manifestation in Wilson disease with transient elastography, ARFI, and different fibrosis scores. Noninvasive investigation of liver fibrosis with ultrasound-based elastography and laboratory-based fibrosis indices have been established in various chronic liver diseases within the last years. We aimed to evaluate feasibility and diagnostic value of transient elastography (TE), acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI), and different serologic fibrosis indices in Wilson's disease (WD).TE and ARFI were performed in 50 Wilson patients. In addition, AST/Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), FIB-4, and Forns score were calculated. Hepatic fibrosis was classified by a clinical score.Of the 50 Wilson patients 41 had hepatic manifestation of WD. TE results were significantly increased in advanced hepatic fibrosis (7.0 ± 2.2 kPa p < 0.05) and cirrhosis (10.1 ± 6.73 kPaTE displayed a gradual increase between different stages of hepatic manifestation in WD and could significantly discriminate cirrhosis. The TE cutoff for cirrhosis may be clinically more relevant than the R-ARFI value.
