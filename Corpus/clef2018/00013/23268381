Classification and staging of chronic liver disease from multimodal data. Chronic liver disease (CLD) is most of the time an asymptomatic, progressive, and ultimately potentially fatal disease. In this study, an automatic hierarchical procedure to stage CLD using ultrasound images, laboratory tests, and clinical records are described. The first stage of the proposed method, called clinical based classifier (CBC), discriminates healthy from pathologic conditions. When nonhealthy conditions are detected, the method refines the results in three exclusive pathologies in a hierarchical basis: 1) chronic hepatitis 2) compensated cirrhosis
