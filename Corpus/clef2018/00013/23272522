Biochemical and ultrasound aspects in chronic viral hepatitis C patients. Biochemical and ultrasound investigations in patients with chronic hepatitis C on a 48-week anti-viral regimen.A group of 6 patients, 4 women and 2 men, age range 24-61, were evaluated at the beginning of therapy and compared after 48 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2a and peginterferon alpha-2b regimen at doses established by the National Treatment Program approved by the Romanian National Health Insurance House.ALT and AST levels have decreased in all patients. The viral load was undetectable in two patients, both females, after 48 weeks of therapy. Ultrasound images showed a decrease in size of the right and left hepatic lobes and portal vein diameter after 48 weeks.Inhibition of virus by interferon and ribavirin resulted in the reduction of inflammatory phenomena and regenerative fibrosis noticed after a very long period of time (at least 48 weeks). Further studies performed on larger patient groups are needed in order to better describe all these changes.
