Liver fibrosis: noninvasive assessment with acoustic radiation force impulse elastography--comparison with FibroScan M and XL probes and FibroTest in patients with chronic liver disease. To compare the diagnostic performance of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography with that of FibroScan M and XL probes and FibroTest in the staging of fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease.This study received ethics approval, and all participants provided written informed consent. A total of 321 consecutive patients with chronic liver disease who underwent liver biopsy were prospectively enrolled from April 2010 to May 2012. Liver disease was caused by viral hepatitis (n = 136), alcoholic or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis disorders (n = 113), or some other disease (n = 72). In each patient, liver stiffness was evaluated with ARFI elastography, M and XL probes, and FibroTest within 1 month before liver biopsy. Histologic staging of liver fibrosis served as the reference standard.Liver stiffness measurement failure rates were 11.2% with the M probe (36 of 321 patients), 2.3% with the XL probe (six of 260 patients), and 0% with ARFI elastography (0 of 321 patients). Unreliable results with ARFI elastography were more frequent in obese patients (those with a body mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more) (42 of 86 patients [48.8%] vs 34 of 235 patients [14.5%], P < .0001). No significant difference was found between ARFI elastography and the M probe in the diagnosis of cirrhosis (area under under the receiver operating characteristic curve [Az], 0.88 vs 0.91 P = .12) or severe fibrosis (Az, 0.85 vs 0.89ARFI elastography is reliable in the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease, especially nonobese patients.
