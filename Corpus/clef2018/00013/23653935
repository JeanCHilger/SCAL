Diagnostic value of serum markers of fibrosis in chronic liver diseases. To estimate the diagnostic value (DV) of direct markers of liver fibrosis, such as type IV collagen (C-IV), hyaluronic acid (HA), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) in combination with indirect markers of fibrosis, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GTP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), platelets, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in evaluating liver fibrosis.Sixty-seven patients with chronic diffuse liver diseases were examined. ALT, AST, gamma-GTP, and ALP were determined as indirect indicators of fibrosis. The levels of TIMP-1, HA, C-IV, and TNF-alpha were estimated by ELISA the stage of fibrosis was determined by the results of indirect liver ultrasound fibroelastography (FE).According to the results of FE, the patients were divided into 2 groups: 1) (n = 25) F < or = 2 METAVIR and 2) (n = 42) F3-F4. While estimating DV of severe fibrosis stages (F3-F4), the area under the ROC curve (AUC) increased for platelets, HA, and C-IV. DV of ALT, AST declined with the higher degree of fibrosis. The highest ratio of test specificity and sensitivity (TSp and TSen) and AUC were observed for AST and HA. ALT and platelets showed low TSen, and TNF-alpha and TIMP-1 had no TSp. For evaluation of fibrosis (F4), a HA increase of over 57.7 ng/ml had 92.6% TSen and 67.5% TSp for a C-IV elevation of above 133.1mkg/l, TSen was 85.2%, TSp was 57.5%The results of the investigation convincingly suggest that examination of the serum markers of fibrosis allows one to estimate with a high probability its presence and severity in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. The so-called direct markers (substances reflecting the biochemistry and regulation of fibrogenesis) are undoubtedly of great diagnostic value.
