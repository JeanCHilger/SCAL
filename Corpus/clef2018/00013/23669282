Reliability of the estimation of total hepatic blood flow by Doppler ultrasound in patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension. Hepatic blood flow (HBF) is best estimated by the Fick's method during indocyanine green constant infusion (ICG-HBF) on hepatic vein catheterization. We investigated the consistency and agreement of HBF measured by Doppler ultrasound (US-HBF) as compared with ICG-HBF in portal hypertensive patients with cirrhosis.In 50 patients observed for HVPG measurement (56% compensated Child score 7 ± 2Mean ICG-HBF and US-HBF were similar, being respectively 1004 ± 543 ml/min and 994 ± 494 ml/min (p = 0.661 vs. ICG-HBF). However, results in individual patients disclosed marked differences between the two methods (386 ± 415 ml/min) and showed only moderate consistency (ICC 0.456 p < 0.0001), absolute agreement (ICC 0.461HBF estimations by Doppler-ultrasound and ICG are significantly correlated, but their discrepancy in individual cases is high. Estimation of HBF by Doppler-US should be considered unreliable in patients with poor hepatic function and large liver arterialization.
