Reducing risk of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt using ultrasound guided single needle pass. Delayed liver laceration following transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a serious and likely underdiagnosed complication. It is however an important complication following TIPS, which remains one of the most technically challenging interventional procedures performed. In addition to laceration, a number of complications regarding bleeding and perforation are well described following TIPS procedures. We feel the adoption of techniques such as ours and that of other authors described in the literature using an ultrasound-guided percutaneous transhepatic approach with a small caliber needle provides a safer and less traumatic procedure and should reduce complications of bleeding and almost completely eliminate the risk of liver laceration. Our procedure was successfully performed under conscious sedation rather than general anaesthesia further reducing the overall procedural risk to the patient.
