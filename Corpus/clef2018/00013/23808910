Fibroscan can avoid liver biopsy in Indian patients with chronic hepatitis B. Liver fibrosis is an established determinant of prognosis and therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The role of fibroscan in assessing fibrosis in CHB remains unclear. Present study was designed to correlate fibroscan with liver biopsy and determine whether fibroscan can avoid liver biopsy in patients with CHB.Fibroscan and liver biopsy were performed in 382 consecutive patients with CHB. Biopsies were reviewed by pathologist blinded to the fibroscan value. Discriminant values of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) to reasonably exclude and predict significant fibrosis were calculated from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The factors affecting LSM independent of fibrosis were assessed.Three hundred fifty-seven patients were included (mean age 30.1 ± 9.7 years, male : female 17 : 3). There was significant correlation between LSM and histological fibrosis (r = 0.58, P < 0.001). The area under ROC curve of LSM for significant fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4), bridging fibrosis (F0-2 vs. F3-4), and cirrhosis (F0-3 vs. F4) was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78-0.89), 0.94 (95% CI: 0.89-0.99), and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.85-1.00), respectively. LSM < 6.0 KPa could exclude significant (F ≥ 2) and bridging fibrosis (F ≥ 3) with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 92.4% and 99.5%, respectively. Cut-off of 9 KPa could detect significant (F ≥ 2) and bridging fibrosis (F ≥ 3) with specificity of 95% and 97%, respectively, and had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 84.3% in predicting significant fibrosis. LSM < 6 KPa and > 9 KPa matched with histological fibrosis in 227/250 (91%) patients. Therefore, fibroscan could avoid liver biopsy in 70% (250/357) patients with an accuracy > 90%. Histological fibrosis, ALT > 5 times, and age > 40 years were independent determinants of increased liver stiffness.Fibroscan accurately assessed fibrosis and could avoid liver biopsy in more than two-thirds of patients with CHB.
