Inhibition of hepatic fibrosis with artificial microRNA using ultrasound and cationic liposome-bearing microbubbles. We sought to investigate the antifibrotic effects of an artificial microRNA (miRNA) targeting connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) using the ultrasound-targeted cationic liposome-bearing microbubble destruction gene delivery system. Cationic liposomes were conjugated with microbubbles using a biotin-avidin system. Plasmids carrying the most effective artificial miRNA sequences were delivered by ultrasound-targeted cationic liposome-bearing microbubble destruction gene delivery system to rats with hepatic fibrosis. The results show that this method of gene delivery effectively transported the plasmids to the rat liver. The artificial miRNA reduced hepatic fibrosis pathological alterations as well as the protein and mRNA expressions of CTGF and transforming growth factor β1. Furthermore, the CTGF gene silencing decreased the levels of type I collagen and α-smooth muscle actin (P<0.01). These data suggest that delivery of an artificial miRNA targeted against CTGF using ultrasound-targeted cationic liposome-bearing microbubble destruction may be an efficacious therapeutic method to ameliorate hepatic fibrosis.
