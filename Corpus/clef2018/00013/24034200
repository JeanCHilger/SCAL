Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation in cryptogenic liver cirrhosis. The cause in 10 - 20% cases of liver cirrhosis (LC) cannot be elucidated, and are thus termed cryptogenic. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are relatively rare, but the most common anomaly involving the pulmonary tree. Although the rare correlation between LC and PAVM is well-known, there have been no reports of PAVMs occurring in cryptogenic LC. We report a case of PAVM that occurred in cryptogenic liver cirrhosis in a 3 years old male child. The child presented with complaints of malena, hematemesis and variceal bleed. The examination revealed a child with respiratory distress, irritability, tachycardia, clubbing and abdominal distention. He was worked up for recurrent variceal bleeding secondary to portal hypertension but the oxygen saturation during hospital stay kept deteriorating. The diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome as the cause of persistent hypoxemia in the absence of other cardio-pulmonary causes was then made by enhanced echocardiogram using agitated saline. He improved significantly after liver transplantation performed abroad. At a 6 months follow-up, the child was stable with no evidence of intrapulmonary shunting on repeat echo.
