Natural history of postvascular-phase iso-enhanced lesions on the sonogram in chronic liver diseases. This study examined the natural history of postvascular-phase iso-enhanced lesions (PIELs) on contrast-enhanced sonograms to determine the potential risk and predictive factors for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic liver diseases.This prospective study included 87 PIELs on contrast-enhanced sonograms (postvascular-phase: 10 min post-injection of perflubutane microbubbles) in 72 patients with chronic liver diseases (45 males and 27 females age 65.0 ± 10.8yTwenty patients developed HCCs during the study period (median, 22.0 months). The cumulative risk of HCC occurrence was 7.9% at 1 year and 36.0% at 3 years. The presence of coexistent HCC (hazard ratio [HR], 4.975 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.729-14.316Patients with coexistent HCC, alpha-fetoprotein > 20 ng/mL, or PIEL > 14 mm should be carefully monitored because of the high potential for HCC occurrence.
