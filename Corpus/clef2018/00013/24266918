Management of end-stage liver disease. Patients with cirrhosis who experience hepatic decompensation, such as the development of ascites, SBP, variceal hemorrhage, or hepatic encephalopathy, or who develop HCC, are at a higher risk of mortality. Management should be focused on the prevention of recurrence of complications, and these patients should be referred for consideration of liver transplantation.
