Pre-transplant left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is associated with post transplant acute graft rejection and graft failure. Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is a significant cause of morbidity and graft failure in liver transplant recipients (LTR). Diastolic dysfunction (DD) is frequently present in patients with cirrhosis undergoing liver transplantation. However, it is unclear if DD leads to ACR.Data was collected retrospectively for consecutive LTR between January 2000 and December 2010. Demographic data and mortality related data was obtained from social security index. Primary outcome was biopsy proven ACR. Graft failure and all-cause mortality were also evaluated. DD was evaluated as a predictor of these outcomes. Other echocardiographic indices were also assessed as predictors of ACR by using Cox proportional hazard modeling adjusted for covariates.A total of 970 LTR (mean age 53.2 ± 10 years, women 34.6 % and white 64.5 %) were followed for 5.3 ± 3.4 years. Patients with DD (n = 145, 14.9 %) were significantly more likely to develop ACRs (HR 10.56 95 % CI 6.78-16.45, p value = 0.0001) as well as graft failure (HR 2.09Pre-transplant DD is significantly associated with increased risk of allograft rejection, graft failure and mortality. This signifies the importance of cardiac evaluation during the pre-transplant period.
