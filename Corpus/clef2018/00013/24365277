Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): a new risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events in dialysis patients. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in Western countries. Today it is believed that NAFLD is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, and thus it is closely related to the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage-renal disease (ESRD). NAFLD and ESRD share some important cardiometabolic risk factors and possible common pathophyisiological mechanisms, and are linked to an increased risk of incident CVD events. We hypothesize that the coexistence of these two conditions could lead to much faster progress of the aterogenic process. Furthermore, patients with ESRD who suffer from NAFLD have a much higher risk for the development of adverse CVD events. Given the high prevalence of NAFLD, and its tight association with other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome and thus cardiovascular complications, it is important to recognize and aggressively treat this condition in ESRD patients. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose the use of non-invasive methods such as transient elastography (TE) (Fibroscan-CAP) for the detection and quantification of liver steatosis and fibrosis, as well as an abdominal ultrasound for detecting liver steatosis. We focus on their correlation with carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaque as surrogate measures of increased cardiovascular risk in HD patients in order to investigate the association of NAFLD and increase risk of adverse CVD events. This evaluation will prove useful in assessing the risk in HD patients with NAFLD for increase CVD mortality.
