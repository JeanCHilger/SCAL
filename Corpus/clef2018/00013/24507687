Ultrasonic diagnosis and vasoactive substances examination in patients with cirrhosis. To investigate hemodynamic change of patients with cirrhosis by using Color Doppler ultrasound technique and to explore the significance of change in the content of vasoactive substances-plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).A total of 178 cases with cirrhosis were regarded as study groups, and were divided into three degrees: A, B and C according to child-pugh and meanwhile 60 cases were regarded as normal control group. Portal vein and splenic vein of patients were explored by adopting Color Doppler ultrasound technique, related indexes were recorded and the blood flow as well as their ration in the two groups was calculated. Radio immunoassay was adopted to detect the content of plasma ET-1 and CGRP in both study group and contrast group.Compared with the healthy cases in the contrast group, there was abnormal hemodynamics in the system of portal vein of patients with cirrhosis and the content of plasma ET-1 and CGRP was increased obviously. In the Child-Pugh liver function grades, the content of ET-1 and CGRP was increased as the degree of cirrhosis became more and more serious. There was no significant difference in the comparison between those without ascites and those in contrast group (P>0.05), the content of plasma ET-1 and CGRP in patients without ascites was increased remarkably. Besides, there was positive correlation between the content of plasma ET-1 and CGRP and Dpv, Dsv and Qsv.Detection of abnormal hemodynamics of portal vein and splenic vein by Color Doppler ultrasound technique can be one of the means for diagnosis of hypertension. Plasma ET-1 and CGRP of patients with cirrhosis reflect the serious degree of the damage in live function and play an important role in the formation and development of portal hypertension.
