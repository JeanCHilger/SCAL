Hepatocellular carcinoma. A comparison of Oriental and Caucasian patients. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a very malignant tumor that affects both Caucasian and Oriental populations. In the Caucasian patient, it frequently arises in a background of cirrhosis, most commonly the alcoholic type. In the present study, the alpha-feto-protein level was increased in less than half of the Caucasian patients. In comparison, hepatocellular carcinoma in Oriental patients most often occurs in livers with postinfectious cirrhosis. In the present study, both hepatitis B surface antigen and an increased alpha-fetoprotein level were present in three of four patients. If the tumor is present, however, it appears to behave similarly in both ethnic groups. Without resection, the prognosis is poor, regardless of the presence or absence of underlying cirrhosis or hepatitis B surface antigen status. A tissue diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is most readily made by ultrasonographically guided fine-needle aspiration, which has an 81 percent sensitivity. The most important factor affecting survival is surgical resection. Clearly, the stage at diagnosis is also crucial, but even in more advanced disease, operation can improve survival. It also appears that an increased carcinoembryonic antigen level above normal or a markedly increased alpha-fetoprotein level or both are associated with poor survival. However, whether this is a reflection of tumor size alone, or in fact represents a more aggressive tumor is uncertain and will require further study.
