Ultrasonographic features of hepatocellular pseudotumour in the cirrhotic liver. Eight cases of hepatocellular pseudotumours (HPT) were encountered in 6 years during which time 140 hepatectomies were performed for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). All were found during screening of cirrhotic patients. The ultrasonographic pattern of HPT was similar to that of HCC and their correct diagnosis was impossible by ultrasonography alone. A space-occupying lesion in the cirrhotic liver which is detected by ultrasonography but not by computed tomography and angiography may be a hepatocellular pseudotumour. This diagnosis is particularly likely if the serum alpha-fetoprotein level is normal.
