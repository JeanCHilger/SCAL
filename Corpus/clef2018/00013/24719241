Liver stiffness assessment with tagged MRI of cardiac-induced liver motion in cirrhosis patients. To assess liver stiffness using magnetization-tagged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the cardiac-induced motion in the liver of cirrhosis patients with known Child-Pugh scores.Tagged MRI was performed using a 3T MR scanner on 52 cirrhosis patients classified into two groups: liver cirrhosis with Child-Pugh A (LCA n = 39) and liver cirrhosis with Child-Pugh B or C (LCBCIn control, LCA, and LCBC groups, the MaxDisp was 3.98 ± 0.88 mm, 2.52 ± 0.73 mm, and 1.86 ± 0.77 mm the MaxP1 was 0.10 ± 0.02, 0.04 ± 0.01, and 0.02 ± 0.01This method measures cardiac-induced liver motion and deformation to assess liver stiffness. Significant differences were found in our stiffness measures between control, LCA, and LCBC groups, with more severe disease being associated with greater stiffness.
