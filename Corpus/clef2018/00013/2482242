Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis by alphafetoprotein, ultrasound and fine-needle biopsy. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may be detected at a relatively early stage in patients with liver cirrhosis regularly followed by screening programs using ultrasonography (US) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) measurement. Using both tests in 214 consecutive cirrhotic patients with no clinical signs of liver cancer, we detected HCC in 20 cases (9.4%). The sensitivity of US was greater (85%) than that of AFP (75%), and the combination of the two methods had a sensitivity of 100%. Only 50% of patients with focal liver lesions at US had a final diagnosis of HCC that was obtained in the majority of cases by US-guided fine needle biopsy.
