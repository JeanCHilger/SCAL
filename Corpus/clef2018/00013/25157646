Effects of sustained viral response in patients with HIV and chronic hepatitis C and nonadvanced liver fibrosis. We assessed the effects of sustained viral response (SVR), after treating with interferon-ribavirin (IF-RB), on mortality, liver-related (LR) events (decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma), HIV progression, and liver stiffness in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients with nonadvanced liver fibrosis.From a cohort of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients treated with IF-RB, we selected those with baseline liver fibrosis stages F0, F1, or F2 according to METAVIR. The study started when IF-RB was stopped and ended at death or at the last follow-up visit.A total of 695 patients were included (HCV genotype 1 or 4, 431 F0, 77SVR in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with moderate stages of liver fibrosis is associated with a reduction of mortality and LR events, and with a reduction of progression of HIV and liver fibrosis.
