Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver. Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver is not common. Of the 76 patients who underwent hepatectomy in our hospital from 1986-1988, 4 had inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver. It comprised 5.2% of patients subjected to liver resection during the same period. These 4 patients were misdiagnosed as primary liver cancer and desmoid tumor of the upper abdominal wall by ultrasonography and CT scan before operation. The inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver had long clinical course, less symptoms, and clear capsule, tenacity in nature and no liver cirrhosis on operation. The patients received modified hepatectomy without any postoperative complications. Hepatic resection is the treatment of choice. If contra-indicated, steroid can be used.
