Clinical significance of disorders of hemostasis in children with chronic pneumonia and mucoviscidosis. The results of the clinical observations over 127 patients with mucoviscidosis and chronic (primary and secondary) pneumonia are presented. The children were aged from 1 to 15 years. Study of the plasma and platelet links of hemostasis permitted one to reveal considerable disorders seen during exacerbation in all the groups. The intensity of the disorders correlated well with the gravity of the patient's condition and with the bronchopulmonary process spreading as well as with the presence of complications on the part of the cardiovascular system (cor pulmonale) and the hepatobiliary system (liver cirrhosis). The chronic form of the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) syndrome was diagnosed in 50 percent of the patients with mucoviscidosis, in 1/3 of the patients with secondary and in 18 percent of the patients with primary chronic pneumonia. The subacute form of the DIC syndrome was diagnosed in 15 percent of the patients with mucoviscidosis and in 4.5 percent of the patients with secondary chronic pneumonia. The multimodality treatment without heparin made it possible to correct the hemostatic disturbances in the majority of the patients under observation. In some children with mucoviscidosis and secondary chronic pneumonia, the use of heparin in the form of intravenous injections or ultrasonic inhalations permitted making such a correction more rapidly and more completely.
