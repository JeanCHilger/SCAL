The role of computed tomography in the evaluation of Caroli's disease. Two patients with Caroli's disease are reported who did not have renal abnormalities or hepatic fibrosis. Extra hepatic complications of Caroli's disease in these two patients were best evaluated by computed tomography (CT). Although ultrasound evaluates the ductal abnormalities of Caroli's disease well, it does not delineate subphrenic or subhepatic abscesses, pancreatitis, pancreatic phlegmon, or pseudocysts as well CT.
