Hepatocellular pseudotumour (regenerating nodule) in the cirrhotic liver mimicking hepatocellular carcinoma. During a recent 6-year period we have encountered 10 patients with 'hepatocellular pseudotumour in the cirrhotic liver' (regenerating hyperplastic nodule). The patients were all male, aged 40-82 years. Seven were chronic alcohol consumers. None was positive for HBs-Ag but seven had either anti-HBs or anti-HBc. Serum AFP level ranged from 4 to 28 ng/ml in six patients who did not have hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of the diagnosis of the pseudotumour. The lesions were depicted by ultrasonography in seven, by computed tomography in two, and by angiography in one case. Liver scan was negative in all five cases investigated. The pre-operative diagnosis was definitely or highly suspicious of hepatocellular carcinoma in three, of pseudotumour in the cirrhotic liver in three, and of recurrent carcinoma in one. In another three patients, pseudotumour was coincidentally discovered in resected specimens with hepatocellular carcinoma. The histopathological and follow-up studies demonstrated synchronous or metachronous development of carcinoma in seven patients. Whether or not these lesions in the cirrhotic liver are premalignant remains to be elucidated.
