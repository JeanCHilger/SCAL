Measurement of portal vascular resistance in patients with portal hypertension. Portal vascular resistance was measured percutaneously in 60 patients with chronic liver disease and in 5 control subjects. The portal vascular resistance (PVR) was calculated, using the following equation, from the portal blood flow (QPV), portal venous pressure (PPV), and hepatic venous pressure (PHV): PVR = (PPV - PHV)/QPV. The portal blood flow was measured using an ultrasonic Doppler duplex system, and the portal venous and hepatic venous pressures were measured using percutaneous transhepatic catheterization and venous catheterization, respectively. The wedged hepatic venous pressure was measured by occluding the hepatic venous branch using a balloon catheter. The portal vascular resistance was 0.25 +/- 0.13 mmHg X ml-1 X min X kg body weight (mean +/- SD, n = 5) in the control group, 0.64 +/- 0.29 mmHg X ml-1 X min X kg body wt (n = 13) in the chronic active hepatitis group, 1.34 +/- 0.79 mmHg X ml-1 X min X kg body wt (n = 30) in the cirrhosis group, and 0.85 +/- 0.69 mmHg X ml-1 X min X kg body wt (n = 13) in the idiopathic portal hypertension group.
