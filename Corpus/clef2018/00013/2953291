Current indications of laparoscopy. The authors illustrate the indications of laparoscopy by reporting their clinical experience in a Department of gastroenterology between 1982 and 1984. In addition to the clinical indications which remain valid, new indications of laparoscopy are described in cases of failure of ultrasonography and/or computerised tomography, and of direct opacification of the biliary and pancreatic ducts. Laparoscopy has been practically abandoned in the diagnosis of obstructive jaundice and pancreatic pathology. It is irreplaceable in peritoneal pathology. The role of laparoscopy in hepatic tumours, hepatitis, cirrhosis, certain abdominal emergencies, unexplained abdominal pain and pelvic disease is discussed. Some rare indications may be considered only when the technical possibilities of laparoscopy are understood.
