Morphological M-mode and real-time echocardiographic changes in liver cirrhosis. The morphological echocardiographic parameters were studied in a heterogeneous group of 60 cirrhotics without cardiovascular or pulmonary disease. Enlarged left ventricle (20% of cases) associated with enlarged atrium (15% of cases), enlarged right ventricle (23.3% of cases), left ventricular hypertrophy (10% of cases) and signs of pulmonary hypertension (6.7% of cases) were the most common changes encountered. These were assumed to be due to the hemodynamic changes described in cirrhosis and were related to the decompensation of the liver function and not to the etiology of liver disease, hepatitic activity without decompensation, or age.
