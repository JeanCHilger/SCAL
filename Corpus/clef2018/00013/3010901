Segmental hepatic resection utilizing the ultrasonic dissector. Hepatic resection continues to become a more widely accepted therapeutic modality, with increased use as improved imaging modalities more precisely define the nature and extent of various liver abnormalities. The surgical anatomy of the liver indicates that there are eight segments with single or multiple segmental resections able to be performed. The use of the ultrasonic dissector facilitates the performance of transparenchymatous segmental resection without obtaining vascular inflow or outflow control. This report describes the segmental anatomy of the liver and the use of the ultrasonic dissector. Thirteen patients have undergone segmental hepatic resection with the ultrasonic dissector. Five patients had cirrhosis. Mean +/- 1 SD operative time required for segmental resection was 128 +/- 57 minutes, and blood loss was 830 +/- 623 mL. Utilization of the ultrasonic dissector to perform segmental hepatic resection may increase our versatility in the management of various hepatic and biliary tract diseases.
