Epidemiology of liver cancer in Indonesia. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Indonesia ranks as the 9th most common of cancers. The ratio of male and female in HCC 2.5:1. HCC were found mostly in the 4th to 7th decade of life. HCC is frequently accompanied with cirrhosis and close relationship with HBV. The positivity of HBV marker is 60% in CLD and 67% in HCC.
