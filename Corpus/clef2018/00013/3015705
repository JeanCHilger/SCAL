Surgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis. Value of peroperative ultrasonography. During the past three and half years, 19 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma associated with cirrhosis were operated on. Pain was present in seven patients while 12 were asymptomatic. Alpha foeto-protein was negative in 7 patients. Intraoperative ultrasonography was performed in the last 15 patients. Three right hepatic resections, 5 left hepatic lobectomies and 11 segmentectomies or subsegmentectomies were performed. The operative mortality was 5 p. 100 (one patient). The long term survival in the 3 patients who underwent palliative resection was 6 months.
