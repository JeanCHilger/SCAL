Surgical treatment of small hepatocellular carcinomas in cirrhosis. Over the last five years a policy of systematic screening for small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in patients at risk has led to an increasing number of resections in patients with cirrhosis. Remarkable progress in the surgery of HCC in cirrhosis has been accomplished through: (a) a better understanding of the surgical anatomy of the liver, (b) the definition of new types of liver resection aimed at reducing the amount of parenchyma removed while still being oncologically satisfactory, (c) the reduction of intraoperative blood loss by various techniques of clamping afferent and efferent vessels, (d) the systematic use of intraoperative ultrasonography, and (e) the prevention of postoperative variceal bleeding and the formation of ascites. Results of resection of small HCC in cirrhosis have been quite impressive in Japanese series, with a low operative mortality and above 50% three-year survivals. Results in the West have been somewhat less good. Differences in the pathology of these tumours and particularly in the rate of encapsulation could account for these differences. Clearly, surgical resection has become an established treatment for small HCC in cirrhosis. More information is needed on the results of surgery in operated patients and this should be compared with the natural history of small HCC in cirrhosis in order to better define the patients who will most benefit from these operations and which tests performed at which intervals, are most reliable in screening patients at risk.
