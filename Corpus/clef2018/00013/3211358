Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mimicking clinical picture of Budd-Chiari syndrome. A case of a patient with clinical picture of hepatosplenomegaly, portal hypertension, dilatation of hepatic veins and inferior vena cava, without venous thrombosis or other causes of obstruction of right-sided heart, is described. This picture is compatible with the Budd-Chiari syndrome. Echocardiography has shown a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causing relevant dilatation of both atria and it has allowed us to exclude the presence of a constrictive pericarditis. The hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is first considered as a cardiac cause of cirrhosis mimicking the Budd-Chiari syndrome.
