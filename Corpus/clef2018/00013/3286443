An ultrasonic duplex system facilitates detection of portal hemodynamic changes following selective shunts for esophageal varices. We used an ultrasonic duplex system (US system) to assess portal hemodynamics in 52 patients with liver cirrhosis and esophageal varices, who underwent 2 types of distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS), conventional DSRS (group A, 8 patients) or DSRS with splenopancreatic disconnection (group B, 44 patients). The portal blood flow rate (PBF) was determined in 64 out of 70 patients (91.4%) and the shunt flow rate (SVF) in 39 out of 42 patients (92.9%) who had angiographically confirmed patent portal vein and shunt vein, during the peri- and postoperative period. In group A, a remarkably small amount of postoperative PBF (193 ml/min) and a concomitant increase in SVF (1039 ml/min) were evident. Such ultrasonic findings were compatible with a reduction in portal vein diameter, in accordance with the poor portal perfusion grade of the liver, and a transpancreatic stealing of the portal blood flow to the shunt, as evidenced by postoperative angiography. In contrast, the reduction in PBF was minimal, that is 663 ml/min preoperatively to 562 ml/min at discharge, and 536 ml/min at late follow-up, in group B patients. Significant alterations in portal circulation of the group B patients were not evident angiographically. This US system is most useful to assess portal hemodynamics in patients with a selective shunt.
