Embolization of the splenic artery in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. Ultrasound results and follow-up. Over the last four years the authors performed transcatheter embolization of the splenic artery by Gianturco coils in 32 consecutive cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension, splenomegaly, cytopenia and gastro-esophageal varices endoscopically proved. This procedure was especially useful for treatment of splenomegaly and cytopenia because a constant reduction of spleen dimensions and increase in platelet count were registered. The effectiveness of transcatheter embolization and follow-up are based on clinic, hematologic and sonographic findings. We believe sonographic monitoring to be very useful both to evaluate splenomegaly and signs of portal hypertension and to reveal splenic complications (abscesses). We never registered severe complications.
