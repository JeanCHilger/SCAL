Ultrasonic pseudotumoral aspect of cirrhosis. Seven cases of cirrhosis with non-tumoral nodules on ultrasound imaging are reviewed. Comparison of ultrasound and histopathologic data provided information on mode of formation and pathologic significance of these images. They correspond usually to a particular distribution of fibrosis and steatosis, exceptionally to regenerating nodules. Nodule formations seen on ultrasound images are independent of histopathologic criteria defining micro- and macro-nodular cirrhosis. Ultrasound guided cytohistology is the only examination allowing their distinction from true tumoral lesions.
