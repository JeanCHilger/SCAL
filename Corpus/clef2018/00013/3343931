Independent effects of liver disease and chronic alcoholism on thyroid function and size: the possibility of a toxic effect of alcohol on the thyroid gland. In an autopsy study we found thyroid volume significantly decreased in alcoholics with liver cirrhosis as compared to matched controls: 15 mL (range, 7 to 37 mL) v 25 mL (range, 13 to 90 mL) (P less than .01). At the same time the amount of fibrosis of the thyroid glands was higher in the alcoholics as compared to the matched controls: 20% (range, 6% to 40%) v 12% (range, 6% to 23%) (P less than .01). In order to evaluate the relative importance of alcohol consumption and liver disease on thyroid function and ultrasonically determined size, three groups of patients and matched controls (sex, age, weight, and smoking habits) were investigated: group 1, 18 patients with nonalcoholic liver cirrhosis group 2, 21 consecutive chronic alcoholics (greater than 100 g of alcohol daily for greater than 5 years) without liver cirrhosis (all had biopsy proven fatty change or normal liver)
