Ultrasonically guided percutaneous transhepatic transcholecystocholangiography in the nondilated biliary tree. Five patients with CT or ultrasound-proven nondilated intrahepatic biliary radicles underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous transhepatic transcholecystocholangiography (PTHTCC) for visualization of the biliary tree following failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. In no instance were more than 2 passes of a 22-gauge needle necessary to enter the gallbladder. Visualization of the biliary tree was excellent in all cases, and there were no complications. Therefore, PTHTCC is a safe and reliable method of visualizing the nondilated biliary tree.
