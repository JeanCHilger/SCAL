Resolution of diffuse granulomatous fibrosis of the liver with antituberculous chemotherapy. A 71-yr-old man with pulmonary tuberculosis developed jaundice, and an ultrasound examination suggested hepatolithiasis. The liver was markedly enlarged and of stony consistency. Two 2.5-cm biopsy specimens of the liver each disclosed diffuse fibrosis with giant cells practically no normal parenchyma was seen. Ultrasonography and computed tomography disclosed multiple intrahepatic calcifications, and percutaneous cholangiography revealed stenosis of the right hepatic duct. One year after treatment with antituberculous drugs, liver biopsy specimens taken from the same areas of the liver showed nearly normal histology.
