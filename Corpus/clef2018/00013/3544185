Effects of food intake and various extrinsic hormones on portal blood flow in patients with liver cirrhosis demonstrated by pulsed Doppler with the Octoson. In the fasting state the mean portal blood flow demonstrated by the pulsed Doppler system with the Octoson in liver cirrhosis (LC) patients (velocity (PV), 10.2 +/- 3.5 (mean +/- SD) cm/sec, 7.0 +/- 2.6 cm/sec/m2 flow (PF), 579 +/- 262 ml/min, 383 +/- 184 ml/min/m2 (n = 40)) was significantly lower than that in control subjects (PV, 21.2 +/- 5.2 cm/sec, 14.7 +/- 3.9 cm/sec/m2
