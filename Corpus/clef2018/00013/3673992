The effects of endoscopic sclerotherapy combined with transhepatic variceal obliteration on portal hemodynamics. We studied the effects of endoscopic sclerotherapy with transhepatic variceal obliteration on portal hemodynamics in 20 patients with cirrhosis (six with a spontaneous splenorenal shunt and 14 without it). Portal venous flow 1 month after combined therapy (measured by pulsed Doppler flowmeter) was significantly increased compared with that before therapy (n = 20, 843 +/- 339 vs. 669 +/- 253 ml/min, p less than 0.001). Portal vein catheterization and portal venous flow measurement were repeated 18 months after therapy in eight patients without a splenorenal shunt before therapy and in two patients with a splenorenal shunt before therapy. Two of the former developed a splenorenal shunt. In these 10 patients, portal venous flow before, one month, and 18 months after therapy was 617 +/- 219, 784 +/- 227, and 720 +/- 224 ml/min, respectively, and in 8 of 10 patients the portal venous flow at 18 months remained similar to the values at one month. Portal vein pressures were not significantly elevated 18 months after therapy (35.4 +/- 6.4 vs. 33.6 +/- 5.1 cm H2O) and the mean portal vein pressure change was 2.75 cm H2O (range -6 to +7.5 cm H2O). To summarize, portal venous flow was significantly increased one month after combined sclerotherapy in cirrhotics, the portal venous flow at 18 months remained similar to the values at 1 month in most patients, and the change in portal vein pressure after therapy was small.
