Protean manifestations of pylethrombosis. A review of thirty-four patients. Thirty-four adult patients with portomesenteric venous occlusion (PVO) were reviewed. In 11 with hepatic cirrhosis, PVO was usually heralded by worsening ascites often with varix hemorrhage mortality was high. Four with isolated portal block had varix hemorrhage without ascites. All of these patients survived despite recurrent hematemesis when portal decompression was not feasible in two patients. Eight others (5 agnogenic and 3 with hypercoagulability), experienced sudden abdominal pain with a clot typically propagated into mesenteric tributaries with ileojejunal infarction
