A contribution to early diagnosis of primary hepatic cell carcinoma occurring in patients with liver cirrhosis. In cases where liver cirrhosis can be diagnosed, we must give the occurrence of primary hepatic cell carcinoma careful consideration because most cases of hepatoma are associated with liver cirrhosis. Among 311 patients with liver cirrhosis, in whom the diagnosis was made laparoscopically and histologically in the past 6 years and the clinical course was observed for at least 1 year after initial diagnosis, primary hepatocellular carcinoma developed in 20 patients, in whom alpha-fetoprotein in the serum, sonography and scintigraphy, computed tomography, selective angiography and echo or laparoscopy guided needle biopsy of the liver were utilized regularly after initial diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. Based on our own experience, we wish to stress that the combination of sonography, scintigraphy, computed tomography and selective angiography can contribute to early diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma occurring in patients with liver cirrhosis.
