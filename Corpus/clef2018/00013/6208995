Ultrasonographic and radionuclide detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotics with low alpha-fetoprotein levels. A total of 67 cirrhotic patients with clinically suspected neoplastic degeneration and low alpha-fetoprotein levels were assessed prospectively with ultrasound and gold (198Au) scintigraphy. Ultrasound showed space-occupying lesions in 22 of the 24 patients who had a final diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (sensitivity, 95.8%) and excluded the presence of HCC in 37 of the 43 patients with cirrhosis only (specificity, 86.0% efficiency, 90.8%). Scintigraphy demonstrated a cold defect in 22 of the 24 patients who had a final diagnosis of HCC (sensitivity, 95.8%) and excluded the presence of HCC in 22 of the 43 patients with cirrhosis only (specificity, 51.1%
