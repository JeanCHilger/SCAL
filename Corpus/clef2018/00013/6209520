Ultrasound determination of liver size and assessment of patients with malignant liver disease. The value of ultrasound-measured liver volume in assessing response to therapy in patients with malignant liver disease was determined by the method originally described by Carr, which was modified and validated. Volumes measured in five cadavers by ultrasound and, after removal, by water displacement agreed to within 8% and the wide range of volumes in 20 normal subjects (800-2400 ml) was closely correlated with body weight. In 20 patients with non-malignant diffuse liver disease (cirrhosis or fatty liver) and 33 with malignant liver disease, initial volumes ranged from 1000 to 4900 ml and did not correlate with body weight. Changes in response to therapy in 15 patients with malignant liver disease were monitored by serial measurements with demonstrable changes in volume which, in those with alpha-fetoprotein tumours, were in parallel with changes in serum alpha-fetoprotein levels.
