Ultrasonic diagnosis of liver diseases. The authors analyse the possibilities of ultrasonic diagnosis of the diffuse liver diseases. Sixty normal subjects and 114 patients (50 with chronic hepatitis, 30 with hepatosis, 34 liver cirrhosis) were examined. The authors suggest a new method consisting in the measurement of the "compensation power", i. e. of the energy that is consumed during penetration via hepatic tissues with more energy being consumed the denser the tissue. A significant difference in that parameter was recorded between hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatosis, permitting the differentiation between the illnesses under consideration. Study of the other parameters (the length, width, liver log, the diameter of the vena cava inferior, of the splenic vein and spleen) enables expanding the number of indicators used in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the liver diseases.
