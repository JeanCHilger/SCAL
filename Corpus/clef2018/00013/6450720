Cruveilhier-Baumgarten disease in Japan--on the basis of our own case. The article reports on a patient with Cruveilhier-Baumgarten disease. The anamnesis of the 59-year-old housewife revealed previous anemia, splenomegaly and abnormal liver function 21 years ago. Three years ago, esophageal varices were found. A tortuously distended vein was seen in the falciform ligament at the time of laparoscopy, and this finding was confirmed by angiography and ultrasonography. Esophageal varices and hypersplenism were also noted. Despite these findings, liver biopsy specimens of both lobes showed only slight fibrosis with minimal lymphocyte infiltration in some portal areas, and no evidence of cirrhosis. Patency of the umbilical vein and portal hypertension without significant histologic change of the liver, are both in keeping with the features of this disease. Dilatation of the umbilical vein seemed to be congenital and did not contribute to active blood flow of portal hypertension in this patient. In Japan, development of "caput medusae" in portal hypertension is rather rare, whereas esophageal varices and splenomegaly are more frequent. Venous hum is also seldom found. 14 cases of Cruveilhier-Baumgarten disease and 28 cases of Cruveilhier-Baumgarten syndrome have been reported from Japan in the literature since 1911.
