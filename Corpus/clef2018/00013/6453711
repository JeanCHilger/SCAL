Is the sonographic diagnosis of hepatic cirrhosis and hepatic metastases reliable (author's transl). In a prospective study the reliability of the sonographic diagnosis of hepatic cirrhosis and metastases was investigated in 101 patients. Sonographic diagnoses were checked by laparoscopy. Hepatic cirrhosis was accurately diagnosed in 78% of the cases and hepatic metastases were correctly diagnosed in 92% of cases. The absence of cirrhosis or metastases was correctly recognised in 93% and 98%, respectively. The sonographic diagnosis of liver cirrhosis is based on five criteria: convexity of the ventral surface, caudal margin greater than 45%, rigid contours on palpation diffuse density of the internal structure, and splenomegaly. The most important criterium for the diagnosis of metastases is the presence of circumscribed contour changes. In 32 patients with cirrhosis and in 12 patients with metastases one diagnosis was incorrect. Thus sonography has a high accuracy in the diagnosis of hepatic cirrhosis and metastases.
