Cholangitis and secondary biliary cirrhosis. Biliary obstruction and bacterial infection are the most common cause of cholangitis. By modern diagnostic techniques the biliary tract and the liver can be explored in great detail. Decompression of biliary obstruction may be achieved surgically, endoscopically and via the percutaneous transhepatic route, bacterial infections can be controlled by powerful antibiotics, thus preventing the progress of cholangitis to secondary biliary cirrhosis following decompression of biliary obstruction has been documented. In view of recent diagnostic and therapeutic progress it seems likely that the incidence of secondary biliary cirrhosis will further decline in the future.
