Sonography of infantile polycystic kidney disease. Sonography was performed on five children, ages 1 day-9 years, who had classic infantile polycystic kidney disease and on one child who had glomerulocystic renal disease. Microcystic involvement of the kidneys in infantile polycystic kidney disease results in renal enlargement, increased echogenicity of renal parenchyma but good transmission of sound through the kidney, and poor definition of renal borders on sonograms. The periportal involvement of the liver in the classic infantile polycystic kidney disease may lead to hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension. Less typical features include asymmetric renal enlargement and macrocysts in the renal parenchyma.
