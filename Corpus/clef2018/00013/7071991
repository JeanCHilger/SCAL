Ultrasonic characterisation of diffuse liver disease - the relative importance of frequency content in the A-scan signal. Successful methods of ultrasonic characterisation of alcohol-induced diffuse liver disease using texture analysis (Lerski et al. 1979, 1980a, b) have studied the radiofrequency (RF) A-scan ultrasonic signal. In the present paper the Fourier spectra of such signals have been partitioned and a statistical analysis implemented to determine the diagnostic usefulness of certain frequency groups present in the signal. Although this method has not, of itself, been found to compared favourably with texture analysis it has shown that useful information is present in the high frequency portion of the frequency spectra. This information would not be available if the smoothed and denodulated A-scan signal were studied.
