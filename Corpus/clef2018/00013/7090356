Ultrasonic studies of the abdominal organs. II. Its diagnostic value in liver diseases. Five hundred fifty three patients with diffuse and focal liver processes were examined via ultrasound tomography, with confirmed diagnosis by punch biopsy according to Mengini (23), laparoscopy (437), laparotomy (58), at necropsy (30) and with clinical accurate diagnosis in liver stasis (5). Accurate echographic diagnosis was made in 65.9 per cent of chronic hepatitis (from 88 patients), in 68.9 per cent of liver cirrhosis (from 228 patients), in 81.8 per cent of liver steatosis (from 33 patients). In 71 patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites the accurate diagnosis was made in 89.3 per cent. The coincidence between ultrasound and morphological diagnosis in metastatic liver carcinomas in 80.2 per cent (from 91 patients), in primary--72.2 per cent (from 18 patients) and in echinococcus cysts--96,3 per cent (from 82 patients). Ultrasound tomography has undoubted diagnostic value in diffuse and focal solid and cyst formations of liver in particular. The results obtained, for the proper interpretation, are necessary to be compared with those from the other investigation methods and the clinical data in the process of making the final diagnosis.
