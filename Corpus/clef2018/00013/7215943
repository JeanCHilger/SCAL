Prospective evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of liver ultrasonography. Liver ultrasound was prospectively evaluated in 104 subjects who underwent liver biopsy, including 24 patients without evidence of liver disease (controls), and 80 with a broad spectrum of liver pathology. Ultrasonography was very specific (100%) and moderately sensitive (70%) in the detection of liver pathology, and hepatic neoplasms, steatosis, and fibrosis were detected by ultrasound in 80%, 80%, and 67% of cases respectively. In addition, ultrasonography diagnosed other pathologies--mainly biliary tract disease and abdominal neoplasms--in 26% of the patients.
