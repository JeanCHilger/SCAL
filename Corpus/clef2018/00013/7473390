Hepatosplenic silicosis. A case of hepatosplenic silicosis complicating a pulmonary silicosis is reported. Numerous calcified splenic nodules seen with conventional radiology, ultrasound or computed tomography, hepatic microcalcifications and "egg shell" abdominal lymph nodes best seen with computed tomography represent the radiologic signs. However, hepatosplenic silicosis can only be confirmed by pathological examination of liver biopsies showing birefringent particles within hyalinized nodules.
