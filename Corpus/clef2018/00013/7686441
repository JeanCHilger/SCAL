The male preponderance in incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients may depend on the higher DNA synthetic activity of cirrhotic tissue in men. The relationship between the DNA synthetic activity of hepatocytes from cirrhotic liver tissue and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during a 3-year follow-up period was studied in male and female patients with posthepatitic cirrhosis.The bromodeoxyuridine labeling index (BrdU LI) of hepatocytes was estimated in 38 cirrhotic patients (Child A stage, 23 men and 15 women) using a BrdU/anti-BrdU in vitro method. The incidence of HCC was compared between male and female cirrhotic patients during a 3-year follow-up period.Sixteen of 23 (69.6%) male patients belonged to the high-DNA synthesis group (BrdU LI > or = 1.5%), and only 7 (30.4%) were in the low-DNA synthesis group (BrdU LI < 1.5%). Among female patients, only 5 of 15 (33.3%) were in the high-DNA synthesis group, and 10 of 15 (66.7%) were in the low-DNA synthesis group (P < 0.05). Eleven of 23 (47.8%) male patients and 3 of 15 (20.0%) female patients had HCC develop. In the high-DNA synthesis group, 10 of 16 (62.5%) of the men and 3 of 5 (60.0%) of the women had HCC develop during the follow-up period. In contrast, only one of seven (14.3%) male patients and none of ten (0%) female patients in the low-DNA synthesis group had HCC develop.It was concluded that HCC developed frequently (about 60% of the time within 3 years) in patients of both sexes who were in a high-DNA synthesis group. Thus, the larger proportion of men in the high-DNA synthesis group compared with the number of women in the group (69.6% versus 33.3%) might be one possible reason for the male predominance in the development of HCC in cirrhotic patients.
