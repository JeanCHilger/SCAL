A histological basis for the 'sonographic snowstorm' in opportunistic infection of the liver and spleen. We report 3 cases of opportunistic infection of the liver and spleen due to Pneumocystis carinii, Candida albicans and Aspergillus with an unusual but similar sonographic appearance. In the patient with Pneumocystis we report for the first time this same appearance in the bowel and pleura. Histology showed either extensive fibrosis or focal fibrinous exudates as the underlying cause. Calcification, though present, was scanty and was not thought to be the likely explanation for the appearances.
