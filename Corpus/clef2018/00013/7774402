Portal vein embolization via a fine needle guided by angio-echography: experimental and clinical study. This paper introduced a technique of portal vein embolization by injection of ethanol via fine needle under guidance of angio-echography. First introportal ethanol injection were done in 28 dogs to evaluate its embolic efficacy and safety. The result showed if a dose of injected ethanol was chosen properly, expected embolization could be obtained with slight toxicity to hepatic parenchyma and function. For clinical application, selective portal vein puncture was percutaneous transhepatic under echo guidance. Ultrasound angiography by injecting carbon dioxide (CO2) into portal vein was introduced initially. After confirmed that the injected branch was that supplied the tumor and there was no retrograde overflow of portal blood, ethanol was injected at a dose no more than 10ml. Eighteen patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and underlying liver cirrhosis underwent the procedure preoperatively. Of 14 cases who received hepatectomies, portal vein embolization developed in 12. Since the procedure was guided by angio-echography it could be used for indicated cases with satisfactory embolic effect and not harmful to liver. The procedure had advantages of simple manipulation and made selective embolization easier compared to interventional transcatheter portal vein embolization.
