Follow-up study of hepatic hemangiomas. Hepatic hemangioma is the most common benign tumor of the liver, but there are a few reports on chronological changes in size of hepatic hemangioma. To elucidate natural history of hepatic hemangioma, we evaluated consecutive ultrasonograms of 27 hemangiomas in 23 patients. Underlying liver disease in these 23 patients included seven cases with chronic hepatitis, five cases with liver cirrhosis and three cases with fatty liver. The remaining eight cases showed no evidence of liver disease. Follow-up period ranged 12 to 114 months (average 44). During the follow-up, six (22.2%) hemangiomas changed in size on US, which included three lesions with increase in size, one lesion with decrease in size and two lesions with spontaneous regression. Of 12 patients with chronic liver disease, only one patient showed significant change in the hemangioma size, which regressed spontaneously. These results showed that there was no case showing increase in size of hemangioma in patients with chronic liver disease. Thus, if clinically diagnosed hemangioma which tends to increase in size is detected on US or other imaging modalities in patients with chronic liver disease, aimed aspiration biopsy should be preferably performed considering the possibility of hepatocellular carcinoma.
