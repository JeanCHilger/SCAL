Pregnancy after liver transplantation. Two patients who became pregnant after liver transplantation for end-stage liver disease were carefully monitored using pulsed Doppler waveform measurements. One patient with Wilson's disease, on triple immunosuppressive therapy including prednisone, azathioprine and low-dose cyclosporin A, delivered a healthy girl weighing 2650 g after 38 weeks' gestation. The other patient, with HBV-related postnecrotic cirrhosis, became pregnant less than 3 months postoperatively, under triple therapy, after being amenorrheic for 6 years. Episodes of elevation in liver enzymes were noted, and severe osteoporosis with low back pain developed. A healthy boy weighing 2975 g was born at 35 weeks' gestation. Our cases add to previous reports of successful pregnancies under cyclosporin A immunosuppression.
