Ultrasonography in the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. Ultrasound is now widely used in the diagnosis of liver diseases. Applications of ultrasound in the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis are reviewed in this paper. Characteristic findings of liver cirrhosis in ultrasound are nodular liver surface, round edge, and hypoechoic nodules in liver parenchyma which represent regenerative nodules of cirrhotic liver. Detection of hypoechoic nodule more than 10 mm is important in the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Detection of splenomegaly, ascites, and portosystemic collaterals is possible by ultrasound. Evaluation of portosystemic collaterals is beneficial in the management of esophagogastric varices and portosystemic encephalopathy. Ultrasound is useful in the non-invasive diagnosis and long-term management of cirrhotic patients.
