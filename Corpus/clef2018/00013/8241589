Prevalence of gastroesophageal varices supplied by intrahepatic portal branch. The contribution of the intrahepatic portal branch to the gastroesophageal varices is rare. This anomalous pathway (a large left intrahepatic portal branch) was proved by portographic study and by imaging techniques in a 54-year-old man with cirrhosis. The overall prevalence of this type of collateral in the literature is only 1.9% in 908 patients with portal hypertension. In addition, all are via the left portal venous branch. It may be speculated that the mechanism of this variation is due to dilatation of the rest of the intrahepatic portal system via a small anastomosis due to portal hypertension.
