Foci of Schistosoma mansoni in Assiut province in middle Egypt. Following detection of Schistosoma mansoni in a 12 years old boy who had both schistosomal polyposis and periportal fibrosis with hepatosplenomegaly, epidemiological studies to confirm local transmission were performed in his and 30 other villages in Assiut Governorate, Egypt. The index case's brother and 6 of 380 inhabitants of his village who provided stool specimens were infected with S. mansoni and a farmer with dysentery and hepatosplenomegaly had a positive rectal snip biopsy. All had hepatic abnormalities on ultrasound examination. Two of 221 schoolchildren in another village had mixed infections with S. mansoni and S. haematobium 17 others had only S. haematobium. None of 419 inhabitants living near the infected boys had S. mansoni infection. Snails from canals and drains near both villages were netted, identified, counted and checked for infection: in the second village one of 1039 Bulinus truncatus was infected with Schistosoma sp. but none of 859 Biomphalaria alexandrina was infected. Schistosomiasis mansoni is being focally transmitted in 2 villages in Assiut Governorate and appears to be spreading from Lower to Middle and Upper Egypt. We believe B. alexandrina, which has been present in some of the waterways for at least 15 years, were infected recently by local inhabitants returning from Iraq or by cattle traders or military recruits from the Delta.
