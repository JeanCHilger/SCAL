Assessment of portal hypertension in hepatic cirrhosis in relation to etiologic factors. Hundred-forty-one patients, 78 affected by alcoholic liver cirrhosis and 63 by posthepatitic cirrhosis were studied in order to assess the degree of portal hypertension in liver cirrhosis of different etiology taking into account the developing stages of the disease. Etiological assessment was based on anamnesis, laboratory data, needle liver biopsy and patients of each group were divided into 3 subgroups (grade A, B, C) according to Child-Turcotte classification. A > 1.3 cm diameter of portal vein and a > 13 cm spleen size evaluated by means of real-time ultrasonography together with the occurrence of esophageal varices at endoscopy were considered as signs of portal hypertension. Our study shows that such signs are more frequent in patients affected by posthepatitic cirrhosis in comparison with those affected by alcoholic cirrhosis. If the severity of the disease was considered, at the early stage (grade A) no significant difference was reported in portal diameters while splenomegaly and esophageal varices appeared more frequent in posthepatitic cirrhosis. In grade B patients the increase of portal and spleen size proved significantly greater in posthepatitic cirrhosis whereas prevalence of esophageal varices was similar in the two groups. The lack of differences in the three considered parameters at the end stage of the disease may be due to severe changes in liver morphology actually similar in the 2 groups apart from etiological factors.
