Refractory hypoxemia during liver cirrhosis. Hepatopulmonary syndrome or "primary" pulmonary hypertension? We report an uncommon mechanism of severe hypoxemia in two cirrhotic patients under long-term beta-blocker therapy. Our patients presented with profound hypoxemia refractory to oxygen therapy, normal lung radiography and pulmonary function tests, and evidence of right-to-left anatomic shunt. Although these features are highly suggestive of hepatopulmonary syndrome, pulmonary hypertension was present, and a right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale was demonstrated by contrast-enhanced echocardiography. No cause of pulmonary hypertension other than portal hypertension was identified. Pulmonary hypertension and intracardiac right-to-left shunt eventually regressed after discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy. We conclude that "primary" pulmonary hypertension associated with portal hypertension may because of severe hypoxemia during liver cirrhosis. Differential diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome relies upon contrast-enhanced echocardiography and may be of critical importance because of possible therapeutic implications.
