A case of hepatocellular carcinoma responding to oral administration of UFT. A 77-year-old male with liver cirrhosis was admitted to our hospital for further examination and treatment of liver tumor. A tumor, which was in the S5 of liver and 7.2 cm in diameter, was revealed by ultrasonography, CT scan and MRI. The titers of serum AFP and PIVKA-II were 600 ng/ml and 3.5 AU/ml, respectively. According to the findings of imaging diagnosis and laboratory data, the patient was diagnosed as having hepatocellular carcinoma. He was treated by the oral administration of UFT (300 mg/day). Ultrasonically guided aspiration biopsy of the tumor and CT scan, which were performed ten and fourteen months after the beginning of administration of UFT, respectively, revealed the necrosis of the tumor. Twelve months later, the tumor size reduced to 1.4 cm in diameter, and the titer of PIVKA-II was reduced to the normal range. This case shows the clinical effectiveness of oral administration of UFT.
