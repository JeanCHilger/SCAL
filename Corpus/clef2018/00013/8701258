Role of hepatotropic viruses in liver pathology in Southwestern Cameroon. Between 1990 and 1992 (2 years), 102 patients with clinical liver pathology underwent standardized clinical, pathological, sonographic and serologic investigations (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV autoantibodies and tumor markers). During the same period seroepidemiological studies with the same parameters as above were performed on the following control groups: healthy pregnant women (n = 383), blood donors (n = 85), HIV-positive individuals (n = 93), and hospitalized patients in all age groups with minor ailments unrelated to liver pathology (n = 108). The results are discussed in detail. Virtually all adults had HAV infection. HBV and HCV infection appears to play a major role in chronic liver pathology in southern Cameroon. The two infections frequently occur together (over 40% of liver cases) and correlate significantly with liver cirrhosis. The marked prevalence of HBV and HCV markers in healthy pregnant women is of epidemiological concern due to the potential for vertical transmission of the infection (immunization). Endemic infections such as falciparum malaria are probably responsible for unspecific stimulation of the immune system, which is reflected in a generally marked prevalence of autoimmune markers in liver patients and controls, since histologically there was no evidence of autoimmune liver disease.
