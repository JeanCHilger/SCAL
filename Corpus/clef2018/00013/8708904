'Triangular cord': a sonographic finding applicable in the diagnosis of biliary atresia. Biliary atresia (BA) is characterized by luminal obstruction of the extrahepatic bile duct with fibrous remnants. The authors reviewed ultrasonographic examinations of the fibrous tissue in the bifurcation of the portal vein at the porta hepatis and identified the triangular- or tubular-shaped echogenic density, the so-called "triangular cord" (TC), in the vicinity of the portal vein on a transverse or longitudinal scan. In this prospective study, the authors investigated whether TC was useful in the noninvasive diagnosis of biliary atresia in 18 infants who had persistent neonatal jaundice. This was done by comparing the ultrasonographic examination with the histopathologic examination (HPE) of liver specimens obtained from a needle biopsy. The TC was identified in nine patients, all of whom were confirmed to have BA by HPE. The TC was not observed in the other nine patients, who had neonatal hepatitis (NH). The mean size of the TC was 13 mm (wide) x 6 mm (thick) (width range, 5 to 21 mm thickness range, 4 to 12 mm). The diagnosis of BA was confirmed at the time of Kasai hepatoportojejunostomy in eight of the nine patients whose TC was noted by ultrasonography (US). The other patient was discharged because his parents refused the operation
