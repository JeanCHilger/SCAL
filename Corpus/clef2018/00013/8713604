The Queixadinha Project: morbidity and control of schistosomiasis in an endemic area in the northeast of Minas Gerais, Brazil. In an endemic area for schistosomiasis in the northeast of the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil 516 individuals have been submitted to clinical and laboratory examination, ultrasonography of the abdomen and dopplerecocardiography in order to define the morbidity of schistosomiasis before and after treatment. A high prevalence of schistosomiasis (66.3%) and of severe disease (9.5% with palpable spleens) were recorded. Ultrasonography classified liver periportal fibrosis as light (19.4%), moderate (27.6%) and intense (6.8%), and 46.0% presented no periportal fibrosis. Twenty one out of the 53 individuals (39.6%) with palpable spleens did not present liver fibrosis on ultrasound. Periportal lymph nodes were described in 33.8% of the population and anti-KLH antibodies were found in the serum of 40.7%. Urinary alterations compatible with the glomerulopathy of schistosomiasis were observed in 4.5% of the population, and 11.7% of the individuals examined by dopplerecocardiography had pulmonary hypertension. Twelve months after treatment for schistosomiasis the prevalence of the disease dropped from 66.3% to 25.0%. In Queixadinha, a profile of the morbidity of schistosomiasis has just been established.
