Differential diagnosis of liver disease by means of sonography: correlation with scintigraphy and angiography (author's transl). The value of sonography of the liver is assessed and compared with angiography and scintigraphy on the basis of case material from 102 patients, representing localized and diffuse liver processes. The diagnostic accuracy depends on the characteristic acoustic impedance differences in the examined tissue. Diffuse liver disease and processes without clearly defined acoustic borderlines may cause diagnostic difficulties and differentiation can only be attempted by additional clinical information. Defined tumours represent the main field of application. The combined use of ultrasound, scintigraphy and angiography permits a correct diagnosis to be made in nearly 90% of cases. Differential diagnosis between cystic and solid processes is possible only by ultrasound.
