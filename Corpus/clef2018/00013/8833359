Left ventricular diastolic function in liver cirrhosis. Left ventricular systolic abnormalities have been reported in liver cirrhosis (LC). Diastolic function in cirrhotics, on the contrary, does not seem to have been studied so far.Diastolic function was evaluated in 42 cirrhotic patients and in 16 controls by means of Doppler echocardiography.Compared with the controls, cirrhotics had increased left ventricular end-diastolic and left atrial volume, stroke volume, late diastolic flow velocity (peak A) (71 + or - 17 cm/sec versus 56 +/- 18 p <0.01), time from onset of mitral inflow to the early peak (time E) (86 + or - 11 msec versus 72 +/- 14The impaired left ventricular relaxation in the presence of high stroke volume suggests a myocardial involvement in LC. The pseudo normalization of the E/A ratio and DT in patients with tense ascites could reflect loading conditions masking the relaxation abnormality.
