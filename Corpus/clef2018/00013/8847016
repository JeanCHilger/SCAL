Hemodynamic analysis of findings in patients with portal hypertension: multicenter analysis in Japan. Japan Portal Hypertension Study Group. A multicenter study was done to assess the pathophysiology of malcirculation with portal hypertension.Patients were admitted to 48 different institutes from 1990 to 1992.Portal venous pressure was 345.9 +/- 72.1 mmH2O in patients with portal hypertension. In patients with liver cirrhosis, the diameter of the splenic artery, of the proper hepatic artery, of the left gastric artery and of the splenic vein was significantly larger (p<0.05) than seen in the controls without portal hypertension. In patients with idiopathic portal hypertension, the diameter of the splenic artery and of the vein was significantly larger (p<0.05) and that of the proper hepatic artery was significantly smaller (p<0.05) than seen in the cirrhotic patients. In the cirrhotic patients, blood flow volume was significantly larger (p<0.05) in the splenic vein. In patient with idiopathic portal hypertension, blood flow volume in the portal vein and splenic vein were significantly larger (p<0.05) and that of superior mesenteric vein showed an increasing tendency to enlarge.This study shows that a hyperdynamic state is present in patient with portal hypertension.
