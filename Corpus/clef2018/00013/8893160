Characteristics of anti-HCV antibody-positive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma on chronic hemodialysis: recommendation of periodic ultrasonography for early detection. We analyzed 10 patients (male:female 9:1, mean age 64.2 years) who developed hepatocellular carcinoma during the observation period of 2 years among 2,164 chronic hemodialysis patients in 23 dialysis centers. Among them, 409 patients were positive for serum anti-HCV antibodies (19%). They were all positive for serum anti-HCV antibodies but negative for HBs antigen. None of the anti-HCV antibody-negative patients developed hepatocellular carcinoma during this period. Although liver function tests of the patients were almost normal, pathological examination of the liver revealed chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis. Periodic ultrasonographic examination is necessary for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hemodialysis patients with positive anti-HCV antibodies even if liver function tests are within normal ranges.
