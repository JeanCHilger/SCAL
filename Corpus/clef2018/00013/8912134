Case report: development of hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with chronic hepatitis C infection after a complete and sustained response to interferon-alpha. A 60-year-old man with a chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and histological features of chronic active hepatitis was treated with interferon-alpha (IFN). He successfully responded to IFN with normalization of serum ALT and disappearance of serum HCV-RNA. His liver biochemistry profile remained normal and serum HCV-RNA was not detected throughout the entire follow-up period. One year later, a small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was detected by routine ultrasonographic screening. Laparotomy revealed a small tumour with no metastasis and the non-tumorous liver demonstrated macronodular cirrhosis. Although no space-occupying lesions were detected by frequent radiological examinations prior to IFN therapy, the small size of the tumour suggested de novo development of HCC. Patients with chronic HCV infection, including those who have complete responses to IFN and lack clinical and histological evidence of cirrhosis, should be followed up for the potential development of HCC.
