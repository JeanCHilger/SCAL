Ascites and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Report of 54 cases. We identified 54 patients with AIDS and ascites seen over a 4.5-year period at a university hospital. This retrospective study is the largest reported series of patients with AIDS and ascites. Patients with AIDS who are evaluated for ascites should be stratified by the CD4 + cell count and the presence or absence of portal hypertension based upon the serum-ascites albumin gradient and clinical presentation. Awareness of possible surgery-related causes of ascites is crucial, as these patients may not manifest the usual signs and symptoms of peritonitis or abdominal catastrophes seen in immunocompetent hosts. Patients with evidence of portal hypertension due to hepatic cirrhosis and an elevated ascitic neutrophil count should be suspected to be infected with common bacterial pathogens associated with peritonitis unless the CD4 + cell count is below 50 cells/mm3. When the CD4 + cell count declines below this threshold, infections due to Mycobacterium avium complex, cytomegalovirus, and other opportunistic infections should be considered.
