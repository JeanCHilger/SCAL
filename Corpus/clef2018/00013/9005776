Intrahepatic dilation of the bile ducts. Particularity of a clinical case. We report the case of a 71 years old male patient with a "simple" form of Caroli's syndrome. The "simple" form is less common than the form associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis. In this case the intrahepatic bile duct dilatation was confined to the segments V and VI, and intrahepatic lithiasis and cholelithiasis were associated. Usually, Caroli's syndrome remains asymptomatic for the first 20 years of the patient's life, sometimes longer, and in few cases for the patient's whole life. "Simple" asymptomatic Caroli's syndrome is generally unrecognized and in our own case it was an intraoperative finding. Patient's age, the presence of a hepatitis C and the absence of malignant changes discouraged us from performing a right hepatectomy and then a Roux-en-Y intrahepatic bile duct jejunal anastomosis was done. One year after the operation the patient is leading a normal life, and he is symptom-free.
