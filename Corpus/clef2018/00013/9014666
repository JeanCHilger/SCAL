One hundred and fifty hepatic resections: evolution of technique towards bloodless surgery. A technique of hepatic resection is described and the results of 150 resections are reviewed. Hepatic transection was performed, under intermittent portal inflow occlusion, using ultrasonic aspiration to skeletonize portal branches and venous tributaries. Control of venous haemorrhage during resection was optimized by argon beam coagulation and lowering central venous pressure to between 0 and 4 cmH2O by extradural blockade and systemic nitroglycerine infusion. One patient with jaundice died in hospital, giving a mortality rate of 0.7 per cent. There were no deaths in patients without jaundice and cirrhosis. Fifteen patients (10.0 per cent) had significant complications, nine medical and six surgical, including three bile leaks (2.0 per cent). Mean blood loss was 814 ml for the whole study but only 434 ml in the last 4 years. During this latter period mean blood transfusion in hospital was 0.5 units and mean postoperative haemoglobin value fell by 0.7 g per 100 ml. Hepatic resection can be performed with the same degree of confidence and similar low morbidity as any other major surgical procedure.
