Hepatocellular carcinoma with sarcomatous change arising in primary biliary cirrhosis. We report an autopsy case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with sarcomatous change arising in the context of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) in a 79-year-old man. Primary biliary cirrhosis was diagnosed (stage I according to Scheuer's classification) by findings on blood biochemical analysis, laparoscopy, and liver biopsy at age 69 years. Five years later, (at age 74 years), a mass lesion was detected in the S6 region of the liver by abdominal ultrasonography, and target biopsy revealed well differentiated HCC. Blood biochemistry, ultrasonography, and computed tomography findings showed that the PBC had progressed to stage IV (cirrhotic stage). Percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (PEIT) was administered to the HCC several times over a 5-year period however, the patient died of liver failure in February, 1994 (at age 79 years). Viral markers for hepatitis B and C were negative during the course, and hepatitis C virus RNA was not detected by polymerase chain reaction. Autopsy findings showed liver cirrhosis and diffuse involvement of spindle-shaped sarcomatoid cells in the liver, particularly in the S6 region, associated with several nodules of trabecular HCC cells. A zone of transition between the sarcomatoid cells and the trabecular hepatocellular carcinoma cells was observed. The sarcomatoid cells were diffusely disseminated in the peritoneal cavity and had metastasized to multiple organs. Immunohistochemically, the cells were positive for fibrinogen, as were the coexisting trabecular hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The HCC had been treated several times with PEIT. Of interest, PEIT may be an important factor in this type of tumor progression.
