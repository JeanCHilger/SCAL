Bone demineralization in cystic fibrosis: evidence of imbalance between bone formation and degradation. Bone turnover, collagen metabolism, and bone mineral status were investigated in 59 patients with cystic fibrosis and in 72 sex and age-matched control subjects. In all patients and control subjects serum concentrations of osteocalcin (OC), carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP), amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP), and cross-linked carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP), and urinary values of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX), as well as total body bone mineral content (TBBM) were measured. Higher ICTP (microgram/L) and NTX (bone collagen equivalent/urinary creatinine (nmol/mmol) values were found in pre-pubertal, pubertal, and young adult patients than in control subjects (ICTP: 15.4 +/- 2.1 and 13.2 +/- 1.8, p < 0.001 23.3 +/- 5.3 and 20.1 +/- 4.1, p < 0.02
