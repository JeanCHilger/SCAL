Serum alanine aminotransferase activity in obese children. To confirm the significance of the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test for the diagnosis of fatty liver and to clarify the relationship between serum ALT activity and the duration of obesity, we analysed 310 obese young school children (195M, 115F), who were classified into three duration groups (1-3 y, 4-6 y, 7 + y), three age groups (6-7 y, 8-9 y, 10-11 y), and four obesity groups (weight excess: mild, 20-29% moderate, 30-39%
