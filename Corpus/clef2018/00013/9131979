Prenatal diagnosis of biliary atresia associated with choledochal cyst. We report a case of biliary atresia promptly detected by its association with a choledochal cyst, prenatally diagnosed at 20 weeks' gestation. The baby was operated at 14 days of life. A choledochal cyst was found and fibrosis of the extrahepatic bile ducts was also noted. So, excision of the choledochal cyst and a Roux-en-Y porto-jejunostomy was done. Nine months later, despite an appropriate biliary drainage, echographic and histological changes compatible with liver cirrhosis have been detected. Including this one, six cases have been reported.
