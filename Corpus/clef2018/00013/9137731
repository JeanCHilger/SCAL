Chronic constrictive pericarditis apropos of 3 cases disclosed by refractory cardiac failure. Chronic constrictive pericarditis is a difficult diagnosis and may present atypically. The authors report three clinical cases and review the diagnostic strategy of constrictive pericarditis. In these three patients, the diagnosis was finally made after one or more years of symptomatic disease and after several diagnostic work ups and ineffective treatments. In cardiac failure, pericardial calcification is often not observed on chest X-ray and Doppler echocardiography is usually the diagnostic investigation. Adiastole presents with dilatation of the vena cava and atria, contrasting with normal ventricles without major valvular disease. Doppler echocardiography enables distinction of constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy: normal myocardium, thickened pericardium, specific septal motion, inspiratory increase in right ventricular dimensions, premature opening of the pulmonary valve, important variations in ventricular filling with respiration, expiratory diastolic reflux in the hepatic veins. Catheterisation confirms adiastole and may suggest a pericardial aetiology in characteristic cases, associated with only mild increases in pulmonary artery pressure. If need be, the pericardial thickening > 4 mm may be observed with magnetic nuclear resonance imaging and, when a doubt remains with respect to the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, the absence of fibrosis on endomyocardial biopsy provides the diagnosis and indication for curative surgery: pericardectomy.
