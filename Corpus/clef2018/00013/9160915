Intraoperative evaluation of small-calibre arterial reconstructions. A new hammerhead-shaped, small probe for intraoperative duplex ultrasound was devised to evaluate small-calibre arterial reconstructions. This probe was used in two patients one with terminal liver cirrhosis who had a left hepatic lobe that had been transplanted from her mother, and a second patient with limb-threatening ischaemia who had undergone arterial reconstructions. The technique was diagnostically useful and contributed to successful clinical outcomes.
