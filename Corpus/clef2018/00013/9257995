Helicobacter pylori among Egyptian patients with chronic liver diseases. A comparative study. The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in Egyptian patients with different stages of liver diseases was compared to those with normal liver status. Eighty patients subjected to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were enrolled. They were divided according to their liver status into two groups the first patients with liver cirrhosis and the second who had no liver affection. Gall bladder diseases were excluded by abdominal ultrasound examinations. Endoscopic antral mucosal biopsies were used for H. pylori screening by both culture and urease test, and for histopathological examinations. Both groups were matched as regards age, sex, and socioeconomic conditions. Culture was positive in 42.2% and 40.7% of patients in both groups respectively (P > 0.05). Urease test showed positive results in 58% and 76.6% in both groups respectively (P > 0.05). Helicobacter pylori prevalence showed no significant differences between both studied groups as regards age, sex, or type of gastric lesions. Furthermore, liver status in patients with chronic liver diseases does not play a role in distribution of infection. The study shows the high prevalence of H. pylori among Egyptians and the absence of a relation between H. pylori and chronic liver diseases.
