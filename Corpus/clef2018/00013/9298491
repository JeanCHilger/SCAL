Unusual spontaneous hepatic vein to paraumbilical vein shunt in a patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome and cirrhosis: a case report. A very unusual portosystemic shunt was identified using color flow Doppler sonography in an adult male with Budd-Chiari syndrome and cirrhosis secondary to a hypercoagulability state. Hepatofugal blood flow was demonstrated between the middle hepatic vein and a recanalized paraumbilical vein, resulting clinically in prominent periumbilical veins. The clinical and radiological features are described.
