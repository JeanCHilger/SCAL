Biliary cirrhosis secondary to obstruction of the common bile duct by ectopic pancreas in a cow. A 10-year-old Japanese Black cow showed icterus with gradual emaciation for a period of 3 months. Ultrasonography demonstrated increased "echogenicity" of the entire liver, with marked dilatation of the gall-bladder. At necropsy, the common bile duct was found to be obstructed by focally thickened fibrous tissue adjacent to a flesh-like mass (9 x 4 x 4 mm) attached to the wall of the duct. The mass consisted of normal pancreatic tissue. The liver showed moderate fibrosis, with nodular regeneration of the hepatic tissue and bile duct hyperplasia. A diagnosis of biliary cirrhosis secondary to ectopic pancreas in the common bile duct was made.
