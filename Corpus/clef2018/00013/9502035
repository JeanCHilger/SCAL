Doppler study of fasting and postprandial resistance indices in the superior mesenteric artery in healthy subjects and patients with cirrhosis. We assessed the resistance index (RI) in the superior mesenteric artery under fasting and postprandial conditions in healthy subjects and in patients with cirrhosis to determine whether the amount of change in the RI reflects the presence or severity of liver dysfunction.Fifteen subjects with normal livers and 27 patients with cirrhosis underwent Doppler sonography of the superior mesenteric artery before and after ingesting a standard meal. The RI at baseline (fasting state) and the postprandial RI were compared between the 2 groups. The fasting RIs and post postprandial RIs changes in cirrhotic patients were correlated with the severity of disease.No difference was found between the baseline RIs in healthy (RI = 0.85) and cirrhotic subjects (RI = 0.84), nor was there a difference in baseline RIs between subgroups of cirrhotic patients according to the severity of liver disease. The RI decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after the meal in both the healthy (13%) and cirrhotic (8%) subjects, but the postprandial decrease was significantly less pronounced (p < 0.05) in cirrhotic patients than in healthy subjects. Among cirrhotic patients, there was no correlation between the postprandial decrease of the RI and severity of liver disease.The marked decrease in the postprandial RI in the SMA in healthy subjects is generally not seen in patients with cirrhosis, and changes in the postprandial RI do not reliably predict the severity of liver dysfunction.
