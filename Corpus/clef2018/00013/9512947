Effect of dopamine on portal blood flow in cirrhotic patients. The effects of dopamine infusion on portal blood flow were examined in 12 cirrhotic patients (seven men, five women) in a Child-B group.Dopamine was administered as an intravenous infusion (2 micrograms kg-1 min-1).At 0, 30 and 60 min, portal blood flow, left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions were evaluated using the pulsed doppler method. No significant difference was found between heart rate, blood pressure and parameters demonstrating left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions before and after dopamine infusions. Portal blood flow decreased significantly at 30 and 60 min. Portal blood flow fell from 1802 +/- 88 to 1339 +/- 50 ml min-1 (P < 0.001) at 30 min and to 1121 +/- 60 ml min-1 (P < 0.001) at 60 min.The reducing effects of dopamine on portal blood flow in cirrhotic patients were demonstrated by the pulsed doppler method, which is a noninvasive test.
