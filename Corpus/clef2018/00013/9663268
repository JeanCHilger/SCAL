Small bowel varices: report of two cases. Two cases of small bowel (S-B) varices associated with portal hypertension, one with liver cirrhosis and one with portal thrombus, are reported. Detection of S-B varices has been a challenging task and several invasive diagnostic techniques have been used for this purpose. However, in our cases, color Doppler sonography revealed the S-B varices supplied by the superior mesenteric vein and draining to the iliac (one case) or ovarian vein (other case), which helped to establish an early appropriate diagnostic and treatment plan.
