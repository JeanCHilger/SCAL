Severe ischemic-type biliary strictures due to hepatic artery occlusion seven years after liver transplantation--a rare cause of late cholestatic graft failure. Although ischemic cholangitis is an important cause of early cholestatic graft failure in hepatic allografts, it rarely leads to biliary tract abnormalities in the late postoperative period. We describe a 54-year-old woman who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation for alcoholic liver cirrhosis in 1988 and presented in April of 1995 with malaise, jaundice, dark urine, clay-colored stools and cholestasis. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography demonstrated a rapid progressive sclerosing cholangitis. Liver biopsy findings showed mild portal hepatitis, specimens were non-diagnostic with regard to cholangitis, and no infection was found. Duplex ultrasonography suggested obstruction of hepatic artery blood flow and celiac arteriogram confirmed complete hepatic arterial occlusion. Progressive destruction and irregular stricturing and dilatation of the intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree, complicating ascending infectious cholangitis, progressive cholestatic jaundice and insufficient endoscopic biliary drainage made a hepatic retransplantation in 1995 mandatory. Ischemic cholangitis is an important cause of cholestatic graft failure, but this type of cholangitis is difficult to diagnose because of its misleading biopsy manifestations. We conclude that liver transplant recipients who exhibit nonanastomotic strictures on cholangiography should be evaluated for occlusion of the hepatic artery as a possible cause.
