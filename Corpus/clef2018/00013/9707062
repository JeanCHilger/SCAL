Effects of endoscopic variceal ligation on oxygen transport and the arterial lactate levels in patients with cirrhosis. Despite the increased cardiac output and oxygen delivery, an impaired oxygen uptake has been noted in patients with cirrhosis. We recently observed that endoscopic variceal ligation decreased the cardiac output due to a reduction in the cardiac preload. It is thus possible that a variceal ligation decreases the oxygen delivery and thereby negatively influences tissue oxygenation in patients receiving such treatment. We thus investigated the effects of variceal ligation on oxygen delivery, oxygen uptake, and the arterial lactate levels.There were 22 patients with compensated cirrhosis and risky esophageal varices (Child's class A:B=13:9). Twelve patients underwent an endoscopic variceal ligation and 10 patients received gastroscopy as a control. The cardiac function, blood gas status, oxygen delivery, and arterial lactate concentration were also assessed before and after variceal ligation. The oxygen uptake was calculated by the Fick equation.Following variceal ligation, there was an immediate decrease in the cardiac output and oxygen delivery. The reduction in oxygen delivery was associated with a slight but significant increase in the arterial lactate concentration. The decreased oxygen delivery was also associated with a concomitant decrease in the oxygen uptake. In the control subjects, gastroscopy did not alter the systemic hemodynamics, arterial oxygen status, or arterial lactate levels.We found a significant decrease in the oxygen delivery in patients undergoing an endoscopic variceal ligation. Such deteriorated tissue oxygenation may be serious especially in patients with a low oxygen transport ability such as in patients with variceal hemorrhage with anemia. However, the clinical significance of these changes remains unclear and further studies are therefore warranted.
