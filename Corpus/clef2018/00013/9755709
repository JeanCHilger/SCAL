Colour Doppler imaging of shunts from the left portal branch in portal hypertension. Description of a typical pattern. To describe the typical colour Doppler appearance of a shunt through the parenchyma of the left lobe of the liver in portal hypertension.Ultrasound images of 141 patients with biopsy-verified cirrhosis were reviewed. Special note was taken of the appearance of shunts from the left portal branch.In 28 patients, shunts from the left portal branch were detected ultrasonographically, 10 of which ran through the liver parenchyma on a course separated from the ligamentum teres. Seven of these 10 followed a tortuous course just below the surface of the liver creating a ball or corkscrew-like pattern.Shunts from the left portal branch are not uncommon and may represent the only ultrasonographically detectable pathology in these patients. Recognition of the typical pattern will facilitate their detection.
