Serum concentrations of sICAM-1, sE-, sP- and sL-selectins in patients with Schistosoma mansoni infection and association with disease severity. Increased serum concentrations of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1, CD54) and of soluble E- (CD62E), but not soluble P- (CD62P) and L- (CD62 L) selectins, were detected in Malagasy patients living in an hyperendemic focus of Schistosoma mansoni. Levels of sICAM-1 remained elevated for several months after treatment with praziquantel. Serum levels of ICAM-1, but not of other markers, were significantly correlated with the disease severity, as indicated by ultrasonographical data, and with some circulating fibrosis markers (at least hyaluronic acid). sICAM-1 level may reflect endothelial inflammatory reactions, probably harmful, in the liver and may be useful for monitoring morbidity evolution in schistosomiasis mansoni.
