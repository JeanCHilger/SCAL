Hepatocellular carcinoma: clinical and epidemiological characteristics. We present 12 patients with CHC, 11 men and one woman, median age, 59.9 +/- 10.1 cared for in two hospitals from La Plata city. The median age, the predominance of men and presence of cirrhosis in the 75% are similar findings to European 41% of the patients, consulted of the CHC has increased in our environment. The fact that all the patients have been symptomatic at the moment of the consultation, that one of them had normal liver function tests and that only two of them had nodule of less than 5 cm of diameter, suggest advanced stage of the disease. At the same time, the median of survival of 8.3 +/- 9 (DS) months post-diagnosis and of 3.6 +/- 8 (DS) months post surgery. 90.9% had a risk factor to undergo CHC (alcohol, HBC, HCV). Because of one patient, the risk of hemodyalizer patients to have CHC is emphasized. Therefore, it is important to prevent and treat viral infections. In this study, the diagnosis of the echography was of 100% and the histologic corroboration was done by percutaneous biopsy with ultrasound or TC assessment. We observed that the levels of alpha-fetoprotein had a weak, negative correlation, not significative, with the diameters of the nodules. Although it is true that the size of the sample and the retrospective character of the investigation inhibits us to draw definitive conclusions, the behaviour of alfafetoprotein creates doubts about its value in the diagnosis and screening of the CHC.
