Diagnosis of liver cirrhosis in children based on colour Doppler ultrasonography with histopathological correlation. Changes in hepatic architecture in cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis affect liver vascular haemodynamics.To determine the criteria for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis using Doppler US.Twenty-two children with liver disease of unknown histology were prospectively examined and compared with eight normal children. Doppler US of portal vein velocity, arterio-portal velocity ratio, loss of reverse flow component in the hepatic vein and hepatic artery visualisation were examined prior to liver biopsy. Doppler results were compared with histological activity indices. Twelve patients had cirrhosis and ten had chronic active hepatitis.The most sensitive method (83%) for the assessment of cirrhosis was portal vein velocity less than 20 cm/sec. Arterio-portal velocity ratio (greater than 3) and hepatic artery visualisation were less sensitive (75% and 33% respectively) but specificity was 100% for all three methods. When these three methods were evaluated together, sensitivity increased to 91% and accuracy to 96%. Loss of reverse flow component was less specific (77%) but was sensitive (75%).Portal vein velocity, arterio-portal vein ratio and hepatic artery visualisation together were reliable in diagnosis of cirrhosis in the paediatric age group.
