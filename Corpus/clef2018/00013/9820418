Detection of diaphragmatic defect as the cause of severe hepatic hydrothorax with magnetic resonance imaging. Severe right-sided hepatic hydrothorax occurred in an 83-yr-old Japanese woman with a 7-yr history of cryptogenic liver cirrhosis. Transdiaphragmatic communication was indirectly suggested by rapid migration of dye (indocyanine green) from the peritoneal to the pleural space. Magnetic resonance imaging studies also demonstrated a diaphragmatic defect as a characteristic hypointense jet flow across the diaphragm on both T1- and T2-weighted sagittal scans. Although no firm treatment for hepatic hydrothorax has been established and direct demonstration of diaphragmatic defect with noninvasive imaging is extremely rare, testing for diaphragmatic integrity is meaningful to provide a radical or less invasive treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging, as well as color Doppler ultrasonography, may be useful for the detection of diaphragmatic defects as the cause of hepatic hydrothorax.
