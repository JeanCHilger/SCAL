Splenic artery aneurysm and orthotopic liver transplantation. Splenic artery aneurysms are a rare but potentially fatal complication after liver transplantation. We report three cases presenting in a 12-month period in adult patients who underwent transplantation for chronic liver disease. Doppler ultrasound of the splenic artery should be performed in all patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension who are being assessed for liver transplantation. The aneurysm can be ligated at the time of transplantation.
