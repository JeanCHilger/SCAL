Successful surgical treatment for implanted intraperitoneal metastases of ruptured small hepatocellular carcinoma: report of a case. We report herein the case of a 53-year-old man with disseminated intraperitoneal metastases caused by the rupture of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He was admitted to our hospital in shock after suffering a trauma injury to the upper abdomen. Ultrasonography revealed a massive hemoperitoneum. At surgery, 4000 ml of blood was drained from the abdominal cavity and a ruptured tumor, 2 cm in diameter, was found in the right lobe of the liver. The tumor was resected with an adequate surgical margin and subsequent microscopic examination confirmed a diagnosis of moderately differentiated HCC without associated liver cirrhosis. The patient was readmitted 14 months later following the development of right lower quadrant pain. Ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed extrahepatic abdominal tumors, and abdominal angiography demonstrated four intraperitoneal tumors. At surgery, four implanted metastases adhered to the greater omentum were found and resected. No other tumors were detected. Microscopically, all four tumors were confirmed as moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Ruptured HCC may lead to implanted intraperitoneal metastasis, but rupture of small HCC is very rare. While hepatic resection is the treatment of choice for ruptured HCC, according to our review of the literature, only a few patients have survived long-term after resection of implanted metastasis.
