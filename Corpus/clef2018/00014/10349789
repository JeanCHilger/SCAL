Sinusoidal portal hypertension secondary to nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. Regenerative hepatic nodular hyperplasia is infrequent and generally appears in association with many other diseases, the most frequent being the Felty syndrome. It may cause portal hypertension and variceal bleeding. A histologic study is necessary for diagnosis since certain biologic data and the nodular appearance of the hepatic surface may be confused with hepatic cirrhosis from which it may basically be, apart from the histologic features, distinguished by its good prognosis due to the absence of liver failure. We present the case of a seropositive patient with regenerative hepatic nodular hyperplasia and rheumatoid arthritis with marked portal hypertension shown in the hemodynamic study performed by our department for presentation of a persistent elevation in transaminases and ultrasonography alterations suggesting hepatic cirrhosis.
