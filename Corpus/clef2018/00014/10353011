Importance of liver puncture biopsy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography in patients with chronic anicteric unexplained cholestasis. A retrospective study in 79 patients. To determine the diagnostic value of systematic liver needle biopsy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography in patients with unexplained chronic anicteric cholestasis.Seventy nine patients presented with anicteric cholestasis for over 6 months as defined by: a concomitant increase in at least 2 of 3 cholestatic enzymes (GGT, alkaline phosphatase, 5'nucleotidase) a low cytolytic ratio (ALT/AP (xN/xN) < or = 5)Diagnosis of cholestasis was fortuitous in 43% of cases. Group A: 5 patients had normal liver biopsy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography group B (10 patients): 5 with destructive cholangitis, 5 with degenerative cholangitis, associated with portal fibrosis in 90%In the present population: a) 13% presented with intense cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis on endoscopic retrograde cholangiography b) 49% presented with various histologic biliary lesions without primary sclerosing cholangitis. We conclude that in chronic anicteric cholestasis of unexplained origin, first choice work-up should include liver biopsy, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography should only be performed when intense histologic cholangitis is observed.
