Gallbladder hyporesponsiveness to an exogenous nitric oxide donor, glyceryl trinitrate, in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis. An increased production of nitric oxide (NO) in liver cirrhosis has been documented. NO could intervene in regulating gallbladder contraction, as suggested by clinical and experimental studies. Our aim was to investigate the influence of an NO donor on gallbladder motility in cirrhotic patients in relation to the severity of liver cirrhosis.The subjects were six controls and 18 patients with liver cirrhosis (six in each Child class). Gallbladder emptying was monitored by ultrasound for 90 min after a mixed meal (14 g fat, 425 kcal). Fasting gallbladder volume, minimal residual volume, ejection fraction, area under emptying curve, and half contraction time of the gallbladder were assessed at 15-min intervals. The patients were evaluated on two consecutive days, with or without perlingual administration of 0.5 mg glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). Statistical analysis was performed by the two-tailed Student's t test and Pearson's correlation coefficient.GTN significantly reduced gallbladder motility in controls and compensated cirrhotics (p < 0.02), but had no effect upon gallbladder emptying in Child class B and C cirrhotics.Gallbladder hypocontractility in liver cirrhosis is related to the severity of the disease. This study is the first to show that GTN has no effect upon gallbladder motility in advanced liver cirrhosis when administered in doses that induce relaxation in controls and compensated cirrhosis.
