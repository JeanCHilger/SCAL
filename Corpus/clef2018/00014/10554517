Intrahepatic calcification--a differential diagnostic problem. A 57-year-old woman was admitted for investigation of intrahepatic calcifications. Intrahepatic cholangiolithiasis was suspected. In 1993 she underwent cholecystectomy because of lithiasis. The examination with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) was planned.The laboratory findings were normal except for a mild elevation of alkaline phosphatase and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase. The sonographic examination of the abdomen showed multiple hyperechoic calcifications along non-dilated bile ducts. In the spleen of normal size there were found a lot of intraparenchymatous calcifications. The abdominal roentgenography revealed calcifications also in the pancreas. In ERC, the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts were normal with simultaneous proof of parenchymatous calcifications.Because of the medical history of the patient and the radiologic findings the multiple parenchymatous calcifications could be referred to a miliary tuberculosis during childhood. In miliary tuberculosis, the liver almost always is involved by acute granulomatous inflammation. The therapy of hepatic tuberculosis follows the guidelines of systemic tuberculostatic therapy according to other presentations of this disease. Under sufficient therapy, tuberculotic granulomas normally heal without cicatrization. Sometimes tissue reactions in form of local fibrosis and calcification lead to a mild reduction in hepatic function as seen in this case.In the European population, intrahepatic cholangiolithiasis is a rare cause of focal hyperechoic liver lesions. In differential diagnosis, numerous diseases of possible systemic course have to be considered, which may induce calcifications of the liver or other organs. Among systemic diseases characterized by granulomatous inflammation and possible calcification tuberculosis and sarcoidosis have to be mentioned first.
