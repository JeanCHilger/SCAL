Clinical predictors of pulmonary hypertension in patients undergoing liver transplant evaluation. Clinical prediction of portopulmonary hypertension (PPHTN) is critical in the preoperative evaluation of candidates for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) because of its association with significant morbidity and mortality. To determine the clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic predictors of PPHTN, we retrospectively evaluated 55 candidates before OLT. From those, 8 candidates had pulmonary hypertension ([HTN] group A) and 47 candidates did not (group B). Pulmonary HTN was defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 25 mm Hg or greater and either elevated pulmonary vascular resistance or normal pulmonary artery wedge pressure. The significant predictors of PPHTN were (1) systemic arterial HTN (63% in group A v 9% in group B P <.001), (2) loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound (38% v 2%
