Treatment of multilocular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of 4.5 cm and 3.5 cm diameter using percutaneous ethanol injection in a patient with advanced liver cirrhosis. Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) is established for tumors up to 3 cm. We report on treatment of a multilocular HCC with a maximum size of 4.5 cm.In a 76-year-old woman with a liver cirrhosis (Child C) due to chronic hepatitis C HCC with two nodules (diameter 3.5 cm and 4.5 cm) was diagnosed. Because of the patient's reduced general state of health and the advanced cirrhosis surgical treatment and chemoembolization were declined. The two nodules were treated in ten settings during 15 weeks under ultrasound guidance with 85 ml of 96% ethanol. There were no severe side effects. The patient's general condition improved and serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration decreased from 21,126 to 800 micrograms/l. Seven months after the diagnosis of the HCC she was admitted to another hospital due to a cerebral hemorrhage. A few days later she died because of a pneumonia. In spite of detailed micro- and macroscopically investigation no tumor was found during the autopsy. This case report shows that HCC up to a diameter of 4.5 cm can be effectively treated by PEI. This treatment modality is cheap and well-tolerated even in patients suffering from advanced cirrhosis.
