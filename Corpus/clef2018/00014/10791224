A case of living-related partial liver transplantation using the right gastroepiploic artery for hepatic artery reconstruction. A 13-year-old boy with liver cirrhosis underwent living-related partial liver transplantation with a left lobe from his mother. A standard hepatic artery reconstruction using the recipient right hepatic artery was anticipated. Unfortunately, the recipient hepatic artery was found to be severely arteriosclerotic and was unsuitable for reconstruction. Instead, the right gastroepiploic artery, measuring 2.0 mm in diameter, was mobilized and was anastomosed to the left hepatic artery of the graft in an end-to-end fashion. Arterial blood flow was satisfactory. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was transferred to a floor bed on the 5th postoperative day.
