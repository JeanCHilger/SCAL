48-hour hemodynamic effects of octreotide on postprandial splanchnic hyperemia in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension: double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Octreotide is effective during 48 h in the treatment of acute variceal bleeding, probably by reducing variceal blood flow and pressure. Its basal and postprandial effects on splanchnic and systemic hemodynamics, and hormonal changes over this time interval have not yet been studied. Twenty-four patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension were randomized to receive a liquid meal and either octreotide (Oct, 100 microg bolus intravenous, followed after 2 h by a continuous infusion of 25 microg/hr for 20 hr) or placebo (Plac) given at three consecutive days. Splanchnic (Doppler ultrasound) and systemic hemodynamics (noninvasive cardiac monitoring) were assessed on four consecutive days (one control day and three treatment days) during 2 hr. The postprandial increase in mean blood velocity of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA-V(mean) +44%), portal blood velocity (PV-V(mean), +44%) and total hepatic blood flow (HBF, +40%) observed in the placebo group during the control day was abolished during the first day of treatment (SMA-V(mean), +3%, P < 0.01 PV-V(mean), +6%, P < 0.05
