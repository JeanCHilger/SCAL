Gastric permeability to sucrose is increased in portal hypertensive gastropathy. Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) is frequently found among patients with hepatic cirrhosis and at present the only way to detect and follow PHG is via endoscopy.To assess gastric and intestinal permeability and investigate its relationship to endoscopic findings and indices of portal hypertension and hepatic function.Thirty-one non-diabetic patients with hepatic cirrhosis and PHG (PHG+) were studied and compared with 17 cirrhotic patients without PHG (PHG-). All patients underwent endoscopy for the assessment of PHG and Helicobacter pylori status, ultrasound determination of the diameters of spleen and portal vein, and, subsequently, an oral load of sucrose, lactulose, and mannitol. Sugar concentrations were determined in 6-h urine specimens and expressed as a percentage of the orally administered dose or as lactulose/mannitol ratio.The urinary sucrose excretion was significantly elevated in patients with PHG compared to those without (PHG+, 0.20% +/- 0.03 PHG-, 0.07% +/- 0.01Gastric permeability to sucrose is increased in patients with PHG, independently of the presence of H. pylori. Sucrose permeability may be useful for the follow-up of patients with PHG.
