The echo-guided interstitial laser photocoagulation of malignant liver tumors. The authors' personal technic, immediate results and short-term complications in patients with normal and altered liver function. The literature studies about interstitial laser photocoagulation of liver tumors mainly deal with the treatment of liver metastasis in patients with normal liver function. We report our personal experience with interstitial laser photocoagulation in patients with liver tumors (mostly cirrhotics with hepatocellular carcinoma). Our aim was to evaluate the short term efficacy of percutaneous interstitial laser photocoagulation in inducing focal ablation of liver tumors and the possible complications in patients with normal and impaired liver function.Sixty-six patients (52-80 years 42 men), 47 with 51 hepatocellular carcinoma nodules (diameter = 1.6-6.6 cmFifty-eight patients underwent a single interstitial laser photocoagulation session, 7 patients 2 session and 1 patient 3 sessions. The range of administered energy per patient was 1200-32,000 Joules (mean: 6700 J). CT showed complete necrosis of 47 nodules in 43 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and in 15/18 patients with metastasis. Three Child C class patients with mild ascites and hyperbilirubinemia before procedure (nodules O: 1.9, 3.5 and 5.8 cm) dropped out of CT follow-up because of severe liver function impairment with increased ascites and hyperbilirubinemia, associated with transient ileum paraliticus in 1 case. One of these patients died two months after treatment. Two patients with metastasis dropped out of treatment because of complications occurred after the interstitial laser photocoagulation session (1 ileum paraliticus, 1 gastric hemorrhage) and another one refused to continue the treatment.
