Results of liver transplantation for nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Liver transplantation has been performed in individuals with a pretransplant clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis but with nodular regenerative hyperplasia histologically. The purpose of this report is to investigate the results of liver transplantation in patients proven to have nodular regenerative hyperplasia post-transplant. A retrospective review was undertaken of four patients who underwent liver transplantation with a histologic diagnosis of nodular regenerative hyperplasia. All were felt to be cirrhotic on clinical grounds. Final histology of the explanted liver was confirmed by a single pathologist. Their ages ranged from 39 to 54 years, and three of the four were male. Three had pretransplant needle liver biopsies, two percutaneous and one transjugular. All revealed nonspecific reactive changes. Ultrasound and MRI were interpreted as consistent with cirrhosis in four of four and three of four cases, respectively. Portal vein flow was hepatopedal in three and absent in one. Pretransplant clinical characteristics and frequency were as follows: bleeding varices two, clinical ascites three, encephalopathy three, and impaired hepatic synthetic function two. All four patients underwent successful liver transplantation. There were no episodes of acute rejection. All are alive and well with normal graft function 2 to 4 years post-transplant. We conclude the following. 1) Patients with clinical end-stage liver disease due to underlying nodular regenerative hyperplasia can successfully undergo transplantation. 2) Nodular regenerative hyperplasia can present with signs and symptoms of liver failure, is difficult to diagnose by needle biopsy, and can be difficult to discriminate clinically from cirrhosis. 3) Although each case must be individually evaluated transplantation may be the optimal therapy in patients presenting with complications of liver failure.
