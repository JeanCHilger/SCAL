Laparoscopic subsegmentectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma with cirrhosis. Laparoscopic liver resection is feasible for both benign and malignant disease with today's laparoscopic techniques and technology. Location of the tumor at the edge of segment 3, 4, 5, or 6 of our patients makes them an ideal candidate for laparoscopic resection.There were 9 patients who underwent laparoscopic subsegmentectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma with cirrhosis. They were classified as Child A in 6 and B in 3 patients. Hepatitis B was found in 5 and Hepatitis C in 4 cases. Preoperative diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was completed in 7 and definitive histologic diagnosis from frozen section in 2 cases. All 9 patients underwent subsegmentectomy and removal of the tumor with non-tumor cirrhotic liver with a distance of 10 mm at the least margin. Laparoscopic ultrasound allows exact localization of lesions and achievement of adequate resection margin.Those patients resumed a full diet on the 2nd-3rd day after the operation and were discharged home on day 4-7 with no complications but one had prolonging discharge due to ascitis from a drainage tube. Finally, the ascitis was controlled by medications for 1 week. All patients had high postoperative satisfaction.Laparoscopic liver resection is a procedure of significant risk and technically demanding. Therefore, it should be performed only by experienced liver surgeons with a high level of laparoscopic skill and in the carefully selected patient.
