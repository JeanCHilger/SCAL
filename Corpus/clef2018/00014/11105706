Radiographic findings of ischemic hepatitis in a cirrhotic patient. We report the radiographic findings of ischemic hepatitis in a patient with cirrhosis. The abdominal ultrasound exam showed multiple hypoechoic nodules in the liver measuring up to 2 cm, suggestive of diffuse metastatic disease. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple hypodense masses throughout the liver with no enhancement. Liver biopsy revealed coagulative hepatocyte necrosis at the center of the regenerative nodules. Repeat CT scan obtained 5 months later showed complete resolution of the hypodense nodules. Ischemic necrosis of regenerative nodules should be differentiated from diffuse hepatic metastatic disease in the setting of ischemic hepatitis in cirrhotic patients.
