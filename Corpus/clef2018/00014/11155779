Non-syndromic association of congenital hepatic fibrosis and bilateral cystic renal dysplasia. Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) is associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Although cystic renal dysplasia (CRD) is the most common form of newborn cystic renal disease, this disorder of anomalous metanephric differentiation is only rarely found concurrent with CHF. Our literature review found only 13 sporadic and 12 familial non-syndromic cases of combined bilateral CRD and CHF reported outside Taiwan. We report the first domestic case, occurring in a fetus of 18 weeks' gestational age, which was the second pregnancy of a 24-year-old mother with a previous history of spontaneous abortion at 10 weeks' gestational age. Postmortem autopsy confirmed the concurrence of bilateral CRD and CHF without associated anomalies of other visceral organs and external appearance. This particular association must be differentiated from ARPKD and liver disease, in regard to ultrasonographic examination and genetic counseling.
