Which patients with cirrhosis should undergo endoscopic screening for esophageal varices detection? Our aims were to develop a noninvasive predictive tool to identify cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices and to evaluate whether portal Doppler ultrasonographic parameters may improve the value of other predictors. One hundred forty-three consecutive compensated cirrhotic patients underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Fourteen clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographic, and Doppler ultrasonographic parameters of each patient were also recorded. Esophageal varices were detected in 63 of the 143 patients examined (44% 95% confidence interval [CI] 36.2-52.6). Medium and large esophageal varices were observed in 28 subjects (44%
