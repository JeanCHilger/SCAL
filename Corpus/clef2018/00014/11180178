Visualization of blood flow in hepatic vessels and hepatocellular carcinoma using B-flow sonography. A B-flow sonographic technique was recently developed to provide direct visualization of blood flow with gray-scale sonography. Compared with color Doppler sonography, B-flow imaging has wideband resolution and a high frame rate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of B-flow sonography for visualizing blood flow in hepatic vessels and tumor vascularity in patients with liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Twenty-five patients with liver cirrhosis, including 15 with HCC, were studied by B-flow and color Doppler sonography. Blood-flow detection rates in portal veins and hepatic arteries and tumor vascularity in HCC were analyzed, and the 2 methods were compared.Using B-flow, blood flow was visualized in the portal vein in 23 (92%) of 25 patients and was visualized in the hepatic artery separately from the portal vein in 9 (36%) of 25 patients. The blood-flow signals were visualized only within vessels, never "bleeding" outside the vessel's lumen. Blood flow in the portal vein was observed with color Doppler sonography in all 25 patients, but the hepatic artery was never clearly separated from the portal vein. Vascularity within the HCC tumor was detected in 9 (60%) of 15 nodules with B-flow imaging, and fine arteries flowing into the tumor were observed in 6 nodules. Color Doppler sonography detected blood flow in 13 (87%) of the 15 HCC nodules.Blood flow in hepatic vessels and tumor vessels of HCC were visualized with B-flow sonography. B-flow sonography is a potentially useful technique for the evaluation of liver vascularity and intratumoral vessels.
