Color Doppler velocity profile assessment of portal hemodynamics in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension: correlation with esophageal variceal bleeding. Using the color Doppler velocity profile (CDVP), we investigated portal hemodynamics and their relationship with esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.The hemodynamics of the portal trunk, right anterior portal branch, and splenic vein were evaluated in 69 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension and 46 healthy volunteers. The CDVP, a recently developed Doppler software, was used to measure blood flow velocity and flow volume evaluate the spatial distribution of flow velocities in the cross-section of a vessel (velocity profile), as reflected by the profile parameter (n)Compared with the healthy group, the cirrhotic group had a significantly lower mean CSVmax in the portal trunk and right anterior portal branch (both p < 0.01), a significantly elevated mean flow volume in the splenic vein and portal trunk (both p < 0.01), a significantly elevated mean ratio of splenic vein flow volume to portal trunk flow volume (SV/PT) (p < 0.001), and a significantly greater mean congestion index in the portal trunk, right anterior portal branch, and splenic vein (all p < 0.01). In the cirrhotic group, there was a significantly higher incidence of a flat flow pattern in the right anterior portal branch and a phasic flow pattern in the splenic vein than in the healthy group (both p < 0.01). Among cirrhotic patients, the EVB(+) group had a significantly greater mean flow volume in the splenic vein (p < 0.01), greater mean SV/PT (p < 0.01), greater mean spleen size (p < 0.05), and lower mean portal trunk n value (p < 0.05) compared with the EVB(-) group. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the SV/PT and portal trunk n value were independent EVB-related factors.The results suggest that portal hemodynamics in cirrhotic patients are characterized by passive congestion and increased blood flow. However, these 2 features had different preponderances in different parts of the portal venous system. Increased flow in the splenic vein may be the primary source of increased portal flow and may play a role in the development of EVB. The SV/PT and portal trunk n value may be valuable factors for predicting EVB.
