Radiologic diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Substantial recent technologic improvements in CT scanning, US scanning, and MR imaging, together with advances in the understanding of the optimal application of contrast administration techniques, have facilitated advances in radiologic imaging detection for HCC diagnosis. Despite a large number of earlier publications reporting a high sensitivity for imaging detection of HCC, more recent screening studies of large cirrhotic populations confirm that only 37% to 45% of HCC tumor nodules are detected by CT scanning, US scanning, or MR imaging. Future investigation will include efforts to improve the detection of small tumors and to characterize with greater specificity the spectrum of nodular changes that occur with cirrhosis. Although several small series have attempted to characterize cirrhotic nodules by evaluating the relative arterial or portal blood supply, these preliminary results require substantiation with larger series. Continued technologic advances such as multidetector helical CT scanning and new US and MR contrast agents under investigation may improve the imaging characterization of cirrhotic nodules.
