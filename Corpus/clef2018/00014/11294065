Laparoscopic subsegmentectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma with cirrhosis: a case report. Laparoscopic liver resection is feasible for both benign and malignant disease with present laparoscopic techniques and technology. Laparoscopic liver tumor resection is indicated instead of the conventional hepatectomy if the tumor is located in the peripheral part of the liver. Here, we reported a case of a 73-year-old woman who accepted laparoscopic subsegmentectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma of segment 6. After traditional laparoscopic trocar was settled down under the low pneumoperitoneal pressure of 8 mm Hg, laparoscopic ultrasound allowed exact localization of lesions first and then transection line was marked. Then, dissection the liver parenchyma was carried out with laparoscopic microwave coagulator and ultrasonic aspirator gradually. After operation, she resumed full diet on the second day and was discharged on the 5th post-operative day with no complications and high patient satisfaction. She had follow-up study regularly in our clinic and was disease free at nine months. With the improvement of laparoscopic techniques and the development of new and dedicated technologies, laparoscopic hepatectomy has become feasible.
