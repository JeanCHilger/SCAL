The liver hemodynamics in portal gastropathy. Complex hemodynamic studies were made in 280 patients with hepatic cirrhosis presenting with the portal hypertension syndrome. It has been found out that the isolated hyperdynamic state of blood circulation in the upper portion of the stomach is responsible for the development of not only portal gastropathy but gastric varicosity as well. Revealed in the above patients was a decline in the arterial and portal bloodflows corresponding to a diminution of total hepatic bloodflow in which the share of the portal versus arterial bloodflow tended to be on the increase. In portal gastropathy the portoarterial ratio gets changed at the presinusoid and sinusoid levels so that the predominance of the portal flow into the liver over the arterial inflow is associated with the predominance of the arterial component over the venous one in the sinusoid bloodflow.
