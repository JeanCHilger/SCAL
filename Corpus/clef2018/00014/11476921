Value of splanchnic Doppler ultrasound in the diagnosis of portal hypertension. The accuracy of various Doppler parameters of portal circulation in the diagnosis of relevant portal hypertension (presence of gastroesophageal varices) was prospectively validated. The following parameters were compared in 51 patients with chronic liver disease (40 with cirrhosis and 11 with chronic hepatitis): portal vein flow velocity and congestion index, hepatic and splenic arteries resistance indexes (RI), modified liver vascular index (portal flow velocity/hepatic artery RI) and portal hypertension index, a new index calculated as: [(hepatic artery RI x 0.69) x (splenic artery RI x 0.87)]/portal vein flow velocity. Highest accuracy was achieved by the splenic artery RI and the portal hypertension index (both around 75%) at cut-offs, respectively, of 0.60 and 12 cm/s(-1), which appeared to be, therefore, the most favorable parameters for the clinical practice. Their use may limit the need for endoscopy to search for varices.
