Comparison of screening methods for hepatocellular carcinomas in patients with cirrhosis. To determine the most suitable screening methods for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), we investigated 45 cases with HCCs. Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scan and measurement of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were regularly performed. Thirty-two cases (72%) were detected initially by ultrasonography. Fourteen out of 23 cases (61%) with tumors 20 mm or less in diameter and 11 out of 12 cases (91%) with 21-30 mm tumors were detected initially by.ultrasonography. For the initial detection of tumors sized 20 mm or less, the mean interval of ultrasonography was 3.54 months, unlike the 5.67 months for tumors sized over 21 mm. There was no significant difference between tumor size and measurement interval in AFP levels or CT scan examinations. From these results, we suggest that a suitable screening schedule would be every three months by ultrasonography.
