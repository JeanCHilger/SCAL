Doppler sonographic diagnosis of respiration-dependent reversed flow in the hilar splenic vein. We describe respiration-dependent reversed flow in the splenic vein detected by color Doppler sonography in 2 patients. In case 1, gray-scale sonography in a patient with liver cirrhosis and abdominal pain showed a hyperechoic, thickened colonic segment and diverticula, with increased echogenicity around the diseased colon. The liver was small, with a nodular surface and coarse echotexture. Doppler sonography of the portal and splenic veins showed a constant hepatopetal flow while the patient held her breath in midinspiration and a brief, transient color change restricted to the hilar splenic veins when the patient took a deep breath. In case 2, abdominal sonography in a patient with pneumonia and right-sided abdominal pain showed mural thickening of the appendix and left-sided pneumonic infiltration. The liver size and texture were normal. Color Doppler sonography of the portal and splenic veins showed a constant hepatopetal flow while the patient held his breath in midinspiration and a transient reversal of flow restricted to the splenic veins when the patient took a deep breath. Although the cause of this flow pattern is unclear, increased intra-abdominal pressure is a possible explanation.
