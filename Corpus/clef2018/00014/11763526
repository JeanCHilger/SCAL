Use of ednit in the treatment of portal hypertension in patients with chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. To study ednit (ACE inhibitor) effectiveness in the treatment of portal hypertension in patients with chronic hepatitis (CH) and hepatic cirrhosis (HC).The examination of 87 patients with active CH and 54 patients with HC at the preascytic stage included two-dimentional ultrasonic scanning of the abdominal organs with doppler fluometry of the vessels in the territory of the portal vein, tetrapolar rheohepatography, ultrasound investigation, angiography of the abdominal vessels. The patients received combined therapy with ednit in a dose 5 mg twice a day for at least 5 weeks.Patients with active CH and HC having portal hypertension treated with adjuvant ednit in the above dose achieved marked clinicobiochemical remission quicker, portal-hepatic circulation improved.The addition of ednit to therapy of active CH and HC with portal hypertension is effective as it lowers total peripheral vascular resistance which eventually results in a fall of pressure in the territory of the portal vein and improvement of hepatic circulation. The highest effect is reached in administration of 5 mg twice for 24 hours.
