Pseudothrombosis with T2-weighted fast spin-echo MR images caused by static portal venous flow in severe cirrhosis. Unenhanced T2-weighted fast spin-echo images obtained in a 65-year-old woman with severe cirrhosis showed an area of high signal intensity occupying the left second-order portal vein branch, suggesting portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis. Doppler sonography, which revealed virtually no blood flow in the vessel, also supported the diagnosis. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI subsequently revealed the patency of the vessel. The extremely slow portal venous flow was considered to be the cause of false-positive findings with unenhanced MRI and sonography.
