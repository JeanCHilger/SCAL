Diagnostic value of ultrasonic examination in patients with different stages of liver fibrosis. To discuss the diagnostic value of ultrasonic examination in patients with early liver cirrhosis and the relation with different stages of liver fibrosis.In the series, 263 patients with chronic hepatitis B were under taken liver biopsy and ultrasonic examination of type B for determination of liver cirrhosis images, width of the main portal vein and the splenic vein, tumefaction of the spleen. Data were analysed statistically.Sixties of 263 patients were diagnosed as early liver cirrhosis. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, misdiagnostic rate, missed diagnostic rate, and Jonden's index of ultrasonic examination for early liver cirrhosis were 52.5%, 88.3%, 11.7%, 47.5%, and 0.508, respectively. The width of the main portal vein with liver fibrosis of S1, S2, S3, and S4 were 10.93 mm +/- 1.25 mm, 11.35 mm +/- 1.06 mm,11.29 mm +/- 1.52 mm, and 11.4 8mm +/- 1.25 mm, respectively with statistic difference between S4 and S1 (P=0.03). The width of the spleen vein of S1, S2, S3, and S4 were 6.518 mm +/- 2.033 mm, 7.190 mm +/- 1.569 mm, 7.444 mm +/- 1.805 mm and 8.406 mm +/- 2.227 mm, respectively with statistic difference between S4 and S2 (P=0.035). The incidence of tumefaction of the spleen was increased with the degree of liver fibrosis.The diagnostic sensitivity of ultrasonic examination for early liver cirrhosis is low. The width of the main portal vein, the spleen vein and the incidence of tumefaction of the spleen are related with the degree of liver fibrosis. The regeneration node of liver cirrhosis may contribute to the development of portal hypertension.
