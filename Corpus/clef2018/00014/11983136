Correlative study between portal vein pressure and portal hemodynamics in patients with portal hypertension. To explore the characteristics of the portal vein hemodynamics and the correlation with the portal vein pressure.There were 41 cases of hepatic cirrhosis complicating portal hypertension. The liver function was graded Child-Pugh A+B in 31 cases and Child-Pugh C in 10 cases. The inner-diameter and blood stream speed of the portal vein (PV), the spleen vein (SV) and the superior mesentery vein (SMV) were measured by the color Doppler ultrasonography. The vascular acreage and blood flow volume were calculated. The portal vein pressure was directly measured during the operation. Thirty-two healthy people and 26 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) served as controls in this study.The inner-diameter of the three veins was obviously wider and the blood flow speed was slower in two portal hypertension groups than in CHB and normal groups (P<0.01). In Child C group, the speed was the slowest. The speed of SV and SMV in two hypertension groups did not show any significant difference (P>0.05). In Child A+B group, the blood flow volume of the three veins was larger than that in normal and CHB groups (P<0.01 or P<0.05). The volume of PV was less in Child C group than Child A+B group (P<0.01), but the volume of SV and SMV was not obviously different (P>0.05). In Child A+B group, the portal vein pressure (Ppv) had a close correlation with the portal vein width, blood flow quantitation (Qpv), and blood stream volume (Qsv) of the spleen vein.The Qpv in Child A+B grade can be measured by the color Doppler ultrasonography technique, and the portal vein pressure can be monitored easily by the equation of Ppv=1.8951+0.0011Qpv.
