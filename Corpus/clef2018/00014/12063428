Antenatal diagnosis of a choledocal cyst. Choledocal cyst is a rare anomaly that usually becomes symptomatic during childhood. Forty to sixty percent of choledocal cysts are diagnosed before 10 years old, usually when complications occur. Today, because of advances in sonographic imaging, some cysts can de diagnosed before birth. The major prognostic factor is the development of complications such as hepatic fibrosis. Early treatment, after postnatal ultrasonography assessment, can reduce the incidence of serious complications. The authors report a case of a choledocal cyst diagnosed at 23 weeks gestation.
