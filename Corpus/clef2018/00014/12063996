Pseudo-Budd-Chiari Syndrome: decompensated alcoholic liver disease mimicking hepatic venous outflow obstruction. Three patients with rapid onset decompensated liver disease who were referred to our hospital with presumed Budd-Chiari syndrome are described. This diagnosis was based on marked hepatomegaly, caudate lobe hypertrophy and failure to visualize hepatic veins by Doppler-ultrasound examination. Detailed history, biochemistry, and histology were, however, highly suggestive of alcoholic liver cirrhosis with steatohepatitis-induced hepatomegaly. On angiographic examination narrowed but patent hepatic veins were demonstrated in 2 patients. A third patient died before further work-up could be performed autopsy showed patent hepatic veins. These cases show that the radiological diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome due to hepatic vein obstruction can be false positive and that suspected hepatic vein occlusion on Doppler-ultrasound should be confirmed by angiographic studies and on liver histology.
