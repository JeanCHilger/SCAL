Endovascular intrahepatic portacaval shunting. Pilot experience in Russia of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting is presented. Results of endovascular shunting in 14 patients with cirrhosis of the liver were analyzed. Four patients underwent emergency endovascular shunting when conservative treatment was not effective. Ten patients underwent elective surgery. Repeated esophagealgastric bleedings were indications for shunting. Relapse of bleeding was seen in 1 patient 5 days after surgery. Regular dopplerography permitted to reveal timely stenotic process. When stenosis of portosystemic shunt was diagnosed, ambulatory balloon dilatation of anastomosis through transjugular approach was performed. It was enough for opening of anastomosis lumen and decrease of pressure gradient.
