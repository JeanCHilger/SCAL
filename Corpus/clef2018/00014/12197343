Hepatic fibrosis due to fascioliasis and/or schistosomiasis in Abis 1 village, Egypt. An epidemiological study of fascioliasis and/or schistosomiasis was conducted in Abis 1 village. Stool specimens were collected from 2492 individuals and examined. Fascioliasis, alone or combined with schistosomiasis, was more prevalent among children aged between 5 years and 15 years than in adults. Serum procollagen III peptide (PIIIP) levels were determined as an indicator of active fibrosis, and liver histopathology and ultrasonography used as indicators of established fibrosis. PIIIP levels were significantly higher in children than in adults, and in mixed infections than in fascioliasis alone. In adults, fibrosis around granulomata detected by histopathology and grade 3 periportal fibrosis detected by sonography were encountered more frequently in dual than in single infections.
