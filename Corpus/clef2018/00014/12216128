Evaluation of the effectiveness of Dopplerography in patients with diffuse liver disease with portal hypertension syndrome. Under analysis were the results of Dopplerography of the abdominal cavity vessels in 66 patients with liver cirrhosis and 14 patients with the extrahepatic portal block. The sensitivity of the method in diagnostics of the intrahepatic block was 96.9%. The linear rate of the blood flow along the upper mesenterial vein was the most sensitive dopplerographic criterion of liver cirrhosis with the portal hypertension syndrome, the most specific test was the determination of the hepatic artery pulsativity index. A considerable decrease of the index of linear and volume rates of blood flow along the splenic vein and higher index of the splenic artery pulsativity were observed when the functional reserves of the liver decreased. A higher resistance index and the presence of the III degree gastroesophageal anastomoses are characteristic of the patients with bleedings from the veins of the esophagus and stomach.
