Hepatocellular carcinoma: Role of imaging diagnostics in detection, intervention and follow-up. Demonstration of techniques and clinical value of imaging diagnostics for screening, detection, interventional follow-up and therapy control of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Diagnostic techniques for screening, detection and differential diagnosis of HCC are presented using color-coded duplex sonography (US), computer tomography (CT) and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance techniques like MRI, MR angiography and MR cholangiopancreaticography (MRCP). Therapy control with imaging was performed for surgical methods like resection and liver transplantation as for well as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RF) and laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT). In screening, HCC color-coded duplex sonography reveals a sensitivity from 45 to 92 % and a specificity from 78 to 90 % when liver cirrhosis is present. The diagnostic results of CT were further improved with the newly developed techniques of multislice CT. The highest diagnostic accuracy can currently be achieved using contrast-enhanced MRI with a sensitivity from 82 to 96 %. TACE presents a palliative therapy concept MR-guided LITT and radiofrequency ablation are used as thermoablative methods for local therapy and the therapy control is based on the above imaging techniques. Contrast-enhanced MRI proves to be the superior imaging technique for the early diagnosis, differential diagnosis and follow-up of hepatocellular carcinoma.
