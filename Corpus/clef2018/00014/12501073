Fetal hepatic calcifications: prenatal diagnosis and outcome. The purpose of this study was to provide information on the causes and postnatal outcomes of fetal liver calcifications that were detected by ultrasound imaging.Cases with fetal liver calcifications that were encountered between 1992 and 2001 were evaluated. A detailed fetal ultrasound imaging for associated abnormalities, maternal STORCH (syphilis, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus 1 and 2, rubella, and Toxoplasma ) analysis, parvovirus serologic condition, and parental cystic fibrosis mutations analysis were performed amniocentesis was offered in all cases. All infants who were born alive were examined and followed up.Sixty-one pregnant women with fetal liver calcifications were identified. Forty of 61 patients had additional fetal abnormalities 21 of 61 cases of fetal liver calcifications were isolatedFetal liver calcifications are relatively common. Isolated cases have a good prognosis after aneuploidy and infection have been ruled out. However, additional major abnormalities present a risk for chromosomal abnormalities, mainly trisomy 13.
