New parameter of liver ulitasonic tissue characterization--multi-fractal spectrum. Based on the previous research about the feature of liver ultrasonic images, this paper presents a new analysis method of multifractal spectrum alpha-f(alpha). Using a series of partition Hausdorff dimension f(q) this paper describes the sophisticated fractal characteristics of the ultrasonic images in the different section of the growing process and the multi-fractal spectrum alpha-f(alpha) acts as the new parameter of the ultrasonic issue characterization. Using the neural network it has catalogued and recognized the tissue diseases, caring out ultrasonic tissue characterization. Apparently, this method has practical significance.
