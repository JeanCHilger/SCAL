Laparoscopic "radical appendectomy" is an effective alternative to endoscopic removal of cecal polyps. The endoscopic removal of cecal polyps can be complicated by hemorrhage, perforation, or incomplete resection. Laparoscopic radical appendectomy represents a safe alternative for the definitive resection and accurate pathologic evaluation of selected cecal polyps.Patients with cecal cap polyps not involving the ileocecal valve were candidates for laparoscopic radical appendectomy. Intraoperative colonoscopy and resection of the appendix and cecum to the level of the ileocecal valve were accomplished via three midline ports. For each patient, histologic evaluation by frozen section ruled out malignancy and ensured complete resection.Five patients, four of whom had significant medical comorbidities, presented with large adenomatous polyps contained within the cecum. Each polyp was determined to be unresectable endoscopically therefore, a laparoscopic radical appendectomy was performed. One patient with cirrhosis also underwent intraoperative liver ultrasonography and biopsies, which contributed to the longest operative time and hospital stay. The histologic diagnosis by frozen section was benign for each patient. The mean operative time was 95 minutes, and the mean length of hospital stay was 1.8 days. No postoperative complications were observed during a mean follow-up of 6 months.Laparoscopic "radical appendectomy" is an effective treatment for selected cecal adenomatous polyps. Our ability to resect the polyps completely and avoid a standard right hemicolectomy supports this approach.
