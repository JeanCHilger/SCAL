Hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis and seronegativity for markers of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus: report of a case. We report a case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arising in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) in whom both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) serological tests were negative. A 72-year-old woman was found to have HCC 10 years after a diagnosis of PBC. All serological tests for HBV and HCV were negative. Preoperative liver biopsy findings suggested moderately differentiated HCC. Dynamic computed tomography (CT) showed hypervascular tumors in segments IV and VII. At laparotomy, a 30-mm tumor was palpated in segment VII and a wedge resection was performed. The second tumor, which measured 10 mm in diameter, was detected in segment IV by abdominal ultrasound, and microwave coagulation therapy was done. HCC arising in hepatitis virus marker-negative PBC is rare and past reports do not clarify whether HBV or HCV infections are associated with HCC.
