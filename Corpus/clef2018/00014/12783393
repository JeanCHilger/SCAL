Relationship between portal venous flow and liver regeneration in patients after living donor right-lobe liver transplantation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between portal venous (PV) velocity and degree of liver regeneration in humans after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Between July 1997 and September 2002, a total of 15 adult-to-adult LDLTs with right-lobe grafts were performed, and 13 of these patients were enrolled in this study. Postoperative PV dynamics differed according to the primary liver disease therefore, patients were divided into two groups: a fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) group (n = 4) and a liver cirrhosis (LC) group (n = 9). Right-lobe donors (n = 13
