Liver ultrasound and faecal copper estimation in oral submucous fibrosis. There is no evidence of an increased quantity of ingestion of copper in areca nut chewers by way of habitually swallowing the 'quid juice' allegedly contain 'appreciable quantity' of soluble copper. Our experimental findings are favour of assuming that the amount of copper ingested, if at all, is well within the threshold limit of tolerance and therefore of no clinical significance. In conjunction with our earlier observation this study again proved the absence of visible and clinically/diagnostically detectable fibrosis in visceral organs, that includes liver, in patients suffering from advanced oral submucous fibrosis.
