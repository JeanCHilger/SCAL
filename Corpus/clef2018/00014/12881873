Liver fibrosis indexes in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. To assess the clinical utility of liver fibrosis indexes determination in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.Liver fibrosis indexes of 79 patients with fatty liver, diagnosed by B ultrasonic echography, 37 patients with posthepatitic cirrhosis patients and 32 healthy subjects were determined.The level of procollagen III(PC III), hyaluronic acid (HA), collagen IV(C IV), laminin (LN) in the fatty liver cases were significantly higher than those of healthy subjects (P<0.05 - 0.01), but lower than those in the liver cirrhosis cases (P<0.01). The difference of PC III, C IV, LN between the severe and early fatty liver cases was significant (P<0.05 - 0.01). Positive rate of these indexes was higher in severe cases.There is a trend of liver fibrosis in severe fatty liver patients. Combined determination of liver fibrosis indexes may help the diagnosis of liver fibrosis in the fatty liver patients.
