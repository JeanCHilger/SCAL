Ultrasound versus clinical examination as indication for Schistosoma mansoni associated morbidity in children. In order to compare clinical versus ultrasound based diagnosis of Schistosoma mansoni induced periportal fibrosis (pF) 536 infected Sudanese schoolchildren underwent clinical and sonographical examination. A liver exceeding 3 cm in sternal line and a palpable spleen were considered pathological. Ultrasound criteria for age dependent organometry of a Central European cohort were used as reference. Based on clinical criteria 190 children (35.4%) had hepatomegaly, whereas according to ultrasound results the rate was only 11.4%. Splenomegaly was detected in 77 cases (14.4%) by clinical means, but in 196 by ultrasound (36.6%). The sensitivity of clinical parameters as indication of pF was around 50%. Results for ultrasound detected organomegaly were only slightly better. It was concluded that assessment of liver and spleen sizes was of limited value as an indication for pF and that a considerable discrepancy existed between clinical and ultrasound based assessment of hepato- and splenomegaly.
