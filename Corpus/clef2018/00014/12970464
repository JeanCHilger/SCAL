Hepatic flow parameters measured with MR imaging and Doppler US: correlations with degree of cirrhosis and portal hypertension. To determine the correlations between hemodynamic parameters of hepatic flow measured with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and Doppler ultrasonography (US) and the severity of cirrhosis and portal hypertension.Forty-six patients referred for measurements of portal venous pressure (three with normal liver, 12 with chronic hepatitis, and 31 with cirrhosis [10 with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis 13 with class B cirrhosisWith MR imaging, all flow parameters except distribution volume were significantly different between patients with and those without cirrhosis (P <.05). There was a significant correlation between all flow parameters measured with MR imaging and portal pressure (P <.02). Apparent arterial (P =.024) and portal (P <.001) perfusion, portal fraction (P <.001), and mean transit time (P =.004) were correlated with Child-Pugh class. Flow parameters measured with Doppler US did not differ significantly between patients with and those without cirrhosis. Only right hepatic arterial resistance (P <.007) and portal flow (P <.043) were weakly (r < 0.7) correlated with portal pressure. No Doppler US parameter was correlated with Child-Pugh class.Hepatic flow parameters measured with MR imaging correlate with the severity of cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Doppler US parameters are only weakly correlated with portal pressure.
