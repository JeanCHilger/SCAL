Liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients. The results of a multicentric retrospective analysis of 265 liver resections for hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients have been collected and assessed. Overall operative mortality was 9.1%. The actuarial 3-year survival was 46.5%. Better results were obtained in patients with encapsulated lesions and alphafetoprotein levels less than 400 ng/dl. Tumoral recurrence, which was the main cause of late death, was related to alphafetoprotein higher levels and to the type of surgery performed: tumor resection with short tumour free margin had the highest recurrence rate. Results were significantly better in those centers where intraoperative ultrasonography was systematically employed.
