Percutaneous ethanol injection of hepatocellular carcinoma: survival after 3 years in 70 patients. Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) under ultrasound control is a new therapeutic procedure for cirrhotic patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our experience included 70 patients with 110 lesions (range 0.8-5 cm). Follow-up ranged from 5 to 70 months (mean: 25 months). No serious complications occurred after 930 treatments. The 1, 2, 3-year survival rates (Kaplan-Meier method) were: 96, 84, 72% for single lesions less than 5 cm and 94, 84, 25% for multiple lesions. In our opinion and in consideration of the results of other authors obtained with PEI and with surgery, single lesions less than 5 cm found in Child's A and B patients with high surgical risk or with some adverse prognostic factors for surgery, could be an indication for PEI.
