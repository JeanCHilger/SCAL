Establishing a diagnosis of adrenal metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma by 99mTc-PMT hepatobiliary scintigraphy. A 69-year-old woman was diagnosed as having hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with liver cirrhosis in October, 1984 and treated by transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE). In June, 1990 she was found to have a huge mass in the left hypochondrium which ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed to be a lett adrenal mass. A 99mTc pyridoxyl-5-methyl tryptophan (99mTC-PMT) hepatobiliary scintigraphy was positive and confirmed metastatic HCC. Although the adrenal mass was large, the HCC itself was controlled well with TAE. The adrenal mass was removed surgically in July, 1990 and the histological findings were compatible with HCC metastasized to the adrenal gland.
