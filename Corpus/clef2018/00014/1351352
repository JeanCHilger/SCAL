A review of the literature on the use of ultrasonography in schistosomiasis with special reference to its use in field studies. 2. Schistosoma mansoni. This review presents an outline of the pathology resulting from Schistosoma mansoni infections, and the ways in which it can be investigated. The use of ultrasonography is covered in detail. Ultrasonography can provide direct information about lesions in internal organs, and thus provide information about patterns of morbidity and about the regression of pathological changes after treatment. The method is non-invasive, and can be used under field conditions. Ultrasonography is valuable for the study of hepatosplenic pathology, to detect lesions such as the development of periportal fibrosis and the enlargement of the portal vein, which can indicate the development of portal hypertension. This may lead to a severe outcome, including bleeding from oesophageal varices, which is a principal cause of death from S. mansoni infection. A problem with the use of ultrasonography is that the mild lesions likely to be observed in population surveys are not always easy to assess. Ultrasonography has already been used in a number of epidemiological studies of S. mansoni infection, and has proved to be feasible and useful. However, the methodology used for ultrasound studies has varied considerably, so that it is difficult to make valid comparisons between results obtained in different places or at different times. A standardized methodology for making observations and recording the results is needed if the full potential benefit of using ultrasound in the monitoring of schistosomiasis control projects is to be realised.
