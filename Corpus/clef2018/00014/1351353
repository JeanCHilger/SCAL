A review of the literature on the use of ultrasonography in schistosomiasis with special reference to its use in field studies. 3. Schistosoma japonicum. This paper gives a brief description of the pathology resulting from Schistosoma japonicum infection, and ways in which it can be investigated. It then reviews reports of the application of ultrasound in investigating lesions in schistosomiasis japonica, including papers published in Chinese and Japanese. Ultrasonography has been widely used for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis and for the investigation of pathological changes resulting from the infection. Marked and characteristic changes are observed in the structure of the liver parenchyma in advanced disease. Chronic pathology may be seen as a result of past infection. Animal studies have been used to compare ultrasound images with actual pathological changes. Ultrasonography can also be used to detect early changes, for example periportal fibrosis, which can indicate the development of portal hypertension. The problem of differential diagnosis is discussed.
