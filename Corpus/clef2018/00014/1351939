Emission tomography for assessment of diffuse alcoholic liver disease. A method of quantitative liver tomoscintigraphy (SPECT) was compared for accuracy with planar scintigraphy (PS) in a group of patients with diffuse alcoholic liver disease. SPECT sensitivity was also compared with that of transmission computed tomography (CT), US, aminopyrine breath test (ABT) and liver chemistries (LC). One hundred and fourteen alcoholic patients with proven liver disease and 17 patients free of liver disease were included. Seven quantitative scintigraphic features and a score, including all criteria were considered. With a specificity of 95%, the sensitivity was 79% in steatosis and 97% in cirrhosis. SPECT showed a better sensitivity than PS (SPECT 89%, PS 66%), especially in patients with steatosis. In the same subsets of patients, SPECT sensitivity also compared favorably with that of transmission CT (SPECT 92%, CT 65%), ultrasonography (SPECT 88%, US 53%) and ABT (SPECT 90%, ABT 63%).
