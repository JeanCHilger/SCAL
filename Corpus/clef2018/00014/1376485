Early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. In every patient, in particular males of all ages presenting with chronically progressive diseases or cirrhosis of the liver, ultrasonography and an AFP test should be performed at intervals of six months. If hepatocellular carcinoma of the liver (HCC) is suspected (i.e. by increase of AFP or a positive result in ultrasonography), diagnosis should be confirmed by further investigations such as fine-needle biopsy guided by sonography, angiography and CT-scan. Adequate therapeutical measures such as resection of the tumor, chemotherapy, injection of alcohol or liver transplantation can thus be initiated in time. Besides efforts for early diagnosis of carcinoma of the liver, preventive measures (vaccination for hepatitis B, restrictive use of blood transfusion, reduction of alcoholism, thorough therapy of hemochromatosis, etc.) may contribute to the reduction of chronic diseases of the liver and of associated HCC.
