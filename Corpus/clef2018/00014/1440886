Sonographic changes following splenectomy for portal hypertension in Schistosoma mansoni. Eleven patients with portal hypertension due to infection with Schistosoma mansoni underwent splenectomy and devascularization operations. The patients were examined with ultrasound once preoperatively and twice postoperatively over a period of about 6 months. Following surgery there was significant and sequential reduction in the diameter of the portal vein at the hilum and the splenic vein at the pancreas. The liver lengths and index of liver size did not change significantly. No changes in the degree of periportal fibrosis could be detected.
