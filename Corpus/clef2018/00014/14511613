Klatskin tumors and Klatskin mimicking lesions of the biliary tree. We report on the preoperative capability of imaging modalities and clinical assessment to differentiate between Klatskin tumors and Klatskin mimicking lesions of the biliary tree. Adenocarcinomas of the hepatic ducts (Klatskin tumors) mimic benign fibrosing cholangitis. Extensive resections carry a substantial risk but offer the only chance for cure in patients with a Klatskin tumor.Thirty-three consecutive patients who underwent resection for suspicion of a malignant tumor of the hepatic hilum were reviewed. All patients underwent preoperative ultrasonography, computed tomography, ERCP and angiography. The patients were divided into a group of true Klatskin tumors and a group of benign Klatskin mimicking lesions.Twenty-seven of the resected specimens were malignant tumors, and six lesions showed only fibrosing cholangitis. Preoperative clinical presentation and imaging modalities were very similar between Klatskin tumors and fibrosing cholangitis.Management of obstruction of the liver hilum is dictated by the suspicion of malignancy. Complete removal of the tumor remains the therapeutic aim but clinical presentation and imaging modalities cannot help to differentiate between Klatskin tumors and Klatskin mimicking lesions prior to surgery.
