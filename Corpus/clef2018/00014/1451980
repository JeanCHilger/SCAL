Increased gastric mucosal perfusion in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy. To characterize gastric mucosal perfusion in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy, 34 cirrhotics with this lesion and 24 noncirrhotics were studied by reflectance spectrophotometry and laser-Doppler flowmetry during endoscopy. A significant correlation was observed between the hemoglobin content of the gastric mucosa, measured by reflectance spectrophotometry, and the serum hemoglobin concentration both in cirrhotics (r = 0.72) and in noncirrhotics (r = 0.87). IHb ratio (hemoglobin content of gastric mucosa divided by blood hemoglobin concentration) was higher in cirrhotics with portal hypertensive gastropathy than in noncirrhotics (P < 0.001), whereas the oxygen content of the gastric mucosa was similar in both groups. This pattern indicates that cirrhotics with portal hypertensive gastropathy have increased gastric perfusion without congestion. Gastric blood flow estimated by laser-Doppler was significantly higher in cirrhotics with portal hypertensive gastropathy than in noncirrhotics (P < 0.001). In cirrhotic patients, gastric areas with cherry red spots showed a significantly higher IHb ratio than areas with a mosaic or scarlatina pattern (P < 0.05). The magnitude of changes in gastric perfusion and the endoscopic severity of portal hypertensive gastropathy had no relationship with the degree of portal hypertension or the azygos blood flow.
