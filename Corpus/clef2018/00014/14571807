A case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): treatment with local application of alcohol and interleukin 2 (IL-2). A case of an inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma due to liver cirrhosis is presented. Surgical treatment was not clinically warranted. So we decided to induce tumor necrosis by intratumoral injections of 10 mL of ethanol followed by two treatments with 9 x 10(6) U Chiron interleukin-2 with an interval of 1 month. This ethanol-interleukin-2 cycle was repeated three times with intervals of 6 months. Interleukin-2 injections were given by a fine needle, under ultrasound control in the periphery and in the center of the tumor. The initial size of the tumor was 55-60 mm. During the follow-up period of 2 years the tumor size remained relatively unchanged. The patient died due to gastric hemorrhage. The treatment elicited no adverse clinical effects. The clinical status improved greatly after this treatment. Local interleukin-2 application after alcohol-induced tumor ablation might be an alternative if surgical treatment is not warranted.
