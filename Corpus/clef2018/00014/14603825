Clinical and aetiological profile of hepatoma at a tertiary care centre. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world. Infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the high-risk factors for the development of HCC, particularly in Asia and Africa. Other risk factors include hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and, to a certain extent, exposure to a liver-specific carcinogen such as aflatoxin B, and alcohol consumption. In the present retrospective study, we analysed the clinical profile and aetiological role of HBV and HCV in HCC. A total of 40 cases of HCC (33 males and 7 females, age range 22-80 years) were seen from January 1999 to June 2001 at our institute. A detailed history of age, sex, past history of liver disease, clinical symptoms and presenting complaints was recorded. The most common presenting complaints were abdominal distention, pedal oedema and pain abdomen. Underlying cirrhosis of the liver was seen in 30 cases (75%), Child's A in 6, Child's B in 11 and Child's C in 13 cases. A history of alcoholism was present in 6 patients. All the patients were tested for HBsAg and anti-HCV by ELISA. HBsAg and anti-HCV was positive in 19 (47.5%) and 8 patients (20%), respectively. The diagnosis in the majority of cases was derived by FNAC and in a few by imaging techniques plus alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) evaluation. The diagnosis was confirmed by FNAC in 34, CT scan and AFP in 2, and ultrasound abdomen and AFP in 4 cases. We conclude that viral infection (HBV > HCV) is still a major aetiological factor and the incidence of HCV infection appears to be increasing. The majority of the cases of HCC studied had a cirrhotic background.
