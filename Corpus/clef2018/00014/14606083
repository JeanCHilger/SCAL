Influence factors of serum fibrosis markers in liver fibrosis. To analyze the factors which influence the serum levels of hyaluronic acid (HA), type III pro-collagen (PCIII), laminin (LN) and type IV collagen (C-IV) in liver fibrosis.The serum specimens from 141 chronic hepatitis patients were assayed for fibrosis indexes including HA, PCIII, LN and C-IV with radioimmunoassay (RIA) and liver function indexes by an automatic biochemistry analyzer. The patients were then divided into consistent group and inconsistent group. The patients'clinical manifestations were recorded, routine blood pictures were done by a blood counter and analyzer (AC-900). Liver biopsy specimens were examined path-morphologically. The inner diameters of portal vein, splenic vein and thickness of spleen were all measured by ultrasonography.Sixteen patients (14.16%) had serum fibrosis indexes inconsistent with histological stage of their hepatic fibrosis. Their serum fibrosis indexes did not correlate with the stage of hepatic fibrosis (P>0.05), but were positively correlated with the grade of inflammation (chi2=12.07, P<0.05). At the same time, serum albumin (ALB) and the ratio of albumin and globulin (A/G) were significantly increased (t=3.06, P<0.01), (t=3.70, P<0.01). Serum levels of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (ALT), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and globulin (GLB) were all significantly decreased (t=2.45, P<0.05), (t=2.33, P<0.05), (t=2.08, P<0.05), (t=3.03, P<0.01). Weary degree also decreased more obviously (chi2=7.52, P<0.05), but other clinical manifestations, routine blood indexes, serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (AKP), total bilirubin (TBIL), total protein (TP), width of main portal vein, width of splenic vein and thickness of spleen had no significant change (P>0.05).Serum fibrosis indexes can be influenced by the grade of inflammation, some liver function indexes and clinical manifestations. Comprehensive analysis is necessary for its proper interpretation.
