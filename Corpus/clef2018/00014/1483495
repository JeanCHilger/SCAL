Effect of propranolol on urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion and renal interlobar arterial blood flow after furosemide administration in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. The effect of propranolol on furosemide-stimulated urinary prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) excretion and renal blood flow was evaluated in 12 patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Plasma and urine were collected before and 60 min after furosemide 20 mgI with or without propranolol pretreatment, and plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), urinary excretion of PGE2 and sodium were determined. The renal interlobar arterial Pulsatility Index (PI), as an index of resistance to blood flow, was also determined before and 60 min after furosemide administration with and without propranolol pretreatment, by using a duplex Doppler ultrasound (Hitachi EUB 565). Urine volume and sodium excretion after furosemide administration were not influenced by the propranolol pretreatment. Furosemide administration significantly increased urinary PGE2 excretion, PRA and PAC, and these effects were significantly reduced by propranolol. Furosemide administration with or without propranolol significantly reduced renal interlobar arterial PI, the average reduction in PI being significantly lower after furosemide administration with propranolol pretreatment. The results demonstrate that propranolol pretreatment significantly influenced the furosemide-induced increase in urinary PGE2 excretion and renal interlobar arterial blood flow in cirrhotic patients.
