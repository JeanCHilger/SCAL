Hemospermia: cause, clinical significance and our experience. The hemospermia is first of inflammatory origin, in the young, where it is due to urethro-prostatitis or orchio-epididymitis, in the old, to benign or malignant prostatic tumours. In 30-70% of the cases it is idiopathic. It can be connected with a prolonged sexual abstinence or with intense sexual activity. Predisposing diseases are prostatitis, epididymitis, urinary stones, gonorrhea, syphilis, tuberculosis, cirrhosis of the liver, blood hypertension, haematologic diseases. Our casistics, 60 patients in 4 years (1987-1990), has showed the hemospermia as isolated episode in 20% of the cases, in 35% associated with urologic symptoms. Juvenile forms, connected with urethro-prostatitis, are often associated with the echographic presence of periurethral calcifications or to a swelling of the seminal vesicles. In 8 patients, the hemospermia was recurrent, and due to a prostatic tumour. In 2 patients, with recurrent hemospermia, a urogenital tuberculosis has been detected.
