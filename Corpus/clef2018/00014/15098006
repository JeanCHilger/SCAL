Histologic changes mimicking biliary disease in liver biopsies with venous outflow impairment. Impairment of venous outflow from the liver manifests as zone 3 sinusoidal dilatation and congestion (SDC) in liver biopsy. The spectrum of histologic changes in portal tracts has not been described. We studied liver biopsies from 34 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of venous outflow impairment (VOI). Liver transplant recipients and biopsies with cirrhosis and hepatic neoplasms were excluded. Clinical records were reviewed for laboratory tests and radiographic findings. In all, 19 patients had right heart disease, 13 had classic Budd-Chiari syndrome and two had veno-occlusive disease. Liver chemistry tests showed elevated liver transaminases (n=21 61.8%), elevated alkaline phosphatase (n=31
