Portal vein aneurysm as late complication of liver transplantation: a case report. A case of intrahepatic portal vein aneurysm in the late postoperative period after liver transplantation, as well its complications, is reported.A 59-year-old man underwent orthotopic liver transplantation in 1996 for treatment of hepatitis C virus cirrhosis. The patient received a graft from a 10-year-old child. During the follow-up from 1996 to 1998, the patient did not show any alterations. In 1999, during an annual routine exam, a portal vein aneurysm was identified however, it had no impact on graft function. In November 2002, the patient developed jaundice and serious graft dysfunction requiring hospital admission. Helicoidal CT scan showed an intrahepatic image compatible with a portal vein aneurysm without biliary tract dilatation. During the same hospitalization, he developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to variceal rupture as well as kidney and liver failure, and expired on December 31, 2002. The necropsy demonstrated an intrahepatic portal vein aneurysm with portal vein thrombosis and chronic liver disease. The evolution in this case suggests that if there is an intrahepatic portal vein aneurysm after liver transplantation, the patient is likely to experience an eventual recurrence of portal hypertension
