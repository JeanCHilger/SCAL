Non-pulsatile hepatic and portal vein waveforms in patients with liver cirrhosis: concordant and discordant relationships. The relationship between hepatic vein waveform and portal vein waveform (HVW and PVW) was evaluated in 54 healthy subjects and 148 patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension using spectral Doppler ultrasound recordings. In all healthy subjects, the HVW was triphasic and the PVW was slightly pulsatile. 51 of 148 patients (34.5%) had flat non pulsatile HVW with a significantly higher incidence in Child C vs Child A patients (48.9% vs 20.7%, respectively p<0.01) while 56 of 148 patients (37.8%) had flat PVW, also with significantly higher incidence in Child C vs Child A patients (46.7% vs 25.9%, respectively
