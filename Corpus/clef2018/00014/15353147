Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver cancer remains one of the most common causes of cancer death globally, and its cure rate has not improved for the past 20 years. Hepatocellular carcinoma develops in patients with cirrhosis of any etiology. Patients with cirrhosis are thus usually included in screening program aiming to achieve early detection and effective treatment for HCC. Only those patients diagnosed with HCC who would benefit with the available treatment, should undergo the screening procedure. This is based on ultrasonography and alpha-fetoprotein every 3-6 months based on the prevalence and economic status of the community being tested.
