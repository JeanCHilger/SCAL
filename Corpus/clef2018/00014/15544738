Spontaneous aneurysmal portohepatic fistula: imaging diagnosis. Intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunts not related to trauma or biopsy are infrequent and their etiology is controversial. A congenital or acquired origin due to cirrhosis and portal hypertension has been proposed. Hepatic encephalopathy is present when there is associated cirrhosis. We describe a case of aneurysmal portohepatic venous fistula that was incidentally diagnosed with conventional ultrasonography and was subsequently confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomography scan. Because there were no symptoms of encephalopathy, no surgical or vascular percutaneous treatment was provided.
