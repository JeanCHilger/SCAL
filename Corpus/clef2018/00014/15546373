Transesophageal echocardiography-guided transvenous biopsy of an intracardiac tumor. Transesophageal echocardiography with simultaneous fluoroscopic guidance during a transvenous biopsy of an intracardiac tumor is a valuable technique. We present the case of a 67-year-old man with a metastasis in the right atrium from which histological examination of the tumor was indicated. The inaccessible location of the primary tumor in the liver and impaired hemostasis due to cirrhosis necessitated a transvenous biopsy of the metastasis. The procedure and the associated techniques are discussed in this case.
