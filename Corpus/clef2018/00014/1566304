Morbidity due to schistosomiasis japonica in the People's Republic of China. Transmission and morbidity induced by Schistosoma japonicum were evaluated in 825 individuals undergoing periodic treatment with praziquantel on Jishan island, Jiangxi Providence, in the People's Republic of China. Eggs of S. japonicum were found in the stools of 39.4% of the population 70% of those infected were less than 20 years of age. Hepatomegaly greater than 3 cm in the midsternal line was detected by physical examination and ultrasonography in 75% and 90% of individuals, respectively, regardless of infection status. Symmer's clay pipe-stem fibrosis of the liver was detected by ultrasonography in 20% of all individuals. Hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody to hepatitis C were found in 11% and less than 1% of the population, respectively. Our study suggests that, despite intermittent chemotherapy, morbidity due to S. japonicum is still a significant problem in China.
