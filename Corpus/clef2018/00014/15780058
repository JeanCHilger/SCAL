Reduced prevalence of ischemic events and abnormal supraortic flow patterns in patients with liver cirrhosis. A reduced prevalence of cardiovascular diseases has been reported in liver cirrhosis. However, studies focusing on supraortic district of cirrhotic patients are lacking.By ultrasound duplex scanning, the presence and severity of atherosclerotic plaques and flow pattern abnormalities were assessed in carotid and vertebral arteries of 118 cirrhotics aged 60.7 +/- 12.8 (1 standard deviation) years, and in 236 controls matched with cirrhotic patients according to age, sex and cigarette smoking.Previous ischemic strokes were significantly less numerous in cirrhotic patients than in controls (0.8% vs. 10.5% P = 0.0009)Advanced liver disease is associated with a reduced prevalence of ischemic stroke, which seems to be related to a decreased prevalence of abnormal flow patterns in the supraortic vessels, especially among non-smokers.
