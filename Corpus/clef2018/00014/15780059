Intrahepatic circulatory time analysis of an ultrasound contrast agent in liver cirrhosis. To assess the diagnostic accuracy and advantages of intrahepatic circulatory time analysis of an ultrasound contrast agent using pulse-inversion imaging as compared with recently reported noninvasive diagnostic tests for cirrhosis.Forty patients divided into noncirrhotic (nonLC) (n = 20) and compensated cirrhotic (LC) (n = 20) groups were studied prospectively. After intravenous administration of a contrast agent, the arrival times at the hepatic artery (HA), portal vein (PV), and hepatic vein (HV) were measured by pulse-inversion imaging. Intrahepatic circulatory time was calculated as the difference between the HV and HA arrival times (HV-HA interval time) or the HV and PV arrival times (HV-PV interval time).The HV-HA and HV-PV interval times were significantly shorter in the LC group (7.4 +/- 1.7 and 1.9 +/- 1.5 s, respectively) compared with those in the nonLC group (normal: 15.6 +/- 2.1 and 11.1 +/- 1.7 s, respectively P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively, and hepatitis: 12.8 +/- 4.1 and 7.8 +/- 4.4 s, respectivelyThis analysis, which is considered to reflect intrahepatic hemodynamic changes, is a useful noninvasive diagnostic test for compensated cirrhosis.
