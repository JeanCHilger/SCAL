Ultrasonography of diffuse liver disease. A review. Radiographically, the liver may appear normal even if severely diseased. Ultrasonography can be an important adjunct in the evaluation of diffuse parenchymal hepatic disease. Diffuse liver disease appears ultrasonographically as a change in liver echogenicity from normal when compared with the renal cortex or spleen. Diffuse liver disease can be characterized as either hyperechoic due to fatty change, steroid hepatopathy, and cirrhosis or hypoechoic due to congestion, suppurative hepatitis, and lymphoma. Ultrasonographic diagnosis of diffuse liver disease should be substantiated by biopsy and histopathologic evaluation.
