Ultrasound guidance in the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG): an adjuvant technique in patients with abdominal wall varices? Malnutrition in patients with liver disease is common. As a result, enteral feeding may be indicated. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion is rarely performed because the presence of varices is considered to be a contraindication. We report a case of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion in a patient with both gastric and oesophageal varices. The use of abdominal ultrasound may provide an adjuvant tool for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion. This novel technique may minimise the risk of complications in selected patients.
