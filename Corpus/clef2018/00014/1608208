The Doppler sonographic measurement of the blood flow in the portal vein system in portal hypertension. Diagnostic potentialities of Doppler sonography in assessment of portal hemodynamics in patients with chronic active hepatitis and hepatic cirrhosis were compared to those of noninvasive (rheohepatography) and invasive (angiography) techniques. Dopplerograms of the portal vein and its branches are described in specific details. Meals and treatment with beta-adrenoblockers reducing portal hypertension are evaluated in relation to their influence on the portal hepatic circulation.
