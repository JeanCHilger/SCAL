Sonographic determination of liver volume. Problems, methods and practical significance of liver volume measurements (author's transl). A sonographic procedure is described which permits accurate determination of liver volume by simple means. Comparison between the sonographic measurements and volume determinations at autopsy carried out by water displacement of the isolated organ showed a statistical error of +/- 1.58% and for average liver volumes of 1,800 ml and 95% limits of confidence of -84 to +20 ml. Quantitation of liver size may be an important clinical measurement, e.g. in assessing the possibility of shunts in the lieno-portal system in portal hypertension with recurrent bleeding from oesophageal varices due to cirrhosis of the liver, for evaluating liver atrophy after shunts affecting the liver, for demonstrating liver size in right heart insufficiency and congestive states or for the control of the effectiveness of cytostatic drugs in lymphatic or haematological disease.
