Diagnosis and treatment of congenital biliary duct cyst: twenty-year experience. To summarize the experience in diagnosis and treatment of congenital biliary duct cyst.Clinical data from 108 patients treated from 1980 to 2000 were analyzed retrospectively.Abdominal pain, jaundice and abdominal mass were presented in most pediatric patients. Clinical symptoms in adult patients were non-specific, resulting in delayed diagnosis frequently. Fifty-seven patients (52.7%) had coexistent pancreatic biliary disease. Carcinoma of the biliary duct occurred in 18 patients (16.6%). Ultrasonic examination was performed in 94 patients, ERCP in 46, and CT in 71. All of the patients were correctly diagnosed before operation. Abnormal pancreatobiliary duct junction was found in 39 patients. Before 1985, the diagnosis and classification of congenital biliary duct cyst were established by ultrasonography preoperatively and confirmed during operation. The main procedure was internal drainage by cyst-enterostomy. After 1985, the diagnosis was decided with ERCP and CT, the procedure was cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. In 1994, we used a new and simplified operative procedure to reduce the risk of malignancy of choledochal cyst. Retrograde infection of the biliary tract the major postoperative complication, could be controlled by the administration of antibiotics.The concept in diagnosis and treatment of congenital choledochal cyst has been changed greatly. CT and ERCP are of great help in the classification of the disease. Currently, cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is strongly recommended as the treatment of choice for patients with type I and IV cysts. Piggyback orthotopic liver transplantation is indicated for type V cysts (Caroli's disease) with frequently recurrent cholangitis, resulting in biliary cirrhosis.
