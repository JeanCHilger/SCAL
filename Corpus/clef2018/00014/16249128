Spontaneous regression of hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhosis developed in childhood. We reported two cases of hepatitis B virus infection-related cirrhosis developed during childhood and followed up for more than 20 years. Both the subjects remained untreated, and ultimately regression of cirrhosis was documented by clinical (including ultrasound) and histological examination. Recent studies have already suggested that hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis may regress after treatment, but this is the first demonstration that hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhosis developed in childhood may be a spontaneously reversible process. Subsidence of virus replication and of necro-inflammatory process and the efficiency of liver regeneration and repair might contribute to this favourable outcome.
