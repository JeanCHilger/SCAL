Complications after percutaneous liver biopsy in diffuse hepatopathies. Liver biopsy is nowadays a well established procedure in the diagnosis and follow up of liver disease. It is indicated in various clinical settings to establish a diagnosis, to assess prognosis and to monitor therapy. Complications are infrequent, most of them being minor (pain and vasovagal reaction). Major complications occur less frequently, the most important being bleeding. Several factors are associated with the tendency to bleed: coagulation abnormality, presence of liver cirrhosis or malignancy, inexperienced operator, blind technique and increased number of passes. Ultrasound guided liver biopsy is nowadays a very debated issue. It has been demonstrated that it decreases the rate of both minor and major complications after liver biopsy and it is cost effective. Outpatient liver biopsy has gained more acceptance today, being well-accepted by the patients and less costly.
