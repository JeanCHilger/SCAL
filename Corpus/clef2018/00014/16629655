Salmonellosis with liver abscess mimicking hepatocellular carcinoma in a diabetic and cirrhotic patient: a case report and review of the literature. Salmonellosis with liver abscess in a cirrhotic liver is extremely rare. We report the first case of Salmonellosis with septic shock and liver abscess in a diabetic and cirrhotic patient. The image studies of liver initially favored hepatocellular carcinoma. But no definite focus of sepsis was found. After close follow-up of the liver space-occupied lesion, ultrasound examination revealed the features of liver abscesses at space-occupied lesion later. Ultrasound-guided liver aspiration proved abscess. The clinical and radiological responses were good after antibiotics treatment.
