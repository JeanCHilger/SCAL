Three-Port laparoscopic partial hepatectomy using an ultrasonically activated device (USAD). We provide an initial report of the indications and procedure for three-port laparoscopic partial hepatectomy.Three-port laparoscopic partial hepatectomy was performed in nine patients (age, 49 to 73 years) at our department. Eight patients (seven men and one woman) had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) six of these patients had liver cirrhosis (LC) and two had chronic hepatitis (CH). The ninth patient, a woman had a single metastatic liver tumor from colon cancer. The tumors were located in regons S(2), S(3), S(4), S(5), S(6), and S(8). Preoperative liver function assessment revealed Child-Pugh classification A or B. All the tumors were located superficially, and their diameter averaged approximately 3 cm. Hepatectomy was performed laparoscopically, using an ultrasonically activated device (USAD) with or without microwave coagulation therapy (MCT).The operative time was 50 to 168 min, and the intraoperative blood loss ranged from 32 to 158 g. The postoperative hospital stay was 5 to 17 days. No recurrences, including local relapse, were observed.Three-port laparoscopic partial hepatectomy is safe and feasible for patients with Child-Pugh liver function classification A or B if the tumor is located superficially and is less than 3 cm in diameter.
