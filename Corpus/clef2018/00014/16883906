Effects of syndrome dependent umbilical sticking with shizhang cataplasm and xuzhang cataplasm in treating Cirrhosis caused ascites. To investigate the effects of Shizhang Cataplasm (SC) and Xuzhang Cataplasm (XC) in treating liver cirrhosis caused ascites of excessive syndrome (ES) type and deficient syndrome (DS) type respectively.All the 77 patients (37 of ES type and 40 of DS type) enrolled were treated by conventional treatment but with restrictive use of diuretics. SC and XC were given respectively to 26 patients of ES type and 26 of DS type additionally by umbilical sticking, they were regarded as the treated group, and those (11 of ES type and 14 of DS type) not received the cataplasm treatment were regarded as the control group. The changes of symptoms, body weight, abdominal perimeter and amount of urine before and after treatment were observed, and amount of ascites was examined with B-ultrasound to evaluate the efficacy according to comprehensive grading criteria. Also, the toxicity was observed.Sixty-two cases completed the full course, 15 were withdrawn. As compared with the corresponding control group, body weight, abdominal perimeter and amount of ascites decreased, while amount of urine and flatus discharging increased remarkably in the treated group (P < 0.05). The comprehensive efficacy in patients of ES type was better than that in DS type (P < 0.05). The effective rate of grade I/II was 7.1% and 9.1% for patients in the control group of DS type and ES type respectively, while it was 57.2% and 69.2% in the treated group of DS and ES type respectively. Better therapeutic effect was shown in patients of ES type treated with SC.SC and XC showed good assistant effects in treating patients with liver cirrhosis caused ascites of ES and DS type respectively.
