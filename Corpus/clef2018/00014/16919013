Successful treatment of portopulmonary hypertension with bosentan: case report. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is found in 2-20% of cirrhosis patients who have portal hypertension (portopulmonary hypertension, PPHT). Endothelin (ET), a potent vasoconstrictor, is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of portal hypertension. We describe the long-term successful use of the dual ET(A)/ET(B) receptor antagonist bosentan in a 43-year-old male with alcohol-related cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), right ventricular enlargement and dysfunction, respectively, and moderate PAH. Elevated pulmonary arterial pressure was substantially reduced and exercise capacity increased. Improvement was maintained over 2 years, and bosentan treatment continues in this patient. Our report is in line with a series of current reports in PPHT that support the use of bosentan in this subset of PAH patients.
