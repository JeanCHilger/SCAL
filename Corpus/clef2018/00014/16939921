An ultrasonographic scoring system for screening compensated liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C virus infection. To investigate the correlation between the stage of hepatic fibrosis and ultrasonographic findings of the liver, spleen and gallbladder and establish a sensitive ultrasonographic semi-quantitative scoring system for screening compensated liver cirrhosis.Totalling 248 patients with chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infection underwent liver biopsy and ultrasonic examination. The images of the liver surface, parenchymal echo, intrahepatic vessels, gallbladder, spleen and diameter of portal vein were analyzed.The stages of hepatic fibrosis were not correlated to ultrasonographic findings of the liver surface or diameter of portal vein, but hepatic fibrosis of different stages showed significant differences in parenchymal echo, intrahepatic vessels, gallbladder and splenomegaly. In cases with normal liver parenchymal, intrahepatic vessels, gallbladder and spleen, the negative predictive value of the ultrasonographic semi-quantitative scoring system for diagnosing compensated liver cirrhosis amounted to 96.3%. The sensitivity of a score not lower than 5 was 90% for detecting compensated cirrhosis. With a score not lower than 7, the diagnostic accuracy and specificity was 85.9% and 95.2%, respectively, but the sensitivity was lowered to 37.5%.The ultrasonic images of the liver parenchyma, intrahepatic vessels, gallbladder and spleen in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis vary significantly in patients with hepatic fibrosis of different stages, and this ultrasonographic scoring system allows for a sensitive diagnosis of compensated cirrhosis.
