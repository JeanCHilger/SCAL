Doppler study of hepatic vein in cirrhotic patients: correlation with liver dysfunction and hepatic hemodynamics. To elucidate the significance of Doppler measurements of hepatic vein in cirrhotic patients and to correlate with liver dysfunction and hepatic hemodynamics.One hundred patients with liver cirrhosis and 60 non-cirrhotic controls were studied. Doppler waveforms were obtained from right hepatic vein and flow velocity measured during quiet respiration. Doppler measurements were also obtained from portal trunk, right portal vein and proper hepatic artery.Hepatic vein waveforms were classified into three classical patterns. Flat waveform was uncommon. Mean hepatic vein velocity was significantly higher in cirrhotic patients (12.7 +/- 6.4 vs 5.1 +/- 2.1 and 6.2 +/- 3.2 cm/s P<0.0001). The poorer the grade of cirrhosis, the higher was the mean velocity. Maximum forward velocity was never greater than 40 cm/s in controls. Degree of ascites was found to be highly correlated with mean velocity. "Very highq group (>=20 cm/s) presented clinically with moderate to massive ascites. Correlations between right portal flow and mean velocity was significant (P<0.0001, r = 0.687).Doppler waveforms of hepatic vein, which is independent of liver dysfunction, should be obtained during normal respiration. Mean hepatic vein velocity reflects the change in hepatic circulation associated with progression of liver cirrhosis. It can be used as a new parameter in the assessment of liver cirrhosis.
