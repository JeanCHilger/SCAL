Study on the relationship between the degree of periportal fibrosis, hepatic parenchymatous fibrosis and diameter of portal vein in Schistosoma japonicum infection. The degree of periportal fibrosis, hepatic parenchymatous fibrosis and the diameter of portal vein in fishermen from highly endemic area of schistosomiasis japonica in Dongting Lake region were measured. The results showed a significant correlation between the degree of periportal fibrosis and parenchymatous fibrosis and the portal venous diameter with a correlation coefficient of 0.375 and 0.332 respectively. The authors consider that the diameter of the portal vein can be used to assess the hepatic morbidity of patients.
