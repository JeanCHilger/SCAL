Results and place of Fibroscan in the non-invasive diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis. Diagnosis of liver fibrosis by transient elastography (Fibroscan) is a new and non-invasive method. We report its results, and compare them with the non-invasive biological tests.Fibroscan is validated for chronic hepatitis C, allowing to diagnose the fibrosis (MÃ©tavir) F2, F3 and F4 with areas under the ROC curve of 0.79-0.83, 0.90-0.91 and 0.91-0.97 respectively. The non-invasive diagnosis of the cirrhosis can be made with positive and negative predictive values from 70 to 95% and 77 in 95%. Preliminary data concern the HCV-HIV co-infections, primary biliary cirrhosis, NASH, portal hypertension, and the follow-up of the hepatic fibrosis. These results are altogether comparable to the various non-invasive biological tests, for cirrhosis diagnosis.It's remain to determine the respective places of Fibroscan and non-invasive biological tests, in the liver fibrosis diagnosis.
