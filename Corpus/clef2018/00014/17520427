Factors predicting complete necrosis rate after ultrasound-guided percutaneous laser thermoablation of small hepatocellular carcinoma tumors in cirrhotic patients: a multivariate analysis. To assess factors affecting the effectiveness of percutaneous laser ablation (PLA) under ultrasound (US) guidance in terms of complete ablation achievement.The clinical records of 86 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors (mean diameter 23.7 mm) in 60 cirrhotic patients (mean age 68.3 years 36 malesComplete ablation was obtained in 62 nodules (72%). Statistically significant predictors of incomplete ablation after the first PLA course at both univariate and multivariate analysis included: infiltrating growth pattern (odds ratio (OR) 12.3, P<0.002), non-naïve tumors (OR 8.7, P<0.001), and first period of treatment (OR 10.3, P<0.002).The effectiveness of US-guided PLA for HCC tumors < or =4 cm turned out to be negatively affected by both operator-related (the beginning of the operator's experience with the technique) and tumor-related factors (non-naïve, infiltrating HCC tumors).
