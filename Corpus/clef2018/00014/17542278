Prevalence of NAFLD and metabolic syndrome in asymtomatics subjects. Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a frequent entity to progress to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, and it is associated with several metabolic disturbances. The insulin resistance is often considered the link between metabolic disturbances and NAFLD. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of NAFLD in healthy population and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in this patients. The associated factors to develop liver cirrhosis were identified.2,503 records were reviewed and the presence of steatosis was determined by ultrasonography. A clinical and biochemical examination was carried out and the metabolic criteria were defined according to the ATP III.427 (17.05%) patients with NAFLD were detected. 359 (14.3%) with NAFLD were included, the mean age was 46.26 +/- 9.85 years. Overweight was present in 46.79% and obesity in 36.49% of patients. The association between DM, HAS, high levels of cholesterol and triglicerides was found in 3.6, 13.6, 63 and 43%, respectively. Steatohepatitis was found in in 34% of patients high levels of AST. AST/ALT ratio > 1 was detected in 76 patients (21.16%). According to the ATP III criteria, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with NAFLD was 22.8%.The frequency of NAFLD and metabolic syndrome in this study was 14.3% and 22.8%, respectively. Overweight, obesity and dyslipidemia were the main associated factors to NAFLD.
