How should we manage patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in 2007? Evidence-based management guidelines for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are lacking in the Asia-Pacific region or elsewhere. This review reports the results of a systematic literature search and expert opinions. The Asia-Pacific Working Party on NAFLD (APWP-NAFLD) has generated practical recommendations on management of NAFLD in this region. NAFLD should be suspected when there are metabolic risk factors and/or characteristic changes on hepatic ultrasonography. Diagnosis by ultrasonography, assessment of liver function and complications, exclusion of other liver diseases and screening for metabolic syndrome comprise initial assessment. Liver biopsy should be considered when there is diagnostic uncertainty, for patients at risk of advanced fibrosis, for those enrolled in clinical trials and at laparoscopy for another purpose. Lifestyle measures such as dietary restrictions and increased physical activity (aerobic exercise) should be encouraged, although the best management strategy to achieve this has yet to be defined. Complications of metabolic syndrome should be screened for regularly. Use of statins to treat hypercholesterolemia is safe and recommended frequent alanine aminotransferase (ALT) monitoring is not required. Obese patients who do not respond to lifestyle measures should be referred to centers specializing in obesity management
