Liver morbidity due to Schistosoma mekongi in Cambodia after seven rounds of mass drug administration. Severe liver disease due to Schistosoma mekongi was frequent in northern Cambodia. Between 1995 and 2002, seven rounds of mass chemotherapy (praziquantel) reduced infection from 50% to below 3%. In 2002, we assessed hepatosplenic morbidity by historical, clinical and ultrasonographic investigations in adults (older than 14 years) from endemic (n=342) and non-endemic (n=103) areas (Kratie province). Clinical hepatomegaly (25 vs. 0%), splenomegaly (55 vs. 0%), reported blood in stool (41 vs. 20%) and abdominal pain (78 vs. 57%) were significantly higher in the endemic area. In this area, significantly more subjects reported a family history of death due to schistosomiasis (12 vs. 0%) 63% (vs. 0%) reported having at least three treatments of praziquantel in previous years
