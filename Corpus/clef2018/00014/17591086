Hepatic radionuclide angiography and Doppler ultrasonography in the detection and assessment of vascular disturbances in the portal system. The aim of the study was evaluation of the morphology of the blood vessels, blood flow velocity and direction with Doppler ultrasound (D-US) and correlation with the relative liver parenchymal perfusion assessed by hepatic radionuclide angiography (HRA).Real-time, D-US and HRA were performed in 108 patients.In patients with portal venous aneurysm, hepatopetal blood flow was increased, while portal perfusion did not differ from controls. In portal hypertensive patients, D-US detected dilatation of the portal system veins, with decreased blood flow. In comparison to the portal perfusion in controls and portal venous aneurysm, values were significantly (p < 0.01) lower in chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis and differed between themselves (p < 0.01). In the groups of cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices, sclerosed esophageal varices, recanalized umbilical vein, partial portal thrombosis and cavernous portal vein with hepatofugal, hyperkinetic or slow blood flow, and very low velocities beside the thrombi, portal perfusion was lower (p < 0.01) than in controls, portal venous aneurysm, chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis without collaterals. In complete thrombosis, minimal collateral flow was found with D-US, while HRA proved no portal supply.D-US and HRA are complementary for the estimation of various liver vascular disorders.
