Cholestatic hepatitis in situs inversus abdominalis. A 75 year old patient was admitted to hospital due to painless jaundice and fatigue. Patient's history was not remarkable for chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, hereditary metabolic disorders or a hepatotoxic damage. Laboratory tests revealed significant elevation of the parameters of cholestasis and aminotransferase activity, a significantly elevated titer of both antinuclear (ANA) and antimitochondrial (AMA) antibodies. Abdominal ultrasound and computertomography showed no mechanic cholestasis nor tumorous process but a situs inversus abdominalis of the abdominal parenchymatous organs. Portal and periportal inflammation, consistent with autoimmune hepatitis, was diagnosed histologically after performing laparoscopic liver biopsy. Regarding the significantly elevated cholestatic parameters and the positive AMA-autoantibodies AIH-PBC overlap syndrome was highly probable so medical treatment including both ursodeoxycholic acid and immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids and azathioprine was started resulting in a continous downward tendency of liver enzymes and an improvement of the patient's clinical condition. Finding the correct diagnosis and therapy of autoimmune liver disease is not always easy and unproblematic. Regarding its sometimes fatal progression and good response towards medical treatment prompt diagnosis and institution of autoimmune hepatitis--alone or combined as PBC/AIH overlap syndrome--should not be deferred. Laparoscopic liver biopsy should be the method of choice in patients's with situs inversus abdominalis regading the variable anatomy.
