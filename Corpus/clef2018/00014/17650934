Angioma-like liver lesions in patients with chronic liver disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate in our healthcare area the clinical, ultrasonographic, and evolutionary features of patients with chronic liver disease and angioma-like liver lesions on ultrasonography.We conducted a retrospective study amongst patients seen at the Ultrasonography Unit, Gastroenterology Department between January 2000 and June 2004. Included in the study were patients that presented with clinical and/or laboratory complaints consistent with chronic liver disease of any etiology, and those in which abdominal ultrasounds revealed the existence of at least one angioma-like liver lesion. All relevant epidemiological, clinical, ultrasonographic, and evolutionary data were carefully collected and recorded.In the course of our study, 58 patients were diagnosed with chronic liver disease and angioma-like liver lesions, of which 13 showed clinical, laboratory, ultrasonographic, and/or histological signs of liver cirrhosis. In 50% of patients these lesions were less than 10 mm in diameter, and in most cases were located in the right hepatic lobe. During an average follow-up period of 35 months (6-168 months) we verified that, in two patients, these lesions, initially interpreted as angiomas were in fact malignancies (one hepatocellular carcinoma and one metastatic adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder). In both cases, the patients were cirrhotic. Thus, our study revealed that 15% of lesions found in cirrhotic patients initially interpreted as angiomas were actually malignant.Our study revealed that, in patients with chronic liver disease, particularly in cirrhotic patients, a considerable percentage of ultrasonographic lesions originally interpreted as angiomas are in fact malignant tumors.
