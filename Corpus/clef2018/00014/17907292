Clinical significance of activity of ALT enzyme in patients with hepatitis C virus. To investigate serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in relation to the clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographic and histological characteristics of patients with hepatitis C virus.Duration of disease, HCV-RNA, liver steatosis, and the hepatitis activity index (HAI) were correlated with serum ALT in 36 patients with HCV. ALT values were also investigated in 16 control subjects without any liver diseases.In bivariate analyses, ALT levels correlated with duration of HCV infection (P < 0.01), HCV-RNA (P < 0.05), and the HAI (P < 0.01). Among the components of the HAI, ALT concentrations were significantly associated with periportal bridging/necrosis (P < 0.01) and fibrosis (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, periportal bridging/necrosis (beta = 0.508 P < 0.01), duration of HCV infection (beta = 0.413In patients with HCV, alterations in the liver tissue as reflected by ALT elevation are mainly associated with periportal bridging/necrosis, viral load and duration of disease. A cut-off value < 23 IU/L distinguished with high diagnostic accuracy healthy controls from patients with HCV.
