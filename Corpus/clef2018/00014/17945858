The effects of sampling rate on the texture separability of ultrasound images. Ultrasound machine has been a useful diagnosis tool for several decades, and many researches tried to use computerized algorithms to help physicians diagnose diseases according to the ultrasound texture patterns. However, the effects of sampling format and the sampling rate on the texture feature were not treated properly. In this paper, the authors try to evaluate the effects of the scan conversion done at imaging stage and the sampling rate used at the texture feature extraction stage. They demonstrate the indispensability of considering sampling format and sampling rate according to the feature used, and their proposed method would improve the separability of texture feature for coarse and homogeneous ultrasound images.
