Non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis by transient elastography in post transfusional iron overload. Liver fibrosis, assessed by biopsy, is the main complication of post transfusional liver iron overload. Transient elastography (TE) is a new, non invasive method able to measure liver stiffness (LS) caused by fibrosis.We prospectively evaluated the predictive value of LS measurement for liver fibrosis evaluation in 15 chronically transfused patients and compared these results with the METAVIR histological fibrosis stage from liver biopsies.Mean TE values significantly differed in patients with severe fibrosis (METAVIR F3, F4): 9.1 (+/-3.7 SD) kPa from those with mild or no fibrosis (METAVIR F0, F1, F2): 5.9 (+/-1.8 SD) kPa (P = 0.046). TE value above 6.25 kPa (Se = 80% Sp = 70%Transient elastography appears to be a reliable tool to evaluate liver fibrosis in post-transfusional iron overload.
