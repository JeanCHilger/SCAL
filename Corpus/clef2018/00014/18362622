Systematic extended right posterior sectionectomy: a safe and effective alternative to right hepatectomy. A surgical approach based on ultrasound-guided hepatectomy might minimize the need for major resection, whose rates of morbidity and mortality are not negligible. Right hepatectomy (RH) is traditionally performed in cases of vascular invasion of the right hepatic vein with multiple tumors in the right posterior section, and/or of the right posterior portal branch (P6-7) with tumor in contact with right anterior portal branch (P5-8). We herein describe an alternative approach to RH consisting in ultrasound-guided systematic extended right posterior hepatic sectionectomy (SERPS).Among 207 consecutive patients who underwent hepatectomies, 21 (10%) underwent SERPS. Median age was 67 years (range, 48-79). There were 13 men and 8 women. Ten (48%) patients had hepatocellular carcinoma 11 (52%) had colorectal liver metastases. Median tumor number was 2 (range, 1-15)In-hospital and 90-days mortality were nil. Major and minor morbidity occurred in 3 (14%) and 2 (9.5%) patients, respectively. No patients were reoperated because of complications. Blood transfusions were given to 2 (9.5%) patients. After a median follow-up of 21 months, no local recurrence was observed.IOUS-guided SERPS is feasible, safe, and effective. It should be applied whenever possible as alternative resection to RH to maximize liver parenchymal sparing.
