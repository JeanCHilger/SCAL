Renal parenchymal disease: histopathologic-sonographic correlation. This study was designed to address the correlation between sonography of a kidney with histological lesions and clinical findings in patients with renal parenchymal disease based on a multivariate logistic regression analysis.Clinical and laboratory data, sonograms and renal biopsies were evaluated in 154 patients. Cortical echogenicity was graded as less than (0), equal to (1) or greater than (2) liver/spleen parenchyma. Histological lesions - mesangial proliferation (MP), leukocyte permeation (LP), fibrinoid necrosis and crescents (FNC), interstitial infiltrate (II), segmental glomerular sclerosis (SGS), glomerular obsolescence (GO), tubular atrophy (TA) interstitial fibrosis (IF) and interstitial edema (IE) - were graded according to extension and severity as normal (0%), mild (<25%), moderate (>25% <50%), and severe (>50%).a) II, IF, SGS, IE and increased creatinine occurred less in cortical echogenicity grade 0 b) MP, arterial hypertension and normal parenchymal thickness predict cortical echogenicity grade 1Increased cortical echogenicity was a very sensitive marker of renal parenchymal disease. Different lesions rather than degree of lesion severity accounted for progressive increase of cortical echogenicity. IE exponentially increased the effect of IF on cortical echogenicity.
