Liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension: non-invasive measurement of blood flow in the portal vein with Doppler-duplex. Doppler-duplex has been widely used to quantify blood flow. Nevertheless, its usefulness in assessing portal vein flow (PVF) has been questioned due to technical problems: vessel cross sectional area measurements, interobserver variability, and PVF changes related to physiological events. This study was aimed to measure PVF in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, to estimate changes in PVF during the respiratory cycle, and to evaluate intraobserver variability of Doppler-duplex technique. Twenty-two patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension and 22 healthy subjects were included. One operator made 6 measurements of portal vein diameter (D) and mean flow velocity in inspiration and aspiration. Area of the vessel (A) and PVF were calculated by a microprocessor. Interobserver variability was estimated for each subject and a mean was determined for each group. In the control group, PVF was 901 +/- 39 ml/min in inspiration and 633 +/- 38 ml/min in aspiration p < 0.001. In patients with cirrhosis PVF was 1303 +/- 121 ml/min in inspiration and 1003 +/- 96 ml/min in aspiration
