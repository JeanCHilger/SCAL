Portal venous flow (ultrasonography-Doppler) in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. To evaluate the clinical usefulness of the ultrasonographic (echo-Doppler) measurements of portal blood flow their results were compared with several clinical and biochemical parameters in alcoholic cirrhotic patients. The technique was standardized and its reproducibility was checked in 30 cirrhotics and in 20 control subjects. In controls, portal area was greater when measured on its transversal axis and in deep inspiration. In cirrhotics the area did not change neither according to the axis nor the respiratory movements. The estimated velocity of blood flow was dependent on the angle of insonation. Measurements performed on longitudinal axis, at 50 degrees in expiratory apnea showed, in the same subject, an interday variability of 7%. In cirrhotic patients portal blood flow was higher than in controls (0.93 +/- 0.32 L/min vs 0.64 +/- 0.12, p < 0.001) being the difference due to a greater area. Considering controls and Child's A and B cirrhotic patients, portal blood flow correlated with the severity of disease (r = 0.738, p < 0.001). In Child C, portal blood flow was decreased, compared to Child's B patients. The presence and size of esophageal varices was also correlated to portal blood flow (r = 0.461, p < 0.05). However no differences were observed between the groups with or without previous variceal bleeding. It is concluded that echo-doppler measurement of portal blood flow is a reproducible technic in standardized conditions, detecting changes related to global liver function and the presence and size of esophageal varices.
