Correlation of liver biochemistry with liver stiffness in chronic hepatitis B and development of a predictive model for liver fibrosis. Abstract Aim: To correlate liver stiffness with demographical factors and routine liver biochemistry and to assess the predictive value of these as potential markers of fibrosis.Transient elastography was performed in 1268 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. According to a previous validated study for CHB, liver stiffness of >8.1 and >10.3 kPa were used as cut-off values for defining severe fibrosis and cirrhosis respectively.Liver stiffness correlated positively with bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), globulin, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and HBV DNA levels and negatively with albumin and platelet levels (P<0.05 for all correlations). From 13 parameters (age, sex, platelet, AST, ALT, GGT, AFP, albumin, globulin, bilirubin, ALP, HBV DNA and hepatitis B e-antigen), four best parameters (AST, platelet, GGT and AFP) were used to derive a liver stiffness model. Using log (index)=1.44+0.1490(GGT)+0.3308 log (AST)-0.5846 log (platelets)+0.1148 log (AFP+1) to predict both severe fibrosis and cirrhosis had area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.85.Routine liver biochemistry correlated well with liver stiffness in Asian CHB patients. A model using simple serum markers can predict liver stiffness, and further studies are required to validate the usefulness of these simple tests as non-invasive markers of fibrosis in CHB.
