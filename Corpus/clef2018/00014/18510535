New images in haemophilia. New imaging techniques are valuable for the care of patients with haemophilia. On angiography it is shown that some bleedings in severely damaged joints or after implantation of prostheses are arterial. Effect of clotting factor is often poor. Selective catherization with embolization of the bleeding artery stops the bleed and is clinically effective. From 31 patients with severe haemophilia A or B, 62 knee radiographs were scored according to the Pettersson-scoring system as well as with Knee Digital Image Analysis (KIDA). Using KIDA, good correlation was found for osteoporosis, irregular subchondral surface, narrowing of the joint space, deformity and incongruence. For each of the parameters within one point in the Pettersson score a large variation existed in KIDA grading. MRI is accurate for diagnosis of soft and osteochondral tissue. Nevertheless, it is costly and not very accessible. The use of parallel imaging is more feasible for assessment of multiple joints within a relatively short period of time. Although ultrasonography also holds the potential for being an adjunct to MRI it has the disadvantage that it is operator-dependent. In a cohort of 124 chronically HCV infected haemophilia patients transient elastography was performed to measure liver stiffness. 57 (46%) had no or mild fibrosis, 18 (14.5%) moderate fibrosis and 49 severe or cirrhotic fibrosis. Transient elastography is safe and helpful to refer patients to antiviral therapy.
