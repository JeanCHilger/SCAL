Comparison of transient elastography and hepatic fibrosis assessed by histology in chronic liver disease. Transient elastography (Fibroscan, Echosens, France) is a new, simple, and non-invasive method to assess the degree of hepatic fibrosis by measuring liver stiffness. Recent reports have shown that liver stiffness measurement using Fibroscan allowed accurate prediction of hepatic fibrosis in patient with chronic hepatitis C. The aim of this study was to evaluate accuracy of Fibroscan for the detection of hepatic fibrosis in Korea with various etiologies of chronic liver disease by comparison with fibrosis assessed by histologic examination.Fifty-four patients with chronic liver diseases, which were histologically confirmed within recent 6 months were enrolled. Etiologies were HBV, HCV infection, autoimmune hepatitis, and non alcoholic steatohepatitis. Hepatic fibrosis was graded on the basis of standard guideline proposed by the Korean Study Group for the Pathology of Digestive Diseases.Fibroscan values were significantly higher in F3 (16.96 kPa) and F4 (19.86 kPa) than others (p=0.003). Liver stiffness measurement was significantly correlated to the fibrosis stage (r=0.614, p<0.0001).Liver stiffness measurement by Fibroscan is a promising method for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis in chronic liver disease because it accompanies no complication.
