Screening for liver fibrosis by using a noninvasive biomarker in patients with diabetes. Patients with diabetes are at risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease leading to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. We examined the efficacy of a screening strategy with a noninvasive fibrosis biomarker (FibroTest) in patients with diabetes.We prospectively studied 1131 consecutive patients without a history of liver disease seen for diabetes. The biomarker data were obtained, and patients with presumed advanced fibrosis were reinvestigated by a hepatologist using elastography and, if necessary, ultrasonography, endoscopy, or liver biopsy.The biomarker predicted advanced fibrosis in 63 of 1131 (5.6%) patients. A total of 45 patients was reinvestigated, and advanced fibrosis was confirmed in 32 patients, a 2.8% (32/1131) prevalence of confirmed advanced fibrosis, 5 cases of cirrhosis, and 4 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. In the population with type 2 diabetes who were 45 years or older, the prevalence of confirmed advanced fibrosis was 4.3% (30/696), and hepatocellular carcinoma was 5.7 of 1000 (4/696).The fibrosis biomarker might be used for the detection of advanced fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.
