Frequency of hepatopulmonary syndrome in cirrhotic patients. To determine the frequency of Hepatopulmonary Syndrome (HPS) in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.Observational cross-sectional study.Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Shaikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, from April 2005 to March 2006.Fifty consecutive patients admitted with liver cirrhosis were recruited. Twelve patients were excluded due to inadequate echocardiography image quality and inability to perform lung function tests. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was made on clinical, biochemical, serological and metabolic workup, ultrasound abdomen or liver biopsy. Complete blood count, liver function tests, prothrombin time, serum albumin, electrocardiography, chest radiograph, transthoracic contrast echocardiography, arterial blood gas analysis and pulmonary function tests (FEV1) were performed. Results were analyzed as percentages. Chi-square test of proportions and t-test were applied.Total patients evaluated were 38. Mean age was 47.92 +/- 11.38 years, with male (68.4%) to female (31.6%) ratio of 2.1:1. The commonest cause of cirrhosis was hepatitis C (71.1%). Out of the 38 patients, 11 (28.9%) had HPS including 5 (13.2%) with overt HPS and 6 (15.8%) with subclinical HPS. All patients with HPS had hepatitis C with Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) class C. Factors associated with HPS were digital clubbing, arterial hypoxemia and intrapulmonary vascular dilatations (p=0.02, 0.05 and 0.000 respectively).In this study, 28.9% patients with cirrhosis of the liver had HPS. All belonged to child class C due to hepatitis C. Digital Clubbing, arterial hypoxemia and intrapulmonary vascular dilatations were important features of hepatopulmonary syndrome.
