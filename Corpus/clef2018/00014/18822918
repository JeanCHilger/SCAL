Effect of umbilical sticking therapy with qitou xiaogu plaster in treating liver cirrhosis patients with portal hypertension. To observe the effect of umbilical sticking therapy (UST) with Qitou Xiaugu Plaster (QXP) on hemodynamics of portal system in patients with liver cirrhosis.One hundred and twenty patients of liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension were assigned to two groups. On the basis of conventional therapy, UST was applied in the 66 patients in treated group, which was exchanged once every 3 days with an interval of 1-day rest. The 54 patients in the control group were orally administered with propanolol. The therapeutic course for both groups was 1 month. Before and after treatment, the hemodynamic changes in portal or splenic veins were observed by color Doppler ultrasonograph, and the changes of liver function, blood coagulation and patients' subjective symptoms were observed as well.After treatment, portal vein diameter and splenic vein diameter significantly decreased (P < 0.05, portal venous flow velocity and splenic venous flow velocity apparently increased (P < 0.05), and portal venous flow apparently decreased in both groups (P < 0.05), while no significant change was found in the splenic venous flow (P > 0.05). The liver function and blood coagulation indexes in both groups were improved. The improvement of clinical symptoms in the treated group was superior to that in the control group.UST with QXP could decrease the portal vein pressure in a short time, with the therapeutic effect comparable to propanolol, and with no adverse reaction.
