Artificial vascular graft for inferior vena cava reconstruction in living donor liver transplantation: a case report. Artificial grafts are not recommended because of the high incidence of thrombogenic effects. However, in some situations, such as emergency or when no vascular bank is available, an artificial graft must be used. We present a case in which a polytetrafluoroethyline graft was used as a conduit to reconstruct the retrohepatic vena cava severed during living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). A 48-year-old woman had end-stage primary biliary cirrhosis for 5 years received a right lobe liver graft from her son. The retrohepatic vena cava was divided and ligated in several sequences. The upper end of the severed retrohepatic vena cava retracted into the liver parenchyma. The lower end of the severed vena cava was distended, with multiple stitches. A 16-mm artificial graft was used as a conduit to replace the inferin vena cava for outflow reconstruction. The patient tolerated the complicated procedure well. No anticoagulant was used throughout the entire course. The patient has been well with excellent liver function after follow-up for more than 5 years. Magnetic resonance imaging and Doppler ultrasonographic studies showed good patency of the cava with no evidence of thrombosis. We suggest use of an artificial graft in living donor liver transplantation, in particular in urgent situations when autologous or allogeneic vessels are not available.
