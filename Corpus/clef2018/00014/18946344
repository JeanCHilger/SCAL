Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma without preoperative tumor biopsy. Progress in liver imaging has made pretransplantation tumor biopsy no longer systematic in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of a preoperative diagnosis of HCC based on clinical and radiological findings in 102 cirrhotics qualified for liver transplantation (LT) between January 1995 and August 2003 at our institution.The diagnostic accuracy of our policy was assessed by comparing pretransplant diagnosis with the pathologic report of explanted livers.Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values for the preoperative clinical and radiological diagnosis of HCC were 89%, 94.3%, 77%, and 93.3%, respectively. A false-positive preoperative diagnosis was made in 20 of 102 patients (19.6%) (dysplastic nodules [n=9], regenerative nodules [n=5] cholangiocellular carcinoma [n=1], hemangioma [n=1], and no lesion [n=4]). All tumors larger than 3 cm were correctly diagnosed, irrespective of serum alpha-fetoprotein (sAFP) levels. The risk of overestimating the diagnosis of HCC in the subgroup of patients with tumors less than 3 cm was conversely correlated with preliver transplantation sAFP (sAFP<or=100 ng/L: 28% sAFP>100: 11%In cirrhotics with nodules larger than 3 cm irrespective of sAFP or nodules less than 3 cm with sAFP greater than 200 ng/L, the pretransplant diagnosis of HCC can be made without performing biopsy. In other cases (i.e., nodules less than 3 cm and sAFP lower than 200 ng/L), histologic confirmation of HCC or a close follow-up imaging should be considered.
