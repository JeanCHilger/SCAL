MR elastography. Magnetic resonance (MR) elastography is an emerging method for measuring the viscoelastic properties of tissues. Hepatic fibrosis, which increases the elasticity or stiffness of the liver, can be detected and staged by MR elastography. The technique has several advantages compared with transient ultrasound elastography (FibroScan): it can evaluate much larger liver volumes it can be performed in obese patients and in those with ascites
