Combining non-invasive methods for assessment of liver fibrosis. Non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis, including biochemical scores using simple biochemical parameters and transient elastography (TE), have been developed over the past decade to either replace or reduce the need for liver biopsy (LB) in the assessment of liver fibrosis. Although their diagnostic accuracy in liver fibrosis is promising, around 20% of patients are likely to be misclassified if these tests or LB are used alone. However, using a combination of several biochemical scores (Fibropaca algorithm, Leroy algorithm) or one biochemical score with TE (Bordeaux algorithm) will increase diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis and reduce the need for LB. Stepwise combination algorithms of non-invasive scores (SAFE biopsy) also improve the diagnostic performance in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) compared with the use of a single non-invasive score. Other sequential stepwise algorithms have been developed in CHC with similar performance results. Comparisons of different combinations of non-invasive methods indicate that the SAFE biopsy, Fibropaca algorithm and Bordeaux algorithm are excellent and comparable in the non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis in HCV patients, and will markedly reduce the need for LB. They may also be useful in clinical practice and particularly for large-scale screening of HCV patients.
