Budd-Chiari syndrome induced by hormonal oral contraception in the patient with congenital thrombophilia-factor V Leiden mutation--a case report. The Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare pathology resulting from various etiological factors which often contribute to its late diagnosis. Liver cirrhosis, malignant tumors and haematological disorders resulting in hypercoagulability, are the most common reasons of Budd-Chiari syndrome. The syndrome is characterized by portal hypertension and splanchnic congestion due to obstruction of hepatic venous outflow. The first symptoms include pain, ascites and hepatosplenomegaly. The diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome can be achieved by Doppler ultrasonography, Computed Tomography scan, Magnetic Resonance or Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography. In the following article, a case report of a patient with diagnosed Budd-Chiari syndrome as a result of congenital thrombophilia-factor V Leiden gene mutation is presented. Clinical symptoms, diagnostic process, as well as treatment options, were shown in the article.
