Prophylaxis and treatment of chronic viral hepatitis as the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma. As hepatitis B and C virus (HBV, HCV) play a pivotal role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the prophylaxis and treatment of these infections may mean also the prevention of HCC. The primary prevention of HCC is vaccination against HBV as well as the screening of blood donors for HBV and HCV markers. The means of secondary HCC prevention are as follows: antiviral therapy of HBV and HCV-related hepatitis and cirrhosis, screening ("surveillance") of cirrhotic patients for HCC using alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasound, and adjuvant antiviral treatment of HCC patients following curative tumor resection/ablation. It may be anticipated that the world-wide spread of HBV vaccination, the more effective individual treatment and novel antivirals will lead to the decrease of HCC incidence in the not so distant future.
