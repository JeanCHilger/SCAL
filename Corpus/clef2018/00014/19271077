Intrahepatic splenosis mimicking hepatocellular carcinoma in a cirrhotic liver. We report a patient who has a cirrhotic liver secondary to hepatitis C virus infection with a liver lesion incidentally found on routine liver ultrasound. The patient had a history of splenectomy 30 years earlier. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics suggested the diagnosis of intrahepatic splenosis, which is confirmed by core needle biopsy. Knowledge of these imaging findings makes this entity important to be considered in the differential diagnosis of a hepatic tumor in the presence of a history of splenic trauma or surgery.
