Prevalence of chronic (latent) pancreatitis in hospitalized chronic consumers of alcohol. A pancreatic echographic investigation was carried out in 120 chronic consumers of alcohol, hospitalized for digestive diseases (hepatic, gastrointestinal) or extradigestive diseases (rheumatic, cardiovascular). Seventy cases (66%) presented pancreatic echographic--structural changes of various degrees. In 50 patients (41.5%) these changes were well definite. The intensity of echographic changes was correlated with the degree of alcoholic impregnation, 50% of the cases presenting also alcoholic hepatic disease. Emphasis is laid on the clinical latency of pancreatic disease. Echographic screening proved to be a valuable method for the detection of latent pancreatic fibrosis in heavy alcohol consumers.
