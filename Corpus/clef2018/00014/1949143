Schistosomal periportal fibrosis in Zimbabwe: use of ultrasound in patients with oesophageal varices. Ultrasound (U/S) imaging of liver was used in a prospective study of 62 consecutive patients with oesophageal varices in the central hospitals in Harare 50 had haematemesis. U/S changes of Symmers's periportal fibrosis (PPF) were graded from mild (grade 1) to gross (grade 4). 46 patients (74%) had U/S features of PPF: 7 were grade 1, 7 grade 2, 29 grade 3, and 3 grade 4. Patients with PPF were more likely to have bled (P less than 0.05) and were less likely to have ascites (P less than 0.05) than those without PPF. Spleen or liver size or grade of varices did not correlate with the U/S grade of PPF. Rectal snips were positive for schistosome ova in 19 of 28 cases with PPF and 2 of 7 cases without PPF. Patients with PPF were more likely than those without PPF (P less than 0.005) or controls (P less than 0.0001) to have spent their childhood in an area of Zimbabwe with a high prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni. Schistosomal PPF appears to be a common cause of portal hypertension in Zimbabwe. It is strongly associated with childhood spent in areas of high S. mansoni prevalence.
