Feasibility of in vivo MR elastographic splenic stiffness measurements in the assessment of portal hypertension. Liver stiffness is associated with portal hypertension in patients with chronic liver disease. However, the relation between spleen stiffness and clinically significant portal hypertension remains unknown. The purposes of this study were to determine the feasibility of measuring spleen stiffness with MR elastography and to prospectively test the technique in healthy volunteers and in patients with compensated liver disease.Spleen stiffness was measured with MR elastography in 12 healthy volunteers (mean age, 37 years range, 25-82 years) and 38 patients (mean age, 56 yearsMR elastography of the spleen was successfully performed on all volunteers and patients. The mean spleen stiffness was significantly lower in the volunteers (mean, 3.6 +/- 0.3 kPa) than in the patients with liver fibrosis (mean, 5.6 +/- 5.0 kPa range, 2.7-19.2 kPaMR elastography of the spleen is feasible and shows promise as a quantitative method for predicting the presence of esophageal varices in patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis.
