Insulin resistance is a major determinant of liver stiffness in nondiabetic patients with HCV genotype 1 chronic hepatitis. In patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography (TE), is closely related to the stage of fibrosis, but may be affected by necroinflammation. Other factors, such as insulin resistance (IR), might influence the performance of LSM.To evaluate in a cohort of nondiabetic patients with genotype 1 CHC, whether IR and other anthropometric, biochemical, metabolic and histological factors contribute to LSM and to identify the best cut-off values of LSM for predicting different stages of fibrosis.Nondiabetic patients with genotype 1 CHC (n = 156) were evaluated by liver biopsy (Metavir score), anthropometric, biochemical and metabolic features including IR. Furthermore, all subjects underwent LSM by TE.Severe fibrosis (F3-F4) was associated with LSM (OR 1.291 95%CI 1.106-1.508). LSM was also independently correlated with low platelets (P = 0.03), high gammaGT (P < 0.001) and high HOMA (P = 0.004) levels. A stiffness value > or =8 KPa was identified as the best cut-off for predicting severe fibrosis (AUC 0.870)
