The treatment of liver fibrosis induced by hepatocyte growth factor-directed, ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction in rats. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of using ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction to treat liver fibrosis induced by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).Forty Wistar rats were divided into five groups after the models of liver fibrosis were prepared: (1) HGF, ultrasound, and microbubbles (HGF+US/MB) (2) HGF and ultrasound (HGF+US)The results of DWI and pathological examination showed the recovery of liver in HGF+US/MB group were better than those of other groups. In HGF+US/MB group, collagen I expression was less, and HGF protein was the highest among all the groups.Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction could deliver HGF into the fibrotic liver and produce an antifibrosis effect, which could provide a novel strategy for gene therapy of liver fibrosis.
