Oddi sphincter fibrosis due to chemotherapy agents in small cell lung cancer: case report. A 62-year-old, man patient was diagnosed as small cell lung cancer. Cisplatin (80 mg/m(2), first day) and etoposide (100 mg/m(2), three days) chemotherapy was started for once 21 days. As the patient received third course of chemotherapy, jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia were detected. Hepatic ultrasonography showed dilated choledochus and intrahepatic biliary tract. Hepatic markers and serologic tests for viral hepatitis were found as normal. Finally endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed in the first ERCP and two days later, second ERCP was performed and oddi sphincter was seen as fibrotic and stenotic and stent was placed. One day after the stent placement, direct bilirubin was found as 6.2 mg/dL and 10 days later laboratory parameters were detected as normal. Oddi sphincter fibrosis occurred due to lung cancer chemotherapy treatment is an interesting case for fibrosis not having been reported due to cisplatin or etoposide before.
