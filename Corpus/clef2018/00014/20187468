Partial cholecystectomy is a safe and efficient method. When there is excess inflammation, fibrosis and portal hypertension around gall bladder or in presence of Mirizzi syndrome, bile ducts and hepatic artery may be possibly damaged during dissection of Calot triangle. In this study, we examined safety and efficiency of partial cholecystectomy operation which we perform when dissection of Calot triangle is challenging.Eighteen patients who were undergone partial cholecystectomy in our clinic between 1996 and 2008 were retrospectively evaluated. Mean age of patients was 66 years (range: 55-88 years) and ratio of male/female was 2/1 (12 men, 6 women). Fourteen patients were undergone general anesthesia, whereas 4 patients were operated under epidural anesthesia. Partial cholecystectomies were performed by right subcostal incision in 16 patients and by right paramedian incision in 2 patients.No intra-operative or early post-operative mortality was found among patients. Post-operative subhepatic abscess occurred in one patient (5.5%) and superficial wound site infection occurred in 4 patients (22,2%). Controlled bile fistula occurred in early post-operative period in two patients (11.1%) and fistula spontaneously closed without requiring additional surgical procedure. Escherichia coli were most common microorganism found in bile culture. Mean hospitalization period of patients was 8 days (range: 15-14 days) and mean follow-up period was 80 months (8-150 months). During follow up, hepatobiliary ultrasonography could be re-performed in 8 patients and no new stone formation was observed. In 7 patients, it was understood verbally that no postoperative gastrointestinal symptoms were present.Where dissection of Calot triangle is changeling, partial cholecystectomy can be safely and efficiently performed.
