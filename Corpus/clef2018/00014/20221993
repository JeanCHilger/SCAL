Severe hepatitis and subacute liver failure with "fast track" cirrhosis in an elderly lady. We report the case of a 74-year-old lady who presented at our clinic with icterus and cholestatic hepatitis. For atrial fibrillation she had been prescribed a medication with phenprocoumone. After ruling out viral, autoimmune, and metabolic causes of hepatitis, we performed a liver biopsy which led to the diagnosis of phenprocoumone-related liver damage. The patient was discharged without phenprocoumone and completely compensated liver function. Five weeks later she returned to the hospital with encephalopathy, ascites, coagulopathy, varices, and signs of cirrhosis in abdominal ultrasound. In spite of treatment with steroids, the patient died of subacute liver failure several weeks later. This case illustrates the occasionally poor course of toxic hepatitis even after discontinuation of the responsible medication, potential treatment options are discussed.
