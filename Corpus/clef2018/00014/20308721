Effects of TIPS on global end-diastolic volume and cardiac output and renal resistive index in ICU patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis. The transjugular porto-systemic stent-shunt (TIPS) reduces portal pressure in cirrhotic patients and is used as a nonsurgical treatment for refractory ascites, recurrent variceal hemorrhage or hepatorenal syndrome. There are concerns regarding a negative impact on cirrhotic cardiomyopathy and deterioration of hyperkinetic circulatory dysfunction. We analyzed a prospectively maintained database containing hemodynamic data on cirrhotic ICU patients. Hemodynamic monitoring was performed using transpulmonary thermodilution (PiCCO, Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany). Renal perfusion was assessed by Doppler ultrasound during studies of portal and TIPS perfusion before and after the procedure. Complete data sets of 8 patients (4 male, 4 female, age 60 years (52-67), Child-Pugh-Turcotte score 10 (8-12)) were available. After TIPS, there was a substantial increase of GEDVI (646 ml/m2 (580-737) to 663 mL/m2 (643-792) p=0.036) that was even more pronounced at 24 hours (716 mL/m2 (663-821)
