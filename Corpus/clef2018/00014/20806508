Recent investigation and treatment of 1 060 advanced schistosomiasis cases in Zhejiang Province. To understand the current status of advanced schistosomiasis patients, deliver medical treatment, and improve the case management in Zhejiang Province.The cases previously diagnosed or suspected as advanced schistosomiasis in the province were the subjects of the investigation. Questionnairing (demographical information, disease history, etc.), clinical examination (ascites syndrome, abdominal palpation), laboratory examination (blood biochemistry, anti-Schistosoma japonicum antibody, eggs), and ultrasonography of the abdomen were used confirming the diagnosis. Treatment was given to the patients.There were 1 060 advanced schistosomiasis patients in 32 counties of 7 prefectures in the province. Majority of them distributed in water network regions, and lived with poor economic conditions. The average age of the patients was (66.3 +/- 9.3), with 89.3% ranged from 50 to 80 years old. Clinically 71.3% of the cases were with splenomegaly, 27.6% with ascites, 0.9% cases of multiple granuloma in the colon and 0.2% cases with dwarfism. 1 023 patients (96.5%) had received medical treatments. 69.4% of the cases had serious complications with advanced schistosomiasis and 52.5% had concurrently disorders in other systems. 71.1% of the patients had subjective symptoms and 65.2% had hepatosplenomegaly with hepatic fibrosis and dysfunction. The serum positive rate of anti-S. japonicum antibody was 15.7%. Stool hatching test and microscopy revealed no eggs in fecal samples, but 24 out of 38 cases were found metamorphic eggs by rectal biopsy. Three years' medical treatment improved the clinical conditions in 74.3% of the cases.Situation of the advanced schistosomiasis patients is quite critical. Treatment and care are urgently needed especially for those aged 50 to 80 years old. [
