Recent advances in diagnosis of portal hypertension. Complications of portal hypertension are major concerns in liver cirrhosis and significant morbidity and mortality mainly because of variceal bleeding, ascites, bacterial infections, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome. Various modalities in the diagnosis of portal hypertension are reviewed. The measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is a simple, invasive, reproducible method and regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis and staging of portal hypertension. Other tests such as transient elastography, per-endoscopic variceal pressure measurement, endoscopic ultrasonography, and Doppler ultrasonography may be complementary and promising.
