Early diagnosis and treatment resolved cholestatic hepatitis C without fibrosis after living donor liver transplantation: report of a case. Cholestatic hepatitis is a life-threatening recurrent pattern of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in immunosuppressed patients, for which curative treatment has not yet been established. We report the successful treatment of cholestatic hepatitis in a 59-year-old man who had undergone right lobe living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for liver cirrhosis (LC) caused by HCV. Following uneventful surgery and an uncomplicated posttransplant clinical course, there was an abrupt increase in total bilirubin in comparison to aminotransferase on postoperative day (POD) 60 (total bilirubin 16.2 mg/dl, alanine aminotransferase 100 U/l, HCV-RNA 390 kIU/ml). The histological findings of the liver tissue showed lymphocyte infiltration in the periportal zone and severe cholestasis. Considering the clinical course, cholestatic hepatitis was strongly suspected and pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy was started immediately, resulting in not only a viral response, but minimal progression of fibrosis. This case serves to demonstrate that early diagnosis and timely initiation of optimal antiviral therapy is essential for the resolution of cholestatic hepatitis C.
