The effect of the respiratory cycle on liver stiffness values as measured by transient elastography. The findings of several studies suggest that liver stiffness values can be affected by the degree of intrahepatic congestion respiration influence intrahepatic blood volume and may affect liver stiffness. We evaluated the influence of respiration on liver stiffness. Transient elastography (TE) was performed at the end of inspiration and at the end of expiration in patients with chronic liver disease. The median values obtained during the inspiration set and during the expiration set were defined as inspiratory and expiratory liver stiffness, respectively. A total of 123 patients with chronic liver disease were enrolled (mean age 49years 64.2% men). Liver cirrhosis coexisted in 29 patients (23.6%). Expiratory liver stiffness was significantly higher than inspiratory liver stiffness (8.7 vs 7.9kPa, P=0.001), while the expiratory interquartile range/median ratio (IQR ratio) did not differ from the inspiratory IQR ratio. Expiratory liver stiffness was significantly higher than inspiratory liver stiffness in 49 (39.8%) patients (HE group), expiratory liver stiffness was significantly lower than inspiratory stiffness in 15 (12.2%) patients, and there was no difference in 59 (48.0%) patients. Liver cirrhosis was more frequent in those who had a lower liver stiffness reading in expiration, and only the absence of liver cirrhosis was significantly associated with a higher reading in expiration in multivariate analysis. In conclusion, liver stiffness was significantly elevated during expiration especially in patients without liver cirrhosis. The effect of respiration should be kept in mind during TE readings.
