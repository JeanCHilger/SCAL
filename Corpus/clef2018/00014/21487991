Elevation of serum galectin-3 and liver stiffness measured by transient elastography in biliary atresia. Biliary atresia (BA) is an intractable neonatal liver disease characterized by progressive fibrosclerotic obliteration of the extrahepatic biliary tree. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum galectin-3 in postoperative BA patients and the association between galectin-3, clinical outcome and liver stiffness score.58 BA patients post Kasai operation and 20 controls were enrolled. None of the patients had undergone liver transplantation. BA patients were classified into 2 groups according to their serum total bilirubin (TB) levels (TB<2 mg/dL, no jaundice vs. TB≥2 mg/dL, persistent jaundice) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (ALT<45 IU/L, normal ALT vs. ALT≥45 IU/L, elevated ALT). Serum galectin-3 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Liver stiffness scores were measured by transient elastography (FibroScan).BA patients had higher serum galectin-3 levels (5.1±0.3 vs. 3.8±0.4 ng/mL, p=0.01) and greater liver stiffness values than healthy controls (29.7±3.0 vs. 5.1±0.5 kPa, p<0.001). Serum galectin-3 levels were markedly elevated in BA patients with jaundice compared to those without jaundice (6.4±0.5 vs. 4.4±0.3 ng/mL, p=0.001). Furthermore, BA patients with elevated ALT displayed significantly higher levels of serum galectin-3 than those with normal ALT (5.9±0.4 vs. 3.8±0.3 ng/mL, p=0.001). Additionally, BA patients with portal hypertension had considerably higher serum galectin-3 levels than those without portal hypertension (6.1±0.4 vs. 3.7±0.3 ng/mL, p<0.001).Increased serum galectin-3 is associated with a poor outcome in postoperative BA patients. Serum galectin-3 could be used as a biochemical parameter reflecting the deterioration of liver function and the severity of liver fibrosis in postoperative BA.
