Value of echography in the study of periportal fibrosis caused by schistosomiasis in an endemic African zone. The authors present the results of a survey with ultrasonography conducted to evaluate the prevalence of hepatic fibrosis as a complication of infection by Schistosoma mansoni. Because of the specific images it yields, ultrasonography appears to be highly valuable for the diagnosis of Symmer's fibrosis. It allows the assessment of morbidity from Schistosoma mansoni, which has previously only been performed indirectly by physical examination.
