Comparison between ultrasonographic signs and the degree of portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis. The sensitivity of ultrasonography (US) for the diagnosis of portal hypertension was assessed in 48 patients with known cirrhosis. These results were compared to the hemodynamic values obtained on the same day by hepatic vein catheterization. The sensitivity of US in detecting portal hypertension was about 40% considering either a greater than 13 mm diameter of the portal vein, or the lack of mild caliber variation of the superior mesenteric vein. The sensitivity was more than 80% considering the presence of portosystemic venous collaterals. Presence of numerous portosystemic shunts was significantly associated with high hepatic venous pressure gradients which reflected the severity of portal hypertension.
