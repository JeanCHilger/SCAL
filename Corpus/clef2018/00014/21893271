Noninvasive tools to assess hepatic fibrosis: ready for prime time? Often regarded as the gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy carries associated risks however, it is less than ideal. The need for noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis for disease staging, prognosis, progression, and treatment response is clear. Advances in serologic testing and conventional imaging techniques have reduced the need for liver biopsy. Areas of research include defining cutoff values for specific diseases, further head-to-head comparisons of noninvasive modalities, examination of algorithms using both serum markers and imaging, and the cost-effectiveness of these various tests for diagnostic as well as screening purposes.
