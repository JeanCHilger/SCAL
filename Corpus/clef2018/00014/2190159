Parotid gland abnormality found in children seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Out of our series of 24 children seropositive for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), parotid gland enlargement was noted in 4 children with AIDS-related complex (ARC) presenting also a Lymphocytic Interstitial Pneumonitis (LIP) on their chest radiographs. The ultrasound (US) aspect of the parotid gland suggests acinar enlargement (suggesting the presence of lymphocytic infiltration). The aspect displayed in the parotid mirrors the process developing in other areas (lungs, liver, spleen, lymph-nodes), i.e. a syndrome of lymphocytic (CD8) proliferation present at the stage of ARC.
