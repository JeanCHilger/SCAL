Plasma hydroxyproline, MMP-7 and collagen I as novel predictive risk markers of hepatobiliary disease-associated cholangiocarcinoma. Chronic opisthorchiasis caused by Opisthorchis viverrini infection is characterized by advanced periductal fibrosis leading to hepatobiliary diseases (HBD), including cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). We aimed to determine fibrotic markers to differentiate HBD status including opisthorchiasis, benign biliary disease (BBD) and CCA. Candidate fibrotic markers in plasma of healthy individuals (n = 14) and patients with opisthorchiasis (n = 32, pre- and post-treatment with praziquantel), BBD (n = 31), CCA (n = 37) and other types of tumors (n = 14) were measured by ELISA and zymography. Plasma levels of hydroxyproline (HYP), collagen I, MMP-7 and TIMP2 in opisthorchiasis patients were significantly higher than those in healthy individuals, and MMP9/TIMP2 balance may be associated with tissue resorption after praziquantel treatment. HYP and TIMP-2 levels were significantly correlated with periductal fibrosis status evaluated by ultrasonography. Plasma HYP level of CCA patients was the highest among HBD patients (p < 0.05). ROC curves revealed HYP, MMP-7 and collagen I levels significantly distinguished opisthorchiasis, BBD and CCA (p < 0.001). Odd ratio (OR) analysis demonstrated these markers in opisthorchiasis were predictable for BBD risk (p < 0.05 OR = 28.50, 10.12 and 4.63 for collagen I, MMP-7 and HYP, respectively), and the risk was reduced by praziquantel treatment. Interestingly, only plasma HYP level in BBD was predictable for CCA risk (OR = 3.69
