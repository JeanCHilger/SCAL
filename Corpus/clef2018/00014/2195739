Echographic tissue characterization in diffuse parenchymal liver disease: correlation of image structure with histology. Seventy livers were examined in vitro using a computerized ultrasound B-mode data acquisition and analysis system. For tissue characterization, statistical parameters from pattern recognition algorithms describing image brightness and image structure were used. Reference classification based on histopathology as well as on chemical/morphometrical analysis led to the diagnostic classes of normal, fatty liver, fibrosis/cirrhosis and fatty fibrosis/cirrhosis. Comparing the two reference methods for ultrasound tissue characterization, reclassification based on chemical/morphometrical analysis resulted in a significant increase in diagnostic accuracy. The strong correlations between statistical ultrasound image parameters and morphometrical features reflect the relevance of our statistical approach to ultrasound tissue characterization.
