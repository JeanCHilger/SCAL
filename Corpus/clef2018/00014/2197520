The ultrasonic picture of the abdominal vessels in focal lesions of the liver. Ultrasound investigation of the abdominal vessels was conducted in 41 patients with liver tumors (17 patients with liver hemangiomas, 9 with primary liver cancer, and 15 with cancer metastases to the liver) and 100 controls. Shifting, compression, occlusion of the intrahepatic portal and hepatic veins as well as of the inferior vena cava and right renal vessels were observed in patients with malignant and benign liver tumors. Malignant tumors were accountable for shifting and compression of the extrahepatic segment of the portal vein and the upper mesenteric artery as a result of metastatic involvement of the lymph nodes. Statistically significant dilatation of the total hepatic artery was noted in patients with malignant and benign liver tumors, determined, probably, by an increase in the arterial inflow in the liver. A decrease in a degree of change of calibers of the portal and hepatic veins in malignant liver tumors was noted in patients with hepatocellular cancer, developing against a background of cirrhosis with portal hypertension as well as in patients with secondary malignant tumors without clinical signs of portal hypertension that might result from an obstacle posed by tumor nodes in the liver parenchyma to venous wall dilatation.
