Thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and portal blood flow in patients who have undergone liver transplantation for cirrhosis. The platelet count (PC), the spleen size (SS), and the portal blood flow (PBF) have been independently studied in the perioperative period after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for cirrhosis, but these parameters have not been described and analyzed in combination. We analyzed PC data and Doppler sonography measurements of SS and PBF from 125 adult patients before OLT and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after transplantation. A linear mixed model with fixed subject random intercepts was used. PCs increased significantly from 101.5 ± 68.5 × 10(9) /L before OLT to 162.4 ± 86 × 10(9) /L 1 month after OLT and remained stable for 1 year after the operation. PBF increased significantly from 619 ± 239 mL/minute before OLT to 1379 ± 491 mL/minute after OLT and remained stable during the first year. SS slowly decreased after OLT, but the decrease became significant only 9 months after the operation (13.8 ± 4.2 cm before OLT versus 11.7 ± 3.7 cm at 9 months, P < 0.05). The cirrhosis etiology did not influence the evolution of the parameters. With or without replication or interferon treatment before OLT, the hepatitis C group viruses did not influence PCs postoperatively. The evolution of SS was correlated to the evolution of PCs in the year after transplantation. In conclusion, PCs and PBF increase rapidly after OLT, whereas SS slowly decreases. The cirrhosis etiology does not influence the evolution of PCs. Thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly are 2 results of portal hypertension, but the rapid normalization of PBF does not completely or rapidly reverse these 2 phenomena.
