Opening of a foramen ovale during liver transplantation. The value of transesophageal echocardiography. A case is reported of a foramen ovale becoming patent during orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The patient had a hepatoma secondary to post-hepatitis cirrhosis. Monitoring included transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). A veno-venous shunt between the right femoral, portal and left axillary veins was used so as to maintain the venous return during portal and caval clamping. The patient's haemodynamic state remained quite stable throughout this period, and no vasoactive drug was required. Five min after graft reperfusion, pulmonary arterial pressure increased suddenly (mean PAP: 27 mmHg). TEE revealed paradoxical movements of the atrial septum. Colour coded Doppler ultrasound showed blood flowing from the right to the left atrium through a patent foramen ovale. Fifteen min later, mean PAP decreased (18 mmHg) and TEE no longer showed any flow between the two atria. Several studies have reported transient pulmonary hypertension after unclamping when the donor liver is reperfused. This could induce right ventricular failure, with transient inversion of the atrial pressure gradient, which, in turn, could result in a right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale. TEE can monitor regional and overall left ventricular function as well as the atrial septum. This technique might therefore to be useful for cardiac monitoring during OLT.
