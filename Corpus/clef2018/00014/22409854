Validation of transient elastography (Fibroscan) in assessment of hepatic fibrosis in autoimmune hepatitis. To validate transient elastography (Fibroscan) in assessment of hepatic fibrosis in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).Liver stiffness was assessed using Fibroscan in totally 30 patients with AIH. We compared the results of Fibroscan with the Scheuer fibrosis stage in liver biopsy in each patient.4 patients were shown as liver fibrosis stage S0, 6 as S1, 5 as S2, 11 as S3 and 4 as S4. Failure of the Fibroscan measurement occurred in 1 case (3.3%) because of her increased body mass index (BMI). The stiffness of Fibroscan was significantly correlated with the liver biopsy fibrosis stage (r = 0.801, P less than 0.001). The liver stiffnesses between mild and moderate fibrosis (S0-2) and advanced fibrosis (S3-4) were significantly different (t = -3.937, P = 0.001).Transient elastography (Fibroscan) is a promising non-invasive method for detection of fibrosis in patients with autoimmune hepatitis. Its use for the follow up and management of these patients and should be evaluated further.
