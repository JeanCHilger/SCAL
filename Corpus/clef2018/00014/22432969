Transient elastography and simple blood markers in the diagnosis of esophageal varices for compensated patients with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis. Transient elastography (TE) has been useful in esophageal varices (EV) diagnosis for chronic hepatitis C patients. In the present study, we evaluate the usefulness of TE and simple blood markers in the EV diagnosis of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis, prospectively.Consecutive patients with compensated cirrhosis and positive HBV surface antigen were enrolled, prospectively. At enrollment, the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase ratio (AAR) and the AST to platelet ratio index (APRI) were recorded, and TE was performed. Two experienced endoscopists assessed EV independently. High-risk EV was defined as small size with a red color sign, and medium or large in size. The diagnostic performances, optimal cut-offs, and the validities of TE, APRI, platelet count (PLT), and AAR in EV diagnosis were assessed.A total of 126 patients (male/female: 93/33 mean age: 54.5 years) with reliable TE results were analyzed. There was good agreement between two endoscopists in assessing the presence of EV and high-risk EV (kappa value: 0.82 and 0.96). Forty-eight (38.1%) patients had EV (small: 35For compensated patients with HBV-related cirrhosis, TE, APRI, and PLT are useful in excluding high-risk EV with high NPV.
