Impact of heart failure and changes to volume status on liver stiffness: non-invasive assessment using transient elastography. The impact of cardiac dysfunction on the liver is known as cardiac hepatopathy. In certain instances this can result in significant hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. The validity of non-invasive tools to assess hepatic fibrosis, such as FibroScan(®) which measures liver stiffness (LSM), has not been established in this setting. We examined the impact of cardiac dysfunction on LSM using FibroScan(®) and the influence of volume changes on LSM.A prospective, cross-sectional study examined the use of FibroScan(®) in subjects with left-sided heart failure (LHF, n = 32), right-sided heart failure (RHF, n = 9), and acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF, n = 8). The impact of volume changes upon LSM was further examined in the ADHF group (pre- and post-diuresis) and in a haemodialysis group (HD, n = 12), pre- and post-ultrafiltration on dialysis. Compared with healthy controls [n = 55, LSM = median 4.4 (25th percentile 3.6, 75th percentile 5.1) kPa], LSM was increased in all the cardiac dysfunction subgroups [LHF, 4.7 (4.0, 8.7) kPa, P = 0.04 RHF, 9.7 (5.0, 10.8) kPa, P < 0.001Our findings support the concept of increased LSM in the cardiac failure population. LSM was not altered to a statistically significant level with acute volume changes.
