A case of liver cirrhosis with a hyperplastic nodular lesion. A hyperplastic nodular lesion resembling focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) was found in the cirrhotic liver of a 50-year-old male patient. A nodule was detected by ultrasonography and hepatic angiography conducted as part of a routine follow-up study for chronic liver disease, and was excised under a diagnosis of suspected hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, central stellate scar-like septa subdividing the nodule ware noted. These fibrous septa contained many small arteries and veins, as well as bile ducts. The parenchyma of the nodule also contained many small arteries. Although these findings were similar to those seen in typical FNH, the present lesion was different in that it was encapsulated, occurred against a background of liver cirrhosis, lacked hepatocyte hyperplasia and showed hemosiderin deposition.
