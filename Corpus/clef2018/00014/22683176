Radiological findings in patients with imported schistosomiasis. Imaging techniques, primarily ultrasound, are useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with schistosomiasis in endemic areas.Study of 219 patients treated in sub-Saharan Tropical Medicine Unit with a diagnosis of imported schistosomiasis by imaging techniques investigations including plain abdominal radiography and ultrasound.A total of 17.8% of patients who had an abdominal X-ray showed findings suggestive of schistosomiasis, in most cases bladder calcifications. In 73 patients (41%) ultrasound showed pathological findings, mainly diffuse or focal wall thickening (26 patients), nodular lesions (n=14), and pseudopolyps (n=8). One patient, who had a large bladder mass (9cm) and bilateral ureterohydronephrosis, was finally diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder. Ultrasound liver abnormalities were found in 10 patients, 4 with signs of portal hypertension, of which 3 had the characteristic periportal fibrosis in schistosomiasis.Imaging studies, especially abdominal and bladder ultrasound, are useful for diagnosis, the study of disease and monitoring of patients with schistosomiasis in non-endemic countries.
