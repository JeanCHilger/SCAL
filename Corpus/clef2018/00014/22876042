Non-invasive determination of hepatic steatosis by acoustic structure quantification from ultrasound echo amplitude. To use leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice with demonstrated differences in steatosis levels to test a new diagnostic method using the acoustical structure quantification (ASQ) mode and the associated analytical parameter, "focal disturbance ratio" (FD-ratio).Nine ob/ob mice, at 5, 8, and 12 wk of age (n = 3 in each age group), were used as models for hepatic steatosis. Echo signals obtained from ultrasonography in the mice were analyzed by ASQ, which uses a statistical analysis of echo amplitude to estimate inhomogeneity in the diagnostic region. FD-ratio, as calculated from this analysis, was the focus of the present study. FD-ratio and fat droplet areas and sizes were compared between age groups.No fibrosis or inflammation was observed in any of the groups. The fat droplet area significantly (P < 0.01) increased with age from 1.25% ± 0.28% at 5 wk to 31.07% ± 0.48% at 8 wk to 51.69% ± 3.19% at 12 wk. The median fat droplet size also significantly (P < 0.01) increased with age, from 1.33 (0.55-10.52) μm at 5 wk, 2.82 (0.61-44.13) μm at 8 wk and 6.34 (0.66-81.83) μm at 12 wk. The mean FD-ratio was 0.42 ± 0.11 at 5 wk, 0.11 ± 0.05 at 8 wk, and 0.03 ± 0.02 at 12 wk. The FD-ratio was significantly lower at 12 wk than at 5 wk and 8 wk (P < 0.01). A significant negative correlation was observed between the FD-ratio and either the fat droplet area (r = -0.7211, P = 0.0017) or fat droplet size (r = -0.9811, P = 0.0052).This tool for statistical analysis of signals from ultrasonography using the FD-ratio can be used to accurately quantify fat in vivo in an animal model of hepatic steatosis, and may serve as a quantitative biomarker of hepatic steatosis.
