Cardiac dysfunction in cirrhosis is not associated with the severity of liver disease. Cirrhotic cardiomiopathy is described as the presence of cardiac dysfunction in cirrhotic patients. The aim of the study was to investigate factors associated with cardiac dysfunction in cirrhotic patients.Seventy-four cirrhotic patients and twenty-six controls performed a conventional echocardiography and Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) for systolic and diastolic function. Results were analyzed by using the Guidelines of American Society of Echocardiography.In patients with cirrhosis, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was increased (p<0.001) , peak systolic velocities were decreased (11.3±2.7 vs 13.9±1.4cm/s p<0.001) and left atrial volumes were increased (32.7±8.3 vs 24±8.5ml, p<0.001) as well as cardiac mass (90.6±23 vs 70.5±22g/m(2), p<0.001). Forty-seven cirrhotic patients (64%) showed diastolic dysfunction at rest: grade I in 37 and grade II in 10 patients. Systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction were not influenced by a more severe liver impairment. Diastolic dysfunction was more prevalent in patients with ascites vs those without (77% vs 56%A mild diastolic dysfunction at rest is frequent in cirrhotic patients but cardiac load conditions are confounding factors in this diagnosis. We did not identify an association between severity of liver disease and cardiac dysfunction.
