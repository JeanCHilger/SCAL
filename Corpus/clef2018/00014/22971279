Characteristic of liver pathology in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients with mildly elevated ALT. To analyse the live pathology characteristics in mild ALT-elevated (1 x ULN less than ALT less than 2 x ULN ) HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, and to explore the influence of the age and HBV DNA level to liver pathology in different HBeAg status patients.All the patients who met the inclusion criteria form "eleventh five-year plan" National Science and Technology Major Project, the treatment program of integrative traditional and western medicine for CHB were enrolled in this study between October 2009 and March 2011 .B type ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was carried out in all patients and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) , HBeAg titer as well as HBV DNA level were detected at the same time. Hepatic tissue inflammation and fibrosis degree of patients according to HBeAg-positive and negative, age ( more than or equal to 40 years and less than 40 years), HBV DNA level (more than or equal to 10^5copy/ml and less than l0^5 copy/ml) were compared respectively. Chi-square test was used to compare the constitute percentage between the two samples. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was also performed to evaluate the correlation between different factors.There were no significant difference in the grade of liver inflammation and the stage of liver fibrosis between 389 HBeAg positive and 126 HBeAg-negative patients (X2=4.326 and X2=3.464, respectively, P values were all more than 0.05). In the group of patients with age less than 40 years, the distribution of different liver inflammation and fibrosis had no significant difference between HBeAg-positive and negative patients (X2=2.543 and X2=5.024, respectively, P values were all more than 0.05). In the group of patient with age more than or equal to 40 years, the percentage of moderate and severe inflammation (G3, G4) HBeAg-positive patients(32.9%) owned is much higher than that of HBeAg-negative patients(16.4%), X2=8.777, P less than 0.05.But the stage of liver fibrosis in HBeAg-positive patients was not significantly different than that of HBeAg-negative ones (X2=0.977, P more than 0.5). In the group of patients with HBV DNA more than or equal to 10^5copy/ml, the percentage of mild inflammation in HBeAg-positive patients (17.5%) was much high than that of HBeAg-negative patients(7.3%), X2=8.851, P less than 0.05. The stage of liver fibrosis between HBeAg-positive and negative patients was no significant difference (X2=8.227, P more than 0.05).In the patients with HBV DNA less than 10^5 copy/ml, The percentage of HBeAg-negative patients(29.6%) with mild inflammation(G1) was much higher than HBeAg-positive patients (6.9%), X2=6.357, P less than 0.05. There was no significant difference in the stage of liver fibrosis between HBeAg-positive and negative patients (X2=4.061, P more than 0.05). The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age was the independent risk factor for different degree of liver inflammation and fibrosis seriousness.The status of HBeAg has no association with the grade of liver inflammation and the stage of liver fibrosis in CHB patients with mildly elevated ALT. The percentage of moderate and severe inflammation in the HBeAg-positive patients with age more than or equal to 40 years was significantly elevated. The grade of liver inflammation has significant difference between HBeAg-positive and negative patients with different HBV DNA levels as well.
