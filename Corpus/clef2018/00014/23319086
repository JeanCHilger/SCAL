Role of liver biopsy in the era of direct-acting antivirals. An accurate assessment of the degree of fibrosis or presence of cirrhosis is critical both for the appropriate management of, and to provide prognosis for, patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. In the new era of direct acting antivirals, large numbers of patients may enter therapy, and although liver biopsy remains the gold standard, it is not practical in all settings. In recent years, a variety of noninvasive methods have been developed that may obviate the need for liver biopsy in most settings. Indirect laboratory formulas, tests, panels of biomarkers and imaging modalities may accurately stage the degree of fibrosis in hepatitis C monoinfection, hepatitis C/HIV coinfection, and post-transplant recurrent hepatitis C.
