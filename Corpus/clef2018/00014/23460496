Persistent abnormal liver fibrosis after weaning off parenteral nutrition in pediatric intestinal failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of pediatric intestinal failure (IF) on liver histology. Altogether, 38 IF patients (median age: 7.2 years range, 0.2-27) underwent liver biopsy, gastroscopy, abdominal ultrasound, and laboratory tests. Sixteen patients were on parenteral nutrition (PN) after 74 PN months (range, 2.5-204). Twenty-two had weaned off PN 8.8 years (range, 0.3-27) earlier, after 35 PN months (range, 0.7-250). Fifteen transplant donor livers served as controls. Abnormal liver histology was found in 94% of patients on PN and 77% of patients weaned off PN (P = 0.370). During PN, liver histology weighted with cholestasis (38% of patients on PN versus 0% of patients weaned off PNDespite resolution of cholestasis and portal inflammation, significant liver fibrosis and steatosis persist after weaning off PN. Extensive small intestinal resection was the major predictor for liver fibrosis stage.
