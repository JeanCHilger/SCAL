Pseudolesions on clinical imaging caused by Sappey veins: a dynamic contrast magnetic resonance and Doppler study. This study aimed to investigate the anatomy and mechanism of pseudolesions around falciform ligament, which appeared on dynamic contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.A total of 30 cases were included in the normal control group (group 1), and 30 cases were enrolled into the liver cirrhosis group (group 2). All cases underwent MR examination including in-phase and out-phase T1-weighted image, T2-weighted fat-suppressed image, and dynamic MR imaging enhancement scanning. The MR images were analyzed to detect pseudolesions, and results from the 2 groups were compared. An ultrasound examination was also performed in all cases to assess the abdominal umbilical vein blood flow.In group 1, MR images detected pseudolesions in 13 cases, and signal reduction did not appear in out-phase MR images compared with in-phase MR images. In 5 of these cases, the umbilical vein was observed to be connected with the hepatic IV segment, and direction flow was toward hepatic during Doppler ultrasound examination. In the 30 patients with liver cirrhosis, pseudolesions were not detected in any of the cases, dilation of the vena epigastricas was observed in 12 cases, and flow direction was from liver. The difference in the incidence of falciform ligament pseudolesions between group 1 and group 2 was statistically significant (P > 0.01).Pseudolesions around the falciform ligament are associated with the Sappey vein, and there is no significant relationship with fatty infiltration.
