Twin pregnancy after liver transplantation. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed in a 29-year-old woman because of increasing decompensation of HBs-antigen positive post-hepatitic cirrhosis. Postoperatively she developed a mild rejection reaction and diabetes mellitus. Thirteen months after the transplant she conceived twins. This high risk pregnancy was complicated by a febrile viral infection with purulent tracheobronchitis at 9 weeks and a threatened abortion at 11 weeks. At 33 weeks there was a sudden drop in haemoglobin due to a minor uterine rupture which necessitated cesarean section. The female infants--of development in keeping with the dates--showed no clinical or ultrasound evidence of any malformations. Apart from initial difficulties--asphyxia (second twin), fluctuating glucose and calcium levels, an episode of neonatal jaundice which required phototherapy, reluctance to suck and hypotonia--the further development of both twins proceeded normally. The maternal diabetes disappeared after delivery, HBs-antigen remained negative and the HBs-antibody titre rose. The patient has remained in good condition, both mentally and physically.
