Measurement of hepatic blood flow by the hydrogen gas clearance method. Experimental and clinical observations. In this study, the author intended to examine the validity of the inhaled hydrogen gas clearance method (i-H2) for determination of the hepatic blood flow (HBF), and also to show some applicabilities of the method in experimental animals and patients with liver diseases. Simultaneous determinations of HBF by i-H2 and electromagnetic flowmetry in rabbits revealed an excellent correlation between the values obtained by the two methods. Moreover, HBF in rabbits measured by i-H2 varied in parallel with that by thermocouple flowmetry or laser Doppler velocimetry after administration of norepinephrine, propranolol or glucagon. In carbon tetrachloride-treated rats, HBF measured by i-H2 correlated better with the severity of damage in the sinusoidal structure than the severity of hepatic cell injury or the serum levels of transaminases. HBF as determined by i-H2 was significantly decreased in acute hepatitis (AH), chronic inactive hepatitis (CIH), chronic active hepatitis (CAH), liver cirrhosis (LC) and fatty liver. Reduced HBF in AH returned to normal during recovery of the disease. The ratio of HBF in tumor/normal tissue was greater than 1.0 for hepatocellular carcinoma in contrast to the ratio of less than 1.0 for metastatic liver carcinoma. Propranolol caused a decrease in HBF by 31%, and vasopressin by 39% in patients with CIH or LC. In contrast, glucagon induced its increase by 65%, 35% and 17%, respectively, in patients with CIH, AH and LC.
