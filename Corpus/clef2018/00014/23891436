MRI and (1)H MRS evaluation for the serial bile duct changes in hamsters after infection with Opisthorchis viverrini. A 3T MR scanner was used to investigate the relationship between the alteration of bile duct lesions and the hepatic metabolic changes in hamsters infected with Opisthorchis viverrini by using 3T MRI and (1)H MR spectroscopy. Animals were divided into control and infected groups. Five normal hamsters were used as control fifty-five hamsters were infected with O. viverrini to induce bile duct lesions and hepatic metabolic changes. T2-weighted image sequence in three orthogonal planes were conducted by MRI scans. Single-voxel (1)H MRS was performed to obtain the relative choline-to-lipid ratios. The livers and bile ducts were excised for the histologic examination. The progression of bile duct changes by histology and metabolic changes in O. viverrini infected hamsters were co-investigated. In the O. viverrini-infected group, the T2-weighted images revealed the time-dependent intra- and extra-hepatic duct dilatations in the liver. The mean (±SD) choline-to-lipid ratios were 0.11±0.035 in the control group, whereas the ratio in the infected group increased significantly with the progression of time. Histologic grading of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis were correlated well with the MRI grading (Spearman rank correlation test
