Quantitative elastography of liver fibrosis and spleen stiffness in chronic hepatitis B carriers: comparison of shear-wave elastography and transient elastography with liver biopsy correlation. To document utility of shear-wave (SW) elastography for assessing liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B and to compare its performance with that of transient elastography.Ethics committee approved the study, and informed consent was obtained. Patients with liver biopsy correlation (n = 226) and healthy patients (n = 171) were analyzed. Results of SW elastography of liver, SW elastography of spleen, and transient elastography of liver were compared and correlated according to METAVIR scores. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs), binary logistic regression, and Delong test were used.AUC for SW elastography of liver, transient elastography of liver, and SW elastography of spleen was, respectively, 0.86, 0.80, and 0.81 for fibrosis (≥ F1 stage) 0.88, 0.78, and 0.82 for moderate fibrosis (≥ F2 stage)SW elastography provides more accurate correlation of liver elasticity with liver fibrosis stage compared with transient elastography, especially in identification of stage F2 or greater.
