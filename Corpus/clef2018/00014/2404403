Effect of endoscopic sclerotherapy and propranolol on the blood flow of esophageal varices. The blood flow in esophageal varices was measured by endoscopic laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) in 27 patients histologically or clinically diagnosed as having liver cirrhosis. The effect of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS), and of intravenous oral administration of propranolol, on the output signal of LDV was evaluated. EIS was performed intravariceally after the measurement, with a 50% glucose solution, human thrombin (1000 U), and Aethoxysclerol as sclerosants.
