Relationship between the liver tissue shear modulus and histopathologic findings analyzed by intraoperative shear wave elastography and digital microscopically assisted morphometry in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Shear wave elastography is a novel noninvasive method for assessing liver fibrosis by measuring liver stiffness. This study was conducted to evaluate how pathologic changes could have an impact on measured elasticity values in both resected hepatocellular carcinomas and adjacent liver tissue.Intraoperative shear wave elastography was performed in 7 patients who underwent liver resection at our institution 7 hepatocellular carcinomas and adjacent liver tissue were subjected to elastographic measurements. A total of 48 circular regions of interest (ROIsBy univariate analysis, the proportions of collagen fiber areas (P = .039), fibrous areas (P = .045), hepatocellular nuclear areas (P = .045), and nuclear areas other than hepatocellular and lymphoplasmacytic areas (P = .039) showed statistically positive associations with mean stiffness values. Multivariate analysis indicated that the proportion of collagen fiber areas was the strongest pathologic determinant of mean stiffness (P = .008), with hepatocellular nuclear areas also having a significant effect (P = .010).Fibrosis predictably affects elastographic estimation, but hepatocellular density (ie, hepatocellular nuclear areas) also alters elastographic assessment.
