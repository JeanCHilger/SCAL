Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a negative risk factor for prostate cancer recurrence. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely related to the metabolic syndrome, which is associated with an increased risk of various malignancies. In this study, we investigated the association between NAFLD and prostate cancer biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy. Consecutive prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were enrolled from two hospitals in Korea and randomly assigned to the training (n=147) or validation set (n=146). The presence of NAFLD, BMI, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, and histological findings including Gleason score (GSc) were analyzed in regard to their association with BCR. NAFLD was diagnosed based on ultrasonography or unenhanced computed tomography images. BCR-free survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. In the training set, 32 (21.8%) patients developed BCR during a median follow-up period of 51 (inter-quartile range, 35-65) months. In the multivariate analysis, the presence of NAFLD (hazard ratio (HR), 0.36 95% CI, 0.14-0.97
