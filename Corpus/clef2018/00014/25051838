Influencing factors in elderly patients with schistosomiasis liver disease combined with gallbladder diseases. To understand the status of elderly patients with schistosomiasis liver diseases combined with gallbladder diseases, and explore the influencing factors.A total of 280 elderly patients with schistosomiasis liver disease were divided into two groups, 198 cases of chronic liver fibrosis and 82 cases of liver cirrhosis, and the results of their gallbladder ultrasound and liver function examinations were analyzed statistically.Among the 280 cases, 157 patients were combined with gallbladder diseases (56.1%), including gallbladder wall thickening (28.2%, 79/280), cholecystolithiasis (13.6%, 38/ 280), cholecystitis (11.1%, 31/280), and gallbladder polyp (3.2%, 9/280). The incidence rates of gallbladder wall thickening, cholecystitis and cholecystolithiasis in the schistosomiasis patients with cirrhosis were significantly higher than those in the schistosomiasis patients with liver fibrosis (chi2 = 4.568, P < 0.05).The main influencing factors of schistosomiasis liver disease combined with gallbladder diseases are the age, the course of the disease, liver cirrhosis and the portal hypertension degree.
