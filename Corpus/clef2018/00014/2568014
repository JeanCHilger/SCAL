Prolonged hepatitis due to ajmaline--description of a case and review of the literature. A 60 years old woman was admitted for jaundice and fever which appeared after a treatment with ajmaline-butabarbital for two-weeks. Abdominal ultrasound examination and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography were normal. Mitochondrial antibodies were absent. Jaundice persisted for three years, associated with diffuse cutaneous xanthomatosis. Five years later, alkaline phosphatases remained elevated. A liver biopsy showed vanishing interlobular bile ducts with centrolobular cholestasis and ductular proliferation. We suggest that ajmaline can induce long lasting cholestasis due to damage to the intrahepatic bile ducts. The responsibility of butabarbital and the relationship with primary biliary cirrhosis are discussed.
