Portal hypertension in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Portal hypertension in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is rare. A 64-year-old woman with CLL for 5 years and increasing hepatosplenomegaly developed portal hypertension and bleeding gastric varices. There was no portal vein thrombus by abdominal echography and angiography. Following splenectomy and devascularization of the fornix, the gastric varices disappeared. The liver biopsy showed dense leukemic cell infiltration in portal triads, but no fibrosis. The portal hypertension in this case may be mainly due to increased portal flow from the enlarged spleen and leukemic cell infiltration in the liver. Previously reported cases are summarized.
