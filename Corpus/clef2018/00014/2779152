Hepatogenic ulcer (various aspects of its pathogenesis). Functional and morphological state of the stomach and duodenum was studied in 98 patients with liver cirrhosis. Hepatogenous ulcer was revealed in 21.7 per cent of the patients with alcoholic and in 25 per cent of those with viral liver cirrhosis. A specific feature of the condition was the development of ulcer in reduced gastric acid production and its asymptomatic course. The incidence of gastric and duodenal affections in liver cirrhosis was significantly higher in pronounced portal hypertension. Study of the portal blood flow with Doppler ultrasonography can reveal the risk group (patients with pronounced portal hypertension) which has high probability of the development of erosion-ulcerous lesions. These patients require obligatory medical checkups with gastric and duodenal endoscopy 2-3 times a year.
