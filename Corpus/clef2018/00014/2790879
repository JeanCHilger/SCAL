The effect of terlipressin (Remestyp Spofa) on hemodynamic parameters in patients with portal hypertension associated with liver cirrhosis. Remestyp Spofa is used in wide clinical practice, among others also in the comprehensive treatment of acute haemorrhage from oesophageal varices. To patients with portal hypertension, oesophageal varices associated with cirrhosis of the liver by means of an infusion pump Remestyp was administered, 13.4 micrograms/1 kg body weight for one hour. By means of a Doppler flowmeter the rate of the blood flow and the blood flow through the trunk of the portal vein was assessed before, at 10-minute intervals during infusion, and during the 90th, 120th and 150th minute. After administration of the drug no significant effect on the investigated parameters was recorded. Therefore in the same group of patients by means of a catheter before and after infusion the following parameters were assessed: central venous pressure, pressure in the pulmonary artery, cardiac minute output, pressure in the free and wedged hepatic vein. Simultaneously changes of the systemic blood pressure were investigated. After Remestyp a significant rise of the systemic blood pressure was recorded, a rise of the central venous pressure and the pressure in the pulmonary artery. The minute volume declined slightly. The pressure in the free and wedged hepatic vein rose. The authors assume therefore that the direct effect of Remestyp on the portal circulation is not haemodynamically significant. The favourable haemostyptic action of Remestyp in patients with haemorrhage from oesophageal varices is rather due to an increased tonus of the oesophageal sphincters. With regard to the very satisfactory experience with the administration of nitrates in this indication their combined administration with vasopressin or its derivatives is considered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
