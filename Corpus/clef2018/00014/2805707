The effect of octanoic fatty acid on the cardiovascular system of the guinea pig. The aim of the study was to clarify the role of octanoic acid (OA) in the development of cardiovascular disorders occurring in some liver diseases associated with high OA levels in blood serum. The effect of OA (caprylic acid) on the functional state of the cardiovascular system was studied in guinea pig by means of the thermodilution method and ultrasound Doppler echography. It was found that, as a result of its inotropic action, OA decreases arterial pressure and vascular resistance while increasing cardiac output. The effect of OA can be inhibited by the administration of indomethacin, a fact suggesting the prostaglandin system plays a role in the mechanism of cardiovascular action of OA. This hypothesis represents a new concept regarding the pathogenesis of the hyperdynamic cardiovascular syndrome in liver cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.
