Variceal haemorrhage in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia. Hepatic in involvement in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia can lead to cirrhosis and occasionally to portal hypertension and variceal haemorrhage. The ultrasonographic, arteriographic and histological findings are described in a patient with this complication. Hepatic artery embolisation proved unsuccessful in arresting repeated haemorrhage which was eventually controlled by hepatic artery ligation. Porto-systemic venous shunting, an apparently logical approach to management, would probably have aggravated the problem.
