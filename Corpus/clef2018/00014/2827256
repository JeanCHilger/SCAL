Sonographic findings in the gallbladder in mucoviscidosis patients. The improved survival time of patients with mucoviscidosis has revealed some new complications. 137 patients were studied by sonography. The findings in the gall bladder have been compared with liver echogenicity. A micro-gall bladder was found in 37 patients (27%). 74 patients had a normal gall bladder (54%). Concretions were found in 22 (16%) of patients. 10 out of the 22 patients with concretions showed sonographic changes in the liver. In view of the frequent abdominal symptoms in patients with mucoviscidosis, sonography should be used routinely as a non-invasive method of investigation.
