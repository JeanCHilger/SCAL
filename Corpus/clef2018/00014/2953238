Changes of splanchnic circulation with progression of chronic liver disease studied by echo-Doppler flowmetry. Changes that occurred in splanchnic circulation with the progression of chronic liver disease were investigated using an ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter in healthy adults and in patients with chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis in the supine position after an overnight fast. Superior mesenteric venous flow, splenic venous flow, and portal venous flow were significantly increased in patients with liver cirrhosis but not in patients with chronic active hepatitis compared with normal subjects. Portal venous flow (control value 10.5 +/- 2.3 ml/min/kg body weight) minus the sum of superior mesenteric venous flow and splenic venous flow was 0.8 +/- 2.1 ml/min/kg body weight in the control, (0.1 +/- 1.9) in chronic active hepatitis, and (-2.2 +/- 4.3) in liver cirrhosis the difference was significant between the control and cirrhosis groups. These results indicate that in patients with liver cirrhosis a hyperdynamic state occurs in the splanchnic circulation of the intestine and spleen and that some portion of splanchnic blood flow bypasses the liver into the systemic circulation.
