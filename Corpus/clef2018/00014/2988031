Differential diagnosis of liver diseases in the nuclear spin tomogram. In evaluating nuclear magnetic tomography for the diagnosis of liver disease, one must differentiate between circumscribed and diffuse lesions. Nuclear magnetic tomography provides additional information for lesions which are echogenic on ultrasound and can differentiate between metastases, haemangiomas and hamartomas. In diffuse parenchymal disease measurement of relaxation time can differentiate between fatty liver, cirrhosis (alcoholic, primary biliary), haemochromatosis (cirrhotic transformation) and hepatoma. NMR spectroscopy is a method for the future.
