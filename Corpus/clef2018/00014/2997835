Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has recently been separated as a distinct clinicopathologic entity with a better prognosis than the usual HCC associated with cirrhosis. The mean age of our 17 patients was 20 years. Alpha fetoprotein levels were normal, and none of the risk factors for HCC was present. Distinctive histologic features included deeply eosinophilic polygonal hepatocytes and abundant fibrous stroma. Calcification was present on plain films of five of 13 cases. Sonography usually showed a homogeneous, echogenic mass. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated small, central calcification in four of ten cases. A central echodensity, hypodense on CT scans, was seen in two cases and corresponded to a central scar. By combining clinical and laboratory data with radiologic tests, a correct diagnosis can often be suggested before biopsy is performed.
