Radionuclide angiography and scintigraphy in hepatocellular carcinoma. Among 1 257 patients subjected to liver-spleen (RES) scintigraphy and radionuclide angiography (RNA), there were 13 cases of histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (1%). All 13 patients had scintigraphic findings indicating cirrhosis. Histologically, cirrhosis was present in only 9 out of 11 cases in which liver parenchyma was available for examination. One patient had hemochromatosis without evidence of cirrhosis. In 11 cases, the tumor was clearly demonstrated as a defect in the static scintigram. However, in 2 cases with cirrhosis and poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, the tumor nodules were hardly discernible. In RNA, the tumor displayed high activity in the arterial phase and decreasing activity during the portal phase, ending up as a defect. At RNA, the lesion was clearly outlined in 12 cases, including the 2 patients in whom the scintigraphic findings were inconclusive in one case with severe cirrhosis and a well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, the tumor was barely detectable. We conclude that a combination of RNA and scintigraphy is a valuable screening which usually provides a correct diagnosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.
