Correlation of ultrasonic attenuation with pathologic fat and fibrosis in liver disease. The attenuation coefficient in two groups (n1 = 70 n2 = 59) of pathologically graded in vitro human liver specimens was measured over a frequency range from 1.25-8.0 MHz and fitted to a power law model. The slopes of the power law curves at 5 MHz were correlated with pathological scores for fat in Group I, which consisted of normal and fatty livers (no fibrosis)
