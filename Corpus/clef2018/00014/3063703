Diagnosis and surgical correction of patent ductus venosus in a calf. Patent ductus venosus was diagnosed in a 10-week-old Holstein heifer with acute onset of collapse and marked tenesmus. Additional clinical signs observed during the course of hospitalization included depression, anorexia, hind limb ataxia, bruxism, and poor growth. Clinicopathologic test results included high blood ammonia concentration, prolonged sulfobromophthalein half-life, and high serum bile acid concentration. Liver biopsy revealed mild periportal fibrosis, but no appreciable hepatocyte atrophy. Mesenteric portography and percutaneous ultrasonography confirmed the patent ductus venosus. An atrial septal defect prosthesis was placed in the ductus venosus, using a catheterization technique. After surgery, however, clinicopathologic test results were unchanged. Ultrasonography revealed that the prosthesis had pulled away from one side of the vessel. When the calf was 10.5 months old, surgical correction was achieved by a transhepatic ligation technique. Ultrasonography confirmed closure of the ductus venosus during and after surgery. Blood ammonia and serum bile acid concentrations and sulfobromophthalein half-life were normal 3 weeks after surgery. The calf had no further episodes of hepatoencephalopathy and was successfully bred at 18 months of age.
