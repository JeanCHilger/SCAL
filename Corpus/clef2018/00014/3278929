Ultrasonic characterization of splenic tissue in myelofibrosis: further evidence for reversal of fibrosis with chemotherapy. Fibrosis in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) is seen not only in the bone marrow but also around the metaplastic foci in the spleen and liver. Following our observation of reversal of bone marrow fibrosis in MF patients treated with chemotherapy, we undertook ultrasonic splenic tissue characterization studies using sound speed measurements to assess the effect of such therapy on the splenic fibrosis. Single studies in 19 patients showed overlapping ranges among the three sub-groups classified according to the grade of bone marrow fibrosis, but the mean values in these sub-groups showed a trend towards decreasing sound speed with increasing marrow fibrosis. Sequential studies in 9 of these patients showed increased splenic sound speed with decreasing marrow fibrosis in 8 patients following treatment, with a reversal of this pattern seen in 1 patient 1-2 years post-treatment. These results suggest simultaneous reversal of fibrosis in the bone marrow and the spleen in MF patients receiving effective chemotherapy.
