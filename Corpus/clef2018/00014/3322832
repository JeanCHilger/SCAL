Ultrasound findings in childhood chronic liver parenchymal diseases. An analysis of 41 patients. Forty-one children with liver disease were studied by ultrasound scan at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Diagnoses were confirmed either by liver biopsy or specific laboratory tests. Sonograms were studied for liver size, beam penetration, echogenicity, vascularity, and biliary tree abnormalities. Different liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis, biliary cirrhosis, Wilson's disease, familial idiopathic cirrhosis, type III glycogen storage disease, and secondary haemochromatosis revealed non-specific disease patterns. Four cases of biliary cirrhosis and two cases of glycogen storage disease showed periportal fibrosis. Two cases of familial idiopathic cirrhosis and a case of Wilson's disease revealed thickening of the gall bladder wall, which has not been described in the literature.
