Appendicular mucoid impaction disclosing mucoviscidosis with cirrhosis in a young adult without pulmonary lesion. A 22-year-old man presented with pain in the right iliac fossa. Clinical examination suggested appendicitis and showed splenomegaly. Echography and abdominal CT-sca suggested the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis based on the association of signs of cirrhosis and pancreatic atrophy. The sweat test was positive. The hypothesis of a mucoid appendicular impaction with spontaneous regression was retained based on clinical and radiological signs. This atypical presentation of cystic fibrosis underscores the frequency of obstructive intestinal which occasionally reveals the disease in the adult, and on the absence in this case of otherwise frequently associated problems such as significant pulmonary disease and malnutrition.
