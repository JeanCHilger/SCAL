Regenerating nodules in cirrhosis: sonographic appearance with anatomic correlation. A sonographic-anatomic correlation study was undertaken to define the sonographic appearance of regenerating nodules in cirrhotic livers. Three cirrhotic livers with multiple regenerating nodules were obtained from patients undergoing liver transplantation. Sonograms of the resected livers were made and correlated directly with the anatomic specimens. Using a 3-MHz transducer, no discrete alterations in the echo texture of the livers were seen to correspond to the regenerating nodules. With a 7.5-MHz transducer, discrete islands of liver parenchyma were identified corresponding to regenerating nodules anatomically. The nodules were recognized because of visualization of thin, slightly more echogenic borders, which corresponded pathologically to fibrous and fatty connective tissue surrounding and separating the nodules.
