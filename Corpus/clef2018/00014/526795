The accuracy of ultrasound in the detection of cirrhosis of the liver. The association of high amplitude echoes returned from the liver and cirrhosis is well recognized. There have been no reports in the literature as to the overall incidence of this finding in the clinical situation. We report our experience in a series of 67 patients with proven cirrhosis who had liver biopsy and an ultrasound examination within three months of one another. In 43 patients cirrhosis was suggested by recognition of a bright liver echo pattern. In 23 patients the liver echo pattern was normal, although additional relevant information was shown in half of this group. The detailed pathology has been analysed in an attempt to account for the false negative examinations, revealing a strong trend for cases of micronodular cirrhosis to give positive ultrasound examinations and macronodular cirrhosis negative examinations.
