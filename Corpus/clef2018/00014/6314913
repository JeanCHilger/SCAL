Evaluation of chemotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma with liver cirrhosis. The present paper discusses the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy in 46 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. In most of patients, Adriamycin (20-40 mg) or Mitomycin C (20 mg) was given by one shot injection via the hepatic artery and followed by serial administration of anticancer agents such as 5-fluorouracil (300-750 mg/day), Adriamycin and Toyomycin. Results were as follows: 1) The complete response was not seen. 2) The partial response (more than 50% decrease of the tumor size) was observed in 6 of 46 patients (13%) for 34 to 457 days. 3) Absence of tumor thrombi in the portal vein which was observed by hepatic angiography, CT and ultrasonography, was closely correlated in the partial response and the prolongation of survival time. 4) There were no significant differences with the therapeutic response or survival time among 3 groups (E2: tumor occupation rate (TOR) 20-40%, E3: TOR 40-60%, E4: TOR above 60%). 5) Obstinate abdominal pain and abnormal liver function remarkably were improved during the chemotherapy in 11 of 18 cases (61%), and 6 of 46 cases (13 %), respectively. 6) Major causes of death were hepatic failure (45.7%), gastrointestinal bleeding (30.4%) and intra-abdominal rupture of the tumor (14.7%). 7) As side effect, some extent of hematopoietic suppression was observed in 25% of the patients treated.
