Liver tissue characterization using computerized echography. A digital echographic data acquisition and evaluation system was used in a clinical study including more than 100 patients with various local or diffuse liver tissue alterations. For diagnosis two decision methods are applied: first linear discriminant analysis and second a Bayesian method. Each A-scan is represented by a set of various numerical parameters from which only the most signal-distinctive ones are used for evaluation. The diagnostic results which will be presented and discussed have proved the method to be very sensitive and specific.
