Medical treatment of splenic abscess. I have described the first reported patient with a diagnosis of splenic abscess treated medically who survived. Another unusual aspect of this case was the establishment of the diagnosis of splenic abscess by ultrasonic examination. Some typical features of splenic abscess illustrated by this case were compromised patient, known abnormal spleen, febrile illness of uncertain cause, and a low index of suspicion causing delay in correct diagnosis. Despite this patient's survival, splenectomy with antibiotic coverage is the preferred treatment of splenic abscess.
