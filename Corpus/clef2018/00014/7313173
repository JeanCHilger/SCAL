Ultrasonographic evaluation of jaundiced patients: accuracy in 246 controlled cases (author's transl). In 246 controlled jaundiced patients, the value of ultrasonography was confirmed. The differentiation of medical from surgical jaundice was 96% accurate. There was an increase in the overall accuracy due to technological developments and better scanning techniques. Nevertheless important diagnostic problems are still unresolved. Although the precise location of the obstructing lesion was determined in 86% of surgical case, the cause was established in only 69%. In medical jaundice diagnostic findings were observed only in congestive liver due to chronic heart failure and in some cases of cirrhosis.
