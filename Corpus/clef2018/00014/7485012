The frequency and influence of gallbladder varices on gallbladder functions in patients with portal hypertension. Gallbladder varices have been reported in patients with portal hypertension. The exact frequency and significance of these collaterals in patients with cirrhotic and noncirrhotic portal hypertension is not known. One hundred and two patients with portal hypertension [38 with cirrhosis, 29 with noncirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF) and 35 with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO)] and 25 healthy controls were studied. Gallbladder varices were seen at ultrasound as tortuous, dilated vessels in the wall or in the bed of the gallbladder. In 35 patients (19 patients with and 16 without gallbladder varices) and in 10 healthy controls, gallbladder functions were studied by determining fasting volume (FV) and then residual volume (RV) every 10 min over 1 h after giving a liquid meal of 420 k.cal. Ejection fraction (EF) was computed as a percentage by the formula: FV--RV/FV x 100. Twenty four (24%) patients had gallbladder varices: Five (13%) with cirrhosis, seven (24%) with NCPF, and 12 (34%) with EHPVO. FV in EHPVO patients was seen significantly more than in cirrhotics (31.6 +/- 15.4 vs 19.3 +/- 6.0 ml, p < 0.05). The RV and EF were not different in the three groups of patients compared with the controls. The EF was similar in patients with or without gallbladder varices (63.3 +/- 10.2% vs 64.6 +/- 10.4%). Gallbladder varices are often seen in portal hypertension, more often in EHPVO patients, and these collaterals cause some gallbladder stasis but do not impede gallbladder function and hence seem unlikely to contribute to gallstone formation.
