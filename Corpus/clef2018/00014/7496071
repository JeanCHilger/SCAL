Effects of bathing in hot water on portal hemodynamics in healthy subjects and in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis. Bathing in hot water induces vasodilatation of the peripheral vessels and alteration of blood distribution. Using a Doppler flowmeter, we evaluated the effect of bathing in hot water on portal hemodynamics. Eight controls and 8 patients with compensated liver cirrhosis remained immersed in hot water at 42 degrees C for 5 minutes. Portal flow significantly decreased from 811 +/- 141 (ml/min) at the baseline to 530 +/- 98 in the controls and from 855 +/- 308 to 642 +/- 208 in cirrhotics immediately after bathing. This decrease (25%) in cirrhotics was significantly less than that (35%) in controls because vessel diameter did not decrease as rapidly as it did in controls. Portal flow after 30 minutes returned to the baseline values in controls but remained low in cirrhotics. These findings suggest that cirrhotics have a lower hemodynamic response to bathing in hot water compared with that in controls.
