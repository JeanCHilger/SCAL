Long-term prognosis of chronic B and C viral hepatitis. 146 patients (62 female, 84 male) with chronic hepatitis B and 80 patients (34 female, 46 male) with chronic hepatitis C were regularly examined in 1 to 2 year intervals with an average follow-up period of 12 years (mean). Each time patients were evaluated by physical examination, routine laboratory data, immunological and serological testing, ultrasonography, and laparoscopy and/or percutaneous liver biopsy. No patient of the study underwent immunosuppressive or antiviral treatment at any time.-The average time data in years are given as the median value (mean). Chronic hepatitis B: Histologic diagnoses and their long-term prognosis: Chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) on first biopsy: 10% of cases complete recovery after 15 years, 70% progression to chronic active hepatitis (CAH) after 5 years CAH: 30% advanced remission/complete recovery 8 years after the first diagnosis of CAH, 40% progression to liver cirrhosis after 5 years
