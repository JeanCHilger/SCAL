Insulin autoimmune syndrome as a cause of spontaneous hypoglycemia in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hypoglycemia in fulminant hepatic failure and hyperinsulinemia in cirrhosis are well-described phenomena. A patient with alcoholic cirrhosis who developed fasting hypoglycemia with an extremely high immunoreactive insulin level and a mildly elevated C-peptide level is reported. An insulinoma was excluded by detailed radiological imaging of the pancreas and by endoscopic ultrasonography. Detection of very high levels of insulin autoantibodies with no prior exposure to exogenous insulin confirmed the diagnosis of insulin autoimmune syndrome. During his hospital course, the patient developed another rare syndrome, acquired inhibitors to factor V, which led to the fatal coagulopathy that resulted in his death. Insulin autoimmune syndrome is the third leading cause of spontaneous hypoglycemia in Japan, where it has been associated with a variety of diseases and drugs. Outside of Japan, only approximately 20 cases have been reported and usually have been found in the context of an underlying autoimmune disorder or prior exposure to sulfhydryl drugs. It is believed that this is the first case reported outside Japan occurring in association with alcoholic liver disease, and the first in the world with coexisting acquired inhibitors to factor V.
