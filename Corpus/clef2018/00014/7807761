A case of liver cirrhosis presenting with right pleural fluid without ascites. A 80-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of appetite loss, dry cough, and dyspnea on exertion. Chest X-ray film showed massive right pleural effusion. On physical examination, the right thorax was dull to percussion, and breath sounds of the right lung field were diminished. Examination of the cardiovascular system was unremarkable. Hepatosplenomegaly and ascites were not evident. The character of the pleural fluid was transudative. Cytological findings were negative and culture of the pleural fluid was normal. First, the pleural fluid was diminished by thoracic drainage. But, after the cessation of drainage, the pleural fluid soon reaccumulated. Abdominal ultrasonography showed typical liver cirrhosis pattern without ascites. An intraperitoneal injection of 99mTc-sulfur colloid was followed by positive uptake of radioactivity in the right pleural cavity from 1 hour after the injection, demonstrating the existence of a direct perito-pleural communication. Thus, the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis presenting with right pleural fluid, without ascites was made. This case indicates that the absence of ascites cannot exclude cirrhosis as the etiologic cause of pleural effusion.
