Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver. Ultrasound and CT features. Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver is characterized by a well-circumscribed, encapsulated inflammatory mass consisting of inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis. We report the radiological findings of inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver in two patients with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, showing a poorly defined, heterogeneous, hypovascular mass, mimicking a tumor. Radiological findings are not characteristic and definitive diagnosis requires needle biopsy or surgery.
