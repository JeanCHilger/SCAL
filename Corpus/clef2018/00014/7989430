HCV-RNA detection in ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsies of liver nodules and surrounding tissue. HCV-RNA was examined in serum and liver tissue obtained from 8 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative patients with liver nodules ranging in size from 2 to 11 cm. Histological examination of ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsies revealed the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in six patients (5 of whom were anti-HCV positive), cholangiocarcinoma in 1 patient (anti-HCV positive) and dysplastic regenerative nodule in 1 patient (anti-HCV negative). The HCCs were surrounded by cirrhosis (3 cases), chronic active hepatitis (CAH) (n = 2) and post hepatitic fibrosis (n = 1), the cholangiocarcinoma by CAH and the regenerative nodule by cirrhotic liver. Total and replicative intermediate HCV-RNA was analyzed by reverse-transcription-nested PCR of the 5'-untranslated region. The five patients with HCC had HCV-RNA in serum, in tumorous and surrounding liver tissues. The viral nucleic acid was also detected in the cirrhotic tissue surrounding the cholangiocarcinoma but not in the tumor. Two out of 5 HCC patients had replicative intermediate RNA (negative strand) in tumorous tissue, 4 in nontumorous tissue and 3 in serum. These results demonstrate that fine needle biopsy can provide sufficient material for both histological examination and HCV-RNA determination and suggest the existence of continuous viral replication during the carcinogenic process.
