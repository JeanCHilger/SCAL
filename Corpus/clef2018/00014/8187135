Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts using the Wallstent prosthesis: a follow-up study. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) in 45 patients with cirrhosis during a mean follow-up of 7 months.Forty-five consecutive patients treated by TIPS and who had been followed for at least 6 months after TIPS or until death, were included. Mean follow-up was 7.2 +/- 5.0 months. Shunt patency was assessed at 1 week and 1 month, then every 3 months after the procedure by Doppler US and angiography whenever needed.Thirty-six patients had been stented for refractory bleeding from ruptured esophagogastric varices. Of these, 8 patients (22%) rebled, 7 of whom were treated by a second shunt. Nine patients were treated for refractory ascites. Three patients had recurrent ascites due to shunt obstruction. All were treated by a second shunt which occluded in 2 patients. As a whole, 14 (31.1%) patients developed shunt obstruction within a mean of 120 +/- 136 days, 4 of whom remained asymptomatic. Other complications were septicemia by Staphylococcus aureus in 1 patient, transient encephalopathy in 9 patients, and disseminated intravascular coagulation in 1 patient.TIPS appears to be a relatively safe and effective technique in treating complications of portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis. Shunt obstruction in 31% of our patients probably represents the most important limitation of this technique.
