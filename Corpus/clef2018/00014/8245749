Risk factors of gallstone disease in a sample of patients in Benha City. This study included one hundred cases of gallstone disease diagnosed by ultrasonography and a similar group of matched controls chosen from Benha University and General Hospitals. Both cases and controls were subjected to a specially designed questionnaire, clinical examination, anthropometric measurements, ultrasonography and laboratory investigations to find out some risk factors that may contribute to the development of gallstone disease. Females constituted the majority of cases (87%) while males were a minority (13%). In both sexes, the highest percentages of cases were among patients aged fifty years or more (53.8% and 33.3% for males and females respectively). Bad dietary habits including increased consumption of animal fats and frequent use of snacks between meals, obesity as indicated by body mass index and body fat percent, positive family history of gallstones and liver cirrhosis were found to be significant risk factors in the predisposition to gallstones in the present study. On the other hand, factors suggesting hormonal role in the pathogenesis of gallstones such as age of menarche, duration of menstrual life, age at first pregnancy, multiparity and duration of contraceptive pills use did not show any significant difference between female cases and controls.
