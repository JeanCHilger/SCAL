Liver/spleen scintigraphy for diagnosis of splenic infarction in cirrhotic patients. Splenic infarction is rare in cirrhotic patients. The diagnosis of the condition is based on clinical findings and splenic imaging. In recent years, ultrasonography and computed tomographic scan have gained popularity over the more classical scintigraphy as the preferred investigations for the diagnosis of splenic infarction. We report three cases of splenic infarction in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Computed tomographic scan, angiography and ultrasonography failed to identify the lesions and the diagnoses were finally made with the aid of liver--spleen scintigraphy. We suggest that scintigraphy is the investigation of choice if splenic infarction is suspected in patients with congestive splenomegaly secondary to liver cirrhosis.
