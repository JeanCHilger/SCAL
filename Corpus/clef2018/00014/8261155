Doppler analysis of portal vein flow in tricuspid regurgitation. Portal and hepatic vein flow-velocity profiles were examined by pulsed Doppler in 66 patients with tricuspid regurgitation (color Doppler grading: severe: 37, moderate: 18 mild: 11) and 20 normal subjects to determine if portal vein flow analysis is useful in the evaluation of tricuspid regurgitation. Portal vein flow was defined as one of the following categories: subcontinuous (dependent on respiration), pulsatile systolic (not inverted), inverted after systole, and continuous (not dependent on respiration). An index of portal vein flow pulsatility was also calculated. Standard classification of hepatic vein flow pattern was performed. Portal vein flow was pulsatile in 20% of normals subjects, and in 27.3% 44.5% and 51.3% of patients with respectively mild, moderate and severe tricuspid regurgitation
