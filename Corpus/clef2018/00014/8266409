An ultrasonographic study of liver fibrosis in patients infected with Schistosoma mansoni in north-east Brazil. Between August 1988 and July 1990, 176 patients with Schistosoma mansoni infection attending the University Hospital, Recife, Brazil received a complete clinical examination including stool examination for intestinal parasites, liver function tests, and ultrasonography. The majority were also examined by upper digestive tract endoscopy. The clinical distribution of their disease was as follows: 26.7% intestinal, 13.6% hepato-intestinal, 53.4% compensated hepatosplenic and 6.3% decompensated hepatosplenic. Infection intensity was high, with a median of 360 eggs/g of faeces. Ultrasonography showed a good correlation between the degree of hepatic periportal fibrosis and the clinical stage of disease (P < 0.0001). Of the patients with the intestinal form of schistosomiasis, 12.8% had grade I fibrosis and the others had no fibrosis 33.3% of patients with hepatointestinal schistosomiasis had grade I fibrosis, 8.3% had grade II fibrosis, and 58.4% had no fibrosis
