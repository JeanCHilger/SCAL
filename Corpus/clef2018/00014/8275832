Hemodynamic changes after combination operation in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. Hemodynamic changes of the portal system were investigated with pulsed Doppler ultrasound device in normal controls and patients with portal hypertension treated by combination surgical technique. It was found that the diameter and blood flow of the portal vein, splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein were larger than those of normal controls. Whereas the velocity of blood flow was lower than that of normal controls. FPP decreased by 31.3% after combination operation: 7.3% after splenectomy There was a positive correlation between FPP and blood flow of splenic artery. The portal blood flow decreased by 42% after disconnection and 62.6% after combination operation. The blood flow of superior mesenteric vein after disconnection increased by 38%. The decrease of portal blood flow after disconnection was positively correlated with the blood flow of the splenic vein. Combination operation is a simple and rational procedure with a good effect in stopping hemorrhage, reducing portal vein pressure, and preventing recurrence of esophageal varices.
