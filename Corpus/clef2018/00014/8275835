Preliminary study on hemodynamics in post hepatitic cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension (PCPH) using Doppler ultrasound. Hemodynamics was studied in normal volunteers and pre- and postoperative patients with PCPH using Doppler ultrasound. There was a systemic hyperdynamic circulatory state in patients with PCPH derived mainly from hyperdynamic splenic circulatory state. Congestion index (CI) of portal vein greater than 0.1cm. s, splenic vein cross section area greater than 0.6cm2, and SVF/PVF greater than 50%, all of these are the hemodynamic diagnostic criterion of PCPH. Both portasystemic shunt and porta-azygous devascularization lowered the hyperdynamic circulatory state of PCPH.
