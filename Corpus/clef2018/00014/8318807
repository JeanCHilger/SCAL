Choledochal cysts: a nine-year review. Hospital records of 24 Chinese infants and children (7 males and 17 females) with choledochal cysts were reviewed. The patients were aged 1 day to 17 years. Abdominal pain, palpable abdominal mass and jaundice, either alone or in combination, accounted for most of the initial presentations. Twenty-two patients were classified as type I with surgery, while the other two patients were type V without surgery. Ultrasonography is a rapid and accurate diagnostic method in the initial evaluation. Cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was the treatment of choice in this series. Chronic cholecystitis with or without inflammation of choledochal cyst was the most common pathological finding. Five patients underwent liver biopsies, showing four biliary cirrhosis and one portal fibrosis. So far, there is no evidence of malignancy in any patient.
