Abnormal renovascular impedance in patients with hepatic cirrhosis: detection with duplex US. The purpose of this study was to determine whether duplex ultrasound (US) can allow detection of early impairment of renal function in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. The authors calculated the pulsatility index (PI) and resistive index (RI) by using duplex US in 17 patients with cirrhosis and ascites but with normal renal function (group A), in 16 patients with cirrhosis but no ascites (group B), in 20 with chronic hepatitis (group C), in six with peritoneal carcinomatosis (group D), and in 16 healthy control subjects (group E). All patients had normal renal function on the basis of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine values. PI and RI were higher (P < .001) in group A patients than in others. Cirrhotic patients with ascites had renal vasoconstriction even in the absence of clinically apparent renal impairment and full-blown hepatorenal syndrome. Impaired renal perfusion plays a key role in sodium and fluid accumulation in patients with liver disease. On the basis of these results, duplex US is useful in pathophysiologic and clinical studies in such patients.
