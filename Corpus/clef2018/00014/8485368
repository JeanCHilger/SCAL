Sonographic aspects of the Cruveilhier Baumgarten syndrome. A rare case of Cruveilhier-Baumgarten syndrome with exceptional deep subcutaneous portosystemic collaterals is reported. Undetected these anastomoses represent potentially dangerous sites for hemorrhage complications. Ultrasound in combination with color-coded duplex sonography is a reliable technique in identifying portosystemic anastomoses as well as in providing valuable information about the etiology of portal hypertension.
