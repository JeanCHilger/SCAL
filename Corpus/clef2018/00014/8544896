Postprandial reversal of the portal venous flow in a patient with liver cirrhosis. The case of a 61-year-old man with alcoholic liver cirrhosis and a hepatocellular carcinoma is presented. He was examined with duplex Doppler before and after a meal. In the fasting state a sluggish hepatopetal portal venous flow was found. After the meal a pendulating flow and then hepatofugal flow were found. The magnitude and direction of flow alternated synchronously with the action of the heart, suggesting a significant role for the hepatic artery in the postprandial reversal of portal venous flow. One year after this examination the patient died from the complications of decompensated cirrhosis and liver failure. At autopsy a large hepatocellular carcinoma was detected.
