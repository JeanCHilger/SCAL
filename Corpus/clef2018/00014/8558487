Hepatic ultrasonography and pathological findings in dogs with hepatocutaneous syndrome: new concepts. In dogs, hepatocutaneous syndrome (superficial necrolytic dermatitis) belongs to a group of syndromes in which cutaneous signs signal the presence of systemic disease. It is characterized by parakeratosis, superficial necrolysis, and basilar hyperplasia of the epidermis, in association with an unusual hepatopathy accompanied by certain metabolic derangements. Hepatocutaneous syndrome was diagnosed in 3 dogs on the basis of typical dermatologic changes and clinicopathologic findings. Hepatic ultrasonography revealed a hyperechoic network surrounding hypoechoic areas of parenchyma, resulting in a Swiss cheese-like appearance. The ultrasonographic image corresponded to the pathological findings. The liver had a nodular appearance, both grossly and microscopically this was attributed to collapse of the areas of parenchyma surrounding the nodules, rather than to the cirrhosis and/or nodular hyperplasia reported previously.
