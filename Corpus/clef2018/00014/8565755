Portal vein thrombosis following endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy. Prospective controlled comparison in patients with cirrhosis. The association between portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and prior endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy has been suggested but remains unproven. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of PVT in patients who had received sclerotherapy for esophageal variceal hemorrhage to a control group of cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension who had not received sclerotherapy. Doppler ultrasound was used to assess PVT in 48 patients (group 1) who had received sclerotherapy for variceal hemorrhage as well as in 52 patients (group 3) with cirrhosis and portal hypertension who had not received sclerotherapy. Assessment of PVT was made at the time of surgery in 24 patients (group 2) who had received sclerotherapy for variceal hemorrhage, failed therapy, and had portacaval shunt surgery or received liver transplantation for liver failure. One patient had splenectomy for symptoms related to a massively enlarged spleen. The incidence of PVT in group 1 was 10%, in group 2 was 13%, and in group 3 was 10%. The incidence of PVT in the three groups was not significantly different statistically. In this controlled study of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, sclerotherapy does not increase the incidence of PVT.
