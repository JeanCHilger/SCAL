Clinico-prognostic significance of partial seroconversion in chronic viral hepatitis B follow-up. Wartenbert Study (1974-1994), II. 146 patients (62 female, 84 male) with chronic hepatitis B were regularly examined in 1 to 2 year intervals with an average follow-up period of 12 years (means). Each time patients were evaluated by physical examination, routine laboratory data, immunological and serological testing, ultrasonography, and laparoscopy and/or percutaneous liver biopsy. No patient of the study underwent immunosuppressive or antiviral treatment at any time. The average time data in years and months are given as the median value (mean). Frequency and date of seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe after the first diagnosis of HBV-infection: in patients with chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) in 79% of cases after 8 years, in patients with chronic active hepatitis (CAH) in 72% of cases after 7 years, and in patients with liver cirrhosis in 61% of cases after 9 years. The overall seroconversion rate in all patients with chronic hepatitis B amounted to 68% 8.5 years after the first diagnosis of HBV-infection. Clinical and prognostic significance: The seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe mostly led to substantial and sustained biochemical and histologic resolution of liver disease activity. In patients with CPH in 100% of cases after 15 months, in patients with CAH in 87% of cases after 17 months, and in patients with liver cirrhosis in 64% of cases after 2.5 years. 80% of these patients with seroconversion and histologic recovery remained HBV-DNA (PCR)-positive.
