Hepatic hemodynamics in a patient with nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver is an uncommon condition. Approximately 50% of these patients develop portal hypertension. Few previous reports document the site of increased resistance to blood flow within the liver in this disorder. We measured Doppler waveform patterns of the right hepatic vein by pulsed Doppler ultrasonography and portal, wedged hepatic, and free hepatic venous pressure by intravenous catheter before and after splenectomy in a 47-yr-old woman with nodular regenerative hyperplasia who presented with portal hypertension and pancytopenia. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia was histologically confirmed. Pre- and postoperative measures indicated a marked difference between wedged hepatic venous pressure and free hepatic venous pressure, whereas there was little difference between portal venous pressure and wedged hepatic venous pressure. Doppler waveform patterns of the right hepatic vein showed an unclear pulsatile flow pattern with a decreasing reversed phase. The above data suggest that portal hypertension in nodular regenerative hyperplasia is primarily sinusoidal, similar to that seen with cirrhosis.
