Measurement of portal and splenic venous flow volume (PV and SV), congestion index (CI) and SV/PV% in various liver diseases using by Doppler echo-sonography. We measured the portal and splenic venous flow volume (PV and SV), congestion index (CI) and SV/PV% in various stages of the liver diseases chronic inactive hepatitis (CIH), chronic active hepatitis (CAH), liver cirrhosis without esophageal varices (LCvarix(-)), and liver cirrhosis with esophageal varices (LCvarix(+))Â¿, and normal volunteers (NC). The results were as follows: PV was 869.4 +/- 184.0 ml/min in NC, 920.4 +/- 242.5ml/min in CIH, 900.0 +/- 216.9ml/min in CAH, 841.8 +/- 253.0 ml/min in LCvarix(-) and 909.7 +/- 430.7ml/min in LCvarix(+). SV was 241.0 +/- 80.0 ml/min in NC, 289.4 +/- 131.6 ml/min CIH, 286.4 +/- 108.8 ml/min CAH, 272.7 +/- 135.7 ml/min in LCvarix(-), 398.0 +/- 280.5 ml/min in LCvarix(+). SV/PV% was 28.1 +/- 10.1 in NC, 31.4 +/- 14.0 CIH, 32.1 +/- 9.6 in CAH, 32.4 +/- 16.0 in LCvarix(-), 43.1 +/- 23.7 in LCvarix(+). CI was 0.06 +/- 0.019 in NC, 0.07 +/- 0.028 in CIH, 0.09 +/- 0.05 in CAH, 0.11 +/- 0.03 in LCvarix(-), 0.145 +/- 0.047 in LCvarix(+). These results suggested that: (1) From the measurement of CI, portal venous pressure is begun to increase at the stage of chronic active hepatitis. (2) Increasing of splenic venous flow volume is begun at the stage of chronic hepatitis and it effects to the portal hypertension of liver cirrhosis. (3) The change of component of intrahepatic portal venous blood flow and decreasing of liver function tests was affected by increasing of splenic venous flow volume. (4) SV/PV% may be useful parameter to evaluate the decreasing of liver function tests and to estimate the complication of esophageal varices at the liver cirrhosis.
