Community-based hepatocellular carcinoma screening in seven townships in Taiwan. The early detection and prompt treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may prolong life and improve the quality of life of affected patients. In order to compare sensitivity and specificity of various screening biomarkers, identify subjects with a high risk of developing HCC, and estimate prevalence and incidence of HCC among subjects, a community-based HCC screening program was implemented in Sanchi, Chutung, Potzu, and Kaohsu, Taiwan Island as well as Makung, Huhsi and Paihsa in Penghu Islets. First stage screening of HCC was based on serological markers including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody against hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP > or = 20 ng/mL), alanine transaminase (> or = 40 IU/L), and aspartate transaminase (> or = 45 IU/L) as well as history of liver cirrhosis or HCC among first-degree relatives. Subjects who were positive for at least one of above six first-stage criteria were referred for second-stage screening by abdominal ultrasonography. Confirmatory diagnosis of HCC was made in suspicious cases according to aspiration cytology surgical pathology, digital substracted angiogram and/or computed tomography. A total of 12,026 men in seven study townships and 1,800 women in two townships in Penghu were recruited for first-stage screening (response rate: men, 25.5%
