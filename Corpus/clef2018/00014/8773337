Superinfection with hepatitis C virus in hemodialysis patients with hepatitis B surface antigenemia: its prevalence and clinical significance in Taiwan. A survey of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAG) and antibodies against hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) in 173 patients undergoing hemodialysis in Taiwan revealed that 15 (9%) patients were positive for both HBSAG and anti-HCV, 106 (61%) were positive for anti-HCV alone, and 14 (8%) were positive for HBSAG alone. Most HBSAg positivity was acquired before the onset of hemodialysis. Anti-HCV positivity, however, was mainly acquired via the hemodialysis procedure. Patients with dual markers were younger (43.7 +/- 3.3 years old, p = 0.0274), had the longest period on hemodialysis (6.6 +/- 1.3 years, p < 0.001), and more severe liver dysfunction. When compared with those who were negative for both markers, patients with both HBSAG and anti-HCV had an increased incidence of chronicity (5/15 vs. 2/38 p < 0.05), ultrasonographic cirrhosis (5/15 vs. 1/38
