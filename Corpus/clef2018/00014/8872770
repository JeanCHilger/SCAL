Case report: delayed resolution of severe pulmonary hypertension after isolated liver transplantation in a patient with cirrhosis. Pulmonary hypertension is now recognized to be a rare association of liver disease and portal hypertension. This report describes the slow resolution of symptomatic pulmonary hypertension in a 33-year-old woman with cirrhosis who underwent isolated liver transplantation. The patient survived the surgery and perioperative period without significant haemodynamic compromise. After liver transplantation, the patient was monitored with regular Doppler echocardiography. By 27 months the pulmonary hypertension had almost completely resolved. This observation is important, as it suggests that patients with severe pulmonary hypertension who survive the perioperative period may have an excellent outcome, although resolution may be slow.
