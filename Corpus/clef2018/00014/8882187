Schistosoma haematobium infection in western Madagascar: morbidity determined by ultrasonography. To assess the morbidity related to Schistosoma haematobium infection in western Madagascar, an ultrasonographic examination was performed of 574 inhabitants > 5 years old in a village in an old-established endemic area where no prior systematic antischistosomal treatment had been given. The overall prevalence of infection was 75.9% and the geometric mean egg count of positive individuals was 36 eggs/10 mL of urine. Recent haematuria had been experienced by 31.8% of individuals. Echographic abnormalities of the urinary tract were present in 50.5% of individuals: they were more frequent in males. Bladder wall lesions were observed in 93.1% of individuals with ultrasonographic changes, irregularities of the inner surface being the most common finding. Congestive changes were noted in 8.4% of kidneys, but we observed only 4 severe congestions. Bladder lesions and congestive changes in kidneys predominated in youth their presence and severity were significantly correlated with egg excretion. In 12 inhabitants, grade 1 periportal fibrosis was observed, but no significant association was found with S. haematobium infection. In a control village, where the prevalence of S. haematobium infection was 7%, moderate congestion of kidneys was observed in 2% of examined inhabitants, and bladder changes in 6%, with a significant relationship with S. haematobium infection.
