Ultrasound guided puncture of the portal vein in transjugular intrahepatic portasystemic stent shunt (TIPSS). Successful completion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stentshunt (TIPSS) relies on knowledge of the individual hepatic vascular anatomy. The patients referred for TIPSS have an increased risk of contrast-medium-induced renal failure, and therefore the potential for a complete angiographic work-up during the procedure is limited. The same patient population also carries an increased risk of bleeding, which necessitates a rather accurate guiding technique for portal punctures. We have established transcutaneous sonographic guidance as a standard technique for transjugular portal puncture, reducing complication rates and intervention time. Competing imaging modalities for guidance are discussed.
