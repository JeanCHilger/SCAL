Follow-up of TIPS: evaluation of signs of dysfunction with Doppler ultrasonography. to assess the signs of TIPS dysfunction at Doppler sonography.retrospective study of signs observed in 106 TIPS including 31 TIPS with dysfunction (portoauricular pressure gradient > 12 mmHg).the signs of TIPS dysfunction were a decrease in the mean velocity in the TIPS (for a velocity < 40 cm/sec, 90% sensitivity, 96%), a hepatopetal intrahepatic portal flow (on the right 90% sensitivity, 100% specificity, on the left 95% sensitivity, 92% specificity), a lack of cardiac modulation of the signal in the TIPS (93% sensitivity, 65% specificity), a hepatic vein flow reversal (30% sensitivity, 100% specificity), and, the only direct sign of stenosis, an increase of the mean velocity in the stenosis (42% sensitivity, 95% specificity for a velocity > or = 1 m/sec).the most sensitive Doppler signs of tips dysfunction are the indirect signs of stenosis.
