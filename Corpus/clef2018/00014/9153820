A rare intrahepatic portacaval tubular shunt in a patient with spastic paraparesis. Although there are numerous communications between the portal and systemic venous systems, intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunts are not frequently encountered in clinical practice. Here we report a patient who presented with spastic paraparesis, who was found to have chronic liver disease with tubular intrahepatic portacaval shunting.
