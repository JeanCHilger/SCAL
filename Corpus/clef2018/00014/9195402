Gall-bladder wall thickening in patients with liver cirrhosis. Gall-bladder wall thickening is commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis, but its exact causes have not been well established. We evaluated clinical, biochemical and haemodynamic data of patients with cirrhosis with respect to the presence of thickening of the gall-bladder wall. After excluding patients who presented with gallstones, acute or chronic cholecystitis, heart failure, a serum creatinine level greater than 2 mg/dL and/or a serum alanine aminotransferase level greater than 400 U/L, 77 patients with cirrhosis (75 male, two female mean age 58 +/- 8 years) were enrolled in the study. Clinical, biochemical, ultrasound and haemodynamic data were obtained in every patient. Forty-one (53%) of 77 patients with cirrhosis had gall-bladder wall thickening (> 4 mm). Compared with patients with a normal gall-bladder wall, patients with gall-bladder wall thickening had significantly lower serum albumin levels (3.6 +/- 0.6 vs 2.9 +/- 0.7 gm/dL, respectively
