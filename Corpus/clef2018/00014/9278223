Importance of age in chronic hepatitis C virus infection. This study was designed to investigate the value of liver biopsy in the management of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection and to identify risk factors for fibrosis. It was a prospective audit of clinical, biochemical, virological and radiological features for predicting liver fibrosis in 140 consecutive patients seropositive for antibody against hepatitis C virus. Seventy-five per cent of patients were asymptomatic and 69% had no clinical signs of chronic liver disease. Serum transaminase levels were normal in 44% of patients, less than twice normal in 35% and more than twice normal in 21%. Ultrasound scan was unremarkable in 85%. Sixty-nine per cent of patients were viraemic at the time of liver biopsy. Liver histology revealed that fibrosis was absent in only 10% of patients (stage 0) while cirrhosis was evident in 7% (stage 5). Liver fibrosis was detected in 90% of patients (stage 1, 11% stage 2, 41%
