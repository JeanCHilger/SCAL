Budd-Chiari syndrome. Budd Chiari syndrome is a rare disorder resulting from occlusion of hepatic venous drainage by hepatic vein thrombosis or by a membranous web in the inferior vena cava. In western countries the commonest causes are myeloproliferative disorders and hypercoagulable states. Presentation may be acute with rapid accumulation of ascites and hepatic failure, or subacute with symptoms developing over a few months. A chronic progressive form has also been described. On presentation there is usually abdominal pain, ascites, and hepatosplenomegaly hepatic encephalopathy is found in about a third. Noninvasive, ultrasound-Doppler is recommended in diagnosis, and has a high correlation with hepatic venography. Liver biopsy is required for therapeutic decisions. Those with advanced hepatic failure or severe fibrosis on liver biopsy are referred for hepatic transplantation. When biopsy shows only hepatic congestion and inflammatory infiltrates, portosystemic shunting is recommended. We present a 61-year-old woman with ascites and hepatosplenomegaly that had developed over the courses of a few months. Budd-Chiari syndrome with chronic myelofibrosis and congenital protein C deficiency were diagnosed. Portosystemic shunt was performed but death from sepsis followed shortly.
