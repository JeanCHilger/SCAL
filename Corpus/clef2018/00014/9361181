Prevalence and incidence of gallstones in liver cirrhosis. Our aim was to assess the prevalence and incidence of gallstone disease in patients with liver cirrhosis and to identify risk factors for cholecystolithiasis.We studied a cohort of 313 patients with liver cirrhosis confirmed by histology and/or laparoscopy and 357 patients free of liver disease, who had been referred for ultrasonographic examination of the upper abdomen. Hepatobiliary ultrasonography was performed when liver cirrhosis was diagnosed and every 6 months thereafter. Risk factors for cholelithiasis (age, gender, diet, pregnancy, diabetes, family history of cholelithiasis, etiology of cirrhosis, decompensated disease) were assessed.The overall prevalence of gallstones in cirrhotic patients was 23.3%. In controls, the overall prevalence of cholecystolithiasis was 16.8%. After a median follow-up period of 65 months, 30 patients developed gallstones. The calculated annual incidence was 3.4%.Given that the prevalence of gallstone disease is higher in cirrhotics than in noncirrhotic patients, cirrhosis of the liver may be considered a risk factor for cholecystolithiasis.
