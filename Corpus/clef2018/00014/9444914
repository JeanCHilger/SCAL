Detection of hepatic neoplasms by computed tomographic arterial portography in cirrhotic patients. Computed tomography (CT) during arterial portography (CTAP) is useful in detecting hepatic tumors but cirrhotic change may interfere with portal flow and the prediction of resectability. We evaluated the usefulness of CTAP in detecting hepatic tumors, especially hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in patients with or without cirrhotic change. Ninety-six patients with pathologically proven hepatic tumors were assessed, of whom 90 had hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumors had been previously detected by abdominal ultrasound and CT scans, after which the patients were referred for angiography and CTAP. The CTAP findings were compared with ultrasonographic, conventional CT, angiographic, and subsequent surgical and pathologic findings regarding size, number, and location of the hepatic lesions. CTAP detected 134 of 143 pathologically proven lesions. The overall sensitivity of CTAP in the 96 patients was 94%, with a false-positive rate of 22%. The detection rate of CTAP for tumors less than 2 cm in diameter was high (92%). The sensitivity and false-positive rate for CTAP in 60 cirrhotic patients were 94% and 23%, respectively, CTAP is a sensitive imaging modality for detection of hepatic neoplasms even in patients with cirrhosis, but its false-positive rate is high.
