Resection of colorectal liver metastases: 25-year experience. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze survival and prognostic factors in 111 consecutive patients undergoing curative resection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer. In addition, the time periods 1971-1984 and 1985-1995 were compared criteria for first liver resection did not change with time, whereas the attitude toward re-resection was more aggressive during the latter period. Operative mortality was 6% during 1971-1984 and 0% during 1985-1995 (3.6% for all patients). The crude 5-year actuarial survivals were 19% and 35% for patients operated during 1971-1984 and 1985-1995, respectively (25% for the whole period). Relapse at any site was observed in 52 patients (81%) operated during the first period and in 29 patients (67%) operated during the second period
