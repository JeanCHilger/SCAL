Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Treatment of patients with recurrent bleeding from esophageal varices. We report the results of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure in six patients with liver cirrhosis and recurrent bleeding or acute intractable bleeding from oesophageal varices in spite of multiple sessions of sclerotherapy. Median follow-up was 15 months (range 1-24 months). The procedure was technically successful in all patients without procedure-related morbidity or mortality. Four of the procedures were performed electively and two as an emergency procedure. The portosystemic pressure gradient decreased to below 12 mmHg following TIPS implantation and the shunt bloodflow was one quarter to three-quarters of the portal bloodflow determined by Doppler ultrasound. Recurrent bleeding occurred in one patient but was amenable to endoscopic sclerotherapy. In this patient the shunt had developed a stenosis that was treated by balloondilatation and insertion of an additional stent six months following the initial procedure, and no further bleeding occurred. The remaining five patients had no rebleeding episodes. Repeated Doppler examinations in the followup period demonstrated patency of all shunts. None of the patients developed portosystemic encephalopathy. One patient died of cerebral haemorrhage, unrelated to TIPS, 16 months following implantation. Another patient died 14 months following TIPS due to acute mesenteric occlusion and septicaemia. We conclude that TIPS is feasible and effective in selected patients with liver cirrhosis and persistent or recurrent variceal bleeding following repeated endoscopic therapy.
