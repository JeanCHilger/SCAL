A syndrome resembling idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension in 4 young Doberman pinschers. We describe 4 young male Doberman Pinschers (3 littermates and 1 unrelated dog) with a syndrome resembling idiopathic or noncirrhotic portal hypertension of humans. Each dog was evaluated for a hepatopathy resulting in portal hypertension, development of portosystemic collateral vessels, and hepatic encephalopathy. These dogs differ from previous reports of young dogs with hepatic insufficiency associated with portal hypertension and acquired portal systemic shunting by their lack of intrahepatic arteriovenous fistulae, portal vein atresia, or intrahepatic fibrosis. Clinicopathologic features included erythrocyte microcytosis, normal to mildly increased liver enzyme activities, increased concentrations of serum bile acids, reduced plasma indocyanine green clearance, and normal total bilirubin concentration. Abdominal ultrasonography disclosed a small liver and portosystemic collateral vessels. Radiographic imaging studies confirmed hepatofugal portal circulation and discounted hepatic arteriovenous fistulae. Histopathologic features in liver tissue from each dog were similar and consistent in all sections examined. Common findings included increased cross-sectional views of hepatic arterioles hepatic lobular atrophy
