The significance of colour velocity and spectral Doppler ultrasound in the differentiation of liver tumours. The aim of the work was to develop a standard protocol of colour velocity and spectral Doppler ultrasound (D.-US) of liver tumour vascularization and to estimate the value of this method in differentiation of liver tumours.In 1994 and 1995, 68 patients with 128 primary and secondary liver tumours were observed. The final diagnosis was histologically verified. The diagnostic system Acuson 128 X/P 10M (Mountain View, CA) with 3.5 MHz convex abdominal probe was used. Qualitative features (vessel presence, vessel location and waveform of tumour vessel blood flow) and quantitative features (vessel quantity per cm2, vessel diameter, maximum velocity (Vmax), and resistance index (RI) of tumour artery, and Vmax of tumour portal vein) were included in the D.-US protocol. The differences in these features among various liver tumours were retrospectively analysed.The tumour vascularization was found more frequently in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than in cavernous hemagioma (CavHA) or metastatic liver lesion (MLL) (P<0. 01). Among the tumours with detected vascularization, significant differences (P<0.01) were found (1) in vessel presence: (a) around tumour between MLL and HCC with or without liver cirrhosis (LC) or CavHA (b) in periphery of tumour between HCC,CavHA, benign tumour (BTAccording to our findings D.-US can be used for the differentiation of some liver tumours when using the criteria: (a) vessel presence around or in periphery of tumour, and (b) arterial flow pattern in tumour vessels.
