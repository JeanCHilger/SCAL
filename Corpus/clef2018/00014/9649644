Splanchnic hyperemia after liver transplantation in patients with end-stage liver disease. Systemic and splanchnic hemodynamic parameters were evaluated in 12 patients with cirrhosis before and 3 and 6 months after liver transplantation. Results were compared with those obtained in 8 healthy subjects. Three months after liver transplantation recipients had an increase in mean arterial pressure (98 +/- 7 v 78 +/- 9 mmHg P < .05), an insignificant decrease in cardiac index (3. 4 +/- 0.6 v 4.0 +/- 1.0 L . min-1 . m-2), and a marked increase in peripheral vascular resistance (1,563 +/- 308 v 800 +/- 205 dyne . s . cm-5
