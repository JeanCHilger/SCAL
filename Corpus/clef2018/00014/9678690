Multiple inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver associated with acute myeloblastic leukemia. A 26-year-old man, diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia had multiple inflammatory pseudotumors (IPT) in the liver. The patient presented complete remission after remission induction therapy, and then showed right upper quadrant discomfort and intermittent fever. An ultrasonography disclosed multiple hypoechoic nodules in the liver. A biopsy of the nodules showed focal liver cell necrosis with scant inflammatory cells, compatible with IPT. After several courses of chemotherapy, the nodules in the liver increased. The second liver biopsy of the nodule showed fibrosis. Multiple IPTs in the liver should be distinguished from abscess and metastatic nodules.
