Primary varices of the colon. A rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. A 34-year-old patient presented with a two-day history of passing bright-red blood with his stools. There was no contributory past or family history and he had no accompanying symptoms.Colonoscopy revealed many varices in the colon and terminal ileum without an active source of bleeding. Angiography failed to demonstrate any bleeding or vascular anomaly in the splanchnic region. Abdominal ultrasound and gastroscopy as well as biochemical tests did not indicate portal hypertension or liver cirrhosis.On the night of admission there was a renewed fall in haemoglobin concentration. Emergency colonoscopy again failed to discover a source of bleeding. After transfusion of four units of erythrocyte concentrate the further course was uneventful. 8 months and 3 years later there were further episodes of marked bleeding per rectum. At the latest admission no source for the bleeding was found but there was some blood oozing in the sigmoid colon. Biochemical tests were unremarkable. The large varices were again seen in the colon and terminal ileum. Gastroscopy, Doppler sonography of the liver and repeat abdominal sonography again failed to demonstrate portal vein thrombosis, liver cirrhosis or portal hypertension.In case of colonic varices the differential diagnosis should include portal hypertension with chronic liver disease, portal vein thrombosis, vascular anomalies or postoperative complications. The treatment of primary varices, which are rare, is conservative.
