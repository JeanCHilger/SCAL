Prenatal diagnosis of bowel obstruction initially manifested as isolated hyperechoic bowel. Fetal bowel obstruction has a prevalence of 1 in 3000 to 5000 live births. Ultrasonographic diagnosis is made by demonstrating distended loops of bowel. Echogenic bowel, defined as small bowel more echogenic than liver or bone, has been associated with congenital infections, cystic fibrosis, chromosomal abnormalities, and bowel obstruction. Fetal ascites, defined as fluid in the peritoneal cavity partly surrounding the liver and bladder, also has been associated with bowel obstruction. We present a case of jejunal atresia whose presenting appearance consists of echogenic bowel, transient ascites, and massive dilatation of intestinal loops.
