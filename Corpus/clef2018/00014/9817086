Ultrasound screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhosis: the evidence for an established clinical practice. Improvement in our current knowledge of epidemiology, natural history and treatment modalities form the background to generalize the use of ultrasound screening in cirrhosis. The cumulative probability of developing cancer is extremely high in cirrhotics and allows to focus screening programs on a well defined risk group thus maximizing cost-effectiveness. This review article highlights scientific evidences in favour of a generalized practice of US screening.
