Hepatocellular carcinoma: surgical treatment. Worldwide the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies. There is a coincidence with liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B/C in most cases. HCC can be suspected by ultrasound and by rise of the tumor marker (AFP). Further investigations, like biopsies, are not necessary if angiography or computed tomography in combination with patient history and elevated AFP levels are positive. The prognosis of untreated HCC is extremely poor. Live expectancy of symptomatic patients is only a couple of weeks. Radical tumor removal by liver resection or transplantation is the only treatment with curative intent. However these options are only suitable for patients with limited disease. Five year survival after curative liver resection depends on the tumor stage, ranging from 25% to 67%. The results after liver transplantation are similar for small cancer. Large, symptomatic tumors are in most cases only suitable for palliative treatment (chemoembolisation, ethanol injection, chemotherapy, immunotherapy). The strong dependence of prognosis on tumor extent underlines the importance of screening patients with elevated risk of developing an HCC. The early recognition of small tumors allows curative therapy with good results.
