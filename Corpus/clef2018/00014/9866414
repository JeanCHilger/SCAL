Budd-Chiari syndrome: current medical-surgical management. The Budd-Chiari syndrome or obstruction of the hepatic veins and/or suprahepatic inferior vena cava is a rare process, frequently associated with hypercoagulable states. There exist several clinical presentations, being most common the acute and subacute forms and rarely seen the fulminant and chronic forms (cirrhosis or fibrosis associated). We present here a female patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome produced by polycythemia, resolved by mesentericocaval interposition "H" shunt using internal jugular vein, after analyzing the current different modalities of medical-surgical treatment, specially portal system shunts and liver transplantation, related to presentation form.
