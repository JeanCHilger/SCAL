Treatment of a TIPS-biliary fistula by stent-graft in a 9-year-old boy. We report a 9-year-old male cirrhotic patient with acute occlusion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) due to a biliary-to-TIPS fistula which occurred 9 hr after the TIPS procedure. Immediate TIPS revision was performed and the fistula was treated by placement of an endoluminal stent-graft. At 12-month follow-up color Doppler examination demonstrated a patent shunt.
