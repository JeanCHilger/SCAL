The clinical study on treatment of hepatic fibrosis of hepatitis B by IFN-alpha 1 and Chinese medical preparation. To find the effective method of curing hepatic fibrosis of hepatitis B.Using interferon alpha 1 and Chinese medical preparation to treat patients with hepatic fibrosis of hepatitis B and the comprehensive indexes, including levels of laminin, precollagen type III and hyaluronic acid, liver puncture, ultrasonographic and fiber-gastroscopic examination were observed before and after treatment.After 3 months of treatment, the fibrotic indexes lowered obviously, in comparing with those before treatment, the difference was significant (P < 0.001). Liver biopsy, B-type ultrasonographic and fiber-gastroscopic examination proved that the hepatofibrosis was improved. The hepato-fibrotic indexes, blood albumin and globulin level were re-examined after 6 months, results showed that the difference between the IFN-effective group and the IFN-ineffective group was significant, P < 0.001.Beneficial effect might be obtained by using IFN-alpha 1 to suppress the replication of hepatitis B virus and Chinese medical preparation to treat hepatic fibrosis.
