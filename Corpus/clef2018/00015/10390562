Longstanding arterioportal fistula after laparoscopic liver biopsy. We present two patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on liver cirrhosis in whom color Doppler sonography documented an incidental peripheral arterioportal fistula due to a previous liver biopsy under laparoscopy. Detection of the fistula helped in preventing the occurrence of a portal thrombus. Color Doppler sonography should be performed prior to transarterial embolization in patients with HCC on liver cirrhosis with a past history of liver biopsy under laparoscopy.
