Primary implantation of polyester-covered stent-grafts for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunts (TIPSS): A pilot study. To investigate whether placement of a polyester-covered stent-graft increases the primary patency of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunts (TIPSS).Between 1995 and 1997 Cragg Endopro or Passager MIBS stent-grafts were used for the creation of TIPSS in eight male patients, 35-59 years of age (mean 48 years). All patients suffered from recurrent variceal bleeding and/or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Seven stent-grafts were dilated to a diameter of 10 mm, one to 12 mm. Follow-up was performed with duplex ultrasound, clinical assessment, and angiography.The technical success rate for creation of a TIPSS was 100%. The mean portosystemic pressure gradient decreased from 25 mmHg to 12 mmHg. In seven of eight patients TIPSS dysfunction occurred between 2 days and 3 years after stent-graft placement. In one patient the TIPSS is still primarily patent (224 days after creation). The secondary patency rates are 31 days to 3 years.The primary use of polyester-covered stent-grafts for TIPSS did not increase primary patency rates in our small series.
