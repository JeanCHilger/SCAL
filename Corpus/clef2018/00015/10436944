Effects of radix Salviae miltiorrhizae on hemodynamics of portal hypertension: clinical and experimental study. By measuring portal pressure of hepatocirrhotic dogs of bile duct ligation directly, and detecting portal system flow in patients with hepatic cirrhosis by ultrasound doppler, we studied the portal hemodynamic effects of Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae (RSM). After intravenous administration of RSM in hepatocirrhotic dogs, the portal venous pressure (PPV), wedge hepatic venous pressure (WHVP), and hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) were significantly decreased (P < 0.05-0.01), but the mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) unchanged (P > 0.05). After long-term administration of RSM (10-12 weeks), the diameter of portal vein (DPV) and splenic vein (DSV), the flow of portal vein (QPV), and splenic vein (QSV) in patients with hepatic cirrhosis were significantly decreased respectively (P < 0.05-0.001). Hypodynamia, abdominal distension, anorexia and liver function (ALT) were improved partially after administration of RSM in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. Side-effects of RSM were not found. The results demonstrated that RSM is an effective drug of depressing portal pressure with few side-effects.
