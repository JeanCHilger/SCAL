Thorotrast-induced liver cancer: results of the German thorotrast study. The X-ray contrast medium Thorotrast, used worldwide between 1930 to 1950 predominantly for arteriography, consisted of a colloidal solution of thorium dioxide. The radioactive thorium-232 (half-life 1.4x10(10) years) is stored lifelong in the organs of the reticulo-endothelial system after intravascular injection, causing chronic exposure to alpha radiation. The aim of the German Thorotrast study is the assessment of radiation late effects and the calculation of risk estimates.The German Thorotrast study started in 1968 as a cohort study and comprises 2326 Thorotrast patients and 1890 patients of a matched control group. The Thorotrast patients who were still alive at the beginning of the study were examined by X-ray plain films of the upper abdomen and of the injection site of the contrast medium as well as by whole-body counter measurements. At the beginning we offered the patients ultrasound and later on CT and MRI at regular intervals for early detection of liver cancer.To date 454 primary liver cancers have been registered in the group of Thorotrast patients compared to 3 cases in the control group. With the help of modern imaging methods relatively small liver cancers were detected and could be surgically removed.There is a correlation between the mean accumulated dose to the liver and the incidence of liver cancer. The cumulative risk for liver malignancies is about 600 diseases per 10(4) persons whose liver was exposed to 1 Gy. Also the incidence of liver cirrhosis is correlated with the mean accumulated dose to the liver.
