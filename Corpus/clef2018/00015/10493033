Hepatic calcification by sequelae of chronic schistosomiasis japonica: report of four cases. Due to the elimination of intermediate hosts and the improvement of clinical care, most parasitic infections have been effectively controlled in developing countries. Recently, the increase of the worldwide tourism, especially to Mainland China, and the migration of overseas workers from endemic countries have led to more parasitic infections that should not be overlooked by physicians. Assessment of diffuse liver disease with physical examination and laboratory findings is notoriously inaccurate. Thus, physicians use liver biopsy for accurate diagnoses. We present 4 patients with hepatic schistosomiasis japonica which were diagnosed using imaging before liver biopsy. Hepatic schistosomiais japonica has a tendency to cause dystrophic calcification and fibrosis in the liver. According to the results, a combination of ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT), used to recognize characteristic calcification patterns, seem useful to physicians for accurate diagnoses. Thus, unnecessary biopsy procedures can be avoided.
