A case report: disappearance of cancer cells confirmed by surgical resection after transcatheter hepatic artery embolization (TAE) for ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was a 74-year-old man. He had received medical treatment for liver cirrhosis (C types) and elevated AFP. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) revealed a 150 mm size tumor in the right lobe of the liver. After admission, anemia progressed rapidly, and we recognized bloody ascites by abdominal punction. Thus, diagnosis was a tumor rupture. Emergency angiography was performed. Farmorubicin and Lipiodol were injected, and complete TAE was added. After two TAE treatments CT-scan showed a remarkable decrement of the tumor and hypertrophy of the left lobe in the liver. Right lobectomy of the liver was then done because reserve function of the liver was good. Cancer cells changed into hyaline body and mecrotic focus. In the pathological examination of the extirpated sample, no viable tumor cells were detected.
