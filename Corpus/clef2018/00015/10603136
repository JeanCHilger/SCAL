Renal hemodynamic changes in children with liver cirrhosis. To assess the sensitivity of duplex Doppler ultrasonography in detecting early impairment of renal function in childhood cirrhosis, intrarenal arterial pulsatility index (PI) and resistive index (RI) were measured in 10 ascitic and 11 non-ascitic children with liver cirrhosis and normal creatinine clearance and 10 age- and sex-matched controls. PI and RI were higher in ascitic than non-ascitic children [PI 1.54+/-0.4 vs. 1.1+/-0.2 (mean +/- SD), P=0. 006 RI 0.76+/-0.07 vs. 0.68+/-0.07, P=0.03). Non-ascitic patients had higher PI and RI than controls (P=0.002 and 0.0001, respectively). PI was inversely correlated with creatinine clearance (r=-0.54, P=0.01). A significant positive relationship was observed between both PI and RI and Child score (r=0.47, P=0.009
