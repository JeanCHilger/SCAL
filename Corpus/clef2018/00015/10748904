Hyaluronate levels and markers of oxidative stress in the serum of Sudanese subjects at risk of infection with Schistosoma mansoni. We showed previously that infection by Schistosoma mansoni not only triggers the production of reactive oxygen species in mouse liver but also leads to the alteration of antioxidant defences. To determine whether such events occur in humans, we measured the serum markers of oxidative stress, i.e., lipid peroxides and protein carbonyl, as well as hyaluronate levels in subjects in the Managil area of the Sudan. Grades of fibrosis were determined by ultrasonographic examination. Two groups were used as controls, one Sudanese and the other European. We found that Sudanese subjects in the endemic area differed from the control groups, both Sudanese and European, insofar as they had higher levels of the serum metabolites measured. The latter increased with the grade of fibrosis. Moreover, protein carbonyl and hyaluronic acid levels correlated positively with lipid peroxide levels. These findings indicate that oxidative stress might contribute to S. mansoni-associated pathology in man. The serum markers considered in our study, obtained by relatively simple techniques, may provide a useful biochemical index for the identification of almost asymptomatic patients who, however, are at risk of developing severe schistosomiasis.
