Results of sclerotherapy for bleeding esophageal varices in patients with schistosomal liver disease. A retrospective study. The aims of the study were to evaluate results of injection sclerotherapy in patients with liver schistosomiasis inducing bleeding esophageal varices and to review ultrasonographic features of the liver disease as well as endoscopic characteristics of the esophageal disease in order to assess any interrelationship between them.A total of 34 patients with active or recent history of hematemesis and Schistosoma mansoni infection had emergency or elective endoscopic sclerotherapy. Each underwent ultrasound examination to assess hepatosplenic involvement and staging, and were followed-up with upper digestive endoscopy every 4 months.Obliteration or reduction of the varices in small columns was achieved in 82.3% of cases. During the follow-up period (mean: 10.4 +/- 2.1 months range: 4-16 months) rebleeding was noted in 2 patients and 2 patients died due to variceal hemorrhage. The relationship between the ultrasonographic periportal fibrosis grade and the endoscopic variceal grade or varices localization was very strong (P < 0.001). A significant difference between grade 1 vs. 3 and 1 vs. 2 of periportal fibrosis and the presence of red signs was also found (P < 0.008).In view of the results obtained in terms of success rate in obliterating varices, rebleeding and mortality rates, a longitudinal study could be justified to assess the usefulness of prophylactic sclerotherapy for the prevention of the first variceal hemorrhage and in the attempt to prolong survival in patients with Schistosoma-induced esophageal varices.
