Evaluation of gallbladder motility in patients with liver cirrhosis: relationship to gallstone formation. To investigate the postprandial gallbladder motility, including emptying and refilling, in cirrhotic patients and to evaluate the relationship to the presence of gallstones and various humoral mediators, 82 patients with liver cirrhosis and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were enrolled into this study. Postprandial gallbladder volumes were measured with ultrasonography every 15 min for 2 hr. Plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone, substance P, and nitrate/nitrite were also measured. Cirrhotic patients showed a higher prevalence of gallstones than healthy subjects (41% vs 15%, P = 0.003), and the prevalence increased with the progression of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A: 26%, B: 44%, and C: 65%, P = 0.02). Plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone, and substance P, and nitrate/nitrite and estradiol/testosterone ratios were not different between cirrhotic patients with and without gallstones. However, postprandial refilling of the gallbladders was significantly impaired in patients with cirrhosis, especially in those combined with gallstones. There was no significant difference in the postprandial gallbladder motility between cirrhotic patients with and without elevated plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone, and substance P and nitrate/nitrite, and estradiol/testosterone ratios. Gallstones were common in patients with liver cirrhosis and the prevalence increased with the progression of liver diseases. Sex hormones, substance P, and nitrate/nitrite did not play major roles in the formation of gallstones in cirrhotic patients. Refilling of the gallbladder was significantly impaired in patients with liver cirrhosis, especially in those with gallstones, and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of gallstones.
