Clinical application of ultrasound(US)-guided percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy for liver cancer. To evaluate clinical application of US-guided percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy for liver cancer.32 patients with 57 nodules of liver cancer were treated, 57 nodules were coagulated by 92 times at 182 different points. Output of one coagulation was 60 W last mg 240-300 sec.The follow-up period was 5-18 months, averaging 10.4 months. 29 patients remained alive, 3 patients died. After treatment, 85.9%(49/57) of the nodules decreased in size color blood flow signal disappeared in 78.2(36/46) nodules on color and energy Doppler scansUS-guided percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy is able to induce total tumor necrosis of liver cancer in most cases. It can be expected as an important non-operative therapy of liver cancer.
