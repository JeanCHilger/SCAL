Effects of ondansetron on portal hemodynamics in liver cirrhosis. The double-blind randomized pilot study was undertaken to compare the effects of a 10-day course of ondansetron 8 mg/day and propranolol 80 mg/day perorally in treating portal hypertension. SUBIECTS AND METHODS: 16 patients with liver disease were enrolled in the study. Measurements of portal vein diameter, portal blood flow velocity and portal blood flow volume were done at days 1, 5 and 10 of treatment using duplex Doppler sonography.The propranolol group demonstrated a decrease in portal venous diameter, while patients treated with ondansetron exhibited reduced portal blood flow velocity values. A decreased portal blood flow volume was found in both groups after 10 days of therapy.No statistically significant differences were found between the groups with the exception of portal venous diameter which is significantly lower at the end of the treatment in the case of propranolol.
