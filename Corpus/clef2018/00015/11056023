Correlation of MRI liver volume and doppler sonographic portal hemodynamics with histologic findings in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The purpose of this study was to correlate portal hemodynamics on sonography and liver volume on MRI with histologic findings in asymptomatic patients with chronic hepatitis C.Portal blood flow in the left and right portal branches in 20 healthy volunteers and in 26 patients was measured using Doppler sonography during both fasting and postprandial states. Total liver and right-and left-lobe volumes were determined using MRI. The ratio between portal blood flow and liver volume determined the "portal flow index" of the right and left lobes.We observed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) between the volunteers and patients in the mean left-lobe volume (352 +/- 81 cm(3) versus 544 +/- 159 cm(3)) and in the mean left portal flow index (1.1 +/- 0.2 ml/minute/cm(3) versus 0.69 +/- 0.2 ml/minute/cm(3)) as measured before the subjects ate. After a meal, the portal blood-flow volume in the right lobe was similar in the 2 groups but in the left lobe was significantly lower in the patients (p = 0.0009). The left postprandial portal flow index was inversely correlated with the grade of liver fibrosis (r = 0.533).The left-lobe volume (positive predictive value, 83% negative predictive value, 72%) and left postprandial portal flow index (positive predictive value, 86%
