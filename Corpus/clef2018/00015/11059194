Vesical varix in cirrhosis of liver. Vesical varices in portal hypertension are rare. We report a patient with portal hypertension who developed recurrent painless hematuria. Cystoscopy was normal. Doppler ultrasound and MR angiography showed a dilated paraumbilical vein within the falciform ligament coursing down to the urinary bladder wall and draining into the right internal iliac vein. He underwent liver transplantation for decompensated chronic liver disease. He is in good health and has not had further episodes of hematuria.
