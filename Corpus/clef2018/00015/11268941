Splenoadrenal shunt. An original portosystemic decompressive technique. Management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage from rupture of esophageal and gastric varices due to portal hypertension remains a debated question. In patients with sclerotherapy-resistant esophagogastric varices, and preserved hepatic function, a surgical shunt is considered the treatment of choice. A 63-year-old male was admitted in our Department with a diagnosis of idiopathic fibrosis of the liver, portal hypertension, esophageal and gastric varices and previous history of variceal bleeding. A distal splenorenal shunt was planned. During the isolation, a large diameter left adrenal vein was identified. An end-to-end anastomosis utilizing the distal splenic vein and the proximal adrenal stump was performed. The procedure was uneventful. An ultrasound color-Doppler on the 3rd postoperative day, showed normal intrasplenic resistance index, demonstrating the efficacy of the shunt. A splenic angiography carried out on the 8th postoperative day showed the complete patency of the splenoadrenal shunt. At the 15th postoperative day, the patient was discharged. In patients with portal hypertension, sclerotherapy-resistant esophagogastric varices and preserved hepatic function, a surgical portosystemic shunt is mandatory. Splenoadrenal shunt, utilizing a left adrenal vein represent an excellent option in selected cases.
