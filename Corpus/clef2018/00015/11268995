Laparoscopic radiofrequency of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in liver cirrhosis. In this report, the feasibility and efficacy of laparoscopic radiofrequency interstitial thermal ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma has been evaluated in 20 patients.The laparoscopic approach with the use of intraoperative ultrasonography allowed us to obtain additional information regarding liver nodules and a complete treatment of the liver lesions.The complication rate was low and there was no operative mortality. A complete necrosis has been obtained in 90% of the cases at 1 month dynamic computed tomography following the treatment.Laparoscopic radiofrequency thermal ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma proved to be a safe and effective technique its use may be proposed in selected patients. Larger series are needed to accurately assess its role among the other ablative therapies of hepatocellular carcinoma.
