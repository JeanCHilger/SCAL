SCVIR annual meeting film panel session: diagnosis and discussion of case 2: Left hepatic arterioportal fistula. A 65-year-old man with cryptogenic cirrhosis initially underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation for variceal bleeding. For the following 16 months, variceal bleeding and intractable ascites persisted despite TIPS revision with variceal embolization. A surgical distal splenorenal shunt was then created, but, although there was initial improvement, intractable ascites recurred. At presentation at a different hospital, the patient gave a history of dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea. Physical examination demonstrated a distended abdomen, consistent with severe ascites, a large right pleural effusion, and bilateral peripheral edema.
