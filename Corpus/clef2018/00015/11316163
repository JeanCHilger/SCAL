Effect of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt formation on portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric circulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) on portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) and gastric hemodynamics.A total of 16 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertensive gastropathy were prospectively studied. Of these, 12 patients underwent TIPS for esophageal varices and four for refractory ascites. Gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF) was assessed by laser Doppler flowmeter, and total blood flow (TBF) in submucosa and mucosa by near-infrared endoscopy. Portal venous pressure was obtained by a transducer during the TIPS procedure. The severity of portal hypertensive gastropathy was classified as none, mild, or severe. The examinations were performed before and 2 wk after the procedure.TIPS significantly reduced portal venous pressure. PHG improved in all four patients with severe PHG and in five of 12 patients with mild PHG after treatment. Gastric mucosal blood flow increased from 49.0 to 55.6 ml/min/100 g after TIPS. In contrast, TBF decreased from 0.35/s to 0.27/s after treatment. Liver function tests showed no significant changes before and after the procedure.It is considered that TIPS may have a beneficial effect on PHG at least for a short time. The mechanism by which PHG improves may be closely related to the improvement of the injured gastric perfusion in cirrhotic patients with PHG.
