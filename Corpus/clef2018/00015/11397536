Doppler sonography measurement of portal blood flow velocity after glucagon injection in patients with chronic HCV infection. Doppler sonography measurement of portal flow velocity (PFV) after glucagon injection was performed in 45 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Patients were divided into three groups: group 1 = no or mild liver fibrosis group 2 = moderate to severe liver fibrosis, and group 3 = liver cirrhosis. All patients were examined using a Doppler ultrasound (US) multipurpose equipment and a convex 3.5-MHz probe, 10 min before (baseline), as well as 5 and 10 min after, IV administration of 1 mg of glucagon chloride. No significant differences were found in mean baseline PFV among group 1 (19.4 +/- 2.4 cm/s), group 2 (20.1 +/- 3.6 cm/s) and group 3 (17.5 +/- 3.7 cm/s). Five minutes after glucagon injection, all three groups showed significantly increased values of mean PFV (25.6 +/- 4.8, 23.7 +/- 4.0 and 19.5 +/- 5.0 cm/s, respectively
