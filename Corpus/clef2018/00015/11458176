Thyrotoxicosis hepatitis: a case report. Abnormal liver function in thyroid disorders may be secondary to thyrotoxicosis or to autoimmune injury to the liver. We report the case of a 36-year-old female who developed jaundice and pruritus with mild cholestasis and moderately elevated transaminase levels. The diagnosis of Graves' disease was made shortly thereafter. Laboratory findings were: alanine and aspartate aminotransferase 219 (IU/I (N: 9-50) and 102 IU/I (N: 10-15) respectively, alkaline phosphatase 336 IU/I (N: 40-135), bilirubin 24 micromol/I (N: 2-23), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 232 IU/I (N: 9-43). Abdominal ultrasonography showed normal bile ducts echocardiography ruled out heart failure
