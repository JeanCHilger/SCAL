Liver abscess in patients with cirrhosis of the liver: a 12-year experience. Liver abscess is rare in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the incidence, clinical presentation, causal pathogens, and outcome of liver abscess in cirrhotic patients.We collected 21 liver abscess specimens (from 14 male patients and 7 female patients Child A: B: C, 4: 7: 10) from 22,731 admissions of 6450 cirrhotic patients, from 1986 through 1998.The common clinical symptoms and signs included fever, chills, and abdominal tenderness. The major predisposing factors were biliary tract disease (52%) and diabetes mellitus (48%). The diagnosis rate with abdominal ultrasonography was 79%. Gram-negative aerobes were the predominant pathogens (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 66.7% Escherichia coli, 23.8%), and occurred in 80% and 69% of blood and pus cultures, respectively, while 38% of cases showed polymicrobial pathogens. The location of the abscess was predominantly in the right lobe (71.4%), and 47.6% of patients had multiple abscesses. Six patients died (all with Child C cirrhosis). The overall mortality rate was 28.6% (6/21).The incidence of liver abscess in the cirrhotic patients was low, at 0.09% (21/22,731 admissions). The clinical presentations and pathogens were not different from those in noncirrhotic patients, except that in our cirrhotic patients, there was no significant difference in mortality between those with monomicrobial and those with polymicrobial abscess: nor was there a significant difference in mortality between those with single and those with multiple abscesses. The Child C patients were the high-risk group.
