The effect of low-dose combined oral contraceptive pills versus injectable contraceptive (Depot Provera) on liver function tests of women with compensated bilharzial liver fibrosis. This was an open comparative trial of two types of hormonal contraceptives, a low-dose combined oral contraceptive and the injectable depot-medroxyprogerone acetate, with a control group using an intrauterine device (copper T-380). Clients were recruited from bilharzial patients attending the maternal-child health and family centers affiliated with the National Liver Institute. Clients with compensated bilharzial liver disease were chosen and were divided into three subgroups according to their own preference for the method of contraception. Baseline, 2-, and 4-months liver function tests were compared, and abdominal ultrasound scanning of the liver was done. There was a nonsignificant change in liver function tests, and the portal vein diameter measured by ultrasound scanning was not changed with steroidal contraceptives. The use of combined oral contraceptive containing low-dose estrogen or using depot medroxyprogertone acetate injectables are safe and can be prescribed in cases with compensated bilharzial hepatic fibrosis with normal function.
