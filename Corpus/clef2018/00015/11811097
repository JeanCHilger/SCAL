Lessons to be learned: a case study approach a case study of the temporal onset of pulmonary hypertension with pre-existent cirrhotic portal hypertension. We report the occurrence of pulmonary hypertension in a 37-year-old male patient with cirrhosis of the liver, portal hypertension and oesophageal varices. Although this is a rare combination, previous reports have shown that the association of portal and pulmonary hypertension is not coincidental the temporal onset of primary pulmonary hypertension is hard to predict and our patient was asymptomatic for a number of years. The pathogenesis of portal hypertension leading to pulmonary hypertension is not known. Diagnosis is difficult because the clinico-pathological symptoms in both conditions are similar. Treatment is limited to calcium channel blockers, vasodilators, nitrous oxide and prostacyclin, although most patients will eventually require visceral transplantation.
