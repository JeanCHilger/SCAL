Effect of somatostatin on portal and hepatic hemodynamics and portal venous pressure in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. To investigate the effect of somatostatin on hepatic and portal hemodynamics and portal venous pressure in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension.Colorful doppler ultrasonography was used to measure the diameter and maximum hemokinetic velocity of portal vein and hepatic vein before and after intravenous administration somatostatin, and thus their hemokinetic volume was calculated respectively. Among 15 surgical patients, changes of the portal venous pressure were observed via a catheter before and after the administration of somatostatin.One hour and 1.5 hour after the administration, the pressure of portal vein significantly decreased from 2.77 +/- 0.26 kPa to 2.42 +/- 0.27 kPa and 2.40 +/- 0.27 kPa, respectively (P < 0.01). The systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and heart rate showed no significant changes. After the administration, the sectional area of portal vein decreased by 7.28% but without significance. The maximum hemokinetic velocity of portal vein significantly decreased by 18.96% (from 19.72 +/- 7.75 cm/sec to 15.98 +/- 7.26 cm/sec, P < 0.01). The mean total hemokinetic volume increased from 1786.22 +/- 926.37 ml/min to 1836.17 +/- 844.24 ml/min, but without significance (P > 0.05).Continuous instillation of somatostatin via peripheral vein can decrease the portal venous pressure in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. The mechanism may be the decrease of hemokinetic volume caused by the decrease of hemokinetic velocity of the portal vein.
