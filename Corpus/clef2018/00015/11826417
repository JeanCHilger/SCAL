Histologic scoring of liver biopsy in focal nodular hyperplasia with atypical presentation. The contribution of radio-guided transcutaneous biopsy in the diagnosis of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) of the liver was compared with the findings on surgical specimens to assess its contribution in clinical and radiologic atypical cases. This retrospective study involved 30 patients with atypical tumors on imaging who underwent liver biopsy and then surgery. All surgical specimens were diagnosed as FNH, either classical (n = 18) or nonclassical (n = 12). Imaging data were reviewed according to 4 radiologic criteria on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computed tomography (CT) scan (hypervascularity, homogeneity, nonencapsulation, and presence of a central scar), and classified depending on the number of criteria found (group I, 4 of 4 group II, 3 of 4
