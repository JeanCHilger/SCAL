Nontumorous vascular malformations in the liver: color Doppler ultrasonographic findings. To investigate color Doppler and spectral wave characteristics of nontumorous vascular malformations in the liver.From September 1995 to January 2001, 32 cases of vascular malformations were identified by means of color Doppler ultrasonography and spectral wave analysis. Computed tomography, angiography, or both were performed in all cases.Five arterioportal and 14 portovenous malformations, 1 arteriovenous malformation, and 4 portoportal and 8 venovenous shunts were detected. Associations with Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome in 6 cases and with cirrhotic liver in 12 cases were found Fourteen patients were liver disease free. In 3 cases, interventional procedures were necessary to reduce portal hypertension or cardiac dysfunction. The incidence of finding vascular malformations in 12,000 patients was 0.1%.Nontumorous vascular malformations are rare disorders in the liver. They may appear in patients with healthy livers and in patients with portal hypertension. Color Doppler ultrasonography and spectral wave analysis are capable of showing and differentiating different types of hepatic vascular malformations.
