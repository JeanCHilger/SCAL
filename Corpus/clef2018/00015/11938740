Use of color Doppler esophageal ultrasonography for assessing hemodynamics of the lower esophageal veins before and after endoscopic esophageal variceal ligation. Using color Doppler esophageal ultrasonography(CDEUS) with water balloon, we examined the lower esophageal veins of 24 patients with portal hypertension and esophageal varices. The results showed that CDEUS with water balloon could clearly display the lower esophageal veins and could effectively evaluate the changes of hemodynamics of the lower esophageal veins before and after endoscopic esophageal variceal ligation. The maximum blood velocity of peri-esophageal vein in the active bleeding group was higher than that in the non-active bleeding group.
