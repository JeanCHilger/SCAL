Serum markers of liver fibrogenesis, and liver histology findings in patients with chronic liver diseases. Investigation of the relationships between the grade and stage of chronic liver diseases irrespective of their etiology using some novel serum markers of liver fibrogenesis, the "classical" serum markers of liver necro-inflammatory injury (such as transaminases), and the histomorphological evaluation of liver biopsies.Markers of liver fibrogenesis: serum metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 (TIMP-1), and N-terminal propeptide of the procollagen III (PIIINP) "liver function tests" (LFTs): bilirubin, transaminases ALT, ASTInvestigation of liver fibrogenesis serum markers (PIIINP, MMP-1, TIMP-1) in patients with various CLDs has shown statistically significant correlations of these parameters with "classical" serum markers of liver necro-inflammation (ALT, AST) and the results of histomorphological evaluation of the necro-inflammatory activity (parameters NAI, MEF) and fibrosis (parameter FI) in liver biopsies.
