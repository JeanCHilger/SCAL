Cytokine regulation of periportal fibrosis in humans infected with Schistosoma mansoni: IFN-gamma is associated with protection against fibrosis and TNF-alpha with aggravation of disease. Hepatic periportal fibrosis, which affects 5-10% of subjects infected by Schistosoma mansoni, is caused by the T cell-dependent granuloma that develop around schistosome eggs. Experimental models of infection have shown that granuloma and fibrosis are tightly regulated by cytokines. However, it is unknown why advanced periportal fibrosis occurs only in certain subjects. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the cytokine response of S. mansoni-infected subjects with advanced liver disease in an attempt to relate susceptibility to periportal fibrosis with an abnormal production of cytokines that regulate granuloma and fibrosis. Fibrosis was evaluated by ultrasound on 795 inhabitants of a Sudanese village in which S. mansoni is endemic: advanced periportal fibrosis was observed in 12% of the population 35% of the affected subjects exhibited signs of portal hypertension. Age (odds ratio (OR), 11.5), gender (OR, 4.2), and infection levels (OR, 2.2) were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with hepatic fibrosis. Cytokines produced by egg-stimulated blood mononuclear cells from 99 subjects were measured (75 with no or mild fibrosis
