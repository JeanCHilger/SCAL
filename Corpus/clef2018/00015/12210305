Early detection of severe cholestatic hepatopathy in COACH syndrome. COACH syndrome is a disorder with cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, oligophrenia, ataxia, coloboma, and hepatic fibrosis. Sixteen cases with certain COACH diagnosis have been reported so far. Neurologic abnormalities are the first symptoms in most cases. The majority of cases were diagnosed late in childhood or adolescence. Complications of the hepatopathy contribute extensively to the morbidity and lethality in the course of the disease. Major complications are portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and gastrointestinal bleeding. We report of a child with only mild neurologic symptoms, but severe hepatic fibrosis with cholangiopathy, and review the literature. This is the first description of profound cholestatic hepatopathy in a very young child with COACH syndrome. The patient was found to have cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, unilateral optical nerve coloboma, mild dysmorphic signs, and a ventricular septum defect. Routine laboratory investigations eventually revealed elevated liver enzymes. Prothrombin time was abnormal. Ultrasound scan of the liver was normal. Hepatotropic viral infections were excluded. We performed a liver biopsy at the age of 16 months, confirming an early stage of cirrhosis with septal fibrosis and pseudolobules, inflammatory infiltrates, signs of cholestasis, and reduced numbers of intrahepatic bile ducts. Early detection and differentiation of liver pathology are important in COACH syndrome. Progressive destructive cholangiopathy may contribute to hepatic fibrosis in COACH syndrome. Liver disease can be severe even in cases with mild neurologic deficits.
