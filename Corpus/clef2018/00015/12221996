Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: a childhood case. A significant part of cryptogenic cirrhosis among adult patients shows that it can be the result of "burn-out" non-alcoholic steatohepatitis beginning in childhood.Describing the case of a 15-year-old boy the aim of the authors is to raise attention to the fact that doctors should think of the possibility of having a fatty liver in presence of certain etiological features.Although he was asymptomatic, the screening test revealed an elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase level. Abdominal ultrasound examination raised the possibility of a diffuse liver damage. The liver biopsy demonstrated the features of steatosis in the absence of alcohol abuse.On the basis of these results, NASH was diagnosed. The presence of a severe fatty liver at such an early age is quite unusual. In the background, the authors verified familial combined hyperlipidaemia and heterozygous mutation of the cystic fibrosis gene for delta F508 as genetic predisposing factor. The clinical condition was accelerated and worsened by the fact, that the patient has grown fat since his infancy. It did not prove possible to achieve a weight reduction with a fat- and cholesterol-poor diet, increased physical activity and medical treatment. However, there was significant improvement in the laboratory findings.The conclusion drawn from this case, on one hand, is that doctors should think of the possibility of a fatty liver in case of an elevated isolate serum transaminase level in connection with obese or over weight patients. On the other hand the role of other coexisting etiological features must emerge in the background of severe steatohepatitis.
