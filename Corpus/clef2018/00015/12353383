Clinico-morphological changes of the liver in patients with dyslipoproteinemia. At present the disorders of lipid metabolism and connected diseases are studied insufficiently. Some disorders with the basis of lipid metabolism disorders are combined into the lipid distress-syndrome. The clinical study of 60 patients with expressed dislipoproteidemia (48 female and 12 male) in the age 46-79 years were made by the clinical observation, estimation of biochemical indexes, lipid blood spectrum, viral hepatitis markers, ultrasonic and liver biopsy. Obtained results showed that the patients with dislipoproteidemia had the expressed liver disorders which were typical for the clinical-morphological characteristics of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In patients with cardio-vascular pathology, atherosclerosis and dislipoproteidemia in 90% of cases the detected liver dystrophy can be considered as pre-stage of NASH.
