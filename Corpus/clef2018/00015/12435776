Increased risk for hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis in relatives of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in northern Taiwan. There is a tendency for familial aggregation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aims of this study were to assess the degree to which familial aggregation of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers accounts for familiality of HCC in families of hepatitis B-related HCC patients, and whether HCC shares a familial predisposition with liver cirrhosis among HBsAg carriers.A total of 671 first-degree relatives of HBsAg-positive HCC cases were recruited using abdominal ultrasonography and tests for HBsAg and serum aminotransferases. They were from 165 simplex families defined as having only one HCC case and 72 multiplex families with more than one case. In analyses of family history of HCC and cirrhosis, the data set consisted of 4,471 unrelated asymptomatic HBsAg carriers recruited in a prospective study.There was no significant difference in the HBsAg-positive rate among relatives between multiplex (55.7%) and simplex (48.1%) families. Sonographic evidence of liver cirrhosis was present in 14.4% of HBsAg-positive relatives from multiplex families but in only 7.8% of HBsAg-positive relatives from simplex families (multiplex versus simplex families: adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.29 95% CI: 1.10-4.77). Among unrelated asymptomatic HBsAg carriers, the adjusted OR of liver cirrhosis associated with a first-degree family history of HCC was 2.80 (95% CI: 1.68-4.66). This association was stronger in HBsAg carriers <50 years. No association was seen between family history of HCC and hepatitis activity based on elevated levels of aminotransferases.Familial aggregation of HCC in HBsAg carriers is associated with familial clustering of liver cirrhosis.
