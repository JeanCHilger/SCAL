Use of ultrasonography in Schistosoma mansoni infections: from the past to the present and future perspectives. Before the sonographic era, clinics or parasitology even autopsy have been the only sources of basic principles on the morbidity due to Schistosoma mansoni. The exploration of inner organs and their pathologies became easier. The organ's size as well as their echogenicity permit grading. Up till now, any classification is not appropriate. Attempts of standardization haven't yet succeeded, thus any comparison among different endemic regions is not possible. A simple method based on qualitative observation of the periportal fibrosis is proposed to help sonographist for the diagnosis of presumption in front of evocative image and to be a guideline for later investigation.
