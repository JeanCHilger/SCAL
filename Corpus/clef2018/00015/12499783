Comparison of Doppler ultrasonography and hepatic venous pressure gradient in assessing portal hypertension in liver cirrhosis. This prospective study aimed to determine if Doppler ultrasonography can be representative of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) in assessing the severity of portal hypertension and response to drug reducing portal pressure.The HVPG and the parameters of Doppler ultrasonography including portal venous velocity (PVV) and splenic venous velocity, the pulsatility and resistive index of hepatic, splenic and renal arteries were measured in 105 patients with liver cirrhosis. In 31 patients the changes of hepatic venous pressure gradient and portal venous velocity after administration of terlipressin were evaluated. The patients who showed a reduction in HVPG of more than 20% of the baseline were defined as responders to terlipressin.Any Doppler ultrasonographic parameters did not correlate with HVPG. Both HVPG and PVV showed a highly significant reduction after the administration of terlipressin(-28.3 +/- 3.9%, -31.2 +/- 2.2% respectively). However, PVV decreased significantly not only in responders(31.7 +/- 2.4%) but also in nonresponders(29.5 +/- 6.1%).Doppler ultrasonography can not be representative of HVPG in assessing the severity of portal hypertension and response to drug reducing portal pressure in liver cirrhosis.
