Vascular endothelial growth factor level in chronic liver diseases. Ninety individuals (76 males and 14 females) were classified into four groups. G1 (Control) included 20 healthy individuals. G2 (Chronic hepatitis) included 20 patients, G3 (Liver cirrhosis group) included 30 patients, and G4 (HCC) included 20 patients with HCC. All groups were subjected to clinical examination, abdominal ultrasonography, complete blood picture, HCV antibodies, HBs Ag, and function tests (total and direct bilirubin, total plasma proteins and albumin, prothrombin time and concentration, and liver enzymes AST, ALT and ALP). Patients of G3 & 4 were classified according to Child-Pugh classification into A. B and C. Upper endoscopic examination was done for 36/50 patients with chronic hepatitis or HCC. Circulating VEGF levels were determined by ELISA. There was a statistically high significant levels of circulating VEGF in G1, 2 & 3 than in the controls. A statistically significant higher level of circulating VEGF in G4 than in G3 & G4, and a statistically negative significant between VEGF levels and platelet count in G2. No significant correlation between VEGF and the grade of esophageal varices in G3 & G4. and no significant correlation between VEGF and upper GIT bleeding or spider naevi (vascular skin changes) in G2. A statistically significant was in correlation between VEGF and degree of hepatic dysfunction.
