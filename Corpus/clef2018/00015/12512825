IgG isotypes in schistosomiasis patients before and after praziquantel. This work evaluated circulating anti-SWAP IgG1 and IgG4 in patients with active S. mansoni infection before and after PZQ and its correlation to clinical, laboratory and sonographic data. The main complaints was abdominal discomfort, pain, tensmus and bleeding per rectum, which progressive decreased after PZQ. The anti-SWAP IgGI and IgG4 were significantly higher in patients than controls. A progressive significant decrease in the level of circulating anti-SWAP IgG1 after treatment, a decrease of IgG4 three months after treatment and a decrease in the egg count after therapy. But, no significant difference in IgG1 or IgG4 was noticed between male and female patients before and after treatment. No significant difference in IgGI or IgG4 in patients having GIT manifestation and organomegalic patients and/or asymptomatic patient. No significant difference in lgG1 or IgG4 between patients with grade (o), graele (I) and grade (II) periportal fibrosis. The sensitivity of ELISA IgGI was 73.3% and specificity was 80% while ELISA IgG4 was 80%. Enlarged liver and/or spleen, periportal fibrosis, and dilated P.V detected by ultrasonography were more among patients than controls. There was no significant difference in hematological parameters and liver function tests between patients and control groups. So, ELISA is sensitive and specific for IgG1 and IgG4. Anti-SWAP IgG1 and IgG4 is useful means in diagnosis and cure, as well as significant reduction of anti-SWAP IgG1 and IgG4 after treatment. Anti-SWAP IgG1 and IgG4 are parameter for evaluating cure. Follow up of anti-schistosomal IgG1 and IgG4 is useful for assessment of treatment
