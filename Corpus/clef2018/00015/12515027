Classifications and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study are included 78 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In 22 the diagnosis is verified pathologically (obduction), while in the other patients the diagnosis is made by laparoscopy, laparoscopical ultrasonography and morphological verification (through FNAB cytology and/or histology). In 69.2% HCC is associated with cirrhosis. The prognosis of HCC associated with cirrhosis is evaluated through the classification of S. Chevret et all., and is compared to the Child-Pugh scoring system. 38.9% of patients in Chevret's class C score are in class B in the Child-Pugh score, while 25.9% of patients are in class C in both classifications, but Child-Pugh's class C patients are most often in B-C transition. It might be assumed that the prognosis of HCC depends more on the tumor prognosis than on the prognosis of the liver cirrhosis itself. Every classification which does not take in to account the liver function (like TNM system) and the whole characteristics of the tumor, would be incomplete, in some extent, in the prognosis of HCC with cirrhosis. In HCC without cirrhosis, the BCLC classification reflects both the liver function and the tumor characteristics. In BCLC class A patients hepatic resection or transplantation is recommended but hyperbilirubinemia and ascites, which might be seen in A3 and A4 classes contraindicate resection of the liver. All scoring systems define lower HCC stage than it is really found (personal and reference data), so there are no arguments to take classification scores as absolute treatment decision making rules.
