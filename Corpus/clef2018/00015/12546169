Assessment of renal and hepatic hemodynamics in cirrhosis of liver. Investigators have documented an increase in renal artery resistance in cirrhotic patients. We studied the hepatic and renal hemodynamics by color Doppler in patients with liver cirrhosis in relation to the presence and severity of ascites.A prospective study was carried out in a large public hospital on 33 patients with cirrhosis of liver and 11 healthy control subjects. Eleven patients had no ascites, 12 had diuretic-responsive ascites and 10 had refractory ascites. The resistance index (RI) of the hepatic artery was measured by color Doppler on its main branch and renal artery RI was measured on the main renal, interlobar and cortical arteries of the right kidney.Considering intraobserver variabilities, coefficient of variation for RI was 2.3%-7.8% (mean [SD] 4.2% [1.8%]). Hepatic artery RI were 0.68 (0.07), 0.68 (0.1), 0.81 (0.04), 1.0 (0.12) in control subjects and cirhotics with no ascites, responsive ascites and refractory ascites, respectively. Renal RI was significantly higher than in control subjects at all three levels in patients with responsive and refractory ascites, being higher in those with refractory than responsive ascites. Renal RI decreased from hilum towards the outer parenchyma, in cirrhotics with no ascites and responsive ascites but not in refractory ascites.Hepatic artery RI is higher in cirrhotics and is related to presence and severity of ascites. In control subjects and patients with no ascites or responsive ascites the renal RI decreased from hilum to the outer parenchyma.
