Texture analysis of B-scan image using fractal dimension. Based on the texture analysis of B-Scan image fractal model, this paper presents the liver clinical B-Scan images and their fractal characteristics. It describes the semi-fractal characteristics of B-Scan images and calculates the fractal dimension(D) of the liver B-scan images of 10 normal persons, 3 patients with cancer of the liver, and 3 patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The results indicate that Fractal Dimension (D) is an important parameter in differentiating some diseases. On the basis of the influence of Fractal Dimension (D) and scale (epsilon), this paper suggests the texture classified parameter S. The experiment results indicate that the parameter S can be used to differentiate diseases efficiently.
