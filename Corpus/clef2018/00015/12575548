Relationship between liver fibrosis criteria and syndrome-type of TCM in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver. To explore the relationship between the liver fibrosis criteria and TCM Syndrome, type in the patients suffering from non-alcoholic fatty liver.Seventy-nine patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver diagnosed by B ultrasonography were classified by TCM Syndrome Differentiation and their liver fibrosis criteria was determined and compared with those of the health subjects as control.Levels of procollagen III (PCIII), hyaluronic acid (HA), collagen IV (CIV) and laminin (LN) in the fatty liver group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). In respect to the TCM Syndrome-types, PCIII, CIV and LN in patients of Phlegm-stasis combined type were significantly higher than those in patients of other two Syndrome-types (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), while HA was insignificantly different (P > 0.05).There was trend of liver fibrosis in fatty liver patients. It was indicated that the Phlegm-stasis combined Syndrome-type possibly was the main TCM pathologic factor of the increasing of fibrosis criteria for non-alcoholic fatty liver.
