Interferon therapy after tumor ablation improves prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma associated with hepatitis C virus. Even after the surgical or medical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, tumors frequently develop at new foci, leading to a poor prognosis.To assess whether combined tumor ablation and interferon therapy can reduce the occurrence of new foci of hepatocellular carcinoma, thereby improving survival rate.Randomized, controlled study.University hospital.74 patients with compensated cirrhosis, three or fewer nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma, and low hepatitis C virus RNA loads (< or =2 x 10(6) copies/mL).After all patients had complete ablation of lesions by percutaneous ethanol injection therapy, 49 patients were assigned to receive 6 million U of interferon three times weekly for 48 weeks and 25 did not receive treatment.Abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and determination of blood biochemical measures.Of the 49 patients treated with interferon, 21 showed a sustained biochemical response and 14 showed a sustained virologic response. The rate of first recurrence of new foci of hepatocellular carcinoma was similar in patients treated with interferon and untreated patients however, the rates of second or third recurrence seemed to be lower in the interferon group than in the untreated group. Patients treated with interferon had a survival rate of 68% at 5 years and 53% at 7 yearsAfter tumor ablation by ethanol injection, interferon therapy may enhance patient survival in selected patients with chronic hepatitis C.
