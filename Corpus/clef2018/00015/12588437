Lipomatous pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas: further evidence of advanced hepatic lesion as the pathogenesis. An 80-year-old Japanese man with liver cirrhosis was suspected of having lipomatous pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas on the basis of results of ultrasonography and a computed tomography scan. He eventually died of hepatic failure. He had no obesity, diabetes mellitus or pancreatic symptoms during his entire clinical course. Autopsy results confirmed lipomatous pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas, cholecystolithiasis, and postnecrotic liver cirrhosis associated with submassive hepatic necrosis was suspected. Although the pathogenesis of lipomatous pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas is not clear, the findings in the present case provide further evidence to support the hypothesis that advanced hepatic lesions cause this lesion.
