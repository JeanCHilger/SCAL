Laparoscopic versus open left lateral hepatic lobectomy: a case-control study. After technical advances in hepatic surgery and laparoscopic surgery, some teams evaluated the possibilities of laparoscopic liver resections. The aim of our study was to assess the results of laparoscopic left lateral lobectomy (bisegmentectomy 2-3) and to perform a case-control comparison with the same operation performed by open surgery.From 1996 to 2002, 60 laparoscopic resections were performed in selected patients, including 18 left lateral lobectomies. The resected lesions were benign tumors, hepatocellular carcinomas with compensated cirrhosis, and metastases. Surgical procedures were performed with a harmonic scalpel, an ultrasonic dissector, linear staplers, and portal pedicule clamping when necessary. Results were compared with those of patients who underwent open left lateral lobectomies selected from our liver resection database in a case-control analysis. Both groups were similar for age, type and size of the tumor, and presence of underlying liver disease.Compared with laparotomy, laparoscopic left lateral lobectomies were associated with a longer surgical time (202 versus 145 minutes, p < 0.01), a longer portal triad clamping (39 versus 23 minutes, p < 0.05), and a decreased blood loss (236 versus 429 mL, p < 0.05). There were no deaths in either group, and the morbidity rates were 11% in the laparoscopic group and 15% in the open group. There were no specific complications of hepatic resection after laparoscopy (no hemorrhage, subphrenic collection, or biliary leak), but some were observed in the open group.This study demonstrates the safety of laparoscopic left lateral lobectomy. Despite longer operation and clamping time, without any clinical consequences, the laparoscopic approach was associated with decreased blood loss and absence of specific complications of the hepatic resection.
