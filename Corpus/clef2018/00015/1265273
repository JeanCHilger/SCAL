Gray scale ultrasound imaging. The anatomy and pathology of the liver. Gray scale ultrasound imaging circumvents some of the limitations of other diagnostic tools. The authors have extended this technique to the investigation of hepatobiliary disease. The details of their equipment are described and their results in relation to various parameters of the disease are discussed. A major feature of the gray scale technique is the enhanced signal-noise ratio, which allows low-level echoes to be displayed.
