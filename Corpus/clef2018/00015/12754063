Effect of Levovist on splanchnic hemodynamics in cirrhotic patients. This study was aimed to assess the effect of Levovist on Doppler parameters of splanchnic hemodynamics. A total of 12 patients with cirrhosis and 12 healthy subjects underwent Doppler ultrasound (US) examination of the portal vein and of the hepatic, splenic and superior mesenteric arteries before, 5 to 8 and 12 to 15 min after the start of an 8-min long IV infusion of 2.5 g of Levovist. Mean velocity and mean diameter were calculated for the portal vein. Resistance index was determined for the arteries. A significant increase of resistance index was observed in the hepatic (0.80 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.71 +/- 0.06 p < 0.01) and splenic arteries (0.72 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.64 +/- 0.06
