Use of silicon-impregnated compresses for echographic detection of section planes during hepatectomies. It is essential to detect section planes during hepatectomy, notably for limited resections in cirrhotic patients. The authors describe a technical artifice, the use silicon-impregnated compresses, to help in the peroperative ultrasonographic detection of these section planes.
