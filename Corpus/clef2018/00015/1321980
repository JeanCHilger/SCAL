CT during arterial portography: diagnostic pitfalls. Computed tomography (CT) during arterial portography (CTAP) is an important technique for evaluating the liver before hepatic tumor resection. With this technique, most tumors are of low attenuation compared with that of enhancing parenchyma. At times, low-attenuation lesions are encountered that represent perfusion abnormalities rather than tumor deposits. These perfusion abnormalities can be categorized as (a) those resulting from improper technique (b) those extending from hilum to capsule (straight-line sign), with or without an obstructing mass
