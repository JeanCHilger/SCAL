Ultrasound visualization of hepatic peribiliary cysts: a comparison with morphology. We report herein a hitherto unrecognized, interesting ultrasound finding ("hilar multicystic echo complex"), the result of peribiliary cysts in the liver. This ultrasound finding was discovered around intrahepatic large bile ducts and large portal vein branches near the hepatic hilum in an autopsy case with hepatocellular carcinoma, submassive hepatic necrosis superimposed on chronic active hepatitis, and portal hypertension. Antemortem ultrasound examination revealed the hilar multicystic echo complex around the portal venous branches near the hepatic hilum. Autopsy confirmed that the hilar multicystic echo complex was due to peribiliary cysts that were present around the bile ducts at the hilum. The peribiliary cysts were thought to have arisen from cystic dilatation of preexisting intrahepatic peribiliary glands. These peribiliary cysts reportedly occur in livers with portal hypertension (e.g., cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, idiopathic portal hypertension, extrahepatic portal obstruction, and portal thromboembolism), adult-type polycystic disease of the liver and kidneys, and systemic infection. Therefore, recognition of peribiliary cysts at sonography would have diagnostic value, and may indicate that presence of one of the above described liver diseases.
