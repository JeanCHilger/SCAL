Small hepatocellular carcinoma. Diagnosis and treatment of 40 cases. In 40 patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma, the lesions were less than 5 cm in diameter, with a mean diameter of 3.4 +/- 1.1 cm. The smallest was 1.1 x 1.3 cm. 39 patients were first detected by ultrasonic scanning, and one was discovered during emergency operation because of spontaneous tumor rupture. 36 patients were treated by means of hepatic resection. One (2.7%) died within 30 days after operation. Four patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis and significant prolongation of prothrombin time (4 seconds over control) were subjected to selective transcatheter arterial embolization combined with transcatheter arterial infusion of chemotherapeutic agent. The diagnosis and treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma was discussed.
