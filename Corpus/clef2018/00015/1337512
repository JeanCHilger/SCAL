Cryosurgery for primary hepatic cancer of 87 patients. From november 1973 to June 1991, cryosurgery with liquid nitrogen was performed on 87 patients with primary liver cancer (PLC). Of these, 27 patients was of stage I (31.0%), 52 in stage II (59.8%), and 8 stage III (9.2%). There were 30 patients with PLC of < or = 5 cm (34.5%). Liver cirrhosis was found in 73 patients (83.9%). In the beginning, plate-like cryoprobes and thermocouples were used to monitor the frozen area. Later on we designed single- and multiple-needle cryoprobes for freezing tumors deeply into the hepatic parenchyma and intraoperative ultrasound was used to monitor hepatic cryolesions. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 60.5%, 32.0%, and 20.2%, respectively. Among the 30 patients with PLC of < or = 5 cm, the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 92.6%, 66.6%, and 50.8%, respectively. There were no operative mortality and complications such as rupture of the tumor, delayed bleeding, and bile leakage. These results indicate that cryosurgery is a safe and effective local treatment for unresectable PLC.
