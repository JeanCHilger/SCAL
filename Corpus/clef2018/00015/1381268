Serum alpha-L-fucosidase. A useful marker in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The value of serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was investigated by determining the enzyme activity levels in 21 patients with HCC, 76 patients with cirrhosis, 22 patients with other malignant neoplasms, and 23 healthy subjects.The serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity level in patients with HCC (575.76 +/- 212.86 nmol/ml/h) was significantly higher than that found in patients with cirrhosis (274.55 +/- 138.97 nmol/ml/h P less than 0.001) or other neoplasms (257.91 +/- 128.12 nmol/ml/hThese results suggest that alpha-L-fucosidase is a useful marker for detecting HCC, in conjunction with alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasonography.
