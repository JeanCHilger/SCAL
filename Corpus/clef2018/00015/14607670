Spontaneous complete necrosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: a case report. Spontaneous regression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare. We found spontaneous regression of HCC in a 53-year-old Chinese with liver cirrhosis. A liver mass 3 cm in diameter was revealed by B-ultrasonography. The resected mass showed histologically complete necrosis. The necrotic tissue was filled with large debris from a neoplastic tissue, regardless of no viable tumor cells were seen among them. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient is alive and well for 4 years after surgery.
