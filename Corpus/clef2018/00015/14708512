Caroli's disease: 6 case studies. Caroll's disease is characterized by congenital non-obstructive dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts of undefined etiology. It is a rare disease usually affecting the whole liver but it may affect a lobe or a segment (11). This study shows the evolution of 6 cases (2 boys and 4 giris) that were diagnosed with Caroli's disease at a referral service. Their ages ranged from 2 to 16 years--median age 10 years. One of the patients presented with cholangitis, while hepatomegaly was observed in 83% of the cases. Four of the patients presented biliary lithiasis and in one of these cholesterol crystals could be observed in the duodenal secretion. The diagnosis was confirmed in 4 cases by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, in 1 by cholangioresonance and 1 by echography. Two of the patients also presented congenital hepatic fibrosis. The outpatient clinic follow-up indicated that all the patients evolved well with the exception of one patient who was selected as a candidate for liver transplantation.
