Alterations in thyroid Doppler arterial resistance indices, volume and hormones in cirrhosis: relationships with splanchnic haemodynamics. The hypothesis of thyroid involvement in the haemodynamic alterations of cirrhosis was evaluated. We measured thyroid volume (thrV), free triiodiothyronine (FT3), free thyroxin (FT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), resistance index (thrRI) and pulsatility index (thrPI) in the inferior thyroid artery in 45 cirrhotic patients of different aetiologies and Child class, and in 13 healthy subjects. Portal vein velocity, flow, diameter and hepatic, splenic, and renal arterial resistance indices were also evaluated. ThrV was increased in Child-C patients (p < 0.05). FT3 was decreased in cirrhotic patients (p < 0.05), TSH and FT4 were not different. ThrPI and thrRI were increased in cirrhotic patients (thrPI: 1.01 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.11 thrRI: 0.62 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.53 +/- 0.04
