Contrast-enhanced US of hepatocellular carcinoma. To evaluate the capabilities of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the characterization of hepatocarcinoma (HCC) in terms of accuracy as compared to spiral CT and diagnostic gain as compared to conventional and Doppler US.Forty-three patients with viral hepatopathy or cirrhosis diagnosed with HCC (6 histologically and 37 cytologically proven) were retrospectively studied. Between January 2002 and May 2003, all patients were evaluated with CEUS after detection of at least one suspicious nodule on US. CEUS features of HCCs were retrospectively compared with those on conventional and Doppler US, and spiral CT.HCCs varied between 1.2 cm and 18 cm in diameter 14/43 were small' (< or = 2 cm). In 18/43 patients, HCC was multifocal. Doppler US revealed 24/43 hypervascular nodules. On CEUS, 37/43 (86%) showed contrast enhancement in the arterial phase, 13/37 (35%) with negative colour and power Doppler US examinationCEUS diagnosis of HCC in cirrhotic liver is possible with a combination of the arterial phase, which shows tumoral hypervascularity in the microcirculation, and the sinusoidal phase, which allows to confirm the malignancy of the nodule.
