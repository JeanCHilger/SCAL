Chylous ascites and chylothorax due to constrictive pericarditis in a patient undergoing haemodialysis. Chylous ascites and chylothorax are rare clinical entities and usually caused by neoplasms, particularly lymphomas, liver cirrhosis, superior vena cava thrombosis, nephrotic syndrome, and some cardiac events such as dilated cardiomyopathy or right heart failure. Constrictive pericarditis is an extremely rare cause of this clinical state. We report a 41-year-old male patient undergoing haemodialysis who presented with chylous ascites and chylothorax. Echocardiography and heart catheterisation revealed constrictive pericarditis. He underwent pericardiectomy and after the operation the ascites and pleural effusion resolved rapidly. We suggest that constrictive pericarditis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chylous ascites and chylothorax.
