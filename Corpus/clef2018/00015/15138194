Gender-related cytokine patterns in sera of schistosomiasis patients with Symmers' fibrosis. Cytokine levels were compared between schistosomiasis patients affected by intense fibrosis defined by ultrasound examination and graded from F-0 to F-3. The concentrations of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, gamma interferon, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of serum samples. Levels of IL-4, IL-5, and TNF-alpha in the sera of F-3 patients were significantly higher than those found in F-0 individuals, while levels of IL-13 were lower. Levels of IL-4, IL-5, and TNF-alpha in serum were significantly higher in F-3 males than in F-0 males or F-3 females. Conversely, levels of IL-13 were significantly lower in F-3 females than in F-0 females and males.
