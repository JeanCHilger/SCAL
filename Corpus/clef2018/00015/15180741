Evaluation of liver fibrosis: a concise review. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has traditionally relied on liver biopsy. However, recent studies have suggested that there can be up to a 33 % error in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. In this article, we review the current status of liver biopsy as a gold standard for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and discuss the radiological and serum tests that have been proposed as potential adjuncts or alternatives to biopsies. Indirect markers of liver fibrosis which reflect alterations in liver function and or inflammation are discussed as well as more direct markers of liver fibrosis. The limitations of utilization of these markers for both cross-sectional diagnosis of fibrosis and monitoring disease progression or regression are discussed.
