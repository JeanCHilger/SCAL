Diagnostic value of portal blood velocity measurements in the assessment of the severity of liver cirrhosis. The aim of our study was to check the significance of portal blood velocity /PBV/ in evaluation of the severity of liver disease. Duplex doppler sonography evaluation of PBV was performed in 20 patients (pts) with liver cirrhosis (7 women, 13 men, aged 34-75) and 10 pts with normal liver function (controls). We checked it during fasting and 30 minutes after a meal. The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was based on clinical, laboratory and sonographic criteria. The severity of liver cirrhosis was classified according the Child-Pugh score as class A--6 pts. class B--10 pts. and class C--4 pts. The lowest values of the mean baseline PBV (during fasting) were observed in cirrhotic pts class C (15.9+/-4.2 cm/s vs class B 18,1+/-7.8 cm/s vs class A 20.4+/-8.6 cm/s vs controls 21.6+/-3.8 cm/s). A similar situation appeared after our evaluation of PBV values in the postprandial state (class C 16.5+/-4.8 cm/s vs class B 19.8+/-9.1cm/s vs class A 22.4+/-6.4 cm/s vs controls 29.6+/-10.6 cm/s). The increment of PBV after a meal in pts with the Child-Pugh class C was significantly diminished compared to control group (0.6+/-4.1cm/s vs 8.0+/-5.2 cm/s
