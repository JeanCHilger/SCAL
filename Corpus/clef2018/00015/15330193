Radiofrequency ablation combined with percutaneous ethanol injection in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein neoplastic thrombosis. In the last ten years new techniques, such as percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), have been developed for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Portal vein involvement is a complication of HCC and the role of surgical resection for HCC with tumor thrombi in the portal veins is controversial. Here we present the case of a 58-year-old man, with Child's class A cirrhosis and a focal lesion of HCC with thrombosis of the segmental portal branch extending into the right portal vein. We treated the nodule with RFA and the portal tumor thrombosis with ethanol injection. Twenty-two months after the combined treatment, an enhanced spiral CT scan showed complete necrosis of the nodule and color/power Doppler ultrasound demonstrated the complete patency of the right portal vein.
