Cirrhosis-related intrathoracic disease. Imaging features in 1038 patients. To describe imaging features of cirrhosis-related intrathoracic disease.Chest CTs of 1038 cirrhotic patients (mean age 53 yrs range, 17-79) were evaluated for: bronchoarterial ratio (BAR), arteriovenous malformations, interstitial opacities, emphysema, and pleural effusions. Lymphangiography, pulmonary angiography, cardiac ultrasound and scintigraphy were selectively performed.Mean BAR was 0.83+/-0.19. In two patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), mean BAR was 0.55. HRCT detected interstitial lung opacities in 15 patients. Signs of fibrosis were seen in 7 (only two associated to biliary cirrhosis) and interstitial edema in 8. Accurate pattern recognition was achieved in 10/15 cases (66.6%). Of the 93 patients with emphysema only one had documented alpha1-AT deficiency (1.08%). Multiple type 1 vascular dilatations were visualized in two patients with HPS. Hepatic hydrothorax was present in 49 patients (4.72%) right-sided in 34 (69.4%), bilateral in 9 (18.4%) and left-sided in 6 (12.2%). Hepatic chylothorax was confirmed in 3 patients. Lymphangiography demonstrated the site of leakage and the engorged thoracic duct.CT can identify intrathoracic pathology associated with liver disease. Decreased BAR is highly specific for HPS. However, a multimodality approach is necessary to depict cases of liver origin.
