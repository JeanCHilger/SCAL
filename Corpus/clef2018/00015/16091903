Coinfection of Schistosoma mansoni and Strongyloides stercoralis in a patient with variceal bleeding. We report a case of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis with portal hypertension and variceal bleeding in an immigrant patient from Egypt, coinfected with Strongyloides stercoralis. The diagnosis was based on the following: (a) identification of Schistosoma mansoni ova in the stools and colonic biopsy specimens, (b) portal hypertension and esophageal varices with normal liver function and the absence of hepatic cirrhosis stigmata, (c) history of migration from an endemic area and (d) ultrasonographic findings of spleen and liver enlargement, fibrosed portal tracts, and normal lobular architecture of liver parenchyma. Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis should be suspected in any patient from an endemic area who has splenomegaly, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices bleeding in the absence of stigmata of liver cirrhosis and hepatic insufficiency. Coinfection with S. stercoralis could be attributed to common epidemiological features of the parasites and the patient's habits.
