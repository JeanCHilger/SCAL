Imaging features of perivascular fatty infiltration of the liver: initial observations. To retrospectively identify and describe the imaging features that represent perivascular fatty infiltration of the liver.The institutional review board approved the study and waived informed consent. The study complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Ten patients (seven women, three men mean age, 78 yearsFatty infiltration surrounded hepatic veins in three, portal tracts in five, and both hepatic veins and portal tracts in two patients.
