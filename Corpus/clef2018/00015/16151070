Yamanouchi magnetic compression anastomosis for bilioenteric anastomotic stricture after living-donor liver transplantation. Yamanouchi magnetic compression anastomosis (YMCA) is a novel interventional method that creates an anastomosis between the bile duct and small intestine. The method uses two magnets to compress the stricture transmurally, causing gradual ischemic necrosis of the stricture. This ischemic necrosis creates an anastomosis between the two magnets. The present report describes two cases in which YMCA was successfully applied to treat bilioenteric anastomotic stricture after living-donor liver transplantation. These two patients exhibited good long-term clinical courses.
