Relationship between liver mass and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in patients with liver cirrhosis. To investigate the relation of liver mass to, liver hymodynamics and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in patients with liver cirrhosis.The liver mass was measured by liver biopsy, hepatic hemodynamics by ultrasonography, and the contents of hyalurionic acid (HA), human procollagen III (HPC III) and collagen type IV (C IV) by radioimmunoassay in 100 patients with liver cirrhosis in compensation stage and 30 normal control subjects.Greater liver mass was accompanied by more severe liver fibrosis and reduced liver blood flow. The contents of HA, HPC III and C IV were obvious higher in the patients than in the normal controls (P<0.05) and increased with the liver mass. The liver mass was positively related to serum liver fibrosis indices (r=0.5612, P<0.05).Liver mass in patients with liver cirrhosis is related to hepatic hemodynamics, indices for liver fibrosis and liver pathology.
