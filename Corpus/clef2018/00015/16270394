Association between thrombotic risk factors and extent of fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. To evaluate the prevalence of genetic and acquired prothrombotic risk factors and their association with the extent of fibrosis and fatty infiltration in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Forty-four patients with chronic hepatitis (28 men and 16 women, with mean age of 45+/-11 and 49+/-12 years, respectively) constituted the patient population of this study. The groups were divided as follows: 15 patients with fatty liver (FL) 15 with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)Activated protein C (APC) resistance and protein S were the most prevalent thrombotic risk factors (6% and 10% in NAFLD vs 21% and 14% in CH P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively). One thrombotic risk factor was identified in 41% of patients (23% mild fibrosis, 18% severe fibrosis) and two thrombotic risk factors in 6% of patients with NAFLD and severe fibrosis. While no differences in APC ratio, lupus anticoagulant, fibrinogen, factor V Leiden, prothrombin, and MTHFR mutation were found. Protein S levels were significantly lower in NASH patients than in patients with FL alone (92+/-19 vs 106+/-2, P<0.01). Protein C levels were markedly higher in patients with NAFLD and mild or severe fibrosis as compared to the patients with CH, respectively (128+/-40 vs 96+/-14, P<0.001 or 129+/-36 vs 88+/-13, P<0.01).Up to 46% of patients with NAFLD may have thrombotic risk factors, and the presence of thrombotic risk factors is correlated with the extent of hepatic fibrosis, suggesting a crucial role of the coagulation system in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis.
