Percutaneous alcohol injection of hepatic tumors using ultrasonic guidance: a new therapeutic approach. Ultrasound guided percutaneous alcoholization of the liver has been carried out using a large volume of alcohol (usually 20 to 30 ml) with no adverse reaction and its efficacy was perceptible after about 6 sessions. The best results were achieved in hepatocarcinomas in a context of Child A cirrhosis (6 out 6 lesion became negative). In hepatocarcinoma in a context of Child B and C cirrhosis and in hepatic metastases, the outcome depends on the initial disorder.
