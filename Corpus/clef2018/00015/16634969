Combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma with components of mucinous carcinoma arising in a cirrhotic liver. A rare autopsy case of combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma, occurring in a 54-year-old man with liver cirrhosis, is presented. Initial laboratory data included CEA 52.1 ng/mL, DUPAN-2 1600 U/mL, AFP 2 ng/mL, and negativity for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B early antigen and hepatitis B core antibody. Ultrasonography and CT scan showed a large tumor node in the liver with ringed enhancement, swelling of several para-aortic lymph nodes, and ascites. Clinically, it was not possible to determine whether the hepatic tumor was an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or a metastatic carcinoma. Histologically, the primary lesion was composed solely of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a trabecular pattern, and the intrahepatic metastases consisted of a variable admixture of HCC and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) with excessive mucin production. Interestingly, the tumor cell cluster showing a trabecular growth pattern produced mucin and had immunohistochemical expression of hepatocyte, cytokeratins 7 and 8. It is concluded that these hepatic tumor cells had both HCC and CC characters.
