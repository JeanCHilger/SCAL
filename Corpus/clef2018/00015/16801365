Renovascular impedance correlates with portal pressure in patients with liver cirrhosis. To prospectively evaluate, in patients with liver cirrhosis, the correlation between the renovascular impedance measured by using color flow and pulsed wave Doppler ultrasonography (US) and the portal pressure measured by using the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG).The study was approved by the senior staff committee (comparable to institutional review board) of the university hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Thirty-one patients with cirrhosis (22 men, nine women mean age, 57.6 years +/- 8.8 [standard deviation]) and esophageal varices were consecutively enrolled in the study. Having fasted, the patients underwent color flow and pulsed wave Doppler US of the right interlobar renal artery (RRA) and the left interlobar renal artery (LRA). The resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) were determined. On the same day, with fluoroscopic guidance, a 5-F balloon-tipped catheter was advanced, via the right basilic vein, into the right hepatic veinMean RI and PI values were 0.67 +/- 0.07 and 1.21 +/- 0.25, respectively, for the RRA, and 0.68 +/- 0.07 and 1.24 +/- 0.26, respectively, for the LRA. All patients had portal hypertension (mean HVPG, 19.3 mm Hg +/- 4.7 range, 11.5-33.5 mm Hg). Neither portal pressure nor renal impedance correlated with Child-Pugh score for cirrhosis. Renal artery impedance indexes correlated with the HVPG (for RRA RI: R = 0.424, P = .03Renovascular impedance had a direct correlation with HVPG.
