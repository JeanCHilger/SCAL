NAFLD in children: a prospective clinical-pathological study and effect of lifestyle advice. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a common cause of chronic liver disease in adults, is incompletely characterized in children. We conducted a prospective study to better characterize the clinical presentation of NAFLD in children and to determine the effect of lifestyle advice in the management of pediatric NAFLD. From June 2001 to April 2003, 84 children (age 3-18.8 yr) who had elevated aminotransferases and the diagnosis of NAFLD confirmed via liver biopsy underwent a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test and a 12-month program of lifestyle advice consisting of diet and physical exercise. Thirty-four (40.5%) patients were obese (body mass index [BMI] >97th percentile), and 43 (51.2%) were overweight (BMI 85th-97th percentile). Ten (12%) had abnormal glucose tolerance 10 (12%) had elevated triglycerides, cholesterol, or both
