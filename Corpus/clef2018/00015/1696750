Assessment of pattern and treatment of intrahepatic recurrence after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma. From 1980 to 1988, 161 patients underwent total extirpation of primary hepatocellular carcinoma. There were 18 operative or hospital deaths. Recurrence of tumor was diagnosed in 69 of the remaining 143 patients during follow-up treatment with monthly serum alpha-fetoprotein measurements and imaging studies that were performed every three months. There were 61 men and eight women whose ages ranged from 33 to 78 years. The histologic factors noted were cirrhosis of the liver in 60 patients and chronic hepatitis in nine. There were multiple or diffuse recurrences (Type A) in 34 instances, one to three nodular recurrences (Type B) in 21, marginal recurrences (Type C) in 11 and a mixed form of the latter two in three instances. Two-thirds of the recurrences were found within 1.5 years and the second peak was noted between 2.0 and 2.5 years. Sex of patient, hepatitis B virus, type of tumor, capsule, extent of hepatic resection and postoperative chemotherapy did not influence the rate of recurrence, but cirrhotic livers had a significantly higher recurrence rate. A second hepatic resection was performed upon 20 patients with a five year survival rate of 26.8 per cent. Good results were obtained by chemoembolization of the hepatic artery. Prevention and adequate treatment of intrahepatic recurrence are of paramount importance in achieving better surgical results for hepatocellular carcinoma.
