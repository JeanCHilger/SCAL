Imaging findings in hepatic Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. We describe ultrasonographic and computed tomographic features of hepatic lesions in two cases of disseminated Langerhans' cell histiocytosis affecting children. In the first case, hyperechoic band like periportal lesions were observed at ultrasonography, which on computed tomography was found to be hypodense admixed with fatty attenuation (HU@23 to - 57) at places. In addition, the caudate lobe was very prominent. In the second case, the hepatic parenchyma showed predominantly hyperechoic diffusely heterogeneous echogenicity. There were features of cirrhosis of liver with portal hypertension in the form of atrophy of right lobe with hypertrophy of left lobe of liver with lobulated outline, prominent main portal vein and splenoportal axis, splenomegaly and gastroesophageal varices. Both the patients were put on chemotherapy as per schedule (Protocol: DAL HX - 83) and are on follow up.
