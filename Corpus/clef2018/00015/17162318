Liver fibrosis in HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis B extensively exposed to antiretroviral therapy with anti-HBV activity. The extent and predictors of liver fibrosis were examined in a HIV/HBVcoinfected cohort with extensive exposure to anti-HBV active HAART.Liver fibrosis was measured using transient elastography.Thirty-seven patients of a median age of 43 were included in the study. All but 2 patients had received anti-HBV drugs for a median time of 40 months in the context of HAART. F0-F1 METAVIR fibrosis scores (minimal or no fibrosis) as measured by elastography were found in 21 (57%) patients. AST levels were significantly lower among F0-F1 patients (33 IU/L) compared to F2-F4 patients (48 IU/L) (p = .01). ALT levels were also lower in F0-F1 patients (38 IU/L) than in F2-F4 patients (54 IU/L) (p = .05).In this HIV/HBV-coinfected cohort, with extensive HAART exposure including anti-HBV agents, more than half of the patients had no or minimal liver fibrosis. Higher transaminase levels were recognized in patients with higher degree of fibrosis.
