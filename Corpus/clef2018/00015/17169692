Microbubble disappearance-time is the appropriate timing for liver-specific imaging after injection of Levovist. Contrast enhancement in the portal vein was repeatedly observed at 1 min intervals with wide-band Doppler ultrasonography in 152 consecutive patients (132 with liver cirrhosis and HCC, 20 controls), 5 min after the injection of Levovist. The duration time of contrast enhancement in the portal vein (microbubble disappearance-time MD-T) was measured in all patients and contrast-enhanced appearances were compared between the 5 min phase and MD-T phase in 68 HCC nodules. MD-T in patients with liver cirrhosis (572.4 +/- 117.9 s) was significantly longer than in controls (481.6 +/- 89.3 s, p < 0.05). MD-T was prolonged in patients with Child B and C compared with Child A (p < 0.05). The contrast-enhanced appearances between the two phases were different in 30 of 68 HCC nodules (44.1%), showing positive enhancement in the 5 min phase and negative enhancement in the MD-T phase. The proposed MD-T may become an essential factor for the evaluation of liver-specific sonograms.
