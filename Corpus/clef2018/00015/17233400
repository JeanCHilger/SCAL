A case of adult idiopathic chylothorax with transudative ascites. A 70-year-old woman presented at a local clinic because of shortness of breath. Since she was found to have pleural effusion, she was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. She had no history of trauma or surgery. Pleural effusion examination revealed a milky-white, chylous, odorless fluid with increased triglycerides. Further evaluation led to a diagnosis of idiopathic chylothorax. Althought she was found to have transudative ascites, abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed no significant findings including cirrhosis of the liver. As a result of intravenous hyperalimentation with fasting, the chylous pleural fluid became serous and decreased. Ascites disappeared simultaneously, suggesting a possible relationship between the chylothorax and transudative ascites.
