Spectral analysing of portal vein Doppler signals in the cirrhosis patients. In this study, we have researched the efficacy of short-time Fourier transformation (STFT) of Doppler signals from the portal veins of healthy volunteers and cirrhosis patients. Sonogram and power spectral distribution for portal vein Doppler spectral waveform changes in the cirrhosis disease were utilized and these graphics compared with healthy volunteers. Five parameters were used to compare power spectrum graphics. Clear differences were detected in the calculated parameters between healthy and cirrhosis patients. It was seen that power spectral graphics and sonograms of portal vein Doppler signals may be used to determine cirrhosis disease.
