Portal diameter in the diagnosis of esophageal varices in 266 cirrhotic patients: which role? The aim was to evaluate the predictability of portal diameter (PD) in the diagnosis of esophageal varices (EV) and of large size EV (F3EV) in a large series of patients with cirrhosis. Two-hundred sixty-six persons with cirrhosis (M:F = 153:113 mean age 65.4 +/- 10 y) were studied by abdominal sonography and upper endoscopy. Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) was found in 16.1% and EV was found in 60.9% of patients. Only Child's class (B vs. A: OR 3.4, p < 0.0001
