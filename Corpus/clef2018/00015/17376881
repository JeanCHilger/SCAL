Clinical and virological characteristics of hepatitis B virus subgenotypes Ba, C1, and C2 in China. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) subgenotypes Ba, C1 (Cs), and C2 (Ce) are the most prevalent HBV variants in China. To investigate the virological characteristics of these subgenotypes and their clinical implications, we enrolled a cohort of 211 patients in the Guangdong Province of China, including 132 with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CH), 32 with liver cirrhosis (LC), and 47 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to clinical examination, liver function test, and ultrasonograph results. Overall, HBV Ba was found in 51.2% (108/211), HBV C1 in 33.6% (71/211), and HBV C2 in 15.2% (32/211) of the cases. The distribution of HBV genotype C was greater among patients in the LC and HCC groups than among patients in the CH group, while the distribution of HBV genotype B was greater among the CH patients than among the LC and HCC patients. No significant differences in clinical features were found among patients with HBV Ba, C1, and C2. Virologically, HBV C1 had the strongest association with the A1762T G1764A double mutation, while the mutation at position 1896 resulting in A (1896A) was uncommon. In contrast, HBV Ba had the highest frequency of 1896A but the lowest of A1762T G1764A, and HBV C2 had intermediate frequencies of these mutations. Mutations of 1653T and 1753V were specifically associated with HBV C2 and C1, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that the 1653T, 1753V, and A1762T G1764A mutations and patient age significantly increased the risk of HCC development. In conclusion, HBV Ba, C1, and C2 have different mutation patterns in the enhancer II/core promoter/precore region. Therefore, genotyping and detecting the 1653T and 1753V mutations, in addition to the A1762T G1764A double mutation, might have important clinical implications as predictive risk factors for hepatocarcinogenesis.
