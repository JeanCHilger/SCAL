Leiomyosarcoma of the infrarenal portion of the inferior vena cava in a cirrhotic patient with hepatitis C. Leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava is a rare primary tumor. We present a case of a 65-year-old man with the history of cirrhosis and non-specific symptoms. The patient underwent computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging that revealed a leiomyosarcoma of the infrarenal portion of inferior vena cava.
