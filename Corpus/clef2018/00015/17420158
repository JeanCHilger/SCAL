Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt: a case report of rescue management of unrestrainable variceal bleeding in a pregnant woman. Liver cirrhosis complications in pregnant women are frequent and death rate secondary to variceal bleeding is relevant. Both sclerotherapy and banding ligation seem to be safe procedures in pregnancy when bleeding is not arrested endoscopically an emergency transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt should be considered, but data regarding pregnant cirrhotic women are scarce. We describe the case of a pregnant woman at 14 weeks of gestation who underwent management of acute variceal bleeding by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt may represent a rescue treatment for failed attempts of band ligation or sclerotherapy.
