The serum endothelin-1 level in steatosis and NASH, and its relation with severity of liver fibrosis. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is known to play an important role in hepatic fibrosis. ET-1 is also a mediator that is elevated in conditions such as insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and endothelial cell dysfunction. In this study, we investigated whether ET-1 has a role in determining the severity of liver fibrosis in NASH. Also, the relation between ALT levels, obesity, diabetes, and AST/ALT ratio and fibrosis and ET-1 level was sought. A total of 92 patients were enrolled in the study. The patients were categorized into three groups: group 1, patients with elevated transaminase levels who were diagnosed as NASH by liver biopsy (n=40) group II, patients with only hepatosteatosis determined by biopsy but having elevated transaminase levels (n=12)
