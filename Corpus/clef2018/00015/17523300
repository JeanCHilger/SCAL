Soluble P selectin levels in chronic liver disease: relationship to disease severity. Thrombocytopenia and platelet function abnormalities are problems commonly found in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). Despite lack of widespread recognition as to the clinical significance of Soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), in that increased levels of sP-selectin have been described in patients with CLD, it has been proposed as a marker of in-vivo platelet activation. The study's aim was to determine whether levels of sP-selectin in patients with CLD increase in accordance with the degree of liver failure, the likelihood of CLD patients with high sP-selectin levels being more prone to thrombosis, as well as investigating the coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters related to the sP-selectin.This study was comprised of two groups: 40 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension (28 males and 12 females) and a control group of 10 healthy volunteers (6 males and 4 females). In both groups, biochemical parameters, sP-selectin, coagulation and fibrinolytic activity levels were measured and a Doppler ultrasound was performed.Plasma sP-selectin levels were found to be higher in the patients compared to those of the control group (p < 0.01), while at the same time significant differences were observed with respect to the stage of disease. Patients with low platelet counts were found to have higher sP-selectin levels than those with normal platelet counts (p < 0.01). Seven patients (17.5%) were seen to have portal vein thrombosis upon doppler ultrasound examination, while sP-selectin levels were significantly lower in those patients with thrombosis than those without (p < 0.05). It was our finding that sP-selectin levels inversely correlated with anti thrombin III.In conclusion, sP-selectin levels related to the degree of liver disease and thrombosis are seen together with low platelet and sP-selectin levels in patients with cirrhosis.
