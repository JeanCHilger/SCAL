Study of the right heart and external respiratory functions in patients with liver cirrhosis by Doppler echocardiography. The paper presents clinical and instrumental evidence on 47 patients with hepatic cirrhosis. The revealed ventilatory disorders and worse bronchial permeability closely correlated with the degree of pulmonary hypertension which in its turn depended on portal hypertension degree. Pulmonary hypertension decreased with a decline in the activity of the pathological process in the liver due to treatment. External respiration insufficiency observed in hepatic cirrhosis contributes to the onset of arterial hypoxemia and hypoxic impairment of the liver activating in it a pathological process. It is recommended that such patients should receive a combined treatment incorporating oxygen therapy, calcium antagonists, antioxidants.
