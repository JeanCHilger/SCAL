Well-to moderately-differentiated HCC manifesting hyperattenuation on both CT during arteriography and arterial portography. We present a rare case of well- to moderately-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a 71-year-old woman with hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis and unusual radiologic features. A 20-mm hypoechoic nodule disclosed by ultrasound in segment two showed hyperattenuation on both computed tomography hepatic arteriography and computed tomography during arterial portography. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound revealed hypervascularity in the early vascular phase and defect in the post-vascular phase, with the same pattern detected by the two imaging techniques. SPIO-MRI revealed a hyperintense nodule. These findings were compatible with those of moderately-differentiated HCC. An ultrasound-guided biopsy showed histological features of well- to moderately-differentiated HCC characterized by more than two-fold the cellularity of the non-tumorous area, fatty change, clear cell change and mild cell atypia with a thin to mid-trabecular pattern. Further studies may provide insights into the correlation between tumor neovascularity in multistep hepatocarcinogenesis and dual hemodynamics, including the artery and the portal vein.
