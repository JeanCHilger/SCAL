The effect of nitrosorbide, korinfar and obzidan on the hemodynamics of patients with chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis based on the data acute drug trials. The data obtained during the complex clinical and instrumental investigation of the hemodynamics in patients with the syndrome of portal and pulmonary hypertension against the background of acute drug tests with nitrosorbide, corinfar and obsidan, are presented. By using modern ultrasound and rheographic techniques, the degree and the relationship of portal and pulmonary hypertensions in patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver are evaluated, the criteria of their early diagnosis are characterized. There was shown a positive action on the renal blood flow of nitrosorbide, an improvement of the pulmonary hemodynamics in patients with diseases of the liver against the background of corinfar exerting no influence on the hepatic blood flow. Obsidan induced a significant decrease of both portal and pulmonary hypertensions, normalization of the total hemodynamics thereby producing the greatest positive effect.
