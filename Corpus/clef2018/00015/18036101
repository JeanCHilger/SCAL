Performance of Doppler ultrasound in the prediction of severe portal hypertension in hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. To evaluate the correlation between hepatic vein pressure gradient measurement and Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD).Sixty-six patients with fibrotic to cirrhotic hepatitis C virus-related CLD, were consecutively included upon referral to our haemodynamic laboratory. Superior mesenteric artery pulsatility index (SMA-PI), right interlobar renal and intraparenchymal splenic artery resistance indices, were determined, followed by hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement.A correlation was found between HVPG and intraparenchymal splenic artery resistance index (SA-RI) (r=0.50, P<0.0001), SMA-PI (r=-0,48, P<0.0001), right interlobar renal artery resistance index (RRA-RI) (r=0.51, P<0.0001) in the whole patient population. However, dividing patients according to the presence/absence of severe portal hypertension (i.e. HVPG > or =12 mmHg), a correlation between HVPG and intraparenchymal SA-RI (r=0.70, P<0.0001), SMA-PI (r=-0.49, P=0.02), RRA-RI (r=0.66, P=0.0002) was observed only for HVPG values <12 mmHg. HVPG but not DUS correlated with the presence of esophageal varices (P<0.0001).Superior mesenteric artery pulsatility index, intraparenchymal splenic and right interlobar renal artery resistance indices do not adequately predict severe portal hypertension.
