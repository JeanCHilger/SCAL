Achilles tendinitis in Vibrio vulnificus sepsis: a rare presentation. Vibrio vulnificus infection commonly presents as sepsis or wound infection. A case of alcoholic liver cirrhosis developed acute left heel pain and swelling 2 days after ingesting raw fish. Two sets of blood cultures indicated V. vulnificus. HLA-B27 was negative. Ultrasonography revealed left Achilles tendinitis. Fluid aspirated from the left retrocalcaneal bursa was sterile. The patient recovered completely 3 weeks after treatment. To our knowledge, V. vulnificus septicaemia with Achilles tendinitis, which may be the only indication of reactive arthritis (ReA), has not been reported previously. Prompt recognition of this life-threatening infection and adequate treatment with antibiotics is vital.
