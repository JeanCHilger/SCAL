Large (>or=5.0-cm) HCCs: multipolar RF ablation with three internally cooled bipolar electrodes--initial experience in 26 patients. To prospectively evaluate the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous multipolar radiofrequency (RF) ablation for the treatment of large (>or=5.0 cm in diameter) hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Twenty-six patients (four women, 22 men median age, 72 years) with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A disease, 22 patientsOne to two RF ablation procedures per patient (mean, 1.15 +/- 0.43 [standard deviation]) led to the complete ablation of 22 (81%) of the 27 tumors (18 tumors after one and four tumors after two procedures), including three tumors that showed segmental portal vein invasion. All patients experienced postablation syndrome, and one experienced subcapsular hematoma and a segmental liver infarct, but no major complication occurred. After a mean follow-up of 14 months (range, 3-34 months), local and distant tumor progression and actual survival rates were 14% (three of 22), 24% (five of 21), and 65% (17 of 26), respectively. The probabilities of 1- and 2-year survival, respectively, were 68% (95% confidence interval: 49%, 86%) and 56% (95% confidence interval: 51%, 81%).HCCs larger than 5.0 cm (but smaller than 9.0 cm)--even those that are infiltrative and those that involve a segmental portal vein--can be completely and safely ablated with multipolar RF ablation.
