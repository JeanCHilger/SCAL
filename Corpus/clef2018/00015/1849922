Sonographic patterns of Caroli's disease: report of 5 new cases. We have reviewed 5 cases of Caroli's disease, studied from 1982 to 1987, in order to define the validity of its sonographic signs. The "intraluminal portal vein" sign, found in all the cases, is emphasized. This sign may be easily identified and it is never encountered in other diseases. Recessive polycystic kidney disease was present in 3 cases, and congenital hepatic fibrosis was demonstrated in the 2 cases studied by liver biopsy.
