Ultrasonic diagnosis of biliary atresia: a retrospective analysis of 20 patients. To investigate the clinical value of ultrasonographic diagnosis of biliary atresia (BA), a retrospective analysis of the sonogram of 20 children with BA was undertaken.Ultrasonography (US) was performed in 20 neonates and infants with BA, which was confirmed with cholangiography by operation or abdominoscopy. The presence of triangular cord, the size and echo of liver, the changes in empty stomach gallbladder and postprandial gallbladder were observed and recorded.The triangular cord could be observed at the porta hepatis (thickness: 0.3-0.6 cm) in 10 cases. Smaller triangular cord (0.2-0.26 cm) can be observed in 3 cases. The gallbladder was not observed in 2 cases, and 1 case showed a streak gallbladder without capsular space. The gallbladders of 15 cases were flat and small. The gallbladders of 2 cases were of normal size and appearance, however, there was no postprandial contraction. The livers of all cases showed hepatomegaly and hetreogeneous echogenicity. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the hepatomegaly and hetreogeneous echogenicity and the stage of hepatic fibrosis.The presence of the triangular cord at the porta hepatis is specific. However, it is not the only diagnostic criterion, since flat and small gallbladder and poor contraction are also of important diagnostic and differential diagnostic significance. The degree of hepatomegaly and hetreogeneous echogenicity is proportional with liver fibrosis, and able to indicate the duration of course and prognosis.
