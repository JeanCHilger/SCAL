Spleen enlargement on follow-up evaluation: a noninvasive predictor of complications of portal hypertension in cirrhosis. Splenomegaly is observed in most but not all patients with cirrhosis, and has been detected more often in patients showing complications of portal hypertension. We aimed to test the hypotheses that spleen enlarges over time in cirrhosis, and that a progressive enlargement may be associated with portal hypertension-related events.A total of 127 cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh, 6.7 +/- 1.7 range, 5-11), observed at our center and followed-up clinically, endoscopically, and with periodic abdominal ultrasound for at least 1 year, were included. Spleen diameter was recorded at each ultrasound examination. The change of spleen diameter over time was calculated. The occurrence of clinical complications of cirrhosis on follow-up evaluation was recorded.At inclusion, spleen diameter was 14.9 +/- 3.1 cm 83% of the patients had splenomegaly. Spleen was larger in patients with decompensated disease (n = 39) versus patients with compensated disease (n = 88) (16.1 +/- 3.5 vs 14.5 +/- 2.7Spleen enlargement at follow-up evaluation outlines a subgroup of cirrhotic patients at higher risk of complications of portal hypertension. Noninvasive monitoring of spleen diameter allows a prognostic stratification of cirrhotic patients.
