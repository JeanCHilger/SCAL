Successful arterial thrombolysis and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for early hepatic artery thrombosis after split liver transplantation in a four-month-old baby. Early HAT is the most frequent and severe vascular complication following liver transplantation. It is one of the major causes of graft failure and mortality. Endovascular thrombolytic treatment in patients with thrombotic complications after liver transplantation is an attractive alternative to open surgery as lower morbidity and mortality rates are reported for it. PTA following transcatheter thrombolysis has been successfully used to treat HAT in adults. To the best of our knowledge, there have not been any reports of a successful transcatheter thrombolysis using interventional radiological techniques in a patient only four months old. The present report describes the successful endovascular emergency treatment of a HAT three days after DD split liver transplantation.
