Hemodynamic features of gastrorenal shunt: a Doppler study in cirrhotic patients with gastric fundal varices. Little is known about the hemodynamics of gastrorenal shunt (GRS), a major drainage route of gastric fundal varices (FV), in patients with FV. The aim of this study was to clarify the hemodynamic features of GRS on Doppler sonography in relation to the grading and bleeding of FV.The study subjects consisted of 69 cirrhotic patients with FV. Diameter, flow velocity (FVe), and flow volume (FVo) of GRS were measured by Doppler ultrasound (US). The detection rate was compared to contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), and percutaneous transhepatic portography (PTP) was used in six patients without GRS on CECT.The use of CECT detected GRS in 60 of 69 patients, and US, 58 of 69 patients. A false-negative result for detecting GRS on both CECT and US was found in one patient after PTP. The diameter, FVe, and FVo of GRS increased according to the endoscopic grade of FV: F1 (7.2+/-1.3 mm, 9.8+/-1.1 cm/s, 358.3+/-123.4 ml/min), F2 (9.9+/-3.3 mm, 12.8+/-5.1 cm/s, 701.7+/-411.3 ml/min), and F3 (11.8+/-2.4 mm, 17.9+/-8.3 cm/s, 1706.6+/-989.5 ml/min). A significant difference was seen between F1 and F3 (diameter, P=.0022 FVe, P=.0133Hemodynamics of GRS on Doppler sonograms reflected the grading and bleeding of FV. Doppler US may be valuable as a noninvasive method to evaluate the severity of FV.
