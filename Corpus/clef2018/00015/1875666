Drug therapy of pulmonary and portal hypertension in liver cirrhosis. Detailed examination of hemodynamics in patients with portal and pulmonary hypertension was performed upon acute drug tests and course administration of nitrosorbide++, corinfar and propranolol. Ultrasound and rheography investigations were employed to elucidate the relations between portal and pulmonary hypertension in cirrhosis patients. Criteria of early diagnosis are discussed. Nitrosorbide++ produced positive effect on hepatic blood flow, corinfar improved pulmonary hemodynamics in lack of its influence on hepatic blood flow, while propranolol resulted in the drop of both portal and pulmonary hypertension, normalization of general hemodynamics.
