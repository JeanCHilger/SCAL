Validity of N-terminal propeptide of the brain natriuretic peptide in predicting left ventricular diastolic dysfunction diagnosed by tissue Doppler imaging in patients with chronic liver disease. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction has been reported in patients with liver cirrhosis. Although conventional Doppler echocardiography has been used to assess diastolic filling dynamics, this technique is limited in diagnosing left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The aim of the study was to validate the N-terminal propeptide of the brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in predicting left ventricular diastolic dysfunction diagnosed by tissue Doppler imaging in patients with chronic liver disease.In 64 patients, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was classified using tissue Doppler imaging and serum levels of NT-proBNP were measured.Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was found in 25 of 31 (80.6%) patients with severe liver fibrosis/cirrhosis versus 2 of 8 (25.0%) patients with moderate and 6 of 25 (24.0%) patients with mild liver fibrosis (P<0.001). Mean NT-proBNP levels were 407.1+/-553.4 pg/ml in patients with severe fibrosis/cirrhosis as compared with 60.8+/-54.9 pg/ml and 55.4+/-41.4 pg/ml in patients with mild and moderate fibrosis (P=0.001). NT-proBNP was most accurate in predicting advanced left ventricular diastolic dysfunction with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.0 P<0.001). A cutoff value of greater than 290 pg/ml was highly predictive of advanced left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.NT-proBNP is a useful marker in detecting advanced left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients with chronic liver disease. Patients with severe liver fibrosis/cirrhosis and NT-proBNP levels exceeding 290 pg/ml should undergo further cardiac evaluation.
