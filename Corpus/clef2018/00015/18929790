Polytetrafluoroethylene patch venoplasty for outflow reconstruction in living donor liver transplantation: two case reports. Outflow obstruction may lead to liver congestion and eventual graft failure after living donor liver transplantation. Various methods of venoplasty provide wider outflow tracts. Most series have suggested use of autologous or allogenic grafts for patch venoplasty. We used a polytetrafluorethylene patch in two patients. Both showed good patency of the outflow tract at Doppler ultrasonography at 7 months and 4 months posttransplantation. A polytetrafluoroethylene patch may be a good alternative when no other autologous or allogeneic vascular patch is available or when the situation is critical.
