Noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis: serum markers, imaging, and other modalities. Liver fibrosis is a common pathway of injury after chronic insult to the liver. The evolution of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis has many clinical implications, including bleeding, infection, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. The reference standard for diagnosing liver fibrosis is currently histologic assessment of tissue obtained through liver biopsy. Although this provides valuable information, it has limitations, including its invasiveness, sampling error, observer variability, and the use of categorical scoring systems. This article outlines the various noninvasive markers, including blood tests, imaging, and novel technologies. It examines the principles behind their development, their diagnostic accuracy, and their evolution.
