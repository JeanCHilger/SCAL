Aflatoxin exposure and viral hepatitis in the etiology of liver cirrhosis in the Gambia, West Africa. Cirrhosis of the liver is thought to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, but few controlled studies on the etiology of cirrhosis have been conducted in this region.We aimed to elucidate the association between environmental and infectious exposures and cirrhosis in The Gambia.Ninety-seven individuals were diagnosed with cirrhosis using a validated ultrasound scoring system and were compared with 397 controls. Participants reported demographic and food frequency information. Blood samples were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, HCV RNA, and the aflatoxin-associated 249(ser) TP53 mutation.HBsAg seropositivity was associated with a significant increase in risk of cirrhosis [odds ratio (OR) = 8.0 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.4-14.7] as was the presence of HBeAg (OR = 10.3Our results suggest that the spectrum of morbidity associated with aflatoxin exposure could include cirrhosis.
