Unboosted fosamprenavir is associated with low drug exposure in HIV-infected patients with mild-moderate liver impairment resulting from HCV-related cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to compare amprenavir pharmacokinetics in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-co-infected cirrhotic patients receiving non-boosted fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with HCV/HIV-co-infected non-cirrhotic subjects and HIV-mono-infected subjects receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700/100 mg twice daily. Liver stiffness at baseline and alanine aminotransferase levels at baseline and during follow-up were measured in order to find a correlation between drug levels and liver fibrosis or hepatotoxicity.Amprenavir plasma concentration was determined by HPLC. Liver stiffness was measured by transient elastometry. Liver function tests were determined every 1-3 months during follow-up.Nineteen HIV-infected patients were included. Eight had chronic HCV hepatitis (group NC), five had HCV-related liver cirrhosis (group C) and six were HIV-mono-infected (group M). In group C patients, amprenavir C(trough), AUC(0-12) and half-life were 86%/83%, 64%/55% and 58%/59% lower when compared with controls and co-infected subjects without cirrhosis, respectively conversely, drug clearance in cirrhotics was 181%/124% higher. In 3/5 cirrhotic patients (60%) and in 2/14 non-cirrhotic patients (14%), C(trough) was below the minimum target concentration of 400 ng/mLOn the basis of these data, it seems reasonable to boost fosamprenavir with ritonavir even in cirrhotic patients amprenavir pharmacokinetics could not be predicted by liver stiffness and seem not to predict hepatotoxicity at follow-up.
