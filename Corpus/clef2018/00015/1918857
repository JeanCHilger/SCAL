Massive subcapsular fibrosis of the liver: ultrasonic and computed tomographic characteristics. Massive and diffuse subcapsular fibrosis of the liver was detected in two patients with chronic liver disease. The subcapsular layer consisted of inflamed fibrous tissue containing rare portal tracts and myriads of bile ducts, indicating loss of subcapsular hepatocytes and their replacement by connective tissue. In the early evolutive phase, massive and diffuse subcapsular fibrosis of the liver appears on computed tomography (CT) scan as a low-density band, which merges with the hepatic parenchyma and is enhanced by contrast on dynamic imaging it is undetectable by ultrasonography. In the advanced phase, it is easily recognizable by ultrasonography as a perihepatic sonolucent band and by CT scan as a low-density band, which is well demarcated from the hepatic parenchyma and is not enhanced with the dynamic technique.
