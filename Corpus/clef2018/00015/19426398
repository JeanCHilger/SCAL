Validity of FibroScan values for predicting hepatic fibrosis stage in patients with chronic HCV infection. The aim of this study was to validate the FibroScan system compared with liver histology and serum markers for the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis. We also tried to determine the cut-off levels and assess the feasibility of using FibroScan values to predict the fibrosis stage.In 44 patients with HCV infection, liver stiffness was evaluated by FibroScan, serum fibrosis markers and a liver biopsy. Associations between these indices were also analyzed.FibroScan values showed a good correlation with serum levels of type IV collagen, hyaluronic acid and procollagen-III-peptide, and with the platelet count. Compared with liver histology, the FibroScan values increased proportionally with the progression of the histological fibrosis stage. Advanced fibrosis (F3 or F4) could be efficiently predicted by a FibroScan cut-off value of 15 kPa. The FibroScan sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were 100%, 73.9%, 77.8%, 100%, and 86.4%, respectively.FibroScan values gave a good correlation with various markers of fibrosis and increased proportionally with the progression of the hepatic fibrosis stage. A FibroScan value of 15 kPa was found to be a significant separation limit for differentiating advanced fibrosis stages (F3 and F4) from the milder stages (F0-F2). FibroScan values are clinically useful for predicting the fibrosis stages and helpful in managing interferon therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
