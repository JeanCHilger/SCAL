Malarial hepatopathy in falciparum malaria. To evaluate the clinical, biochemical and sonographic changes in patients with falciparum malaria and jaundice.A case series.This study was conducted at Medical Unit-I (Ward 5), Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, from January 2006 to November 2007.A total of 62 adult patients, regardless of age and gender, with peripheral blood film evidence of falciparum malaria, who had jaundice, were included. Any patient with evidence of infection with Plasmodium vivax or other causes of liver disease (e.g. viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, amoebic liver abscess, unexplained hepatomegaly, ascites, history of alcoholism, taking hepatotoxic drugs, past history of jaundice) was excluded on the basis of history, relevant clinical examination and investigations.Age of the patients ranged from 13-48 years (mean 26.04+/-8.33). All patients were febrile and icteric, with pallor in 67.7%, hepatomegaly in 30.6%, splenomegaly in 70.9% and impaired consciousness in 20%. Serum bilirubin levels ranged from 3 to 24 mg%. Thirty two (51.6%) had serum bilirubin 3-6 mg%, 20 (32.2%) had 6-10 mg% and 10 (16.1%) had >10 mg%. ALT levels ranged from 20-870 IU/L and AST levels 24-1210 IU/L respectively. INR ranged from 1-1.3. Twenty eight patients (45%) had predominantly conjugated or mixed hyperbilirubinemia and serum transaminases were more than three times normal. Ultrasonography revealed hepatomegaly with decreased echogenicity in 22 (35.4%), splenomegaly in 48 (77.4%) and both hepatomegaly and splenomegaly in 16 (25.8%). Gallbladder wall thickness was increased in 5 (8.06%) patients. There was no evidence of biliary dilatation.A significant percentage of patients having falciparum malaria with jaundice fulfill the criteria for malarial hepatopathy. It should be considered in patients presenting with acute febrile illness with jaundice so that specific treatment can be given.
