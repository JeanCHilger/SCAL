Does carbohydrate-deficient transferrin have diagnostic value in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease?. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an acquired metabolic liver disease in the consequence of triglyceride accumulation within liver cells. It is accompanied by necrobiotic inflammatory reaction, fibrosis and also by liver cirrhosis. Its distinction from alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) can be difficult. Clear anamnesis may help, but if the patient does not inform us about the alcohol consumption, the differentiation is not easy.Our aim was to determine the value of carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT) in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, as well as to analyze the background of high CDT values, according to the anamnesis.39 patients (21 female and 18 male) with ultrasound signs of fatty liver disease were studied. CDT, body mass index (BMI) and HOMA index were determined.Mean value of CDT was: 2.39+/-0.52% (in male 2.51+/-0.61, in female 2.28+/-0.4). No significant difference was found among the two sexes. The diversity of CDT values was normal. The value of BMI belonged to the overweight area without any significant difference between the two sexes.On the basis of the results, NAFLD and AFLD can be differentiated according to the CDT value, and this value could be a higher specific value than the activity of gammaglutamyl transpeptidase, however, anamnesis and other factors are as well very important in achieving the correct diagnosis.
