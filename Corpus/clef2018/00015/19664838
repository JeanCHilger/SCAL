Prevalence, characteristics and severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. The association between NAFLD and psoriasis has never been explored in prospective epidemiological studies. The aim of this 2-phase study was to study the clinical features of NAFLD in patients with psoriasis.Phase 1: Investigation of prevalence and characteristics of NAFLD in an unselected cohort of 142 adult Italian outpatients with psoriasis vulgaris. Phase 2: Comparison of the psoriasis cohort subgroup with NAFLD and an age- and body mass index-matched retrospective cohort of 125 non-psoriasis patients with biopsy proven NAFLD.Based on histories, laboratory tests, and ultrasound studies, 84 (59.2%) received clinical diagnosis of NAFLD 30 had factors potentially associated with liver disease other than NAFLD (e.g., viral hepatitis, significant ethanol, methotrexate use)NAFLD is highly prevalent among psoriasis patients, where it is closely associated with obesity (overall and abdominal), metabolic syndrome, and PsA, and more likely to cause severe liver fibrosis (compared with nonPs-NAFLD). Routine work-up for NAFLD may be warranted in patients with psoriasis, especially when potentially hepatotoxic drug therapy is being considered.
