Intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunts: radiological evaluation. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the imaging findings of intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunts (IPSVS) in asymptomatic patients.Between 2002 and 2008, we examined 8 patients with IPSVS which were found incidentally. Diagnosis was based on ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Three patients had a history of liver cirrhosis without symptoms of encephalopathy.Most IPSVS were located in the right liver lobe (7 cases) and in one case in the left liver lobe. Identification of type of shunt between portal and systemic veins was based on Park's classification. Type III shunts were found in five patients and type I in three patients.IPSVS is a rare vascular abnormality that is usually asymptomatic. Radiologists must be aware of these communications because IPSVS may be an incidental finding in imaging control for unrelated reasons.
