Hepatocellular carcinoma with cirrhosis: are patients with neoplastic main portal vein invasion eligible for percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of both the nodule and the portal venous tumor thrombus? The purpose of this study was to examine the results of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of both medium-sized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the accompanying main portal venous tumor thrombus in patients with cirrhosis.From January 2005 to January 2008, among 1,837 consecutively registered patients with HCC seen at our institution, 412 had HCC and portal venous invasion 27 of the 412 had a single HCC nodule accompanied by main portal venous tumor thrombus. Thirteen patients (10 men, three womenComplete necrosis of the HCC associated with complete recanalization of the main portal vein and its branches was achieved in 10 patients (efficacy, 77%). In the other three patients, necrosis of the HCC ranged from 70% to 90%, and recanalization of the main portal trunk was not complete. No major complications occurred. In three cases, mild to moderate ascites and increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were found. The follow-up periods ranged from 3 to 36 months among the treated patients and 2 to 10 months among the untreated patients. The cumulative survival rate was 77% 6, 12, and 36 months after procedure in the treated group and 43% and 0% 6 and 12 months after diagnosis in the untreated group (p < 0.0001). All 10 successfully treated patients were alive and the portal system was patent at the end of the follow-up period. All three untreated patients died of progressive disease within 5 months of diagnosis.Radiofrequency ablation can destroy both single intraparenchymal medium-sized HCCs and the accompanying main portal venous tumor thrombus with high efficacy and safety and a low rate of complications.
