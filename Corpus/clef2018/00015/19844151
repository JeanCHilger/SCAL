Changes in liver stiffness after acute or chronic liver injury due to viral hepatitis--does fibrosis exist after recovery from acute viral hepatitis?. Liver stiffness (LS) measurement by transient elastography can estimate the degrees of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease. However, longitudinal data of LS after recovery of acute viral hepatitis are still lacking. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate among LS of patients at various stages of viral hepatitis and normal control.Patients who had admitted at Korea University Ansan Hospital between January 2006 and January 2007 due to acute viral hepatitis and recovered were recruited (group A, n=22). We compared the liver biochemistry and LS of group A with those of healthy control group (group B, n=23), current acute viral hepatitis group (group C, n=49), and chronic viral hepatitis group (group D, n=66).Mean ALT, total bilirubin, and LS level of group A were not different from group B (p=0.318, p=0.116, p=0.125, respectively). However, group A had lower ALT, total bilirubin, and LS values compared to group C (all p<0.001), and lower ALT and LS values compared to group D (p=0.007, p<0.001). The mean total bilirubin was not significantly different from group D (p=0.117).Our data suggest that liver fibrosis is a long-term sequela of chronic hepatitis, and not developed in patients who recovered from acute viral hepatitis.
