Upper gastrointestinal endosonography in patients evaluated for liver transplantation. Endosonography (EUS), which merges endoscopic and ultrasound examinations, is a useful modality to display abnormal vessels that develop in the intrinsic circulation, frequently called "deep" varices. If these pathological veins exceed of 5 mm diameter, they significantly increase the risk of bleeding among patients with cirrhosis. In the most recent pilot study EUS proved useful to assess children for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).We performed a cross-sectional study of EUS on 33 (22 males and 11 females) adult cirrhotic subjects being assessed for OLT.We used an echoendoscope at 7.5 MHz/12 MHz/20 MHz to evaluate the esophagus and stomach, including "deep" periesophageal/perigastric varices (adjacent to the muscularis propria) and paraesophageal/paragastric varices (outside the muscularis propria). "Deep" varices were considered to be large if >5 mm.On endoscopy, 26 (79%) patients showed esophageal varices (EV), including 11 (33%) with large (>5 mm) varices. Gastric varices (GV) were observed in 13 (39%) subjects, with 3 patients displaying large (>5 mm) varices. On EUS large "deep" EV (both para and periesophageal) were observed in 12 (36%) subjects, among whom 5 (42%) did not have large varices on endoscopy. Large "deep" GV were found on EUS in 12 (36%) subjects. On endoscopy 4 of them (33%) showed no varices and 3 (25%) had small GV.EUS offers a precise evaluation of portal hypertension in OLT candidates. "Deep" potentially dangerous varices, which are undetected with routine endoscopy, were noted in a significant proportion of patients. The role of EUS in prioritizing subjects for OLT must be evaluated in a prospective study.
