Liver cirrhosis: changes of Doppler waveform of hepatic veins. The authors compared the Doppler ultrasonographic pattern of hepatic veins (HVs) in a group of 60 patients affected by liver cirrhosis and in 65 healthy subjects comparable for sex and age to (a) detect possible differences in HV waveform in the two groups and (b) investigate the relationship of these differences with the severity of the disease (according to Child-Pugh classification) and the modifications of systemic hemodynamics. The waveform of HVs was arbitrarily classified into three patterns: HV0, a normal waveform HV1, lower oscillations without the reversed phase
