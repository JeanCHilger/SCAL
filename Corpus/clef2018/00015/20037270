A case of primary hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma with spontaneous rupture. Primary hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare neoplasm of endothelial origin. The clinical manifestations are nonspecific, ranging from complete absence of symptoms to hepatic failure and death. Spontaneous rupture of a hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is an extremely rare presentation. We present a case of primary hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma in a 65-year-old male patient with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. He was hospitalized due to epigastric pain and multiple liver masses on abdominal ultrasound. Dynamic liver CT imaging revealed multiple peripheral nodular enhanced mass lesions with delayed centripetal enhancement, and the adjacent collection of high-attenuation fluid along the liver capsule. Abdominal tapping revealed blood in the peritoneal cavity. Primary hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma with spontaneous rupture was finally diagnosed based on a histopathologic examination revealing positive immunohistochemical staining for CD34.
