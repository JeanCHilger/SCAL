Prediction severity of esophageal varices: a new cutoff point for Platelet count/ spleen diameter ratio. It is currently recommended that all patients with liver cirrhosis undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) to identify those who have esophageal varices (EV) that carry a high risk of bleeding and may benefit from prophylactic measures. In the future, this social and medical burden will increase due to the greater number of patients with chronic liver disease and their improved survival. The aim of this paper was assess value of platelet count/spleen diameter ratio (PC/SD ratio) for the prediction or screening of EV in cirrhotic patients.In this two years prospective study, patients with liver cirrhosis referred to Al -Zahra hospital enrolled. Patients underwent detailed clinical examination, blood tests (hematology, liver function tests) and ultrasonography. Size of esophageal varices was assessed at UGIE Paquet's grades 0-III were classified as group A (0-IFifty consecutive cirrhotic patients (mean age+/-SD) was 52.1 (+/-16.2) 41 male and 9 female) were enrolledThe PC/SD ratio is independently associated with the presence of EV and can predict its severity in patients with cirrhosis. Use of this cost effective parameter may help identify patients with mild or no EV who may not need UGIE to reduce costs and discomfort for these patients and the burden on health system.
