Portal vein thrombosis and liver transplantation: long term. Obstruction of the portal vein may be related to constriction by malignant tumors or thrombosis associated with liver disease. We herein have reported our experience with patients undergoing liver transplantation with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) whose diagnosis was made intraoperatively. From September 1991 to May 2009, we studied 27/419 (6.4%) patients with PVT who were evaluated according to the presence of esophagogastric varices, underlying disease, malignancy, and if there was previous surgery, review of medical records on data collected prospectively. We observed 24 (88.9%) patients with PVT grade 1, 2 (7.4%) with grade 2, and 1 (3.7%) with grade 3. The average age of the PVT patients was 47.5 years the average model for End-Stage Liver Discase score was 18.3, and the predominant diagnosis, hepatitis C cirrhosis. Eighteen underwent a sclerotherapy/ligature. The sensitivity of ultrasound for grade 1 thrombosis was 39.1%
