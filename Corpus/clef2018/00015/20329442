Cryptogenic cirrhosis: a vanishing entity. The diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis (cirrhosis of unknown etiology) has dramatically decreased, following the discovery of hepatitis B virus (1965), hepatitis D virus (1977), hepatitis C virus (1989). Improving the diagnostic criteria for Autoimmune Hepatitis, by devising the scoring system and the recognition of the fact that Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis can progress to cirrhosis (in 8 to 10 years), further reduced the diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis. Establishing the etiology of cirrhosis in the vast majority of the patients has provided numerous options for its prevention and treatment.
