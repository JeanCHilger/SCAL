Clipless laparoscopic cholecystectomy using the Harmonic scalpel for cirrhotic patients: a prospective randomized study. Improved laparoscopic experiences have made laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) feasible options for cirrhotic patients. This study aimed to compare the traditional method for LC with LC using the Harmonic scalpel in terms of safety and efficacy for cirrhotic patients.In this study, group A (60 patients) underwent LC by the traditional method (TM) with clipping of both the cystic duct and artery and dissection of the gallbladder by diathermy, and group B (60 patients) had LC performed using Harmonic scalpel (HS) closure and division of both the cystic duct and artery with dissection of the gallbladder by the HS. The perioperative data were recorded.The operation with the Harmonic scalpel was performed in less time than TM (45.17 ± 10.54 vs. 69.71 ± 13.01 min p = 0.0001). The intraoperative blood loss was significantly more with TM (133 ± 131.13 l vs. 70.13 ± 80.79 mlFor cirrhotic patients, LC still is more complicated and difficult than for patients without cirrhosis. The Harmonic scalpel provides complete hemobiliary stasis and is a safe alternative to the standard clipping of the cystic duct and artery for cirrhotic patients. It offers a shorter operative duration and less blood loss.
