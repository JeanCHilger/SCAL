Unilobar tapering cirrhosis in a patient with Caroli syndrome associated with an abnormal common bile duct. Caroli syndrome is a rare condition and is composed of congenital cystic dilatation of the biliary system and congenital hepatic fibrosis. Although many associated conditions are defined and hypothesized to occur concomitantly, due to the rarity of this syndrome, none has proven to be an essential component of this syndrome. In order to investigate a patient presenting with a cholestatic clinical picture, ultrasound, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, abdominal computed tomography, liver biopsy, splenoportal venous angiography, and all available liver tests were performed. Upon typical findings, a diagnosis of Caroli syndrome was made and an orthotopic liver transplantation was performed. Investigation of the patient demonstrated multiple intracystic stones mimicking hemangiomatosis in the ultrasound severe irregularity and narrowing in the main bile duct mimicking sclerosing cholangitis in the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
