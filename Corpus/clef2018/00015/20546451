Liver stiffness decrease after effective antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C: Longitudinal study using FibroScan. The aim of the present study was to assess the changes of liver stiffness (LS) and its associated factors in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) after interferon (IFN)-based therapy.Patients with chronic HCV who had previously undergone at least 20 weeks of IFN-based therapy were enrolled. The patients' initial LS measurement was taken at the time of enrollment, and a second LS measurement was made after an interval of at least 38 weeks. LS measurement was carried out with FibroScan, and changes of LS and its associated factors were analyzed.One hundred and forty-four patients, including 95 sustained virological response (SVR) patients and 49 non-sustained virological response (NSVR) patients, were enrolled. There was a significant decrease of LS among SVR patients (median, 0.6 P < 0.001). NSVR patients showed an increase of LS (median, 0.8LS decreases in sustained responders following IFN-based therapy in patients with chronic HCV. Advanced fibrosis, higher BMI, longer time for remission and lower initial LS value are predictive factors for a slow improvement of LS in sustained responders.
