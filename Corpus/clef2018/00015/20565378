Massive pulmonary and intracardiac embolism during liver transplantation. Despite prolonged coagulation times and thrombocytopenia associated with end-stage liver disease, formation of thrombi in the circulation seems to occur more frequently during liver transplant than during any other type of major surgery. Here, we report a case of massive pulmonary and intracardiac embolism that resulted in cardiac arrest and intraoperative death. This was diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiography and occurred shortly after induction of anesthesia and initiation of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration without the concomitant use of antifibrinolytic drugs. We discuss the physiologic changes associated with cirrhosis and liver transplant, and review the literature.
