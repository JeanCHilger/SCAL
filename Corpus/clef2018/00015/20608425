Sonography of small bowel, colon and appendix in children with cystic fibrosis. To assess the utility of sonographic examination in estimation of the incidence and character of pathological changes in different parts of the intestine and other abdominal organs in children with cystic fibrosis (CF).The study group consisted of 182 children (94 girls, 88 boys), aged from 2 months up to 22 yrs, with diagnosed cystic fibrosis or its suspicion, confirmed later. The control group consisted of 20 children with mean age 8 yrs. Sonography was performed with Philips equipment: 4000 HDI and iU 22 using convex, microconvex and linear probes. 329 examinations were performed in 182 children in 2.5 years, 109 underwent second US and 38 patients were examined for the third time.In children with CF, changes in the intestines were observed in 108 patients (59.3%), in the colon in 97 patients (53.3%), and in the small intestine in 49 patients (26.9%). In the control group the wall thickness of large intestine did not surpass 1.6 mm, of small intestine--1.4 mm. In the tested group the maximum thickness of large intestine wall was 7 mm and of small intestine--4.3 mm. Layer structure of the ileum wall was found in 46 children (25%), enlarged appendix in 21 patients (11.6%). Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were observed in 84 pts (46%). Hyperaemia of the bowel wall was not observed on Power Doppler examination. In 71 patients (39%) changes in the structure of the liver were observed (cirrhosis, steatosis, enlargement) and in 114 (62.6%) there were changes in the pancreas.Sonographic examination in patients with cystic fibrosis revealed a high frequency of intestinal changes which confirms the need of including this examination in the annual follow-up of children with CF. In cases of unidentified CF, abdominal sonography leads to the diagnosis.
