The diagnostic significance of ultrasound elastometry in evaluation of fibrosis in chronic diffuse liver diseases. Determination of the diagnostic value of ultrasound elastometry of liver (UEL) in the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic diffuse liver diseases (CDLD).The study involved 316 patients with various etiologies of the CDLD, with the underwent both liver biopsy, the UEL, and evaluation of fibrosis (F) according to the Metavir classification.The maximum diagnostic accuracy of the UEL was obtained in determining of the 4-th stage of fibrosis according to the Metavir. The accuracy of the method was 91% with a sensitivity of 100%. The lowest sensitivity of the UEL determined in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): F1 - 25%, F2 - 33%, F3 and F4 - 50%. The High body mass index (BMI = 30,1 +/- 3,8 kg/m2) is a factor which is limiting the use of elastometry for patients NAFLD. The low sensitivity for F1 and F2 - 14,3% and 10%, respectively, 100% for F4, with a BMI = 24,4 +/- 5,1 kg/m2 was obtained in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). In the alcoholic liver disease (ALD) obtained high sensitivity (100%) for F2 and F4. In the CDLD of viral etiology the sensitivity of UEL was 33-71,4% in the early stages of fibrosis (F1 and F2) with high specificity - 100% and 93.5% respectively.The use of the UEL allows the diagnosis of fibrosis in chronic liver diseases of different etiologies as an alternative to needle biopsy of the liver.
