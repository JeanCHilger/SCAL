Immunological status does not influence hepatitis c virus or liver fibrosis in HIV-hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients. The possible effects on liver fibrosis and HCV viral load of the immunological status of HIV-HCV-coinfected patients are unclear. A cohort of HIV-HCV-coinfected patients was divided according to the current CD4 counts into poor (≤200/μl, n = 117) or good (≥500/μl, n = 441) immunological status. The groups were compared for diverse HCV- and fibrosis-related parameters. Fibrosis was evaluated by transient elastometry and other noninvasive indexes. Many variables were significantly associated with the immunological status in univariate analyses, including fibrosis parameters. However, in multivariate analyses current immunological status or nadir CD4 were not associated with HCV viral load (p = 0.8 and p = 0.3, respectively), liver fibrosis at the time of evaluation (p = 0.9 for both), or fibrosis progression over time (p = 0.98 and p = 0.8, respectively). The factors independently associated with significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis, as compared with minimal or no fibrosis, were alcohol abuse [OR 3.57 (95% CI 1.43-8.85), p = 0.006 OR 10.10 (3.75-27.03), p < 0.0001
