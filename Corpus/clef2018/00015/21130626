Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in a severely obese adolescent. An arguable liver biopsy. The growing epidemic of juvenile obesity has prompted pediatricians to investigate obesity-related conditions in obese teenagers. We report a clinical case of severe hepatic fibrosis in an adolescent with severe and recent obesity. Because of elevated serum aminotransferase levels, abnormal hepatic ultrasonography and insulin resistance (impaired glucose tolerance), we suspected nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Disease activity and fibrosis were confirmed on liver biopsy. Considering the risk of progression toward cirrhosis and its complications, and the pathological liver lesions, we started long-term medical monitoring and drug therapy to control weight loss. At present, although biopsy is the only validated way to establish the diagnosis of NASH, there is no consensus on its indication when NASH is suspected. Noninvasive strategies are attractive but require validation in children.
