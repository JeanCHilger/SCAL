Clinical and biological correlations of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis. The retrospective study included 126 patients with hepatic cirrhosis (HC) CHILD A class, assisted in BotoÅŸani Hospital, during 2007 and 2008. Patients were clinic, biochemical, hematological, etiological, ultrasonographic, endoscopical examined. Statistical analysis carried out with EXCEL soft and SPSS 16.0 soft, calculating chi2, p, ROC curve, SPRI and ASPRI values.We assessed the sample characteristics using the univariate analysis: age, the presence/absence of esophageal varices, SPRI score (limit value > or = 15.5), ASPRI score (limit value > or = 19.3).Non-invasive prediction cannot exclude the endoscopic exam in patients with compensated HC, caused especially by the virus C and alcohol consumption. Thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly and Fibroscan exam were the best noninvasive indicators to predict the esophageal varices.
