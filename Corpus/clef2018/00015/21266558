Noninvasive analysis of portal pressure by contrast-enhanced sonography in patients with cirrhosis. Free portal pressure measurement is a reliable method for assessment of portal pressure in patients with cirrhosis. Intrahepatic circulatory time analysis of a sonographic contrast agent can assess liver fibrosis and its severity. The purposes of this pilot study were to assess the correlation between the intrahepatic circulatory time and free portal pressure and to assess whether intrahepatic circulatory time analysis can be used to predict portal venous pressure severity.The intrahepatic circulatory time and free portal pressure were measured in 31 patients with hepatitis B virus-related liver disease. Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the correlation between the intrahepatic circulatory time and free portal pressure.The hepatic vein-hepatic artery interval times were significantly shorter in the portal hypertension group than the non-portal hypertension group (mean ± SD, 8.26 ± 1.94 and 13.83 ± 1.17 seconds, respectively P < .001). The portal vein-hepatic artery interval times were significantly longer in the portal hypertension group than the nonportal hypertension group (13.13 ± 2.25 and 7.25 ± 1.81 secondsIntrahepatic circulatory time measurement is correlated with free portal pressure and has the potential capability to evaluate portal pressure noninvasively in patients with hepatitis B virus-related liver disease.
