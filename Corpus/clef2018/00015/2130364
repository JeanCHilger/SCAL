Ultrasonography and water content of the liver in chronic diffuse liver disease. Water content in the liver in vivo was determined in 89 patients (33 with normal liver and 56 with chronic liver disease), simultaneously with ultrasonography and histopathological examination. A part of each biopsy specimen was used for this purpose. The difference between wet and dry weights was calculated from the pre- and post-lyophilization weights. According to the attenuation type of ultrasonic images, the patients were divided into two groups, viz., patients of low attenuation type (i.e. patients with type I bright liver) and those of high attenuation type (i.e. with type II bright liver). As to water content, no significant difference was observed between the two groups. No correlation was found between liver water content and histopathology either. It is concluded that knowledge of correlation between numerous parameters is needed to clarify the reason of attenuation differences.
