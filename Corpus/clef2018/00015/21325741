A case of recovery from canine destructive cholangitis in a Miniature Dachshund. A 7-year-old Miniature Dachshund presented with severe chronic jaundice and elevated liver enzymes. Destructive cholangitis was diagnosed according to histopathological findings of remarkable ductopenia with inflammatory infiltrates and fibrosis in the portal areas. Supportive therapy with prednisolone, high-dose ursodeoxycholic acid, human placental extract and antibiotics was tried, and the patient showed recovery of clinical signs 3 months after diagnosis. A second liver biopsy was performed about 1 year after initial diagnosis, and bile duct restoration was confirmed with continuous inflammation around portal areas and inside the lobules. Although we could not determine which treatment was effective in this case, destructive cholangitis in dogs may be recoverable with long-term supportive therapies.
