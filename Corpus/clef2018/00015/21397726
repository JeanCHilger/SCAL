Portal pressure predicts outcome and safety of antiviral therapy in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis C virus infection. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of antiviral therapy in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis, particularly on the impact of portal hypertension.We assessed hepatovenous pressure gradient (HVPG), liver stiffness (transient elastography), and interleukin (IL)-28B polymorphisms (rs12979860) in 90 cirrhotic patients with HCV infection (82% genotype 1 or 4) before antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Efficacy and safety were evaluated.Rates of sustained virologic response were significantly lower among patients with clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH HVPG â‰¥ 10 mm HgHVPG is an independent predictor of response to antiviral therapy, with better predictive value than liver stiffness, baseline HCV RNA levels, HCV genotype, or IL-28B polymorphism. The incidence and grade of thrombocytopenia during antiviral therapy are higher among patients with CSPH. In evaluating cirrhotic HCV patients for antiviral treatment, measurement of HVPG should be considered.
