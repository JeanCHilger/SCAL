Hepatic perfusion disorder associated with focal liver lesions: contrast-enhanced US patterns--correlation study with contrast-enhanced CT. To retrospectively compare the detection and characterization of hepatic perfusion disorder (HPD) associated with focal liver lesions (FLLs) at contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) by using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) as the reference standard.The study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee, and informed consent was waived. Three hundred fifty patients (mean age, 50 years ± 11 [standard deviation] age range, 19-82 yearsContrast-enhanced US results showed HPD features similar to those of CT imaging. CT depicted 50 HPDs in 350 patients, and contrast-enhanced US depicted 55 HPDs in 350 patients. The agreement for HPD diagnosis between US and CT was good (κ = 0.749). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of contrast-enhanced US were 84.0%, 95.7%, 76.4%, 97.3%, and 0.945, respectively. Rapid enhancement coverage (P < .001) and lesion size (P = .002) were significant predictors of the occurrence of HPD. Liver cirrhosis did not have significant influence for HPD detection (P = .087). Image zooming, limited acoustic window, lesion diameter greater than 5 cm, attenuation, and blurred images were the main reasons for the false-positive diagnosis of HPD at contrast-enhanced US.The HPD in FLLs can reliably be detected with contrast-enhanced US, which correlated well with contrast-enhanced CT images.
