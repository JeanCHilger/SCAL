Imaging diagnosis of cancer by echography. Clinical echography has been widely used for the past 10 years in the diagnosis of various neoplastic diseases. Recent advances in high bioengineering-technology brought us many fruitful results in the field of imaging diagnosis such as x-ray computed tomography, microwave-imaging, positron CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonography so on in this late century. Especially, ultrasonography has achieved many successes in the vast fields of medicine, many organs of soft-tissue nature, as non-invasive approach and the merit of no physical hazard of irradiation effect. Furthermore, it is capable of visualizing cancer lesions in the living human body. This lecture describes the present status of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of neoplastic diseases, especially laying emphasis on the diagnosis of abdominal disease and breast tumors.
