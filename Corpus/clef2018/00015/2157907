An operated case of multiple well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomatous hyperplasia. A 66-year-old male with non-A, non-B liver cirrhosis underwent an operation for a partial resection of the S8 area. Intraoperative ultrasound (US) examination of the entire liver revealed 10 space-occupying lesions (SOLs), and a biopsy of 5 out of the 10 SOLs showed 3 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), adenomatous hyperplasia (AH), and an atypical AH (AAH). In a resected specimen that including 4 SOLs that had been detected by operative US, 6 early HCCs, an HCC of the Edmondson grade I + II, and 2 AAHs were found. All tumors were less than 2 cm and were not encapsulated.
