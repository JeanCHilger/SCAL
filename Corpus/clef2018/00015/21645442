Eighty three cases of post transfusion HCV infection: a 10-year follow up. To find out clinical characteristics and natural history of post transfusion HCV infection.83 subjects who have received the blood from a same blood donor from January 1998 to July 2002 were investigated by the method combining cross-sectional study with retrospective study. HCV-antibody, HCV RNA, liver function, abdomen B-ultrasound and Fibroscan were detected.The HCV-antibody were all positive. The HCV RNA of 56 out of the 83 cases were positive. The chronicity rates of hepatis C were 76.3% (29/38) in male patients and 60.00% (27/45) in female patients respectively, without significant difference (X² = 2.99, P = 0.11). The average age of the HCV RNA positive patients was (36.54 ± 14.37) years old. The average age of the HCV RNA negative patients was (27.43 ± 12.51) years old. A significant difference (T = -2.41, P = 0.018) existed between. The HCV genotype was type1b. Among the HCV RNA positive patients,10 cases were with mild asthenia, anorexia and abdominal distention, 9 cases with increased serum ALT, 12 cases.with chronic hepatitis and 1 case was diagnosed with decompensated liver cirrhosis.The clinical manifestations of HCV infection are occult and chronic. The chronicity rate is related to gender and the age when infection was caught.
