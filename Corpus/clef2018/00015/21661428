Changes in liver stiffness measurement during antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B. The usefulness of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) for monitoring changes in fibrosis and inflammation in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients receiving antiviral therapy is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in liver stiffness and correlate them with changes in serological markers and histology in CHB patients receiving entecavir.The study included 38 patients with CHB and 24 cirrhotic patients with CHB. All patients received entecavir for over 12 months. Liver stiffness was measured by transient elastography at baseline and after 48wks of therapy. Liver biopsy was performed on 15 patients at baseline and during therapy.Among 62 treated patients, 51 (82.2%) achieved HBV DNA <50 copies/mL and 43 (69%) achieved alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization at 48wks. The median liver stiffness value at baseline was 15.1 kPa (5.6-75.0) and decreased significantly to 8.8kPa (3.0-33.8) after 48wks. A decrease in liver stiffness value during therapy correlated significantly with decreases in albumin (r=-0.357, p=0.004), bilirubin (r=0.342, p=0.007), ALT (r=0.319, p=0.012), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (r=0.353, p=0.005) concentrations. Decreases in liver stiffness values correlated significantly with improvement in necroinflammatory scores.We suggest that LSM can reflect the changes of necroinflammation in patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving antiviral therapy.
