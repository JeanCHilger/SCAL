Preoperative echocardiographic indices associated with elevated brain natriuretic peptide in liver transplant recipients. Cardiac dysfunction may be present in patients with liver cirrhosis. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration is a widely used biomarker for heart failure. We evaluated whether elevated BNP reflects cardiac dysfunction, as assessed by preoperative echocardiography, in liver transplant recipients.We assessed 122 liver transplant recipients (94 males, 28 females age, 50 ± 8 years). All underwent preoperative echocardiography, including measurements of heart chamber size, mass, ejection fraction, systolic pressure gradient between right ventricle and right atrium (PGsys [RV - RA]), mitral inflow velocities including early (E) and late (A) transmitral flow velocities, E/A, and deceleration time of E. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) was also performed to evaluate systolic (S'), early diastolic (E'), and late diastolic (A') myocardial velocities, E'/A', EAS index: E'/(A' × S'), and E/E'. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine echocardiographic indices for predicting BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL.Of 122 recipients, 87 (71%) had BNP < 100 pg/mL (median, 32.0 pg/mL interquartile range [IQR], 18.0-50.0), and 35 (29%) had BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL (median, 163.0 pg/mLPGsys (RV - RA) is an echocardiographic index independently associated with BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL, suggesting that elevated BNP in patients with end-stage liver disease may reflect increased pulmonary arterial pressure, rather than systolic and diastolic dysfunction assessed by TDI.
