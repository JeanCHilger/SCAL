A case of hepatic angiosarcoma detected as a small lesion. A 72-year-old man visited for imaging examination of alcoholic cirrhosis in April 2007. Enhanced CT images were revealed a 7 mm early enhanced lesion in segment 6 of the liver. The lesion was increased gradually to 40 mm on MRI images 21 months later. We performed ultrasound liver biopsy 3 times. Histology showed angiosarcoma with high-grade atypia and it was positive for CD31, CD34 and factor VIII-related antigen. The doubling time of this tumor was 42-108 days. Although we performed transarterial chemoembolization and interleukin-2 therapy, the patient died 34 months after the initial detection of tumor. We observed the clinical course with periodic imaging examination from the early stage of hepatic angiosarcoma and obtained a pathologic diagnosis by liver biopsy.
