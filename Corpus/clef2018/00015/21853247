Markers of uremia and pericardial effusion in peritoneal dialysis. Inadequate dialysis causes accumulation of toxic residues that may lead to the development of dialysis-associated pericardial effusion, but several other factors could be associated with this abnormality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical risk factors to asymptomatic pericardial effusion in peritoneal dialysis.This cross-sectional study included 34 patients aged ≥ 18 years on peritoneal dialysis for at least 3 months, who showed no symptomatic pericardial effusion, hepatic cirrhosis, neoplasias, lupus or amputations, none in minoxidil use. Asymptomatic pericardial effusion was diagnosed by echocardiography. Risk factors were evaluated by logistic regression and Roc curve. Significance level was set at P < 0.05.Patient age was 51 ± 15.9 years. Of the 34 patients enrolled, 16 were men and 11 diabetic. Five of them presented pericardial effusion. Logistic regression identifies low hemoglobin level (RR 0.454 CI 95%: 0.225-0.913 P = 0.027), low phase angle (RR 0.236 CI 95%: 0.057-0.984These findings corroborate the hypothesis that uremia plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of dialysis-associated pericardial effusion.
