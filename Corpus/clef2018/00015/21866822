Shear wave elastography: possibilities of the differential diagnosis of focal and diffuse changes in various organs and tissues. Ultrasound study (USS) using a shear wave elastography procedure was made in different groups of patients with morphologically verified focal and diffuse abnormalities of both superficial organs and structures and viscera. The qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the stiffness of normal and pathologic organs and tissues were estimated there was a significance importance of differences in benign and malignant lesions. The magnitude of fibrous changes in the hepatic parenchyma was first estimated by a USS technique
