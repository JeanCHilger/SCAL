Computed tomography in the diagnosis of diffuse diseases of the liver. Methods of CT, echotomography and scintigraphy of the liver were used to investigate 95 patients with diffuse liver diseases (fatty dystrophy, hepatitis, cirrhosis, hemosiderosis and amyloidosis). CT changes in these diseases were described. A high efficacy of CT was established in the detection of diffuse liver lesions and portal hypertension permitting one to give up in some cases invasive puncture biopsy of the organ.
