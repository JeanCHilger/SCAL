Heterogeneity of microbubble accumulation: a novel approach to discriminate between well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas and regenerative nodules. This prospective study aimed to elucidate the possibility of differentiating well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (wHCC) from regenerative nodule (RN) on the basis of the heterogeneity of microbubble accumulation. Intensity analysis was conducted on early-phase and late-phase (60 s and 900 s post-injection perflubutane microbubble) harmonic sonograms in 33 focal hepatic lesions (â‰¤ 15 mm
