Hepatic perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa): dynamic CT, MRI, ultrasonography, and pathologic features--analysis of 7 cases and review of the literature. To evaluate the dynamic CT, MRI, ultrasonography, and pathologic features of hepatic perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa), improving the understanding and diagnosis of the tumor.A retrospective analysis of CT, MRI, ultrasonography, and pathologic features of 7 hepatic PEComas diagnosed by pathology during 1st January 2005 to 1st September 2011 in our hospital.The performance of dynamic CT, MRI, and ultrasonography revealed that lesions were regular masses with well-defined borders, the maximum diameters were 2.5-8.5 cm (mean = 4 cm), density was homogeneous, contrast-enhanced CT and MRI showed the lesions were significantly and heterogeneously enhanced on arterial phase, less enhanced on portal venous phase, and slightly hypodense on delayed phase. One patient had multiple hepatic lesions and had delayed enhancement. There were no backgrounds of hepatitis and cirrhosis, enlarged lymph nodes, or distant metastases. Pathology showed the gross appearance of the tumor was smooth. Tumor cells were round or polygonal, with clear boundaries and clear membranes, and had abundant translucent cytoplasm. Nuclei were round, with medium size. Tumor cells were epithelial-like cells and arranged in dense sheets. Immunohistochemistry showed that most of them were positive in HMB45 and MelanA, S-100, SMA, while negative in CgA, Syn, CK, CD117, CD10, and CD34.Dynamic CT, MRI, ultrasonography, and pathology of PEComa had some characteristics of benign tumor's performance. Enhanced scan showed PEComa quickly enhanced on arterial phase and enhanced less on portal venous phase. Knowing these characteristics could help to improve the understanding and diagnosis of hepatic PEComa.
