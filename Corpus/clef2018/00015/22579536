Intra- and interoperator reproducibility of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography--preliminary results. Our study assessed acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) reproducibility and the factors influencing it. The intra- and interoperator reproducibility were studied in 33 and 58 patients, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess ARFI reproducibility. The overall intraoperator agreement was better than the interoperator one: ICC 0.90 vs. ICC 0.81. The correlation of repeated ARFI measurements was higher, but not significantly so, in cases in which intraoperator reproducibility was assessed compared with the ones in which interoperator reproducibility was studied: r = 0.848 vs. r = 0.694 (p = 0.08). For both intra- and interoperator reproducibility, the ICCs were smaller in women vs. men (0.88 vs. 0.91 and 0.67 vs. 0.86, respectively), in patients with high body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m² vs. <25 kg/m² (0.88 vs. 0.91 and 0.79 vs. 0.82, respectively), in patients with ascites vs. no ascites (0.80 vs. 0.93 and 0.78 vs. 0.84, respectively) and in noncirrhotic vs. cirrhotic patients (0.77 vs. 0.82 and 0.70 vs. 0.83, respectively).
