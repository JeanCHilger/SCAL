Hepatic elastography for the assessment of liver fibrosis--present and future. Liver Biopsy was considered the "gold standard" for severity assessment in chronic hepatitis for a very long time. In recent years, non invasive methods were developed in order to replace it. Among them ultrasound based elastographic methods: Transient Elastography (already validated and replacing liver biopsy in some countries), Real Time Tissue Elastography and Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Elastography (currently under evaluation) and Shear Wave Elastography (the newest one). As an alternative to liver biopsy, the development of all these non invasive methods for dynamic evaluation of liver fibrosis will decrease the need for LB, making clinical care safer and more convenient for patients with liver diseases.
