Liver stiffness measurement using XL probe in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography is a noninvasive test of liver fibrosis, but cannot be performed in a significant proportion of obese patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the new XL probe in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Liver biopsy and paired LSM by both the original M probe and XL probe were performed on 193 consecutive NAFLD patients in France and Hong Kong.Compared with M probe, XL probe was more likely to achieve 10 valid measurements (95% vs. 81% P<0.001) and a success rate of over 60% (90% vs. 74%LSM by XL probe can be performed successfully in most NAFLD patients, but obesity is associated with less accurate and reliable measurements.
