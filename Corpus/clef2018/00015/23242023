Biliary cast syndrome in non-liver surgery patients. Biliary cast describes the presence of casts within the biliary tree. It is resultant sequel of cholangitis and hepatocyte damage secondary to bile stasis and bile duct injury. Biliary cast syndrome was first reported in patient undergone liver transplantation. The pathogenesis of biliary cast is not clearly identified, but proposed etiologic factors include post-transplant bile duct damage, ischemia, biliary infection, or post-operative biliary drainage tube. Although biliary casts are uncommon, most of biliary cast syndrome are reported in the liver transplant or hepatic surgery patients. A few reports have been published about non-transplant or non-liver surgery biliary cast. We report two cases of biliary cast syndrome in non-liver surgery patients.
