Predictors of liver fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The role of metabolic syndrome, insulin-resistance and inflammation. NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) reaches an high prevalence in the general population, and it is closely related to metabolic syndrome (MetS). The entity of metabolic abnormalities and the chronic inflammation seem to play a main role in the development of liver fibrosis. The aim of our study is to determine whether subjects with NAFLD and MetS have higher liver fibrosis degree when compared with NAFLD subjects without MetS, and to investigate the relations between fibrosis, MetS and its single components and inflammation.We considered 24 patients with NAFLD. Those who had viral- and alcohol- related liver disease were excluded. MetS was diagnosed according to NCEP ATP III criteria inflammatory status was determined through C-reactive protein (PCR) assay. The peripheral insulin-resistance was assessed by calculating HOMA ir. Liver fibrosis was measured by transient elastography (Fibroscan®).Subjects with MetS had higher HOMA ir, PCR and Fibroscan® score (log value: 0.92±0.24 KPa vs 0.73±0.2 KPa p=0.047). The linear correlation analysis showed that Fibroscan® score was related to MetS, number of MetS components, waist circumference, HOMA ir and PCR. However the multivariate regression analysis showed that only HOMA ir (B=0.077MetS is associated to higher liver fibrosis degree in subjects with NAFLD. The insulin-resistance and inflammation seem to be the main determinants.
