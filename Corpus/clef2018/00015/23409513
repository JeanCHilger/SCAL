Association between high D-dimer plasma levels and ascites in patients with liver cirrhosis. The aim of the study was to investigate plasma D-dimer concentration in patients with liver cirrhosis with and without ascites and to evaluate the impact of ascites depletion on circulating plasma D-dimer levels.Sixty patients with liver cirrhosis were recruited and categorized into two groups: cirrhotic patients without ascites in group 1 (n = 30) and patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites in group 2 (n = 30). D-dimer levels were measured on day of admission, in patients with ascites D-dimer concentration levels were repeated measured after ascites resolution cofirmed by ultrasonography.Mean D-dimer levels showed significant increase in cirrhotic patients decompensated by ascites (626.0 +/- 231.08 microg/L) when compared with healthy controls (140.73 +/- 49.16 microg/L, p < 0.001). There was also a statistically significant increase of mean D-dimer levels in patients with liver cirrhosis and no evidence of ascites (333.4 +/- 109.05 microg/L, p < 0.001). In all patients after ascites resolution D-dimer levels showed significant reduction (437.66 +/- 130.47 microg/L, p < 0.05). Values of D-dimer levels achieved after abdominal paracenthesis (n = 21) where still higher than those in patients without ascites (480.14 +/- 122.85 microg/L, p = 0.001). In cirrhotic patients treated with diuretic therapy (n = 9) circulating D-dimer levels were not significantly different from those in cirrhotic patients without ascites (338.56 +/- 90.55 microg/L, p = 0.96).The presence of ascites in patients with liver cirrhosis is associated with increased plasmatic fibrinolytic activity. Less aggressive ascites resolution therapy has an greater impact on reducing plasmatic fibrinolytic activity than achieved by abdominal paracenthesis.
