Comparison of magnetic resonance elastography and gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for the evaluation of hepatic fibrosis. The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the staging of hepatic fibrosis (HF) in patients with liver diseases.This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board, and the informed consent was waived. One hundred and sixty-eight patients with chronic liver disease or suspected focal hepatic lesions underwent MRE and gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI at 1.5 T. Liver stiffness values were measured on quantitative shear-stiffness maps. The contrast enhancement index (CEI) was calculated as SIpost / SIpre, where SIpost and SIpre are, respectively, the liver-to-muscle signal intensity (SI) ratio on hepatobiliary phase images and on unenhanced images. The diagnostic performance of MRE and CEI for staging HF was compared using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis on the basis of the histopathologic analysis of HF.The liver stiffness values measured on MRE (r = 0.802 P < 0.0001) were more strongly correlated with the HF stage than with the CEI (r = -0.378Magnetic resonance elastography was superior to the gadoxetate disodium-enhancement MRI for HF staging.
