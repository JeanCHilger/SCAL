Thigh emphysema as a first sign of abdominal disease. Thigh infection is a rare complication of intra-abdominal sepsis that can present with emphysema. We report a case of infection in the thigh resulting from colonic perforation. A 61-year-old woman with cirrhosis, grade Child B6 and diabetes treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs was referred to the emergency department because of a persistent pain in her left thigh and also for some abdominal discomforts during the preceding few days. Ultrasonography identified the presence of gas and fluid in the thigh. The patient received fluids and antibiotics but on the day after she reported an increase in pain. For this reason the patient was submitted to a CT scan that showed a thigh emphysema due to intestinal perforation. The patient was submitted to laparotomy. A Hartmann's procedure was performed, with resection of about 15 cm of affected sigmoid colon. The left thigh wound did not require any treatment.
