FibroScan can be used to diagnose the size of oesophageal varices in patients with HBV-related cirrhosis. To study ability of FibroScan (FS) in diagnosing the size of oesophageal varices (OV) in patients with HBV-related cirrhosis.A total of 158 patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis were enrolled in the study. The relation between the presence of OV assessed by endoscopy, and liver stiffness measurement by Fibroscan was studied, and ROC curves were drawn to assess the diagnostic ability of FS value.For the patients without OV, mild OV, moderate OV, and severe OV, their corresponding FS values were (21.7 +/- 9.9) kPa, (32.1 +/- 13.6) kPa, (42.3 +/- 20.0) kPa and (54.5 +/- 16.2) kPa, respectively. Significant difference was found among the groups (P < 0.001) and also between any two groups (P < 0.05). ROC curve for the diagnosis of with vs. without OV, <moderate vs. > moderate OV, and < severe vs. severe OV were 0.798 (95% CI: 73.1%-86.5%), 0.823 (95% CI: 74.5%-90.0%) and 0.879 (95% CI: 80.8%-95.0%), respectively, with corresponding FS cut-off value of 23.3 kPa, 31.5 kPa and 34.6 kPa.Liver stiffness measurement allows to predict the sizes of oesophageal varices in patients with HBV-related cirrhosis.
