Ultrasound evaluation of liver fibrosis: preliminary experience with acoustic structure quantification (ASQ) software. The aim of our study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of acoustic structure quantification (ASQ) ultrasound software in estimating the degree of hepatic fibrosis compared to Fibroscan and liver biopsy.Seventy-seven patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C underwent standard ultrasound examination, ASQ, Fibroscan and liver biopsy. ASQ analysis was conducted by placing a single region of interest (ROI) on each image captured, and calculating mode, average and standard deviation. The sonographic technique was developed through a preliminary evaluation of 20 healthy volunteers.The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for the diagnosis of cirrhosis (F≥4) with ASQ was 0.77, whereas for the diagnosis of any degree of fibrosis (F≥1) it was 0.71. The AUROC for the diagnosis of cirrhosis (F≥4) with Fibroscan was 0.98, while for the diagnosis of any degree of fibrosis (F≥1) it was 0.94. The difference between the AUROC was statistically significant (p<0.05).ASQ is a promising new ultrasound software programme which offers encouraging results in the diagnosis of both liver cirrhosis (F=4) and fibrosis (F≥1). However, to date it has not attained the same level of diagnostic performance as Fibroscan.
