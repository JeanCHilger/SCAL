The usefulness of transient elastography, acoustic-radiation-force impulse elastography, and real-time elastography for the evaluation of liver fibrosis. Several noninvasive methods have recently been developed for the evaluation of liver fibrosis. The accuracy of transient elastography (TE), acoustic-radiation-force impulse (ARFI) elastography, and real-time elastography (RTE) in predicting liver fibrosis were evaluated.Seventy-four patients who had undergone a liver biopsy within the previous 6 months were submitted to evaluation with TE, ARFI, and RTE on the same day.THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN FIBROSIS STAGE AND LIVER STIFFNESS MEASUREMENT (LSM) USING THE THREE TESTED METHODS: TE, r(2)=0.272, P=0.0002 ARFI, r(2)=0.225, P=0.0017TE and ARFI may be better methods for predicting significant liver fibrosis than RTE. This predictive ability increased significantly when accounting for platelet count. However, all of the measures had comparable efficacies for predicting cirrhosis.
