Hybrid treatment of a case of obliterative hepatocavopathy (Budd-Chiari syndrome). Progressive obliteration of the intrahepatic course of a inferior vena cava is an insidious disease that may lead to portal hypertension with progressive liver engorgement and ultimately to liver cirrhosis. Early diagnosis is extremely important so that therapeutic modalities can be offered that can favorably change the natural course of the disease. We present the case of a young woman whose obliterated vena cava could be successfully recanalized by a combined surgical and interventional technique.
