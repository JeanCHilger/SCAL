Value of liver biopsy in internal medicine. Apropos of a series of 300 puncture biopsies. Between April 1976 and March 1987, in an Internal Medicine department some 300 unguided percutaneous liver biopsies were performed, using the Tru-Cut excision needle. The procedure contributed to the diagnosis in 76.2% of the cases. In alcoholism-related pathology with its specific lesions, liver biopsy is particularly useful in diagnosing incipient fatty degeneration and hepatitis and helps in the prognosis of cirrhosis. In chronic hepatitis, it asserts the diagnosis and provides aetiological and prognostic data. The finding of granulomas at histology sometimes clinches a hitherto undecided diagnosis : sarcoidosis or tuberculosis? The diagnosis of drug-induced hepatitis rests on convergent clinical, biochemical and histological elements. In blood diseases, liver biopsy is of interest on three scores: it shows whether or not the liver is involved, detects intercurrent complications and evaluates the extent of the lesions before treatment. When performed after ultrasonography, it enables intrahepatic cholestasis to be recognized and extrahepatic cholestasis, unidentified by ultrasounds, to be suspected. In primary biliary cirrhosis, it confirms the diagnosis and informs on the severity and progressiveness of the disease. In hepatic cancers, liver biopsy has recently been superseded by computerized tomography and ultrasonography. Finally, it largely contributes to the diagnosis of overload disease and evaluates their activity and their impact on the liver.
