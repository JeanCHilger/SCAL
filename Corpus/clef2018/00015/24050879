Diagnostic value of real-time elastography in the assessment of hepatic fibrosis in patients with liver iron overload. The objective of our prospective monocentric work was to determine the diagnostic value of real-time elastography (RTE) in the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with iron overload, using transient elastography (TE) as reference standard.Sixty-seven consecutive patients with MRI detectable iron overload (T2*<6.3 ms) were enrolled. TE and RTE were performed on the same day as MRI. Elastograms were acquired by an experienced operator and analyzed by calculating the elastic ratio between perihepatic soft tissues and liver parenchyma. An elliptical ROI of 1cm(2) (Z1) was positioned in the liver parenchyma and a smaller elliptical ROI of 2mm(2) (Z2) was positioned in a homogeneously soft (red) region of the diaphragm, which was considered as internal control to calculate the elastic ratio Z2/Z1.Seven patients were excluded because of invalid TE or RTE examinations. The remaining 60 patients were 57% males and 43% females (mean age: 42 [21-76] years), including 37 homozygous-β-thalassemics, 13 patients with β-thalassemia intermedia, 6 with primary hemochromatosis, and 4 with myelodysplastic syndrome. Increasing elastic ratios were significantly correlated with increasing TE values (r=0.645, 95% CI 0.468-0.772, P<0.0001). The mean elastic ratios for each METAVIR group were as follows: F0/1 = 1.9 ± 0.4 F2 = 2.2 ± 0.4In patients with MRI-detectable liver iron-overload RTE allows to discriminate between F0/1-F2 and F3-F4 with a reasonable diagnostic accuracy.
