Portal venous velocity in biliary atresia. From December 1986 to April 1989, 38 patients with biliary atresia (eight newly diagnosed) were evaluated with doppler ultrasound of the portal venous system. Peak and mean velocities were computer derived from the spectral waveform. Good velocity was greater than 15 cm/s, intermediate velocity was 8 to 14 cm/s, abnormal velocity was less than 7 cm/s or hepatofugal. Patients were grouped according to clinical status: group 1 (n = 14), normal liver function group 2 (n = 15), recurrent cholangitis
