Use of magnetic resonance elastography to assess hepatic fibrosis in children with chronic liver disease. Management of pediatric chronic liver disease is limited by lack of validated noninvasive biomarkers of histologic severity. We demonstrate that magnetic resonance elastography is feasible and accurate in detecting significant hepatic fibrosis in a case series of 35 children with chronic liver disease, including severely obese children.
