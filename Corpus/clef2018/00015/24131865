Characterization of CD4⁺ T-cell immune activation and interleukin 10 levels among HIV, hepatitis C virus, and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients have accelerated liver disease compared with HCV monoinfection. In HIV-positive patients with viral suppression, data comparing inflammatory cytokines and immune activation between HIV/HCV coinfection with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) to HIV/HCV-seropositive patients with cleared HCV are limited.Fifty-nine age- and sex-matched patients were stratified: (1) HIV monoinfection (n = 15) (2) HCV monoinfection with CHC (n = 15)CD38⁺HLA-DR⁺ expression on CD4⁺ T cells was significantly increased in HIV/HCV coinfection with CHC (7%) versus HCV monoinfection (4%) (P = 0.012). CD4⁺ total HLA-DR⁺ expression was significantly increased in HIV/HCV coinfection with CHC (43%) versus HIV monoinfection (31%) (P = 0.010) and HIV/HCV seropositive with cleared HCV (38%) (P = 0.046). Total CD4⁺CD38⁺ and CD4⁺CD38⁺HLA-DR⁻ expression was significantly higher in HIV monoinfection (23% and 18%) than HCV moninfection (13%, P = 0.002% and 9%, P = 0.001, respectively). Interleukin 10 levels were significantly lower in HIV monoinfection versus HIV/HCV coinfection with CHC (P = 0.0002). In multivariate analysis, severe fibrosis was associated with lower expression of CD4⁺CD38⁺HLA-DR⁺ and CD4⁺ total CD38⁺ than mild-moderate fibrosis (P = 0.03 and 0.03, respectively).CD4 immune activation with HLA-DR⁺ expression in HIV/HCV coinfection with well-controlled HIV may arise from chronic HCV viremia. Conversely, CD4⁺CD38⁺ expression may be driven by underlying HIV infection. CD4 immune activation was unexpectedly found to be associated with decreased liver fibrosis.
