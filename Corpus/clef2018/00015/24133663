Elevated red cell distribution width is associated with advanced fibrosis in NAFLD. The red-blood-cell distribution width (RDW) is a newly recognized risk marker in patients with cardiovascular disease, but its role in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has not been well defined. The aim of the present study was to determine the association between RDW values and the level of fibrosis in NAFLD according to BARD and FIB-4 scores.This study included 24,547 subjects who had been diagnosed with NAFLD based on abdominal ultrasonography and questionnaires about alcohol consumption. The degree of liver fibrosis was determined according to BARD and FIB-4 scores. The association between RDW values and the degree of fibrosis in NAFLD was analyzed retrospectively.After adjusting for age, hemoglobin level, mean corpuscular volume, history of hypertension, history of diabetes, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, the RDW values were 12.61±0.41% (mean±SD), 12.70±0.70%, 12.77±0.62%, 12.87±0.82%, and 13.25±0.90% for those with BARD scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, and 12.71±0.72%, 12.79±0.66%, and 13.23±1.52% for those with FIB-4 scores of <1.30, 1.31-2.66, and ≥2.67, respectively (P<0.05). The prevalence of advanced fibrosis (BARD score of 24 and FIB-4 score of ≥1.3) increased with the RDW [BARD score: 51.1% in quartile 1 (Q1) vs. 63.6% in Q4 FIB-4 score: 6.9% in Q1 vs. 10.5% in Q4Elevated RDW is independently associated with advanced fibrosis in NAFLD.
