Longitudinal change of liver stiffness by transient elestography in chronic hepatitis B patients treated with nucleos(t)ide analogue. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography is a non-invasive method to assess liver fibrosis. Decline in LSM value has been reported after antiviral treatment (AVT) using nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, however, factors associated with changes in LSM during AVT remains unclear.A total of 76 CHB patients who received AVT with NUCs and had serial LSM (median duration: 16 months, range: 12 to 35 months) during AVT were analyzed. Complete virological response (CVR) was defined when hepatitis B virus DNA level was undetectable by real-time PCR assay (< 50 copies/mL).LSM value had significantly decreased after AVT with NUCs [median (quartile): 6.5 (4.7-9.2) to 5.3 (3.9-6.7), P<0.001]. The median change of LSM value/year was -0.8 (range: -9.5∼4.9). The annual change of LSM value was associated with baseline total bilirubin levels, HBeAg status and achievement of CVR during follow-up in univariable analysis, and achievement of CVR during follow-up was an only independent factor associated with the annual change of LSM value [beta coefficients (95% confidence interval)=-0.29 (-2.81∼-0.26), P=0.02]. The annual LSM change was significantly different between those who achieved and did not achieve CVR (median change: -1.08/year vs. 0.26/year, P<0.01), and more patients with CVR had decrease in LSM value (89% (47/53) vs. 35% (8/23), P<0.01).A significant decrease in LSM value was observed in CHB patients after AVT with NUCs. Achievement of CVR was significant factor associated with change in LSM value. Achieving CVR might be a key to decrease LSM value during AVT with NUCs.
