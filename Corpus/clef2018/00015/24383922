Feasibility and reproducibility of spleen transient elastography and its role in combination with liver transient elastography for predicting the severity of chronic viral hepatitis. Liver transient elastography (L-TE) is a reliable, noninvasive predictor of disease severity in chronic liver disease of viral aetiology (CLD). Owing to the relationships among severity of CLD, portal hypertension and spleen involvement, the assessment of splenic stiffness (S-TE) may have an added value in staging CLD. Of 132 CLD patients of viral aetiology, 48 with myeloproliferative disorders (MD) and 64 healthy volunteers (HV), were concurrently investigated by both L-TE and S-TE. Liver disease severity was staged by liver biopsy (LB Metavir) taken concurrently with TE examination and upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy for gastro-oesophageal varices. The S-TE inter-observer agreement was analysed by an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)
