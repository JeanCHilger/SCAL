Evaluation of liver fibrosis and hepatic venous pressure gradient with MR elastography in a novel swine model of cirrhosis. To assess the correlation among MR elastography (MRE) measured liver stiffness (LS), liver fibrosis, and hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) in a swine model of cirrhosis.Three swine served as controls, and liver fibrosis was induced in eight swine by transarterial embolization. LS and HVPG were obtained at baseline and 4 weeks (prenecropsy) following induction of liver fibrosis.Four weeks following the induction of liver cirrhosis, experimental animals developed an increase in HVPG of 8.0±6.4 mmHg compared with 0.3±1.2 mmHg for controls (P=0.08). Over the same timeframe, mean MRE-measured LS increased 0.82±0.39 kPa for experimental swine and 0.1±0.05 kPa for controls (P=0.01). A positive correlation was observed between increases in HVPG and LS (ρ=0.682 P=0.02). Liver fibrosis was measured on explanted livers at 4 weeks and yielded mean fibrosis scores of 2.8 for experimental animals and 0 for controls (P=0.0016). A positive correlation was observed between higher LS and liver fibrosis (ρ=0.884MRE is a reliable noninvasive technique to measure LS in a swine model of cirrhosis. Significant positive correlations were observed between LS and HVPG as well as LS and fibrosis.
