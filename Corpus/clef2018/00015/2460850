Is the focal echographic lesion of the liver in patients with cirrhosis always correlated with hepatocellular carcinoma? 217 cases. The value of ultrasonography and serum alpha foetoprotein assay in the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma was evaluated in a retrospective study of 217 patients, (135 men and 82 women mean age 58 years) who had been hospitalized for 18 months. Cirrhosis was of alcoholic origin in 76 per cent of the cases and complicated by ascites in 54 per cent. Twenty-four patients (11 per cent) had hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed at ultrasonography in 20 cases. The carcinoma was diffuse in 7 cases, focal in 13 cases and less than 3 cm in diameter in 3 cases. A second ultrasonography diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma in 4 cases. In 25/217 patients (11.5 per cent) the focal lesion seen at sonography was obviously not a carcinoma. Among the 207 patients who had a serum alpha foetoprotein assay, the result was normal in 167 (81 per cent) and 4 of these had a carcinoma. Among the 40 patients with an abnormal level of alpha foetoprotein, 19 had a carcinoma. This study confirms the good sensitivity of ultrasonography in the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma, but it also shows its low specificity, especially in cases with focal lesions. Ultrasonography and serum alpha foetoprotein assay should be used to detect hepatocellular carcinomas in cirrhotic patients who may benefit from surgical treatment. In the other patients, ultrasonically-guided biopsy should provide a firm diagnosis of carcinoma before undertaking other treatments, such as chemoembolization.
