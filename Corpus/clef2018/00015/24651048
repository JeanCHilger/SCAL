Successful management of splenic artery steal syndrome with hepatic artery stenosis in an orthotopic liver transplant recipient. Splenic artery steal syndrome is an uncommon but serious complication of orthotopic liver transplantation. We report a case of splenic artery steal syndrome with hepatic artery stenosis in a 65-year-old male liver transplant recipient who was successfully managed by hepatic artery stenting and splenic artery embolization in a single procedure.A 65-year-old man underwent orthotopic liver transplantation due to alcoholic cirrhosis using a piggyback technique. Relevant parameters were measured. The splenic blood flow was apparently reduced and arterial perfusion of the graft was restored. The patient was still in good condition after 4 months of follow-up.The success of this strategy indicates that the patency of the hepatic artery should be maintained and the splenic artery should be embolized to assure sufficient blood supply of the graft.
