Primary lymphoma of the gallbladder accompanied by cirrhosis: CT and MRI findings. A 60-year-old patient with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis B was admitted to the hospital for routine controls. An ultrasonographic examination demonstrated a soft tissue mass originating from the gallbladder. A CT scan and after 3 months a dynamic liver MRI were performed for the possible diagnosis. Based on these imaging studies, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. The histopathological examination diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
