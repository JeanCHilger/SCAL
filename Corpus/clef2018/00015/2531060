Monoclonal antibodies in cirrhotic cancer. In five out of nine cases of cancer in cirrhotic livers protein electrophoresis demonstrated the presence of a monoclone. This finding is compared with thirty cases of liver cirrhosis in which paraproteinemia was not found. The authors come to the conclusion that the appearance of a monoclone in a cirrhotic patient must raise the suspicion of cancer in the cirrhotic liver.
