Hepatocellular carcinoma treated with a curative segmentectomy five years after complete remission of acute myeloblastic leukemia. Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) was diagnosed in a 54-year-old male who had been known to carry a chronic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) from June, 1983. Prompt remission was achieved with combination chemotherapy of BHAC-DMP. Follow-up maintenance and an intensification of this chemotherapy had been given for five years. He was readmitted to our hospital in March, 1988 because a mass was detected in the right lobe of the liver by ultrasonography. His serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level was found to be 180.1 ng/ml, and was diagnosed as having a hepatocellular carcinoma though there was no evidence of liver cirrhosis. A curative right hepatectomy was performed in May, 1988 after transcatheter arterial embolization and portal embolization. After resection of the tumor, the AFP level decreased to 10.7 ng/ml and no HbsAg was detected in the serum.
