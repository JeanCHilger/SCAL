Observation of oral glucose-insulin releasing test in liver cirrhosis. In order to investigate the disorders of carbohydrate metabolism and insulin secretion as well as their correlation in patients with liver cirrhosis, we performed an oral glucose tolerance test on 30 patients with liver cirrhosis proven by history, clinical findings, liver function test, radioisotope liver scanning, ultrasonic examination, gastroscopy, barium esophagogram and liver biopsy, compared with 20 healthy controls. Blood glucose and immunoreactive insulin were determined in both groups at 60 min intervals for 180 min. Results showed marked glucose intolerance with peak value 60 min after glucose load in cirrhotic patients with normal fasting blood glucose. Plasma IRI levels were significantly higher in cirrhotic patients than in normal subjects after glucose load (P less than 0.05), especially 180 min after (P less than 0.01). Twelve of 30 cases (40%) showed an abnormal OGTT curve. Of the 12 cases seven (23.3%) showed a diabetic OGTT curve, five (16.7%) an impaired OGTT curve. While eighteen of 30 cases (60%) showed an abnormal OGIRT curve. Among the 18 cases one (3.3%) presented hypersecretic OGIRT curve, twelve (40.0%) with delayed and prolonged peak, and five (16.7%) with hypersecretic OGIRT curve and delayed, prolonged peak.
