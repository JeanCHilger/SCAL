Thrombosis in particular organ veins. Renal vein thrombosis in early infancy is a complication of dehydration and prolonged hypotension. The onset is usually acute and the most common clinical signs are uni- or bilateral frank masses, hematuria, proteinuria and thrombocytopenia. In most cases, with conservative management, the late outcome is favorable. In the adult, renal vein thrombosis is often a silent complication of the nephrotic syndrome, the hypercoagulability of which may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of the thrombosis. Clinically, the presentation of a sudden complete occlusion is that of severe abdominal and lumbar pain with hematuria and loss of function of the kidney that suffers hemorrhagic infarction. Physical examination often reveals an enlarged kidney. With gradual occlusion, renal function is preserved. The initial diagnostic approach is with ultrasound studies and computed tomography definitive diagnosis is established by renal venography or by selective renal arteriography. In general, a conservative approach including the use of anticoagulant treatment is preferred to surgical intervention. Priapism is a persistent painful penile erection due to ischemic or non-ischemic causes
