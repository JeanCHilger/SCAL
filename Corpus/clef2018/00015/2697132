Evaluation of disorders of portal and total hepatic blood flow in patients with chronic diffuse liver diseases. The total hepatic blood flow measured with radioactive colloidal gold and the portal blood flow with the echo-Doppler method were investigated in 19 healthy examinees and 63 patients with chronic diffuse liver diseases. In the group of healthy examinees, the average values of the total hepatic blood flow was 1254 +/- 231 ml/min and of the portal one 1104 +/- 227 ml/min. The lowest blood flow values were obtained in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, especially in the hepatic (704 +/- 186 ml/min) and the portal blood flow (562 +/- 198 ml/min). In all the groups of examinees, registered values of the total hepatic blood flow were significantly higher than the values of the portal blood flow. The relations of the values obtained by both methods, among groups, were similar. By both methods decreased values are not obtained in liver steatosis and chronic persistent hepatitis in relation to the normal values. In patients with more serious forms of chronic diffuse liver diseases (cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis) significantly lower blood flow values than the normal ones were obtained. Both methods contribute to the investigation of liver circulation disturbances, liver function damages, and to the follow-up of the liver disease course. The possibility of an indirect evaluation of the arterial hepatic blood flow from the difference of hepatic and portal blood flows may mean a new approach to the investigation of pathophysiological liver occurrences.
