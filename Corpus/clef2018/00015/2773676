Value of ascitic lipids and sero-ascitic gradient of albumin in the differential diagnosis of ascites. In order to compare its diagnostic value in the differentiation between malignant and hepatic ascites, we analysed the ascitic fluid concentrations of cholesterol (Ct) and triglycerides (Tg) and the serum-ascites albumin gradient (S-A alb grad) in 58 patients--forty one with chronic liver disease (CLD) and 17 with malignancy. In CLD group the mean values +/- SD for Ct (27.1 +/- 20.1 mg/dl), Tg (34.2 +/- 33.8 mg/dl) and S-A alb grad (1.9 +/- 0.6 g/dl) were significantly different from those obtained in malignant ascites (Ct 103.1 +/- 45.1 mg/dl Tg 62.1 +/- 43.0 mg/dl
