Cirrhosis of the liver simulating congenital cyanotic heart disease. During the last 25 years, 20 patients with cirrhosis of liver with severe cyanosis and gross clubbing simulating congenital cyanotic heart disease were subjected to cardiac catheterization and angiography, splenography, liver function tests, and liver biopsy. No portopulmonary fistulas could be demonstrated. The cyanosis and clubbing were secondary to right to left intrapulmonary shunting across multiple tiny pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas. In 15 cases, selective pulmonary angiography revealed discrete arteriovenous fistulas. In five cases, the angiogram did not reveal any convincing evidence of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas. In two of these five cases, peripheral vein contrast echocardiography demonstrated right to left intrapulmonary shunting and seems a sensitive investigation. Open lung biopsy in one case showed evidence of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas.
