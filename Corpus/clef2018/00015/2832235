Hepatic intraarterial lipiodol: technique, semiologic patterns, and value for hepatic tumors. Hepatic intraarterial lipiodol (HIAL) coupled with computed tomography (CT) was used in a homogeneous series of 138 cases. All patients received 10 ml lipiodol emulsion injected by an arterial route there were no serious complications. Four semiologic patterns were observed. Aside from nodular regenerative hyperplasia occurring in the absence of cirrhosis, HIAL gave no false-positive indications of tumor, as demonstrated by a series of 20 patients with uncomplicated cirrhosis evaluated for over 12 months. Comparison of ultrasonography, CT, angiography, and HIAL coupled with CT for exploration of hepatomas revealed the marked superiority of HIAL/CT for both tumor detection and lesion localization (search for daughter tumors).
