Evaluation of the usefulness of ultrasonics in the diagnosis of cancerous cirrhosis. Comparison with CT. Cirrhotic liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was evaluated with both US and CT. In a group of 600 cirrhotic patients 64 had HCC, which was confirmed at histology in 24 cases, and by disease evolution in the other 40 single focal degeneration was proven in 40 patients, multiple (2, 3 focal lesions), or diffuse degeneration (more than 3 focal lesions) in the remaining 24. Sixteen patients had associated portal thrombosis. US recognized 38/40 single HCC, 22/24 multiple or diffuse lesions, and 11/16 portal vein thromboses. Degeneration was most frequently hypo/isoechoic in small tumors, hyperechoic and mixed in large lesions. When small lesions are hyperechoic their differentiation from both hemangiomas and regeneration noduli is extremely difficult. In such cases CT is mandatory. US diagnostic accuracy is by far superior to that of CT: 95% vs 85% in single lesions and 91.6% vs 87.5% in diffuse forms. Overall accuracy is 93.7% for US and 85.9% for CT. The authors believe that US should be performed every 6 months on cirrhotic patients, so as to allow HCC to be detected in time for radical surgery, while CT should be performed only when doubts persist.
