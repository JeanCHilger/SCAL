Focal and diffuse liver disease studied by quantitative microstructural sonography. Quantitative microstructural sonography differs from conventional sonography in several ways. The frequency as well as the amplitude of echoes is recorded and assessed using spectral analysis techniques. The effects of diffraction of the ultrasound beam are calibrated, as are the transfer characteristics of the system. Studies of patients with alcoholic liver disease revealed significantly increased attenuation, heterogeneity of scatterers, and local scattering strength in those with severe disease in contrast, patients with mild cirrhosis exhibited decreased local scattering strength compared to normal individuals. Using retrospective three-parameter discriminant analysis, 23 out of 24 patients were successfully categorized, suggesting that the parameters used were capable of measuring microstructural changes associated with these disease states. Parameters varied widely among 6 types of hepatic tumors, suggesting that this method may offer promise in distinguishing tumors from normal cases and alcoholic liver disease as well as from each other. Further applications and evaluation of this method appear justified.
