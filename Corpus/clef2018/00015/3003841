Sonography and computed tomography before and after liver resection and transplantation. The diagnostic value of sonography and CT was studied in 259 patients. In the diagnosis of solid tumours, CT is superior to sonography, whereas ultrasound is more useful in the investigation of cystic lesions. In estimating the extent of intrahepatic tumours, the falciform ligament is more useful than a line from the cava to the gall bladder, both for CT and ultrasound, although in this case CT shows the extent of tumours more accurately. 3.7% of the ultrasound and 2.3% of the CT examinations were of limited value because of unavoidable technical problems.
