Chemotherapy and radiotherapy of malignant hepatic tumours. Cure of primary liver tumours remains possible only by surgery and early diagnosis will therefore continue to be important the value of regular screening of cirrhotic patients for development of HCC by ultrasound scanning and estimation of AFP is now established. Prognosis of irresectable HCC depends largely on the general condition of the patient at the time of diagnosis and is better in the absence of cirrhosis. Radiotherapy has little role in the management of patients with HCC, but benefit with acceptable morbidity may be obtained from parenteral chemotherapy, with doxorubicin or its derivatives used as single agents, or with a combination of 5-FU and methyl-CCNU. There may be advantage from regional therapy given via the hepatic artery and early results from the combination of embolization with arterial doxorubicin are encouraging. The use of radiolabelled antibodies to tumour-related determinants of hormonal manipulation show promise. Worthwhile results from the non-surgical management of peripheral (intrahepatic) cholangiocarcinoma and primary hepatic sarcoma remain scarce. Isolated hepatic metastases from colorectal primaries may be resectable
