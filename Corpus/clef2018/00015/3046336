Prevalence of gallstones in liver cirrhosis: a sonographic survey. A sonographic prospective study of the prevalence of gallstones was performed in 140 patients with liver cirrhosis and in 140 controls. Gallstones were found more often in cirrhotic patients (29.2%) than in controls (13.6%) (p less than 0.01). Their prevalence increased with age. The ratio of women to men in cirrhotics was the same as in the general population, with a higher prevalence in women. The prevalence of gallstones increased in decompensated liver disease. There was a significantly higher prevalence of both hypersplenism and hemolysis in cirrhosis. No difference was found in gallstone prevalence in relation to cirrhosis etiology. This prospective study confirms, by means of sonography, the high prevalence of cholelithiasis in liver cirrhosis, and extends the previous data about the lithogenic risk factors in this disease.
