Influence of pathological state on the acoustic attenuation coefficient slope of liver. The acoustic attenuation coefficient slope (beta) of liver was estimated in vivo from the spectral difference of returned echoes. beta of normal young subjects was lower than that of older subjects (mean: 0.340 vs 0.418 dB/cm.MHz). Limited fluid withdrawal from the body by haemodialysis did not affect beta. In alcoholic liver disease beta was related to the amount of fat and of fibrous tissue in liver biopsy specimens. High values of beta were observed as soon as the degree of steatosis exceeded 5 vol%. There was a similar increase of beta in the presence of fibrous interlobular septa. In normal liver beta was related to the amount of triglycerides in the liver specimen.
