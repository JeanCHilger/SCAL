The echographic histogram--its use in the diagnosis of diffuse liver diseases. Quantitative evaluation of the echographic findings in patients with chronic liver diseases was carried out. 64 persons were examined--15 patients with liver steatosis, 21 patients with chronic hepatitis, 17 patients with liver cirrhosis and 15 healthy persons as controls. The diagnosis in all patients was confirmed by liver biopsy. With the help of the computer device of the echograph and by the same experimental conditions were measured: the mean echogenicity of a certain area (in units of density), the most frequent echogenicity and the maximal number of points with most frequent echogenicity. The analysis of the results showed that ultrasound examination allows the differentiation from the normal liver structure of the diffuse liver lesions (echogenicity above 20) and of liver steatosis (echogenicity above 26). The echographic histogram cannot differentiate chronic hepatitis from liver cirrhosis. This is possible by other echographic criteria.
