Differential diagnosis of jaundice. Patients with jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia over 34 mumol/l have been examined by different methods in order to assess the diagnostic value of the methods. 340 patients were examined clinically and by laparoscopy, 168 patients and 92 healthy persons were examined by 10 laboratory indices, 639 patients--by ultrasonography, 95 patients--by scintigraphy, 116 patients--by computer tomography, 83 patients--by endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCPG), 17 patients--by percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), 70 patients--by directed liver biopsy. In the patients with cholestasis the 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, glutamyl transpeptidase (lipoprotein X is positive in 92% of the patients) and cholesterol are increased most. The extrahepatic obstructions are diagnosed by ultrasonography in 94.8% of the patients (the biliary ducts are dilated), in 88.7% of the patients the localization of the obstruction and in 74.7% of the patients the cause of the obstruction are found. In parenchymal jaundice the sonography reveals the disease which has caused jaundice in 62.1% of the patients. The scintigraphy gives correct diagnosis in 50% of the patients with hepatitis and jaundice, in 78% of the patients with cirrhosis and jaundice and in 87.5% of the patients with liver cancer. The computer tomography reveals the obstructive jaundice in 94.7% of the patients and the focal processes in the liver in 96.7% of the patients. The ERCPG gives a clear picture of the biliary ducts in 72.28% and of the pancreatic duct in 83.13% of the patients with jaundice, simultaneously the biliary and the pancreatic ducts--in 45.78% of the patients and correct diagnosis in 83.1% of the patients examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
