Image diagnosis and Doppler ultrasound in the functional study of portal circulation. The authors, after mentioning physiologic appearance of portal circulation and physical principles governing the interrelationship of pressure, flow and flow velocity in blood vessels, report the results of a study about trend of haemodynamic values in 23 normal subjects and 13 cirrhotic patients. Values of portal blood flow and fluid speed were measured using a pulsed "Linear-Doppler" system, before and after dinner. Statistical analysis of results proves the diagnostic value of examination that appears qualified as the method of first choice in the patients with suspected changes of portal circulation.
