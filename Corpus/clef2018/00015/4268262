Change of indication for laparoscopy. The indications for the use of laparoscopy have undergone a change in recent years due to the increasing application of the technique used in the liver biopsy by the Menghini method.  It requires little equipment, is easily learned, and involves few risks.  It has appeared through the development of reliable radiodiagnostic methods (coeliacography, splenoportography), nuclear medical methods (radio-BSP test, scintigraphy), and the application of ultrasonic examination.  On the basis of 257 such operations performed from 1970 to 1972, a defined range of indication is shown for the use of this expensive equipment.  It is considered justified in the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, at the determination of the extent of cirrhosis complications, above all, in the preparation of a portocaval shunt operation, at the efferential diagnosis of jaundice, combined hepatosplenomegalia, and in the diagnosis of tumor or metastase-affected liver.  Laparoscopy should be carried out only in the case of discrepancies between clinical and serochemical findings for the clarification of hepatomegaly and for liver-suspect serochemical findings.
