Hepatocellular carcinoma of small size. Clinicopathological features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of small size, not larger than 5.0 cm in diameter, were studied in 11 patients with underlying cirrhosis. The presence of tumor was detected and confirmed by computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US) during periodic imaging re-examinations of cirrhotic patients. The HCCs grew slowly up to a certain stage and formed satellite tumors that could not be visualized on CT image. Therefore, infusion hepatic angiography and/or transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) are essential before undertaking a major operation.
