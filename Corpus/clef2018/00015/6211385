Comparison between laparoscopy, ultrasonography, and computed tomography in widespread and localized liver diseases. The diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US) in various liver disease in comparison with laparoscopy is evaluated. The diagnostic reliability of CT and US is higher in localized than in widespread hepatic disorders. US is more valuable than CT in the diagnosis of diffuse hepatic lesions. The diagnostic accuracy is similar in localized lesions of neoplastic type. Laparoscopy is the most reliable tool in the diagnosis of widespread liver disease with the exception of fully developed cirrhosis or severe steatosis. In focal neoplastic disease CT and US can be dependably employed when the histological type of the cancer is not required.
