Significance of laparoscopy in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in siderocirrhosis. A case report is given of a patient with liver cirrhosis caused by hemosiderosis, who developed liver carcinoma. In such patients liver carcinoma can only be excluded by means of peritoneoscopy. Sonography, computer tomography and laboratory findings will not allow to make the correct diagnosis, because of the particular nature of liver changes in hemosiderosis of the liver, as can be seen in our case. Thus none of the non-invasive procedures mentioned above are suited for early diagnosis of malignant liver disease because of the special morphological features in hemosiderosis of the liver.
