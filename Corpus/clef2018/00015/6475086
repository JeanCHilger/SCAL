Sonography and scintigraphy in the differential diagnosis of diffuse liver parenchymal diseases. 70 patients with established diffuse liver disease (steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis) were investigated by sonography and scintigraphy. Sonographic parenchymal morphology and scintigraphic activity pattern were correlated with the histological diagnosis. Scintigraphy as a functional diagnostic technique revealed early fibrotic changes of the liver not seen by ultrasound. Cirrhosis could be demonstrated equally by both methods. The two major advances of ultrasound were: high accuracy in steatosis and ability of simultaneous analysis of the other abdominal organs.
