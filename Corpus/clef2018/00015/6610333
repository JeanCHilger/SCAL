Characteristic sonographic features of schistosomal periportal fibrosis. The hepatic sonograms of 22 patients with the features of schistosomal periportal fibrosis (PPF) were reviewed retrospectively. Dense echogenic bands were seen when scanning along the long axis of the intrahepatic portal vein radicles. Rounded densities resulted from scanning across these bands as they radiated from the porta hepatis to the liver's edge. Scanning across central and peripheral bifurcation points of the portal veins produced a branching pattern of high echogenicity. Associated findings were ascites and splenomegaly secondary to the liver disease. The hepatic sonographic features were characteristic of portal tract thickening from schistosomal PPF.
