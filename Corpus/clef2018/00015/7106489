Noninvasive imaging of unusual regenerating nodules in the cirrhotic liver. Despite the common occurrence of regenerating liver nodules, little has been written regarding their ultrasound or computed tomographic appearance. In the great majority of cases, they have an echo texture and CT number identical to surrounding hepatic parenchyma. Exceptionally, as in the 2 cases described, they can mimic a malignant neoplasm. Because radionuclide imaging almost always demonstrates uptake over a regenerating nodule, this modality should be used in suspicious cases in conjunction with either ultrasound or computed tomography in order to exclude a malignancy.
