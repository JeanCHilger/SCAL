Radiologic diagnosis of non-neoplastic liver masses. The Authors make a revue of radiological methods for the study of non neoplastic hepatic masses. They remember the usefulness of ecotomography, computed tomography and scintigraphy as initial screening angiography is to be used at the end of the screening plan only if other methods don't have given a certain diagnosis or if an hepatic resection is planned, in fact angiography is necessary for a correct surgical planning. Some cases are presented with angiographic demonstration of non neoplastic hepatic masses.
