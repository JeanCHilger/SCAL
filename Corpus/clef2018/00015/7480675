Aberrant gastric venous drainage in cirrhotic livers: imaging findings in focal areas of liver parenchyma. To analyze imaging finding in focal areas of liver parenchyma with aberrant gastric venous drainage (AGVD) in cirrhotic livers.Eighteen patients with AGVD confirmed with computed tomography (CT) during arterial portography and arteriography underwent ultrasound (US) (n = 18), CT (n = 18), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (n = 12), dynamic CT (n = 14), and dynamic MR imaging (n = 8). Imaging and histologic (n = 2) findings were analyzed.The focal area with AGVD was hypoechoic on US scans (n = 7), hypoattenuating on CT scans (n = 4), hyperintense on T1-weighted MR images (n = 6), and hypointense on T2-weighted MR images (n = 5). Early enhancement was seen with dynamic CT (n = 8) and with dynamic MR imaging (n = 6), without definite staining on arterial phase of arteriography. Histologic findings revealed hyperplastic changes of liver.The imaging findings, except for early enhancement, were very similar to those of adenomatous hyperplasia or well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. The early enhancement was considered due to early venous return compared with that of the surrounding liver.
