Prognostic significance of hepatic vein waveform by Doppler ultrasonography in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. We prospectively evaluated the prognostic value of the flat hepatic vein waveform, measured by Doppler ultrasound, in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension.The Doppler pattern of right and left hepatic veins in a series of 120 consecutive cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension but without hepatocellular carcinoma was examined, together with clinical and biochemical parameters.Flat waveform of the right hepatic vein was recognized in nine patients and that of the left hepatic vein was seen in 13. After a mean follow-up of 13.6 +/- 9.7 months, 17 patients died, all from liver failure. In the univariate analysis, variable significantly associated with the duration of survival were age, etiology of the liver cirrhosis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding after start of the study, Child-Pugh score, ascites, encephalopathy, prothrombin index, bilirubin, albumin, and flat Doppler waveform in the right and left hepatic veins. Multivariate analysis showed that flat Doppler waveform in the right hepatic vein, bilirubin, and prothrombin index were independently related to survival.The prognostic accuracy in cases of cirrhosis with portal hypertension is significantly improved with acquisition of information obtained from hepatic vein waveform by Doppler ultrasound.
