Hemodynamic and renal effects of ascites apheresis, concentration and reinfusion in advanced cirrhosis. We studied the effects of ascites apheresis, concentration and reinfusion, a new form of treatment for tense or refractory ascites, on systemic hemodynamics and renal function.Twelve patients with advanced cirrhosis (two belonging to Child-Pugh's class B and the remainder to class C) were monitored. They were evaluated under baseline conditions, just after the treatment, and 24 and 48 h after baseline assessment. In addition to systemic hemodynamics--as evaluated by Doppler echocardiography--and renal function, indirect markers of effective volemia, such as atrial natriuretic factor, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, and plasma norepinephrine were also measured.The technique led to significant changes in systemic hemodynamics, such as an increase in stroke volume and cardiac output. However, due to a striking reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, mean arterial pressure also declined. The hemodynamic changes were associated with a parallel increase in atrial natriuretic factor. Despite the reduction in arterial pressure, plasma renin activity also significantly declined, while plasma norepinephrine did not undergo significant changes. Although an improvement in glomerular filtration rate and renal sodium excretion occurred, neither change reached statistical significance. All the hemodynamic, renal and neuro-humoral changes described above subsided almost entirely after 48 h, when no significant changes with respect to baseline values were any longer detectable with the exception of a slight reduction in mean arterial pressure.In advanced cirrhosis ascites apheresis, concentration and reinfusion enhance central volemia, but an exaggerated peripheral vasodilation largely wastes the potential favourable effect on arterial volemia. As a result, no significant improvement in renal perfusion and sodium excretion can ensue.
