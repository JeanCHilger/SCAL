Peribiliary cysts in liver cirrhosis: US, CT, and MR findings. We report the imaging features of hepatic peribiliary cysts (PC) and the course of their development on CT.Both CT and US findings were correlated with histopathologic findings in two patients with PC at autopsy. Five patients with cysts around the portal vein on CT but without histologic correlation were also included in this study. In six patients the course of PC development was observed.In the two autopsy cases cystic dilatation of the peribiliary glands was confirmed. The cases showed continuous small cysts along the portal veins reflecting the periportal collar seen on CT and the abnormal MR signal intensity of the periportal area. Ultrasound (US) showed round or tubular anechoic lesions around the large portal tracts mimicking dilatation of the bile ducts. Clustered cysts and echogenic dots or bands around PC were also seen. In three of six cases the PCs gradually enlarged and increased in number.In patients with liver cirrhosis PCs can be demonstrated by CT, US, and MRI in the vicinity of the hepatic hilum. Peribiliary cysts enlarge gradually and must be differentiated from dilatation of bile ducts or edema of portal tracts.
