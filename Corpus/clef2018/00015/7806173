Noninvasive measurement of femoral blood flow and portal pressure response to propranolol in patients with cirrhosis. This study investigated the correlation between changes in hepatic and systemic hemodynamics and femoral blood flow (FBF), measured by dual-beam pulsed wave Doppler, in 58 portal hypertensive patients receiving propranolol (0.15 mg/Kg intravenously n = 44) or placebo (n = 14) under double-blind conditions. Placebo administration had no effects. Propranolol caused significant reductions (P < .0001) in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG
