Prognostic significance of ascites in patients with liver cirrhosis. The author evaluates the prognostic importance of ascites in 100 patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The patients were followed up on a log-term basis in a hepatology clinic and the diagnosis was confirmed morphologically. Ascites developed at a time when marked objective and laboratory signs of chronic liver disease were present. Ascites was diagnosed by physical examination and verified by ultrasonography. It was treated by contemporary procedures. Survival of cirrhotic patients with ascites was unfavorable--50% survived one year, 38% two years, 17% three years, 15% four years and only 9% five years. Ascites is thus still a very adverse prognostic indicator for patients with cirrhosis.
