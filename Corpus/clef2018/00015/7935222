Prospective study of the incidence of ultrasound detectable liver hematomas after laparoscopically controlled liver puncture with the Silverman needle. A high incidence of hepatic haematomas detected at sonography following percutaneous liver biopsy and laparoscopy-guided liver biopsy has recently been reported.Prompted by this report, we carried out a prospective study on 71 patients aged between 20 and 79 years (median age: 51 years). The patients were examined by ultrasound prior to and following laparoscopy-guided biopsy with the Silverman needle.Only two of the 71 patients (3%) had a hepatic haematoma after biopsy. The haemangiomas had a maximum diameter of 2.6 cm, caused no pain, and disappeared again within ten days at the latest. No therapeutic measures were required.The results of this study indicate that laparoscopy-guided liver biopsy with the Silverman needle is associated with relatively few complications.
