Ultrasonographic examination of the circulation in the hepatic vein in diffuse liver diseases. 59 patients suffering from diffuse liver lesion and 28 healthy individuals had undergone duplex ultrasound examination of the hepatic vein circulation. Three time-velocity spectra had been noticed and later divided into three groups: 1. Normal (triphasic) spectrum. 2. Decreased and deformed amplitudes. 3. Flat flow spectrum.The control group matched the normal (triphasic) spectrum of type 1 without exception. Type 2 could be observed in steatosis, chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis alike. The type 3 spectrum was shown significantly, to occur with 71% sensitivity and with 100% specificity in cirrhosis of the liver. The comparison of the results with the circulation velocities measured in the main portal vein showed a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 94%. Based on this initial experience, authors hold the view that a technically simple hepatic vein Doppler-sonography can complete the clinical analysis with significant additional information in cases of diffuse liver lesion.
