The epidemiology of Schistosoma mansoni, hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection in Egypt. There appears to be no epidemiological association between Schistosoma mansoni infection, the intensity of S. mansoni infection or S. mansoni infection complicated by schistosome hepatic fibrosis and the presence of antibody to hepatitis B virus core antigen (anti-HBc), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) or antibody to both agents. This was the main conclusion of a population-based study of an entire village in the northern Egyptian Nile Delta. All 1850 villagers were invited to participate and serological, parasitological and ultrasound examinations were completed on a high proportion of the total population (68% provided sera and higher percentages provided stool specimens and were subjected to ultrasound examinations). Testing with dual Kato slides indicated a high prevalence of S. mansoni infection in the village (49.1%), typical of the area. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers (presence of either anti-HBc and/or HBsAg) and anti-HCV were also found to be prevalent, present in 24% and 15.9% of the villagers, respectively. The age-adjusted odds ratios (OR) for infection with S. mansoni and HBV [1.13 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.87-1.48], HBsAg (1.11
