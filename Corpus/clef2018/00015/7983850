Ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis in the owl monkey. Bile samples were obtained from adult owl monkeys by ultrasound-guided percutaneous cholecystocentesis, using a transhepatic approach. Sampling frequency was once weekly over a 5-week period. Clinical recovery from each procedure was rapid. Animal body weights fluctuated within 22% of baseline over the study period, but maximal weight loss in any animal was less than 3% at the study's end. At necropsy, gross lesions in the liver and gallbladder were minimal. Histologic examination revealed mild focal cholecystitis in the gallbladder of four of six animals, focal pericholecystitis in three of six animals, and foci of gallbladder fibrosis in two animals. Changes were consistent with repeated trauma from the centesis procedure. Gallbladder mucosa was judged normal in all animals. Body weight fluctuations were attributed to a change in diet, part of a concurrent study, rather than to the centesis procedure. Ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis provides a rapid, minimally traumatic, and safe method for repeated bile sampling in a small nonhuman primate.
