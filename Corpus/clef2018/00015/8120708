Analysis of risk factors for the development of liver disease associated with cystic fibrosis. We prospectively screened for liver disease patients with cystic fibrosis who were more than 3 years of age and who were followed at the cystic fibrosis center of the University of Milan. From January 1991 to December 1992, we screened 189 patients clinical, biochemical, and echographic abnormalities suggestive of overt liver disease were present in 34 (18%). To define risk factors for the development of liver disease associated with cystic fibrosis, we evaluated the possible role of specific mutations of the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator) gene and of different clinical and demographic characteristics (sex, pancreatic status, meconium ileus or its equivalent) through a comparison of patients with cystic fibrosis and overt liver disease (n = 34) and those without liver disease (n = 155). Genetic analysis failed to reveal any significant difference in the allele frequencies of defined (delta F508, 1717-1G-A, G542X, N1303K, W1282X, R553X) and undefined mutations of the CFTR gene in the two groups of patients
