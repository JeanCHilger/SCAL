Abnormalities of Doppler waveform of the hepatic veins in patients with chronic liver disease: correlation with histologic findings. Changes in the Doppler waveform of the hepatic veins are associated with chronic liver disease, particularly cirrhosis. We correlated abnormalities in Doppler waveforms of hepatic veins with histologic findings in the liver to determine the accuracy of Doppler imaging in the detection of cirrhosis.Fifty-two patients with chronic hepatitis C were examined prospectively and blindly by two sonographers. In the same session, a liver biopsy specimen was obtained from each patient and submitted to three independent pathologists for conventional interpretation and for grading of severity according to a predetermined scoring system. Duplex sonography of the hepatic veins was also performed in 50 control subjects.Abnormal hepatic vein waveforms were detected in 12 of 16 patients with cirrhosis and in eight of 36 patients without cirrhosis. However, histologic examination of the biopsy specimens showed that only two of the eight patients without cirrhosis had no significant abnormalities, other than mild portal inflammation. Abnormal waveforms were seen in no control subjects. We found a correlation between fibrosis and steatosis and abnormalities in the Doppler waveform of the hepatic veins (r = .50, p < .001). Portal inflammation, intralobular degeneration, and necrosis did not correlate with an abnormal waveform.Duplex sonography of the hepatic veins may be useful for studying liver disease associated with fibrosis and steatosis. In patients with well-compensated liver disease, flattening of the Doppler waveform of the hepatic vein suggests the presence of cirrhosis.
