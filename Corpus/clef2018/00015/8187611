Hepatocellular carcinoma following intravenous thorium X therapy. Twelve years after receiving radiation therapy with thorium X (280 microCi) for long-standing Bechterew's disease (ankylosing spondylitis) a 52-year-old man was found, by ultrasonography and computed tomography, to have a round mass, 11 x 12 cm, in the left lobe of the liver. Laparoscopy discovered coarse, discoloured nodes on the surface of the right and left lobes of the liver which histologically showed hepatocellular carcinoma. There were no known risk factor for liver carcinoma (like cirrhosis, positive hepatitis B serology, alcohol abuse, haemochromatosis or alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency). As exploratory laparotomy found the tumour to be inoperable, 15 chemotherapeutic embolizations were performed. An abdominal wall metastasis was resected after 17 months. At the time of this report, 20 months after the diagnosis was first made, the patient is in a poor general condition. Internal radiotherapy with thorium X was used, all else having failed, in the treatment of severe ankylosing spondylitis. Although it is not possible to prove a direct causal relationship between the thorium X radiation and development of a liver carcinoma, the coincidence is remarkable.
