The relationship of endoscopy, portal Doppler ultrasound flowmetry, and clinical and biochemical tests in cirrhosis. The relationship of the endoscopic aspect of esophageal varices, portal quantitative Doppler ultrasound parameters and clinical and biochemical findings was assessed in 149 patients with cirrhosis stratified according to the presence of esophageal varices (n = 115) and the absence of previous bleeding (n = 96). In this series of patients the presence of esophageal varices and red signs proved to be significantly correlated with the severity of cirrhosis. However, in the group of patients with varices, no correlation was found between variceal size and the degree of liver failure. Portal blood flow velocity was significantly different in the endoscopic subgroups, but not in the clinical and biochemical subgroups. Furthermore, portal blood flow velocity was found to correlate only with the presence and size of esophageal varices. The Congestion Index of the portal vein (derived from the ratio between the cross-sectional area of the portal vein and the mean velocity of portal flow) was significantly different in most clinical, biochemical and endoscopic subgroups and was correlated with liver function, presence and size of varices, and presence and degree of red signs. We conclude that the Congestion Index of the portal vein, the clinical status and the endoscopic aspect of varices are not independent features in patients with cirrhosis. As for liver function and endoscopic findings, portal Doppler ultrasound parameters, in particular the Congestion Index, may contribute to a better clinical assessment in patients with cirrhosis.
