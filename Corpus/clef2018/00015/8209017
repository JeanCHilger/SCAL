Color Doppler ultrasonography in the differential diagnosis of focal hepatic lesions. The SH U 508 A (Levovist) experience. The differential diagnosis of focal hepatic lesions is a current problem even though many study methods are available. Color Doppler US has been recently suggested as a diagnostic technique capable of depicting lesion vascularization patterns to better understand lesion nature. However, this examination is often difficult and long. In this study, we investigated the role of a US contrast agent SH U 508 A (Levovist) enhancing the color Doppler signals for easier and better depiction of lesion vascularization. Seventy-four patients with one or more focal hepatic lesions (mean diameter: 5.6 cm) were examined. The lesions were 38 HCCs, 4 cholangiocarcinomas, 1 intrahepatic biliary duct carcinoma, 1 case of multiple adenomas, 2 regenerations nodules in cirrhosis, 2 cases of FNH, 18 metastases and 8 hemangiomas. In 54 cases the US contrast agent allowed the visualization of some vessels inside the lesions which had been missed at baseline examinations. Moreover, the vessels which had been depicted on baseline images were better demonstrated. In all but one patient with severe hepatic steatosis, normal parenchymal vessels were markedly enhanced. Our results in the different kinds of tumors are here reported.
