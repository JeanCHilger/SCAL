Budd-Chiari syndrome: imaging with pathologic correlation. We retrospectively evaluated 21 patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome who underwent liver transplant. The pathological findings were correlated with imaging studies that included computed tomography (CT) in all cases, sonography in 20, and magnetic resonance (MR) in 15. Pathological features of Budd-Chiari syndrome in subacute or chronic form, such as parenchymal fibrosis, hemorrhage, and congestion, were found in all resected livers. These occurred usually in conjunction with restricted hepatic veins due to thrombosis or fibrosis with partially recanalized lumen. The status of hepatic veins was correctly assessed and correlated with pathology in 13 of 20 patients who had sonograms, in 12 of 15 patients who had MR, and in nine of 18 patients with contrast-enhanced CT scans. Patency of the inferior vena cava was well seen by all three modalities parenchymal abnormalities were best visible on CT (19 of 21), while ascites, caudate lobe enlargement and collateral vessels were best detected with MR or CT. We conclude that each imaging modality offers certain values and limitations in the assessment of vascular or parenchymal findings in Budd-Chiari syndrome.
