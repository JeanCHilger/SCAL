A case of solitary splenic abscess caused by Salmonella enteritidis and cured completely by antibiotic therapy alone. Solitary splenic abscess is a rare disease and usually treated with splenectomy. A 78-year-old female with diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis was admitted to our hospital in a state of fever and left hypochondralgia. The abdominal ultrasonogram and CT scan showed the splenomegaly and one abnormal mass in the spleen. Drainage under sonographic guidance was attempted to the splenic mass but only a little amount of aspiration fluid was obtained, from which Salmonella Enteritidis was detected. No other abscess in the other organs was detected, resulting in the diagnosis as solitary splenic abscess caused by S. Enteritidis. Antibiotic therapy was carried out and the abscess disappeared judging from the ultrasonogram, CT scan, and laboratory data. The present case suggests that the fully application of ultrasonogram, CT scan, and drainage for the diagnosis leads to the healing of solitary splenic abscess without operation. This is the first case of S. Enteritidis infection in the spleen reported in Japan.
