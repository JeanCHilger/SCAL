Evaluation of effective portal venous flow in chronic liver diseases using echo-Doppler flowmetry combined with per jejunal portal scintigraphy. Portal circulation changes due to the progression of chronic liver disease and portal venous flow are also affected by pharmacotherapy. Thus, noninvasive measurement of effective portal venous flow (EPVF) is highly desirable. We evaluated EPVF under steady-state conditions using echo-Doppler flowmetry combined with per jejunal portal scintigraphy in 32 patients with chronic liver disease. After introduodenal administration of 37 MBq (1 mCi) of 123I-iodoamphetamine, scintigraphy of the pulmonary and hepatic regions was performed and a portosystemic shunt index (SI) calculated. EPVF was calculated as follows: EPVF = PVFx (1-SI/100). EPVF in chronic hepatitis, compensated cirrhosis and decompensated cirrhosis was 12.0 +/- 1.8 ml/min/kg, 10.3 +/- 1.6 ml/min/kg and 8.0 +/- 2.5 ml/min/kg, respectively. There were significant differences in EPVF between all groups, although PVF was similar in each group. EPVF correlated with liver function tests and was a better indicator of liver function than PVF. Measurement of EPVF may provide useful information in the management of patients with chronic liver disease.
