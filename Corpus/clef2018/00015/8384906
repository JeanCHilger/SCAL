Hepatic resection using a water jet dissector. A newly-designed water jet dissector was used for hepatic resections in humans. To evaluate its usefulness, the water jet dissector was compared to an ultrasonic surgical aspirator in terms of average blood loss and time of operation. In hepatectomies on patients associated with liver cirrhosis, the average blood loss during hepatic resection using the water jet dissector was significantly smaller (P < 0.05) than that with the ultrasonic surgical aspirator. However, in hepatectomies on patients without cirrhosis, the average blood loss during hepatic resection did not significantly differ between the two groups. Neither did the time of operation significantly differ between the two procedures in hepatectomies on patients with and without liver cirrhosis. No serious complications attributable to the use of the water jet dissector were encountered. The water jet dissector is thus considered to be a useful new device for use in the transection of the liver during hepatic resections.
