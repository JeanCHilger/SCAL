Gross pathologic types of hepatocellular carcinoma in Italian patients. Relationship with demographic, environmental, and clinical factors. The prevalence of the different hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) macroscopic types, and the association between these types and age, gender, blood group, alcohol and coffee intake, smoking habit, hepatitis virus markers, underlying cirrhosis, and cancer histologic type were retrospectively assessed in 416 unselected patients (321 with cirrhosis).The gross pathologic types of HCC were assessed by ultrasonography combined, in most cases, with computed tomography and angiography.Solitary HCC was the most common cancer type (54.8%), followed by the multinodular (31%), diffuse (7.7%), and massive (6.5%) types. Cirrhosis and blood group other than O were independent risk factors for multinodular HCC (relative risk [RR] 1.6, P < 0.05 and RR 1.7, P < 0.005, respectively)In Italian patients, HCC presents most frequently as a solitary nodule. The presence or absence of cirrhosis, blood group, and smoking habit can influence the likelihood of developing certain HCC shapes. The probability of harboring highly undifferentiated cells increases as the cancer increases in size. In cirrhosis, advanced liver dysfunction may predispose to diffuse HCC.
