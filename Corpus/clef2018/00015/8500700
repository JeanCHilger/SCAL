Digestive hemorrhage caused by congestive gastropathy in a patient with liver cirrhosis: emergency treatment by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic anastomosis. A 34-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension was admitted for gastric bleeding due to congestive gastropathy. Her past medical history included 4 episodes of variceal rupture within the last 5 months. As medical treatment was a failure, an emergency transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt was successfully performed, resulting in a marked drop in portal pressure (from 32 to 15 mm Hg) and a subsequent arrest of acute hemorrhage. Four months later, no recurrent bleeding has been observed and the shunt has remained patent as documented by duplex Doppler sonography.
