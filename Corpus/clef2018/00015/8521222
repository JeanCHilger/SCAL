Congenital intrahepatic venous shunt as a cause of hepatic encephalopathy. Macroscopic intrahepatic portosystemic shunts are extremely rare and may be due to liver injury, congenital vascular malformations or pathologic collaterals secondary to portal hypertension. Forty-eight cases have been reported in the literature up to 1994 with 50-60% presenting cerebral manifestations and 40% being associated with cirrhosis. The case of a patient without cirrhosis who was admitted for upper digestive hemorrhage secondary to gastroduodenal ulcer is described. At 48 hours the patient had an episode of hepatic encephalopathy coinciding with bleeding reactivation. Abdominal echography suggested communication between the right portal and suprahepatic veins and posterior angiography confirmed the diagnosis. Color Doppler echography determined shunt and portal vein blood flow. No case of intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt as a cause of encephalopathy was found to have been reported in the Spanish literature.
