Initial clinical experiences with TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portasystemic stent-shunt). 15 patients with predominantly alcoholtoxic liver cirrhosis (mean age 50 years 8 men and 7 women) were treated by the technically successful implantation of a transjugular portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPS) within a period of 1 year. The indications for TIPS implantation were the following: gastroesophageal bleedings in 12 cases (10 patients with recurrent variceal bleeding including 2 emergency cases with severe bleeding resistant to conventional therapy and 2 patients with exclusively gastral bleeding due to severe hypertensive gastropathy) and ascites resistant to conventional therapy in 3 cases. Portovenous pressure could be effectively reduced by mean of 37%. Within a mean observation period of 8 months 13 patients including the emergency cases remained without recurrent bleeding. Duplexsonography showed patent stents. 1 patient suffered from an early recurrent bleeding due to occlusion of the stent-shunt. The estimation of liver function according to the Child-Pugh-classification showed only minor changes. Before TIPS 9 patients were in class A, 4 in B, 2 in C
