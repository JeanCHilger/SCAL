Areas of increased echogenicity in the fetal abdomen: diagnosis and significance. Areas of increased echogenicity in the fetal abdomen are defined as abnormally bright areas with an echogenicity similar to that of surrounding bones. Such areas are encountered in various normal and abnormal processes. When increased echogenicity is discovered in the fetal abdomen, a careful search should be made for a potential cause. The causes to be considered depend on the location of the areas of increased echogenicity, which can be classified as intestinal, peritoneal, hepatic, retroperitoneal, and parietal. In each case, vascular, ischemic, infectious, tumoral, metabolic, and chromosomal abnormalities should be included in the differential diagnosis before considering the finding a normal variant. Therefore, in utero detection of fetal abdominal areas of increased echogenicity requires a complete sonographic survey of the fetus and placenta along with close sonographic follow-up, evaluation of familial factors, and testing for possible associated cystic fibrosis, infection, or a chromosomal anomaly. The prognosis depends more on the underlying disease than on the extent of the increased echogenicity.
