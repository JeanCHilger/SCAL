Hepatocellular carcinoma cases with five-year survival and prognostic factors affecting the survival time. Between 1980 and 1994, 178 patients were confirmed to have hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in our hospital. The 5-year survival rates in patients with HCC of stage I, II and IVA were 38.1%, 31.8% and 3.9%, respectively. No patient in stage III or IVB survived for more than four years. The 5-year survival rates of the patients treated by hepatic resection, ultrasonically guided percutaneous ethanol injection and transcatheter hepatic arterial embolization were 53.7%, 38.7% and 13.5%, respectively. The logrank test showed a significant difference in cumulative survival rates obtained in patients with HCC according to the tumor stage (p < 0.001) or principal treatment procedure (p < 0.001). Twelve patients survived for more than five years. We employed a Cox's proportional hazards model to estimate the factors significantly affecting the survival time. Variables with statistical significance were the clinical stage (p < 0.001), tumor size (maximal tumor diameter) (p < 0.001) and patient's age (p < 0.05). Conclusively, patients in the early stage of HCC associated with mild liver cirrhosis have a significantly better chance for long survival.
