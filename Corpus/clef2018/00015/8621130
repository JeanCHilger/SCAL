Splenic Doppler impedance indices: influence of different portal hemodynamic conditions. The spleen plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and maintenance of portal hypertension. Few data exist about splenic hemodynamics evaluated by duplex sonography in this condition. Twenty-six normal subjects, 207 patients with portal hypertension of various causes, and in different splenoportal hemodynamic conditions, and 31 patients with liver transplantation were evaluated. In each patient the splenic resistive index (RI = peak systolic--end diastolic velocity/peak systolic velocity) and pulsatility index (PI = peak systolic--end diastolic velocity/mean velocity) were measured. In 17 cirrhotic patients, splenic indices were compared with portal hemodynamics as invasively evaluated by hepatic vein catheterization. In the various groups, RI and PI were respectively: normal subjects, 0.51 +/- 0.05 and 0.72 +/- 0.11 cirrhotic patients with hepatopetal portal blood flow (n = 167), 0.64 +/- 0.08 and 1.03 +/- 0.24
