Successful resection of a large hepatoblastoma in a young adult: report of a case. Hepatoblastoma (HB) rarely occurs in adults, and very few cases of successful resection have been documented. We report herein the unusual case of a 22-year-old, otherwise healthy woman with no history of liver disease who presented with upper abdominal pain and hepatomegaly. Tests for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were negative, but the AFP was mildly elevated at 77 ng/ml, the normal being < 20. There was no evidence of liver cirrhosis on either the laboratory or histologic examinations. A well-demarcated solid mass of 14 cm in diameter, which was lobulated and partly necrotic, was detected in the liver by computed tomography (CT). The lesion was echogenic on ultrasound, slightly hypodense on CT, and mildly hypervascular on arteriogram. The entire tumor was resected by extensive hepatectomy preserving only the lateral segment and part of the posterior segment of the liver. Histologically, the neoplasm was diagnosed as a pure epithelial HB of the fetal type. Following the operation, the patient has been well and free of recurrence for 38 months, maintaining low alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels at around 5 ng/ml. To our knowledge, this is the longest reported survival of an adult following surgical resection of an epithelial HB.
