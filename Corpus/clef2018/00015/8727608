Advances in hepatic resection and results for hepatocellular carcinoma. The mortality and morbidity of hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have decreased in recent years because of the various advances in hepatic resection. Various improvements are evident in dissecting apparatus, liver hepatic inflow clamp, cold hepatic perfusion technique, intraoperative ultrasonography, accurate assessment of hepatic function, autologous blood transfusion, and so on. Five-year survival after hepatic resection for HCC was reported at 26-59% in Eastern as well as Western series. The prognostic factors were portal invasion, multiplicity, serum alpha-fetoprotein level, tumor size, associated cirrhosis, age, alcohol abuse, histologic classification, DNA ploidy, and surgical margin. Segmental or lobar hepatic resection brought about better survival, especially in stage I and II patients. Effective adjuvant therapy should improve the diagnosis.
