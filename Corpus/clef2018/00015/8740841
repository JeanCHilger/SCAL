Portal vein thrombosis complicating hepatocellular carcinoma. Value of ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy of the thrombus in the therapeutic management. During a 4-year period portal vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 20 Child class A patients with cirrhosis by means of ultrasound and ultrasound-Doppler study. Seventeen of them showed single or multiple focal liver lesions diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma by ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy and the remaining three a coarse liver echo-pattern without focal lesions. One patient was found to have developed portal vein thrombosis after the fifth ethanol injection of a single hepatocellular carcinoma lesion 17 mm in diameter. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy of the thrombus was performed on all the patients: portal vein thrombosis was neoplastic in 13 cases and non-neoplastic in seven cases (five patients with a single lesion one with two lesions
