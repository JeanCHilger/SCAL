Transient hepatofugal portal blood flow after hepatectomy in a patient with cirrhosis: report of a case. We report herein the case of a 60-year-old man who developed hepatic failure with simultaneous transient hepatofugal portal blood flow after undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma accompanied by cirrhosis with a splenorenal shunt. The transient hepatofugal portal blood flow was detected by color Doppler ultrasonography. Following this case report, the possibility of a relationship between hepatofugal portal blood flow, portal-systemic shunts, and postoperative hepatic failure is discussed.
