Management of non-complicated cirrhosis. Diagnosis of compensated cirrhosis can be confirmed by needle liver biopsy. This may give a clue to the aetiology and activity of the disease. All patients with cirrhosis underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal ultrasonography. Treatment with non selective beta-blockers in patients with large esophageal varices is strongly recommended. Endoscopic screening every year in patients with small varices and every other year in patients without varices is considered appropriate to identify patients at risk of bleeding. Patients with hepatic cirrhosis are at an increased risk of developing primary malignant tumours of the liver. Screening includes abdominal ultrasound and determination of serum alpha-faetoprotein every 6 months. Bacterial infections can be a severe complication in cirrhotic patients. They must be detected early and treated. Several drugs are contra-indicated in these patients.
