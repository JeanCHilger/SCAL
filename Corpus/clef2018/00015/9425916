Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt versus endoscopic sclerotherapy for the prevention of variceal bleeding in cirrhosis: a randomized multicenter trial. Gruppo Italiano Studio TIPS (G.I.S.T.). Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), a new technique for the treatment of portal hypertension, has been successful in preliminary studies to treat acute variceal hemorrhage and to prevent variceal rebleeding. The purpose of this multicenter, randomized controlled trial is to compare the efficacy of TIPS with that of endoscopic sclerotherapy in the prevention of variceal rebleeding in cirrhosis. Eighty-one cirrhotic patients, with endoscopically proven variceal bleeding, were randomized to either TIPS (38 patients) or endoscopic sclerotherapy (43 patients). Randomization was stratified according to the following: if bleeding occurred < 1 week (stratum I) if bleeding occurred 1 to 6 weeks (stratum II)
