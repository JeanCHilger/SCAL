Lobar atrophy of the liver. Lobar atrophy of the liver due to causes other than liver tumor or liver cirrhosis is a relatively rare pathological condition, and there are only a few reports in the literature. We report six such cases and try to evaluate the relationship between lobar atrophy and portal flow disturbance. The patients could be divided into two groups according to the site of the atrophy: those with atrophy of the left lobe (two cases) and those with atrophy of the right lobe (four cases). The two cases with atrophy of the right lobe had hepatholithiasis in the involved segments, but the cause was not determined in the remaining four cases. In all six cases, portal flow disturbance was noted, including invisibility of the portal vein in four cases, narrowing in one case, and portal thrombus in one case. Collateral circulation was not recognized in any of our cases. Of interest is the mode of lobar atrophy. Atrophy of the right lobe was always associated with marked enlargement of the left lobe, but that of the left lobe did not induce an enlargement of the right lobe.
