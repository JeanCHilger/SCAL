Preeclampsia with fetal death in a patient with schistosomiasis japonica. A case of preeclampsia with fetal death at 32 weeks' gestation is reported. Liver examination of the patient revealed network patterns on ultrasonography and linear calcifications on unenhanced CT scans in the liver. These findings are typical of those of chronic schistosomal infection. Indeed, liver biopsy specimens showed eggs of schistosoma japonicum. We diagnosed her case as preeclampsia with liver cirrhosis due to chronic schistosomiasis japonica. Schistosomal placentitis may have been present and may have contributed to preeclampsia and fetal death.
