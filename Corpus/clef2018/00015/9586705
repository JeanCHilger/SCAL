Comparison of sonograms and liver histologic findings in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Gray scale ultrasonographic images of the liver were correlated with histologic findings in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The gray scale patterns of 64 livers with chronic hepatitis C virus infection were categorized as normal, fatty, fibrofatty, fibrotic, or inflammatory and were graded as mild, moderate, or severe. Liver biopsy specimens also were analyzed for the presence of fat, inflammation, and fibrosis and graded similarly. No correlation was found between fatty and fibrofatty sonographic findings with any of the three histologic patterns. Correlations were found between fibrotic sonographic findings and both fibrotic and inflammatory histologic findings (r = 0.27 P = 0.03). Although some pathologic features of liver disease were detected by ultrasonography, no useful correlation was noted between results of sonography and histologic examination.
