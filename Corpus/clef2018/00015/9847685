Cirrhosis of the liver as a precancerous condition. Cirrhosis of the liver can be regarded as premalignant state, since more than 80 percent of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the western world develop in a cirrhotic liver. The risk to develop this malignancy depends on the activity of the underlying cirrhosis, its etiology and the duration of the disease. Patients suffering from cirrhosis of the liver due to HBV-, HCV- or HDV-infection and patients with genetic hemochromatosis exhibit a high risk for HCC. This risk is further increased by cocarcinogens, such as alcohol, nicotine and toxins. Ultrasound and AFP-studies aim to diagnose HCC early. The sensitivity of AFP in the serum is remarkably low (about 64%). In contrast a normal AFP-concentration (< 20 ng/ml) carries a high negative prognostic value (> 90%). Patients suspected to suffer from HCC according to the results of screening procedures should be subjected to additional radiologic investigations, such as CT-arterioportography or lipiodol-angiography.
