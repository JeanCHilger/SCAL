Pre- and post-operative changes in serum levels of glycocholic acid and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine and their clinical significance in patients with cholelithiasis. Pre- and post-operative changes of serum glycine-conjugated cholic acid (CG) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) levels were observed in twenty-two patients with cholelithiasis. The increase of the levels of serum CG varied with the patients the highest levels were seen in patients with cirrhosis. After operation, the levels of serum CG and T3 were decreased significantly in patients without cirrhosis. There was positive correlation between serum CG and T3 (r = 0.4667, P < 0.01). It is indicated that the lowering of serum CG after operation may be related to the lowering of serum T3
