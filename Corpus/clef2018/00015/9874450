Serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity and early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma: a prospective study of patients with cirrhosis. Serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity is considered a marker of hepatocellular carcinoma. To the authors' knowledge, its clinical usefulness in the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in the follow-up of cirrhotic patients has not been reported previously.The authors prospectively studied serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity, in addition to alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasonography, in a regular screening of 132 cirrhotic patients during an 8-year follow-up.At enrollment, 120 patients had low alpha-L-fucosidase activity (below the cutoff value) and 12 had high activity. All patients had serum alpha-fetoprotein levels below the cutoff value. During the follow-up, hepatocellular carcinoma was detected in 19 patients, 16 with alpha-L-fucosidase activity below the cutoff value at enrollment and 3 with activity above it. In 7 of those 16 patients with carcinoma and low enzyme activity, the enzyme activity showed a significant increase 6-9 months before there was ultrasonographic evidence of a focal lesion, and by the time of diagnosis it had risen above the cutoff value in all of them in only 3 of the 7 patients was the increase in alpha-L-fucosidase activity associated with an increase in alpha-fetoprotein. In another 4 of the 19 patients with carcinoma, only alpha-fetoprotein increased.Serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity is useful in the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma. The data from this study suggest that cirrhotic patients who have a marked increase in serum alpha-L-fucosidase levels during follow-up should be closely monitored for signs of hepatocellular carcinoma development.
