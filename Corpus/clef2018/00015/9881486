Hepatic blood flow changes in chronic hepatitis C measured by duplex Doppler color sonography: relationship to histological features. Our aim was to determine if portal vein and hepatic artery blood flow indices are a noninvasive index of severity of liver disease in chronic hepatitis C. The effect of interferon-alpha treatment on liver blood flow was also studied. Liver blood flow measurements were recorded by duplex Doppler color sonography in 39 patients with chronic hepatitis C, 50 healthy controls, and a single patient with hepatocellular carcinoma. Doppler perfusion index (DPI) (calculated as the ratio of hepatic artery flow to total hepatic flow) and the congestive index of the portal vein (area/velocity) were calculated. Liver biopsies were scored for hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Hepatic arterial flow (415.7+/-329.1 ml/min vs 195.1+/-103.5 ml/min) and DPI (0.27+/-0.14 vs. 0.17+/-0.06) were elevated in chronic hepatitis C patients compared to controls (P = 0.0002 and 0.0003, respectively) while portal vein flow and total hepatic flow were similar. Portal vein congestive index was similar in chronic hepatitis C (0.106+/-0.05) compared to controls (0.125+/-0.08) P 0.52. Hepatic blood flow indices were not related to the grade of hepatic inflammation or the stage of hepatic fibrosis. Twelve weeks of treatment with interferon-alpha had no effect on liver blood flow. In conclusion, patients with chronic hepatitis C have elevated hepatic artery blood flow. Hepatic blood flow indices have no relationship to the severity of histological liver injury in chronic hepatitis C, and these flow indices are unaffected by a 12-week course of interferon-alpha.
