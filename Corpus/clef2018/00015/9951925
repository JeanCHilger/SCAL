Transient spontaneous regression of hepatocellular carcinoma. We report on 2 patients with liver cirrhosis and biopsy-proven hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent spontaneous regression. In 1 case the tumor became undetectable at ultrasonography, while, in the other, the liver lesions decreased in size and showed inner calcifications. In both patients, alpha-fetoprotein, which was high at first diagnosis, returned to normal values. After a tumor-free period of 4 years and 17 months, respectively, liver cancer reappeared and patients died from complications. We advance the hypothesis that tumor regression, when it occurs in cirrhotic patients, is always transient, with chronic liver disease being the oncogenic triggering factor.
