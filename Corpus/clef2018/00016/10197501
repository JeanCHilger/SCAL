Patent ductus venosus. Patent ductus venosus is extremely rare with only 14 cases reported in the world literature. We present a case of patent ductus venosus.A 29-year-old male was admitted with melaena stool caused by gastric haemorrhagic ulcers. Laboratory data disclosed severe anaemia however, liver function tests were normal. Serum ammonia was also within the normal range. Serological viral markers for hepatitis B or C were all negative. The abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography indicated a 12 mm diameter shunt located in the left lobe of the liver, which connected the portal vein with the left hepatic vein. After treatment for gastric ulcers, percutaneous transhepatic portography was performed and an enormous shunt connecting the umbilical portion of the portal vein with the left hepatic vein was revealed.Histological findings of the liver biopsy showed that portal venules could not be observed in the portal areas and that no fibrosis or inflammatory cell infiltration were shown. Because of the anatomical position of the shunt, the case was diagnosed as patent ductus venosus.
