A fibrolamellar variety of hepatocarcinoma in a young woman 17 years old. We report here the case of a 17-year-old female with typical fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, no hepatitis B or C viral infection and a normal, non-cirrhotic liver. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a solid tumor with a central fibrous scar. A fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma is an uncommon malignancy of unknown etiology, without cirrhosis, usually without an increase in tumor markers, and rarely associated with hepatitis B virus. It occurs mainly in young patients. This tumor presents a high resectability rate (48-100%), a good prognosis and a mean survival of 68 months. This tumor is an important differential diagnosis of space occupying lesions in younger adults.
