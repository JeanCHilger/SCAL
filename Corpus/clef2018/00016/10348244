Relationships between several markers of extracellular matrix turn-over and ultrasonography in human Schistosomiasis mansoni. We measured the concentrations of several serum and urinary fibrosis markers, which are metabolites of extracellular matrix, in schistosomiasis patients to investigate their relationship with the ultrasonographic scoring system and with parasitologic data. This study was conducted in patients with various stages of the disease evaluated by ultrasonography (intestinal disease with no organ involvement, with minor hepatosplenic involvement and with severe disease) and in endemic controls. The level of hyaluronan, which were increased in infected patients compared with controls (P < 0.01), was the only fibrosis marker that correlated with the ultrasonographic score (P = 0.003) and is thus a potential serum marker of schistosomiasis-associated morbidity. Urinary free pyridinoline levels were lower (P < 0.001) in infected patients with fibrosis (score > or = 1) than in nonfibrotic patients. A two-year follow-up of the patients treated with praziquantel showed that type I collagen and hyaluronan decreased during the first year post-treatment, whereas free pyridinolines peaked after 12 months and decreased thereafter.
