Cancer antigen 125: a sensitive marker of ascites in patients with liver cirrhosis. Cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) is a high molecular mass glycoprotein, usually used for monitoring the course of epithelial ovarian cancer. Recently it has been shown that liver cirrhosis is associated with increased levels of CA 125, particularly in the presence of ascites. The aim of this study was to evaluate CA 125 as a marker for the detection of ascites in patients with chronic liver disease.A total of 170 patients were studied. All had ultrasound scanning for detection of ascites. Group I consisted of 123 patients with chronic liver disease without ascites whereas group II consisted of 47 patients with chronic liver disease with ascites. CA 125 levels were measured in all patients and also simultaneously in the ascitic fluid of 31 patients from group II.Of 47 patients, 46 (97.8%) of group II had elevated serum levels of CA 125 (mean 321 +/- 283 U/ml) as compared with only nine of 123 (7.3%) patients of group I [mean 13 +/- 15 U/ml]), p < 0.001. The mean CA 125 concentration in the ascitic fluid of 31 cirrhotic patients (group II) was 624 +/- 397 U/ml and was always higher than corresponding serum levels (p < 0.01). Serum CA 125 levels correlated with the amount of ascitic fluid (r = 0.78). A profound decrease in serum CA 125 concentration was noted 2-3 and 10 days after large volume paracentesis. CA 125 was more sensitive and preceded ultrasonography in detection of ascites in few cirrhotic patients.CA 125 is a highly sensitive marker to detect ascites in patients with liver cirrhosis. This marker may be useful to detect small to moderate amounts of ascitic fluid in cirrhotic patients when physical examination is difficult or equivocal for ascites.
