An aged male patient with autoimmune hepatitis complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma. An 82-year-old male patient was admitted for liver dysfunction. Laboratory test showed the following data aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 79 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 28 IU/l, total bilirubin (T. Bil) 0.9 U, zinc sulfate turbidity test (ZTT) 48.9 U, gamma-globulin 4.9 g/dl, immunoglobulin G (IgG) 5,046 mg/dl, anti-nuclear antibodies x 320, anti-mitochondrial antibodies (-), hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) (-), HBcAb (-), anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) (-), hepatitis C virus (HCV-RNA) (-), anti-hepatitis G virus (anti-HGV) (-), alpha-fetoprotein 306.8 ng/ml, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 2.3 ng/ml, carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 77.2 U/ml. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a large mass occupying most of the right lobe and portal thrombosis in the liver. Liver biopsy revealed cirrhosis with inactive hepatitis in the nontumorous lesion and well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma in the tumorous lesion. We report a rare case of an aged male patient with autoimmune hepatitis complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma.
