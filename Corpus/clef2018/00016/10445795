Peri-hepatic lymphadenopathy in primary biliary cirrhosis reflects progression of the disease. We prospectively investigated the peri-hepatic lymph node volume in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and healthy controls to evaluate the correlation with histology, biochemical and immunological features.The total peri-hepatic lymph node volume in the liver hilus was evaluated by high-resolution ultrasound in 67 consecutive patients with PBC and in 43 healthy controls. Stages I-IV of PBC were biochemically, immunologically and histologically proven in all patients.Adequate visualization of the liver hilus was achieved in 59/67 patients (88%) with PBC and in 39/43 healthy controls (91%). Lymph nodes in the liver hilus were sonographically detected in all 59 patients with PBC and in 26/39 healthy controls (67%) with adequate visualization of the liver hilus. The mean peri-hepatic lymph node volumes were: stage I (n = 9): 0.8 +/- 0.5 ml stage II (n = 28): 2.4 +/- 1.5 mlEnlarged lymph nodes in the liver hilus are sonographically detectable in almost all patients with PBC. The total peri-hepatic lymph node volume in patients with PBC reflects histological stage, i.e. larger lymph nodes are observed in more advanced disease.
