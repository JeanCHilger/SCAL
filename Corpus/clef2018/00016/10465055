Diagnostic value of connective tissue metabolites in Schistosoma mansoni related liver disease. Reliable non-invasive markers of hepatosplenic involvement in schistosomiasis are needed for determination of morbidity levels in endemic populations and for diagnosis and follow-up of affected individuals. Serum levels of connective tissue metabolites have been investigated as fibrosis markers in various hepatic disorders, but their accuracy in the detection of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis under endemic conditions has not been fully elucidated. 206 adult inhabitants of a Tanzanian village highly endemic for schistosomiasis mansoni (prevalence 88%) underwent clinical, parasitological and sonographic work-up sera were tested for aminoterminal procollagen III-peptide (PIIIP), carboxyterminal procollagen IV peptide (NC1) and laminin. Connective tissue marker levels did not correlate with the presence or intensity of infection. NC1 levels were significantly correlated with periportal liver fibrosis (P < 0.001), splenomegaly (P < 0.002), portal vein dilatation (P < 0.004) and the presence of portosystemic collaterals (P < 0.001)
