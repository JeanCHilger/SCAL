Our experience with Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS). The transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is a relatively new interventional procedure for the treatment of portal hypertension. It helps to stop the hemorrhage from varices. Decreases the risk of rebleeding and the quantity of ascites. 32 patient underwent the intervention from the May of 1995 until October of 1998. Majority of cases belong to Childs'B and C type. In the anamnesis there were 24 alcoholic cirrhosis. Shunt patency, complications and survival were analyzed. TIPS was successfully placed in 27 patients (84%). Portocaval pressure gradient decreased from 22 mmHg to 10.3 mmHg. There was no treatment related mortality. The average follow up was 14 months. In two patients the stents are patent for 36 months. Two stents became stenotic and there were nine occlusions within three years. Hepatic encephalopathy occurred in two cases. The TIPS is a safe, alternative interventional radiological therapy in the cure of portal hypertension without the mortality and morbidity of an open surgical procedure. By the use of TIPS the portosystemic gradient decrease successfully and can be ruled.
