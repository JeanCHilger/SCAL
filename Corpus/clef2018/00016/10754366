A large spontaneous splenorenal shunt in a patient with liver cirrhosis and uncomplicated portal hypertension. The aim of this paper is to describe and discuss, on the basis of a thorough review of the literature, the case of a 70-year-old woman with probable cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis B and C, uncomplicated portal hypertension (without ascites, encephalopathy or bleeding varices), splenomegaly and hypersplenism, and an unusual, spontaneous, large splenorenal shunt and recanalization of the umbilical vein. The tortuous and varicose splenorenal shunt was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound and CT investigations. A duplex Doppler ultrasonography evaluation was performed to study shunt flow direction and velocity. No gastroesophageal varices were identified on endoscopic examination. The clinical relevance of spontaneous splenorenal shunt, often associated with fundic gastric varices, is discussed.
