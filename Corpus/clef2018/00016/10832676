Erythropoietic protoporphyria with severe liver dysfunction and acute pancreatitis. A case of erythropoietic protoporphyria associated with severe hepatic dysfunction and acute pancreatitis is reported. The patient, a 33-year-old man, was admitted to our hospital complaining of upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting of 3 days' duration. Laboratory tests on admission demonstrated liver dysfunction, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. On the third hospital day, the intensity of the upper abdominal pain increased, concomitantly with elevated levels of serum amylase. Ultrasonography and computed tomography scanning revealed a slightly enlarged pancreas. During this episode, he also complained of various neurological symptoms, including reduced mental alertness, weakness of extremities, constipation, profound sweating, and urinary retention. Porphyrin studies demonstrated markedly elevated erythrocyte and fecal protoporphyrin levels. Laparoscopic findings obtained after the attack subsided were compatible with porphyric liver cirrhosis. We therefore concluded that neurologic disorders and acute pancreatitis could develop in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria with severe liver dysfunction.
