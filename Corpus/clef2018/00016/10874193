Interstitial laser photocoagulation under ultrasound guidance of liver tumors: results in 104 treated patients. To evaluate the efficacy and complications of interstitial laser photocoagulation (ILP) under ultrasound (US) guidance as a technique for focal ablation of liver tumors in patients with normal and impaired hepatic function.A total of 104 patients, 77 with 85 nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhosis (29 in Child-Pugh A class, 43 in B e 5 in C class) and 27 patients with hepatic metastases (25 from colon, two from lung carcinoma) underwent ILP under US guidance. Depending on tumor size up to four needles were inserted in the tumor and multiple laser illuminations were performed in one or multiple sessions. Necrosis of the nodules was evaluated with triphasic contrast-enhanced CT.Ninety-four patients underwent a single ILP session and nine patients two sessions. CT showed complete necrosis in 70 out of 85 HCC nodules in 65 treated patients and in 24 out of 31 patients with metastases. Three Child C class patients dropped out the control of efficacy by CT because of severe liver failure associated in one case with transient paralytic ileum. One of these patients died 2 months after treatment. Two patients with metastasis dropped the completion of the treatment because of complication occurred after the ILP session (one paralytic ileum, one gastric haemorrage).ILP under US guidance is effective in inducing complete necrosis in small and large liver tumors. Nevertheless, ILP can cause severe derangement of liver function in patients with advanced cirrhosis.
