Determining resectability for hepatocellular carcinoma: the role of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography. We reviewed our experience with preoperative determination of resectability in patients with hepatocel-lular carcinoma (HCC) over the last 10 years, and evaluated the role of laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasonography (USG) since we instituted this technique in June 1994. From January 1989 to December 1998, 500 of 1741 patients with HCC (28.7%) were considered suitable for hepatic resection after preoperative assessment. Significantly more contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans and fewer percutaneous USGs or hepatic arteriograms were performed in the 299 patients managed since June 1994 (group 2) than in the 201 patients managed before then (group 1). One hundred and ninety-eight patients in group 2 (66%) underwent laparoscopy with laparoscopic USG. Unresectable disease was found in 41 patients in group 1 (20.4%) (all at laparotomy), and in 68 patients in group 2 (22.7%) (16 at laparotomy without laparoscopic examination, 31 at laparoscopic examination alone, and 21 at laparotomy after an inconclusive laparoscopic examination) (P = 0.5). The most common features of unresectable disease were the presence of bilobar intrahepatic metastases and an inadequate liver remnant with cirrhosis. The adoption of the laparoscopic examination after June 1994 improved the overall resection rate at laparotomy in group 2 from 77.3% to 86. 2%, which was better than that in group 1 (79.6%, P = 0.057). For patients with unresectable disease, the operation time and hospital stay were significantly shorter in group 2. The postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 9.8% and 4.9%, respectively, in group 1, and 5.9% and 2.9% in group 2. There was no operative morbidity in the 31 patients who had unresectable disease detected by the laparoscopic examination alone. Laparoscopy with laparoscopic USG avoids unnecessary laparotomy, and has a definite role in determining resectability in patients with HCC.
