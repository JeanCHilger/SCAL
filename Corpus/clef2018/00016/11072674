Bacillary angiomatosis of the liver, a suspected ultrasound diagnosis?. Infections with Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana present with vasoproliferative lesions in skin and parenchymatous organs in immunocompromised patients. A case report of a 38-year-old patient with HIV infection and hepatitis B surface antigen status is described. The dominant clinical symptoms in our patient were fever and icterus. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed a picture similar to that of liver cirrhosis. Irregular (echorich) nodes with hyper-vascularization were suspected to be hepatocellular carcinoma. Ultrasound guided puncture of one of these lesions and histological examination revealed the diagnosis of bartonella infection. Under antibiotic treatment with clarithromycin and doxycycline the fever and the hyperbilirubinemia decreased. The sonographically detectable lesions reduced in size. Vasoproliferative lesions in immunodeficient patients caused by bartonella infection show a characteristic slightly hyperechogenic irregular pattern at ultrasound. Typically, circumscribed hypervascularization might be shown by color Doppler imaging. Liver cirrhosis and diffuse tumor infiltration should be excluded.
