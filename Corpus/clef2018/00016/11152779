Hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer: preoperative detection and assessment of resectability with helical CT. To prospectively evaluate helical computed tomography (CT) in the preoperative detection of hepatic metastases and assessment of resectability with surgical, intraoperative ultrasonographic (US), and histopathologic correlation.Between October 1995 and December 1998, preoperative staging with helical CT (5-mm collimation reconstruction interval, 5 mm) was performed in 157 patients with hepatic metastases. Iodinated contrast material was injected intravenously (160-170 mLIntraoperative US, palpation, and histopathologic examination revealed 290 liver metastases helical CT correctly depicted 247. Helical CT results were the following: overall detection rate, 85.1% (95% CI: 80.8%, 89.3%)Helical CT is a noninvasive, reliable, and accurate technique for imaging the liver and should be considered as the standard preoperative work-up of hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer.
