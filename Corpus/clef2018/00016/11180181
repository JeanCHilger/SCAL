Association between duplex Doppler sonographic flow pattern in right hepatic vein and various liver diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the Doppler sonographic waveforms in the right hepatic vein and various liver diseases.We performed Doppler sonography of the right hepatic vein in 225 individuals (189 patients with liver disease and 36 control subjects). Patients were categorized on the basis of their histologic diagnosis: cirrhosis (n = 122), fibrosis (n = 23), fatty liver disease (n = 11), metastatic liver disease (n = 8), and noncirrhotic liver disease with neither fatty infiltration nor metastases (n = 25). The waveforms of the hepatic veins were categorized as type 1, triphasic type 2, biphasicType 1 waveforms were found in 100% of the control subjects and in patients with each of the various liver diseases, including 40% of those with cirrhosis. Type 2 waveforms were not found in control subjects or in patients with either fatty infiltration or metastatic liver disease. Type 2 waveforms were, however, found in 16% of patients with cirrhosis, 13% of patients with fibrosis, and 4% of patients with other noncirrhotic liver diseases. Type 3 waveforms were found in 43% of patients with liver cirrhosis, 13% of patients with liver fibrosis, 27% of patients with fatty liver disease, and 50% of patients with metastatic liver disease. In contrast, type 3 waveforms were not found in any control subjects or in patients with other noncirrhotic liver diseases without fatty liver or metastases.Type 3 waveforms in the right hepatic vein are suggestive of liver cirrhosis, although they may also occur in patients with fibrosis, fatty liver disease, or metastatic liver disease.
