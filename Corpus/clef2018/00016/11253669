Anatomical and atypical liver resections. Liver resection has evolved to an established treatment for various malignant primary and secondary hepatic tumours, some benign tumours, and other conditions. The anatomical approach, the preferred concept of the author, rests on knowledge of the intrahepatic segmentation according to the portal structure branching and the course of major hepatic veins. As most of the malignant tumours respect the corresponding intrahepatic boundaries this resectional approach offers superior tumour clearance and, probably, better long-term outcome. Besides the four standard resections along the main fissure and left intersectorial plane, respectively, there are less common sector-orientated procedures including central hepatectomies and operations along the right intersectorial plane. Segment-orientated resections are defined by additional use of the transverse boundary according to the cranially and caudally directed third-order ramification of the portal trunks. Despite the advantage of anatomical resections there are rational indications for non-anatomical procedures such as removal of small benign tumours, excision of HCC in liver cirrhosis, re-resection following major hepatectomies, an excision biopsy in a non-resectable situation, and liver trauma care. Irrespective of the resectional approach, routine use of intraoperative ultrasound, maintenance of a low central venous pressure during parenchyma transsection, intermittent hilar clamping, and ischemic preconditioning all contribute to a safe and oncologically effective operation. In the future, augmentation of the liver remnant by preoperative portal vein embolisation, and multicentre trials on multidisciplinary strategies, may help to enhance resectability and to improve both safety and long-term outcome.
