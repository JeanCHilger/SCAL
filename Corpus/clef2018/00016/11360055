Laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasound for pretreatment staging of hepatocellular carcinoma: a prospective study. Laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasound (L-LUS) has proved to be superior to conventional CT imaging in the staging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of our prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of L-LUS as compared with currently available imaging techniques (spiral CT or Lipiodol CT) in patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis. From January 1998 to May 2000, 70 consecutive patients (50 men and 20 women mean age 67 +/- 7 years) were enrolled. Liver cirrhosis was related to chronic hepatitis C virus infection in 55, hepatitis B virus infection in seven, and alcohol abuse in eight patients. Preoperative diagnostic workup included the following: 70 ultrasound examinations of the liver, 23 CT scans after Lipiodol arteriography, and 53 spiral CT scans. A single lesion was found in 39 patients, two lesions in 20 patients, and three lesions in 11 patients. L-LUS was performed in all patients under general anesthesia using a two- to three-trocar technique. The examination was completed in 68 patients (97%)
