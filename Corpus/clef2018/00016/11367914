Role of diagnostic imaging in abdominal lymphadenopathy. Abdominal lymph node chains and route of lymph drainage of various organs (stomach, duodenum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, small intestine, appendix, blind intestine, colon rectum) are analyzed according to their location. The role of conventional radiology and diagnostic imaging is evaluated in the study of abdominal lymphatic system with particular reference to lymphangiography and the new procedures of sonography, CT and MRI. Present methods used in inflammatory abdominal lymphadenopathy with special attention to tuberculous lymphadenitis, liver cirrhosis, neoplastic abdominal lymphadenopathy, colorectal and pancreatic cancer, are illustrated. Combined modality imaging is considered in gastric cancer based on the evolution of the classification of gastric lymph nodes. The role of sonography, endoscopic ultrasonography, spiral CT and MRI is assessed in gastric cancer N staging. A retrospective study is analyzed and perspectives for the application of a new CT protocol are proposed. PET potentialities in the study of abdominal lymph nodes are examined.
