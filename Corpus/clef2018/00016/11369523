Percutaneous ethanol injection: single session treatment. Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) has become one of the most widely used procedures for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis. PEI spread rapidly thanks to its ease of execution, safety, low resection cost, repeatability, therapeutic efficacy, and survival rates comparable to those of surgical resection. A new version of the procedure known as "single session" PEI, designed for treatment of large HCC under general anesthesia, was proposed in 1993.In our study of 108 patients with HCC>5 cm in diameter, 24 patients (Group A), were treated for a single and encapsulated lesions measuring from 5-8.5 cm, 63 patients (Group B), had a single and infiltrating lesions measuring from 5-10 cm or multiple HCC and 21 patients (Group C), had advanced disease.In Group A, complete necrosis was achieved in 58.3% of lesions, in Group B complete necrosis was achieved only in encapsulated lesions. In infiltrating lesions of Group B and C, complete necrosis was never obtained. Survival of patients at 3 years with encapsulated HCC was 57%, in infiltrating or multiple HCC 42%, and in advanced HCC 0%. One death due to bleeding of esophageal varices occurred in a Child's C patient. Major complications included intraperitoneal hemorrhage, an important hepatic decompensation, a transitory renal insufficiency, and two infarction of adiacent segment.Single session PEI is as effective in inducing liver tumor necrosis as traditional PEI. Its advantage are shorter treatment time and the capability of treating larger and multiple HCC. The One-shot technique proved a more aggressive therapeutic modality than traditional PEI.
