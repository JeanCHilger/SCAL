Renovascular impedance and esophageal varices in patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis. To evaluate the frequency of increased renovascular impedance and its relationship with the presence of esophageal varices in patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis without ascites.The intraparenchymal renal resistive index (RI) (reference value, <0.7) and portal congestive index (ie, the ratio between the portal cross-sectional area and mean flow velocity reference value, <0.07) were measured by using duplex Doppler ultrasonography in 50 consecutive patients. The frequency of varices was assessed endoscopically. The data were analyzed with the Fisher exact test.The renal RI was consistent with increased impedance (ie, >0.7) in 18 (36%) patients and was normal in 32 (64%). The proportion of patients with varices was significantly higher in the former group: 14 (78%) versus 10 (31%) (P =.002). In detection of the presence of varices, the renal RI was uniformly better than the portal congestive index in terms of sensitivity (58% vs. 48%), specificity (84% vs 54%), and positive (3.60 vs 1.04) and negative (0.50 vs. 0.96) likelihood ratios. RI determination improved the ability to exclude the presence of varices from a basal pretest probability of 52% (26 of 50 patients) to a final one of 69% (22 of 32 patients) and that of predicting the presence of varices from 48% (24 of 50 patients) to 78% (14 of 18 patients).A substantial proportion of patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis without ascites have increased renovascular impedance this significantly correlates with the presence of varices.
