Doppler ultrasonography in the assessment of renal hemodynamics in patients with chronic liver disease. To assess renal hemodynamics by Doppler analysis of resistive index (RI) in small intrarenal arteries in patients with chronic liver diseases at different stages, and to analyze renal RI in patients with cirrhosis as a function of the absence or presence of ascites and the response to diuretic therapy.Prospective cross-sectional study of 24 patients with chronic hepatitis, 39 with compensated cirrhosis, and 34 with ascites. The last group was divided into two subgroups: 1) responders to sodium restriction and a low dose of diuretics, and 2) patients with refractory ascites or those requiring high-dose therapy.Renal RI was increased in patients with cirrhosis and ascites (0.68 +/- 0.06) in comparison with patients with compensated cirrhosis (0.63 +/- 0.03, p < 0.01). Renal RI in the latter group was higher than in patients without cirrhosis (0.61 +/- 0.04, p < 0.05). Renal RI in patients with ascites was lower in subgroup 1 than in subgroup 2 (0.65 +/- 0.05 vs 0.72 +/- 0.06, p < 0.01).Renal RI increases as liver disease progresses. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites and increased RI require high-dose treatment or do not respond. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the predictive value of renal RI in assessing the effectiveness of diuretic therapy.
