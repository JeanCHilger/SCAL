Abdominal obesity: metabolic complications and consequences for the liver. Obesity is associated with a number of metabolic and haemodynamic risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This risk depends on a complex of metabolic and haemodynamic consequences of (visceral) fat accumulation, which probably results from the continuous delivery of fatty acids to the liver via the portal vein. Hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, hypertension, insulin resistance and increased hepatic glucose production are all independent risk factors for atherosclerosis. Their combination increases the risk of cardiovascular disease considerably. Triglyceride storage in hepatocytes is another consequence of increased fatty acid supply to the liver. Until recently, hepatic steatosis was considered a harmless condition secondary to obesity or alcoholism. However, it may lead to non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis, which predisposes to liver fibrosis and even cirrhosis.
