Thoracoscopic thermal ablation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma located beneath the diaphragm. Percutaneous interstitial thermal ablation therapy effectively treats hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that can be visualized on percutaneous ultrasonography. However, when the tumor is located just under the top of the diaphragm, visualization can be difficult with conventional ultrasonographic examination. There are also problems concerning complete tumor ablation. We performed thoracoscopic thermal ablation therapy for HCC located just beneath the diaphragm in nine patients with advanced liver cirrhosis.Eight patients underwent thoracoscopic microwave coagulation therapy, and one patient underwent thoracoscopic radiofrequency ablation therapy.Despite the poor hepatic reserve, postoperative recovery after thoracoscopic thermal ablation therapy was rapid in all patients, without deterioration of hepatic function.This preliminary study suggests that the new technique of thoracoscopic thermal ablation therapy is a less invasive optional therapy for HCC located in segments VII or VIII in cirrhotic patients.
