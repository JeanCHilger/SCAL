Hepatic vein transit time of an ultrasound contrast agent: simplified procedure using pulse inversion imaging. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether a new ultrasound technique, namely pulse inversion imaging, could assess the arrival of a contrast agent in the hepatic veins, and to describe possible advantages of this procedure in determining transit time over a previously described method based upon spectral Doppler quantification. 15 subjects were scanned using pulse inversion imaging. A bolus injection of 2.5 g Levovist (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) 300 mg x ml(-1) was given into an antecubital vein. Median transit times of 16 s (range 14-20 s) were found in patients with liver cirrhosis (n=4), 22 s (range 16-27 s) in patients with focal liver lesions (n=8) and 31 s (range 30-32 s) in control subjects (n=3). The maximum interobserver variation was 2 s and the maximum intraobserver variation was 3 s (n=10). Transit time was assessed by both pulse inversion imaging and spectral Doppler quantification in six patients. Comparison of the two methods showed transit times within 2 s apart in five patients and within 5 s apart in one patient. In conclusion, it is possible to assess transit time using pulse inversion imaging. This method is simpler than a previously described method requiring computer analysis. Moreover, several liver veins can be assessed simultaneously. Different transit times were observed in different liver veins in two patients with liver tumours. A short transit time (<27 s) appears to be found only in patients with liver disease. After transit time assessment, it is possible to use the injected contrast agent for late phase imaging of the liver parenchyma.
