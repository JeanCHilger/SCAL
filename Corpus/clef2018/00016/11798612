Determination and significance of serum markers for fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis. To find the relationship between serum levels of hyaluronic acid (HA), type III procollagen (PC III), laminin (LN), type IV collagen (IV-C) and hepatic fibrosis as well as to determine their value in clinical practice.2600 serum samples from chronic hepatitis patients were tested with RIA for fibrosis indexes assays including HA, PC III, LN and IV-C. 280 of the patients with serum samples taken had liver biopsy performed and the biopsy material was examine pathomorphologically. Fibrosis indexes were compared according to inflammation grade, fibrosis stage and chronic hepatitis degree.In the 2600 serum samples from chronic hepatitis patients, fibrosis indexes (including HA, PC III, LN and IV-C) had significant correlation with inflammation grade, fibrosis stage and the degree of chronic hepatitis (P < 0.01). The relating indexes to HA were 0.544, 0.548, 0.468 respectively, to PC III 0.495, 0.424, 0.335 respectively, to LN 0.214, 0.204, 0.184 and to IV-C were 0.464, 0.404, 0.412 respectively.Serum fibrosis indexes are fairly well correlated with the inflammation grade, fibrosis stage and the degree of chronic hepatitis. However, as diagnostic markers, they must be combined with liver function, ultrasonography and clinical features.
