Paradoxical air embolism during hepatic resection. Systemic venous air embolism is a serious complication in patients with chronic liver disease having liver surgery. Intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunting can permit air emboli to pass into the systemic circulation. We describe a case of paradoxical air embolism detected by transoesophageal echocardiography in a patient with cirrhosis who was having a hepatic resection.
