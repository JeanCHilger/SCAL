Study on improvement of liver cirrhosis and liver function in hepatolenticular degeneration patients treated with integrated Traditional and Western medicine. To observe the effects of sodium dimercaptosulphonate (DMPS) plus Gandou tablet, DMPS and calcium disodium ethylene diaminotetraacetate (EDTA) on improving liver cirrhosis and liver function of hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD) patients.One hundred and forty-six HLD patients were divided into A, B, C three groups, and treated with DMPS plus Gandou tablet, DMPS and EDTA respectively, the therapeutic course was 8 weeks for three groups. The ultrasonography of liver, electrophoresis of serum protein and excretion of urinary copper were observed.The ultrasonography of liver was improved in all groups, the rate of improvement of group A was 54.0%, B was 44.0% and C was 39.1%. The amounts of serum albumin in A and B groups increased (P < 0.01, P < 0.05), and gamma-globulin decreased in all groups (P < 0.05). The excretion of urinary copper increased obviously in all groups (P < 0.01), and A, B groups increased more than that of C group (P < 0.05).The de-copper therapy could improve liver cirrhosis and liver function. The effect of DMPS plus Gandou tablet was better than that of DMPS and EDTA.
