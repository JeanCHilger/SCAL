New ultrasound techniques. Modern ultrasound technologies can be divided into methods of visual image improvement/presentation, image quantification, and echo contrast agent applications. Image improvement can be realized by options such as Photopic, tissue harmonic imaging, and panorama methods. Parametric ultrasound quantifies observer-independent image textures. Echo contrast agents offer a better detection of tumor lesions and vascular kinetic investigations.
