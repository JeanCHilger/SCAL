Sinusoidal abnormalities of the liver: MR imaging features. This article reviews the different MR features found in sinusoidal lesions of the liver parenchyma. The diagnosis of these abnormalities is mainly based on the pathologic examination. These diagnoses relate to numerous diseases including veno-occlusive disease, Budd-Chiari disease, peliosis, hepato-portal sclerosis, and portal intra-sinusoidal thrombosis. The use of fast multi-slice acquisitions associated with dynamic enhancement of the liver leads to an efficient examination and allows analysis of both the parenchymal and vascular components of the liver.
