Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in non-lithiasis cholecystopathies. We made a study in 1st Surgery Clinic of Iassy between March 93--November 98, with 2246 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The reason was to define the place and role of laparoscopy in non-lithiasis cholecystopathies (81 cases). In the same period were operated classically 888 calculous cholecystitis and 38 non-lithiasis cholecystitis. The laparoscopy has a major role in diagnosis to the patients with many abdominal symptoms. We discovered pericholecystic adherences, hepatic cirrhosis, acute appendicitis, etc. Sometimes, the laparoscopy was made for "second look" after surgical treatment for neoplasia, the metastasis diagnosis, for tumors visible echographically. In many situations the laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be considered like a preventive operation. The easy postoperative evolution is an argument to enlarge the indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in alithiasis cholecystitis.
