Thyroid hypoechogenicity in patients with chronic hepatitis receiving interferon-alpha therapy: evaluation by standardized grey scale ultrasonography. Recombinant human interferon-a therapy of chronic hepatitis B and C is associated with the induction of thyroid dysfunction in up to 15%. Little is known about morphological changes of the thyroid gland, especially about its tissue echogenicity under this immunomodulative drug treatment.116 patients with chronic hepatitis B or C were consecutively investigated. 53 patients qualified for treatment with interferon-a alone or in combination with ribavirin. Patients with normal serum aminotransferase levels, advanced liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, active intravenous drug or alcohol abusus and with focal thyroid lesions (nodes, cysts, calcifications) were excluded. Thyroid function was determined by measurements of FT4, TSH and thyroidal autoantibodies. Ultrasonography was performed before, during and after interferon-a therapy including volumetry and standardized grey scale analysis. The data were compared with values of 100 euthyroid volunteers as control group.After six months of therapy patients differed from controls by significant TSH elevation (12.8 +/- 9.34 vs. 2.8 +/- 1.1 microU/ml, p<0.02). Six patients (11%) developed overt hypothyroidism with detectable thyroidal autoantibodies. Thyroid volume in patients was similar (13.0 +/- 4.1 ml) to that in the control group (12.6 +/- 4.7 ml). However, thyroid echogenicity of the patients was significantly lower after 6 months of therapy (21.9 +/- 2.5 grey scales) compared to the status before (25.6 +/- 2.3 grey scales) and compared to the values of controls (25.4 +/- 2.1 grey scales, p <0.002).Beside of functional disorders interferon-alpha leads to thyroid hypoechogenicity suggesting relevant morphological changes of the organ.
