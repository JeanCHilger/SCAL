Increased frequency of gallstones in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. The prevalence of gallstones is high in cirrhotics compared with the general population. It is not clear whether cirrhosis per se or presence of portal hypertension influences this increased frequency.Six hundred and fifteen patients with portal hypertension 412 cirrhosis (69 alcoholic and 343 non-alcoholic), 88 non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF) and 115 extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO) were prospectively studied by using real time ultrasound to investigate the prevalence of gallstones in comparison to a matched healthy population.Gallstones were observed in 44 (7.2%) portal hypertension patients compared with 19 (3.1%) controls (p < 0.01), the risk ratio was 2.41 (CI=1.35-4.35, OR 95%). The prevalence of gallstones was 6.8% in cirrhosis, 10.2% in NCPF and 4.3% in EHPVO patients. The overall prevalence was similar in cirrhosis and non-cirrhotics (6.8% vs 6.6%). Gallstones were slightly more common in alcoholic than non-alcoholic cirrhotics (8.3% vs. 6.0%), patients with Child's C than A and B disease (8.2% vs. 5.4%), the differences were however, not significant. Portal pressure as assessed by intravariceal pressure estimation (n=102) was comparable in patients with cirrhosis, NCPF and EHPVO.(i) Gallstones are more than two times common in portal hypertension patients compared to the control population, and (ii) since gall stones are equally common in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension a role of portal hypertension per se in the genesis of gallstones needs to be considered.
