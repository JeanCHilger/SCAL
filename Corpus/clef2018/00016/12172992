Hepatofugal portal flow in advanced liver cirrhosis with spontaneous portosystemic shunts: effects on parenchymal hepatic enhancement at dual-phase helical CT. We investigated whether spontaneous hepatofugal portal flow in advanced cirrhosis affects hepatic enhancement on dual-phase helical computed tomography.Fifteen patients with hepatofugal portal flow on Doppler sonography and angiography (group 1) and 15 age- and sex-matched patients with hepatopetal portal flow (control group 2) underwent dual-phase helical computed tomography. Vascular and liver attenuation values were measured on unenhanced scans and scans obtained during hepatic arterial (HAPPortal vein enhancement was lower during PVP in group 1 than in group 2 ( p < 0.0001). Liver enhancement was higher during HAP and lower and delayed during PVP in group 1 versus group 2 ( p < 0.0001).In hepatofugal portal flow, liver enhancement is increased during HAP and compensating for decreased and delayed liver enhancement during PVP, resulting in potential decreased hypervascular tumor conspicuity.
