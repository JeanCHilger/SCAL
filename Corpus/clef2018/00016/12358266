Comparison of prevalence for paraumbilical vein patency in patients with viral and alcoholic liver cirrhosis. The patent paraumbilical vein (PUV) is a venous collateral that is often found in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. It can be effectively demonstrated by conventional ultrasonography (US). We conducted this prospective study to elucidate the prevalence and etiology of PUV patency for cirrhotic patients.From August, 1997, to July, 1998, one of the authors (S.-N.L.) observed PUV patency for all cirrhotic patients during routine upper abdominal US examination. All cirrhotic patients diagnosed with portal hypertension were further analyzed. Portal hypertension was diagnosed by sonographic evidence of splenomegaly or ascites, or endoscopic varices. Cases presenting with hepatocellular carcinoma and sonographic evidence of prehepatic portal hypertension were excluded. Once a PUV patency with a diameter of > or = 3 mm was suspected based on conventional US, it was confirmed by color Doppler US. Of the 493 cirrhotic patients examined, 252 with portal hypertension and without hepatoma were enrolled in this study.Significant PUV patency was detected in 11.1% of the enrolled patients (28 of 252). With univariate analysis, a significantly higher prevalence was demonstrated for alcoholic patients (p < 0.0001), whereas prevalence was relatively low for those with chronic hepatitis B or C infection (p = 0.0159). A trend toward increased prevalence was noted with Child-Pugh classification (p = 0.001). Furthermore, a higher prevalence was noted in younger cirrhotic patients (p = 0.0037). Alcoholism was still a significant factor despite adjustment of Child-Pugh classification using multiple logistic regression, (OR = 3.88, 95% CI = 1.34-8.55).A significantly higher prevalence of PUV patency was demonstrated for patients with alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis in comparison to those with postviral cirrhosis.
