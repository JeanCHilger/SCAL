Viral cirrhosis with chronic right heart failure and cardiac liver sclerosis: a hypothesis on the differentiation between the two diseases through pulsed Doppler sonography examination. Chronic right heart failure determines cardiac liver sclerosis as a consequence of the hepatic venous congestion that is easily detectable with pulsed Doppler sonography measuring hepatic venous pulsatility. These Doppler parameters profoundly change on the basis of the causative agent of the liver sclerosis. In fact, on pulsed Doppler examination, we detected a flat waveform in hepatic veins of subjects with viral liver cirrhosis whereas we only observed biphasic waveforms in subjects with cardiac liver sclerosis. On the contrary, a pulsed Doppler sonography pattern in subjects with viral cirrhosis and associated chronic right heart failure is unknown. We suppose that splanchnic pulsed Doppler sonography has an important role both in differentiating cardiac liver sclerosis from viral cirrhosis with chronic right heart failure and in the follow-up of the seriousness of the right ventricular failure.
