Vascular reserve in the lower limbs of cirrhotic patients: a duplex Doppler ultrasound study. To evaluate femoral artery impedance at rest and during reactive hyperaemia.Study population comprised 11 cirrhotic patients without ascites, 10 with ascites and 16 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects.Echocardiographic assessment of systemic haemodynamics duplex Doppler ultrasound measurement of femoral artery pulsatility index and vascular reserve [pulsatility index rest/pulsatility index hyperaemia).Cirrhotic patients had elevated cardiac index and low systemic vascular resistance. Pulsatility index (right femoral artery) was not statistically different either at rest or after reactive hyperaemia (controls: rest 10.6 +/- 0.4, hyperaemia 2.6 +/- 0.2 compensated cirrhosis: rest 10.1 +/- 0.8, hyperaemia 3.4 +/- 0.4The lower limb vascular reserve is preserved in cirrhosis.
