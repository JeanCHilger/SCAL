Improvement of sonographic needle visibility in cirrhotic livers during transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt procedures with use of real-time compound imaging. The visibility of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPS) puncture needle was assessed with use of real-time compound imaging and single-line ultrasonography (US). In vitro and in vivo, needle-tissue contrast was calculated. With an increasing angle of incidence, the decrease in needle visibility was more pronounced for single-line US than for compound imaging. At angles of incidence of more than 30 degrees, the needle was barely visible with either technique. Subjective evaluation during TIPS procedures in 10 patients proved that the needle tip was significantly better seen with compound imaging. Therefore, real-time compound imaging significantly improved contrast and subjective visibility of the needle.
