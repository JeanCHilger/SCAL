Concomitant hepatocellular adenoma and adenomatous hyperplasia in a patient without cirrhosis. Hepatocelluar adenoma (HCA) and adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) are rare benign tumors of the liver. HCA is usually found in women who use oral contraceptives. AH usually occurs in patients with liver cirrhosis. Both tumors have potential for malignant transformation.We described a male adult with chronic liver disease (CLD) who had been known to be a hepatitis B carrier (HBV) for years. He was found to have a space-occupying lesion with a suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by abdominal ultrasonography. His alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was normal. Angiographic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of HCC, he wished to avoid an operation, was treated with transcatheter hepatic arterial embolization.He subsequently consented to surgery, and a right lobectomy was performed. The liver pathology disclosed HCA with nuclear dysplasia and post-embolization effects. In addition, there were multiple small foci of AH with nuclear dysplasia in the resected liver. Although he had some focal areas of cirrhosis-like change or post-embolization effect, the AH was associated only with normal liver tissue.This case confirms that HCA and AH may resemble HCC on imaging studies, and that AH may occur in CLD in the absence of cirrhotic change.
