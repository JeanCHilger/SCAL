A clinicopathological study on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. To observe the pathological and clinical characters of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Liver biopsy tissues taken from 97 patients negative for common viral detection with serological test and immunohistochemistry as well as in situ hybridization, were observed by routine light microscopic examination. And the clinical data of patients with NASH was analyzed.Among the chronic hepatitis patients with unknown etiology, the detection rate of NASH was 15.5% (15/97). The characteristic lesions in NASH patients included macrovesicular steatosis in zone 3 of lobules, hepatocytes ballooning degeneration, lobules diffused with acute and chronic inflammation, and perisinusoidal fibrosis. Grading and staging according to Brunt's method, histological lesions could be accounted for G1S1 in 7 patients, G2S2 in 3 patients, G3S1 in 4 patients and G3S2 in 1 patient. There were 14 patients with mild to moderate elevation of transaminase, 10 with hyperlipemia, 8 with diabetes and 9 with fatty liver by ultrasonography.Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a common form of unknown etiology chronic liver disease with certain clinic-pathological features.
