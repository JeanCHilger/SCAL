Correlation between the echogenicity of dysplastic nodules and their histopathologically determined fat content. To correlate the echogenicity of dysplastic nodules in cirrhotic liver with the difference in fat content between lesions and surrounding liver.This retrospective study involved 65 histopathologically proved dysplastic nodules (39 high grade and 26 low grade). Their echogenicity compared with that of surrounding parenchyma was determined sonographically, and differences in the proportions of fat globules contained in the nodules and in surrounding liver tissue were evaluated histopathologically. The sonographic and histopathologic findings were correlated.Among the 65 dysplastic nodules, echogenicity was high in 30 (46%), equal in 5 (8%), and low in 30 (46%). In all cases, there was significant correlation between echogenicity on sonographic imaging and the difference in fat content between nodules and surrounding liver tissue (P < .01). There was, however, no significant correlation between the degree of dysplasia and sonographic echogenicity (P > .05).The echogenicity of dysplastic nodules correlated with their fat content. Echogenicity did not, however, predict whether the grade of a nodule was high or low.
