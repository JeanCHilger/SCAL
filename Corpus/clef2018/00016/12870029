Correlation of clinical features with pathology in chronic viral hepatitis. To investigate the correlation of clinical features with pathology in chronic viral hepatitis (CH).Analyses of single factor and multiple factors of serum biochemical indices, imaging examination results, symptoms and signs with degree of pathological lesion of hepatic tissue in 973 cases of CH were conducted. Meanwhile, the hepatic functional index (AAPEA index) was used to investigate the role of serum biochemical indices in diagnosis of CH.In these patients with CH,the severity of hepatic lesion was closely correlated to symptoms and signs, biochemical indices such as PTA, ALT, TBIL, ALB, A/G, gamma-globulin (gamma-G) by electrophoresis, AST and cholinesterase (CHE) as well as splenic thickness. AST was superior to ALT in reflecting degree of hepatic inflammatory activity. The total mistaken judgment rate of multiple factor analysis was 28.1%. The correlation coefficient of AAPEA index to degrees of hepatic inflammatory activity, fibrosis and pathological grading was 0.559, 0.545 and 0.529, respectively (P<0.000 1)The biochemical indices such as PTA, ALT, TBIL, ALB, A/G, gammaG, AST, CHE and the determination of splenic thickness by ultrasonography B could reflect hepatic pathological changes to certain extent. AST was superior to ALT in reflecting degree of hepatic inflammatory activity. Incorrect judgment rate was high in determination of moderate and severe CH by multiple factor analysis. Conformity rate between AAPEA index and pathological diagnosis was better than any of them alone in diagnosing CH.
