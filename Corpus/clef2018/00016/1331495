Percutaneous ethanol injection under sonographic guidance of hepatocellular carcinoma in compensated and decompensated cirrhotic patients. Forty-six patients with cirrhosis and 75 biopsy-proved hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) nodules underwent percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) regardless of number (up to five) and size (mean diameter, 3.6 cm) of tumoral lesions and clinical severity of cirrhosis (11 patients in Child's class C were included). Ethanol was injected under sonographic guidance through 20 to 22 gauge needles so as to obtain homogeneous hyperechogenicity of lesions. A total of 271 PEI sessions were carried out, delivering 2 to 14 ml per session. All nodules but one decreased in size, and seven were no longer appreciable on sonography. Recurrence was detected in two patients. The 3 year survival rate of all cases was 86%. Child's classes A and B patients fared better (3 yr survival 100%) 2 year survival of subjects with HCC < or = 3 cm was 92%. Multifocality did not affect survival. Most patients experienced mild pain at the site of injection, but only two major complications were encountered: partial chemical thrombosis of the left portal vein and cholangitis. Both cases were managed conservatively. In conclusion, PEI seems to offer a safe and valuable tool for therapy of HCC, especially in patients with good functional liver reserve and small (< or = 3 cm) tumors.
