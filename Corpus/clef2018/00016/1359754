Sonographic organometry in Brazilian and Sudanese patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis mansoni and its relation to the risk of bleeding from oesophageal varices. Fifty-nine patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis mansoni were investigated by sonography in Northeast Brazil and Central Sudan. The sizes of the organs usually involved in this disease were quantitatively assessed according to a standardized protocol, and measurements were adjusted to the body height of the individual. The results were compared with those of healthy controls matched by sex, age, geographical origin and socio-economic status. Considerable differences were found between patients and controls as well as between residents from the two areas. The liver of both patients and controls from the Sudan was significantly smaller than that of patients and controls from Brazil. Only in Brazil, but not in the Sudan, was the left liver lobe larger in patients than in the controls. The diameter of the portal and the splenic vein, the spleen size and the thickness of the gallbladder wall were significantly increased in patients from both areas. The increase of the portal and splenic vein diameter was significantly correlated with the degree of hepatic periportal fibrosis and the frequency of bleeding from endoscopically proven oesophageal varices in the patients, irrespective of their geographic origin. In contrast, such correlations were not found for the degree of splenomegaly nor for the degree of gallbladder-wall thickening. It is concluded that standardized sonographic organometry permits the assessment of morbidity in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis mansoni under different endemic conditions. Especially the measurement of the portal vein diameter may allow estimation of the risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage in these patients.
