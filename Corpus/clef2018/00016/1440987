Dependence of ultrasonic attenuation of liver on pathologic fat and fibrosis: examination with experimental fatty liver and liver fibrosis models. To clarify the effect of the pathological state of the liver on ultrasonic attenuation, we produced two experimental rabbit models. The influence of fat on ultrasonic attenuation was examined using a fatty liver model without liver fibrosis, and that of fibrosis on attenuation using a liver fibrosis model without fatty infiltration. Ultrasonic data were obtained in vivo directly from the liver, and an acoustic attenuation coefficient slope was obtained by the spectral difference method. Tissue components of the liver, namely the total lipid, hydroxyproline and water contents, were measured precisely by quantitative methods. We revealed that ultrasonic attenuation depends mainly on fatty infiltration of the liver and to a lesser extent on fibrosis, but not on the water content.
