Portal hepatic venous shunt via an intrahepatic portal vein aneurysm. A rare case of portal hepatic venous shunt (PHVS) via an intrahepatic portal vein aneurysm (PVA) is presented. A 66-year-old man was admitted for examination of a mass in the liver. Ultrasonography demonstrated a cystic lesion (15 mm in diameter) at the posterior superior segment of the right hepatic lobe which communicated with the right portal vein (RPV) and right hepatic vein (RHV). Superior mesenteric portography showed a biloculate aneurysm in RPV and PHVS. Color doppler ultrasonography indicated that flow in the tracts entered the aneurysmal cavity from RPV and drained into RHV.
