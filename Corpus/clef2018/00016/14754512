Immunohistochemical assessment of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in primary hepatocellular carcinoma and dysplastic nodules. A complementary way for the assessment of HCC prognosis is represented by the analysis of molecular markers. Thus, immunohistochemical assessment of proliferation can describe tumor aggressiveness, probability of local recurrence or metastasis potential, being very useful for the assessment of recurrence-free survival and survival until death. The aim of our study was to assess proliferating cell nuclear antigen activity in HCC and dysplastic nodules as compared with surrounding non-neoplasic areas. Immunohistochemical techniques were thus performed on the samples obtained by ultrasound-guided liver biopsies or intraoperative biopsies, in 32 patients with HCC, as well as in 3 patients with dysplastic nodules occurring in liver cirrhosis. Expression of PCNA within extranodular areas of the HCC patients in the absence or presence of cirrhosis, was increasing from 40% to 70%, respectively. PCNA expression further increased within intranodular areas of dysplastic nodules and HCC, to 100% and 96.88%, respectively. A progressive increase of the mean values of PCNA-LI was also observed from extranodular areas without or with cirrhosis, towards intranodular areas of dysplastic nodules and HCC (4.2%, 6.8%, 27.9%, 31.9%, respectively). Dysplastic nodules can thus be considered lesions with a high-proliferation rate, representing an early stage of hepatocarcinogenesis. This supported the current recommendations for borderline hepatocellular nodules identified by ultrasound, which indicate an aggressive treatment similar to malignant lesions. In summary, we demonstrated a progressively increasing rate of cellular proliferation, from extranodular non-neoplasic areas to intranodular areas (dysplastic nodules and HCC), as reflected by an increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen labelling index.
