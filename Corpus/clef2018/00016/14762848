Multimodal image-guided tailored therapy of early and intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma: long-term survival in the experience of a single radiologic referral center. The best treatment policy for some patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and compensated cirrhosis is still controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term survival and related prognostic factors of patients with early and intermediate HCC (Liver Unit of Barcelona classification) treated in a radiologic referral center by a multimodal image-guided tailored therapy (MIGTT), applied over time, choosing the procedure patient by patient according to the presentation of the disease. Between May 1996 and May 2003, 374 patients (210 with early and 164 with intermediate HCC) were treated with MIGTT. Radiofrequency ablation was considered the first choice ethanol injection was preferred for nodules at risk for radiofrequency
