Modified devascularization surgery for isolated gastric varices assessed by endoscopic ultrasonography. This study aimed to assess the role of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in the surgical management of isolated gastric varices (IGV), and to report the authors' experience in the treatment of IGV with modified devascularization surgery.In this study, 26 cirrhotic patients with IGV were treated with devascularization surgery for variceal hemorrhage. Preoperatively, percutaneous transhepatic portography (PTP) and EUS were used to determine the mode of therapy for IGV. Fundectomy was performed for 14 patients with fundic IGV, whereas 12 patients with cardiac IGV underwent proximal gastrectomy.A significantly higher proportion of patients with cardiac varices showed grade 3 IGV on preoperative EUS than those who had fundic varices (p < 0.05). No major complications were observed during or after the operation, and only one patient died of prolonged shock and massive transfusion. Postoperatively, gastric varices had been eradicated completely in 25 of 26 patients, as determined by EUS study. During a mean follow-up period of 50 months, two patients had recurrent varices without bleeding, as demonstrated by EUS. The overall 5-year survival rate for the fundic IGV group was 67.9%, whereas that for the cardiac IGV group was 64.3% (p > 0.05).This study showed that devascularization surgery is highly effective for the prevention of recurrent bleeding from IGV and provides an alternative treatment method. Preoperatively, EUS is very helpful in detailed devascularization of patients with specific IGV, and may be used also for postoperative follow-up evaluation.
