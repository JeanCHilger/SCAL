Functional hepatic flow in patients with liver cirrhosis. To evaluate hepatic reserve function by investigating the change of functional hepatic flow and total hepatic flow in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension.HPLC method was employed for the determination of concentration of D-sorbitol in human plasma and urine. The functional hepatic flow (FHF) and total hepatic flow (THF) were determined by means of modified hepatic clearance of D-sorbitol combined with duplex doppler color sonography in 20 patients with cirrhosis and 10 healthy volunteers.FHF, evaluated by means of the D-sorbitol clearance, was significantly reduced in patients with cirrhosis in comparison to controls (764.74+/-167.91 vs 1195.04+/-242.97 mL/min, P<0.01). While THF was significantly increased in patients with cirrhosis in comparison to controls (1605.23+/-279.99 vs 1256.12+/-198.34 mL/min, P<0.01). Portal blood flow and hepatic artery flow all were increased in cirrhosis compared to controls (P<0.05 and P<0.01). D-sorbitol total clearance was significantly reduced in cirrhosis compared to control (P<0.01), while D-sorbitol renal clearance was significantly increased in cirrhosis (P<0.05). In controls FHF was similar to THF (1195.05+/-242.97 vs 1256.12+/-198.34 mL/min, P=0.636), while FHF was significantly reduced compared with THF in cirrhosis (764.74+/-167.91 vs 1605.23+/-279.99 mL/min, P<0.01).Our method that combined modified hepatic clearance of D-sorbitol with duplex doppler color sonography is effective in the measurement of FHF and THF. FHF can be used to estimate hepatic reserve function.
