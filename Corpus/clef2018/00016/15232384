Intrahepatic portal-to-portal venous shunts in cirrhosis: a potential mimic of hepatocellular carcinoma. Two intrahepatic portal-to-portal venous shunts demonstrated at computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound in a 40-year-old woman with cirrhosis are described. The shunts appeared as hypervascular hepatic foci on CT, simulating multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma. Follow-up multiphase CT with multiplanar reformation and Doppler ultrasound confirmed the correct diagnosis. Recognition of intrahepatic portal-to-portal venous shunts as a rare mimic of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis should prevent misinterpretation or inappropriate management.
