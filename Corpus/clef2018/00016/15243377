Sonographic evaluation of periportal fibrosis in children living in a Schistosoma mansoni endemic region. To assess with ultrasound periportal fibrosis due to chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection in children living in an endemic region. Materials and methods. A total of 441 children underwent two stool examinations and abdominal sonography. Liver echotexture was assessed by two observers and compared to pre-defined image patterns and a fibrosis score was assigned ranging from 0 to 8. Ultrasound features were correlated to age, sex, and parasitologic findings.Prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infestation was 63%. Two cases of advanced fibrosis (E pattern or fibrosis score of 6) were observed. Fibrosis correlated with age. No correlation existed between fibrosis and intensity of egg-output. A correlation between the two examinors was noted in 84% of examinations with a kappa coefficient of 0.7.Although severe periportal fibrosis is a rare finding in this endemic region, follow-up sonography must be performed because it is the only non invasive and reliable tool for detection of periportal fibrosis.
