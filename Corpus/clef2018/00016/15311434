Guidance and monitoring of radiofrequency liver tumor ablation with contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Radiofrequency (RF) treatments of non-resectable hepatic tumors are generally guided with real-time sonography, which, however, cannot differentiate necrotic changes from viable tumor. To achieve complete treatment of hepatic tumors, accurate imaging techniques are needed for close treatment follow-up. Usually contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used however, they can be performed only at the end of treatment sessions. In this field, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has shown to improve the sensitivity of plain ultrasonography. Recently, further developments of contrast-enhanced US technique have significantly increased its clinical utility. Continuous mode, low MI scans performed with harmonic imaging and contrast specific software appears as a very useful technique for the visualization of both macro- and microcirculation with depiction of tumor vascularisation. In our hospital, we have been employing contrast-enhanced sonography with sulphur hexaflouride microbubbles (SonoVue, Bracco, Italy) before, during and immediately at the end of RF ablation procedures to monitor and assess the therapeutic result prior to closing the treatment session. The results obtained in a group of 109 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in liver cirrhosis (192 lesions) and in 53 patients with liver metastases (97 lesions) undergoing a single session of percutaneous RF tumor ablation, showed that the sensitivity of CEUS for the detection of residual tumor was almost equivalent to that of contrast-enhanced helical CT. More importantly, since the introduction of intraoperative CEUS the rate of partially unablated tumors has dropped from 16.1 to 5.9%. Cost-effectiveness and reduction of patients' discomfort related to the need of re-treatment are the two most outstanding advantages of CEUS in this field.
