Propranolol and 5-isosorbide mononitrate in patients with cirrhosis: systemic and portal hemodynamic events. To study the acute variations in portal and systemic hemodynamics after propranolol and 5-isosorbide mononitrate (IMN) administration in cirrhotic patients.Seventeen cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension were studied with catheterization and Doppler duplex Ultrasound Systemic hemodynamics. Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), portal blood flow and resistance were evaluated in baseline, after intravenous propranolol (0.15 mg/kg), and after 20 mg p.o. of IMN. Patients who showed a decrease > or = 20% and/or < 12 mm/hg in HVPG were considered responders.There were no significant differences in clinical or portal hemodynamic baseline data between responders and non-responders to the drugs. After propranolol administration cardiac index decreased (p < 0.05) and pulmonary capillary pressure increased (p < 0.0001). Six patients (35%) were responders lack of response was associated with an insufficient decrease in portal blood flow or with an increase in portal resistance. After IMN administration cardiac index decreased (p < 0.05) with normalization of pulmonary capillary pressure (p < 0.05). Seven patients were responders to the addition of IMN (5 non-responders to propranolol) and showed a decrease in HVPG associated with a reduction in portal blood flow and resistanceAddition of IMN increased the number of responders and reduced portal blood flow with a variable effect in portal resistance.
