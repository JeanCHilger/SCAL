Device laboratory and postmortem parallels in alcoholic hepatitis during combined therapy using thioctic (alpha-lipoic) acid. The absence of clinical, biochemical, and instrumental signs that characterize the morphological pattern of the liver presents an urgent problem in the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis (AH). Sixty-one patients (mean age 41.7 +/- 8.7 years) were examined to study relationships between the histomorphological parameters and laboratory and instrumental findings in patients with AH on combined treatment including alpha-lipoic acid (Berlition). Indirect assessment of the histological activity of the disease may use the parameters of the serum activity of aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamine aminotransferase, the stages of hepatic fibrosis-ultrasound symptoms: the splenic index at the early stages of the disease, the diameter of the splenic vein in moderate and severe fibrosis. The supplementation of Berlition in the combined therapy for AH decreases the severity of fatty hepatocytic dystrophy, hepatic inflammatory and necrotic changes, no increase or a decrease in the stage of fibrotic changes in the liver tissue.
