Unclear liver fibrosis in a 42-year-old patient with polycythemia vera. A 42-year-old patient was admitted to hospital because of ascites and polyglobulia. Laboratory tests revealed reduced liver function and a significant elevation of all three hematopoietic cell lines. Liver fibrosis and polycythemia vera were diagnosed by histologic examination. The most frequent causes for liver fibrosis were serologically excluded. Ultrasound combined with Doppler imaging revealed an obstruction of the right hepatic vein, which was indicative of Budd-Chiari syndrome. BCS can occur under fulminant and nonfulminant conditions, which can result in progressive damage of the liver. Phlebotomy and combined therapy with low-dose aspirin and anagrelide achieved permanent reduction of the elevated blood parameters. In the follow-up the patient's clinical course was stable without hepatic decompensation.
