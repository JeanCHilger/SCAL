Atypical large well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma with benign nature: a new clinical entity. Based on intranodular hemodynamic studies of nodular lesions associated with liver cirrhosis using computed tomography (CT) during arteriography, CT during arterial portography (CTAP) and angiography under ultrasonography, relatively large hepatocellular nodules with portal perfusion have been depicted. We report 17 such nodules in a total of 663 patients who underwent CTAP. Large well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are characterized by the presence of intranodular portal perfusion even if they measure more than 2.5 cm in diameter. Such nodules display a benign nature clinically as well as pathologically. These nodules, called 'atypical large well-differentiated HCC or dysplastic nodules', show extremely slow growth. Pathological study showed extremely peculiar findings the nodules consisted of homogeneously hyperplastic or well-differentiated HCC without the component of moderately or poorly differentiated HCC, and without fibrous capsules, vessel invasion or intrahepatic metastasis, all of which are commonly found in typical overt HCC. The incidence of such nodules is not rare
