Unique hypervascular nodules in alcoholic liver cirrhosis: identical to focal nodular hyperplasia-like nodules? Currently, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)-like nodules in cirrhotic liver is spotlighted. Unique hypervascular nodules mimicking FNH-like nodule in alcoholic liver cirrhosis were clinicopathologically clarified.Six resected and six biopsy cases of small hypervascular nodules found in alcoholic cirrhosis were studied clinicopathologically.All cases were male and consumed 90-150 g/day of ethanol for longer than 20 years, and hepatitis virus markers were negative. The nodules, 9-21 mm in diameter, were detected by ultrasonography during follow-up of alcoholic cirrhosis, and showed hypervascularity on angiography. Six patients were diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma and six were as hyperplastic nodule by biopsy, and the former six cases received partial hepatectomy. All of the resected nodules were completely or incompletely encapsulated. Histologically, all resected and biopsy nodules showed moderate increase of cell-density with an irregular trabecular pattern, and scar-like fibrosis with anomalous blood vessels, and unpaired arteries. All nodules showed marked or mild iron deposits in hepatocytes and/or kupffer cells, and a diffuse capillarization of the sinusoids.The nodules in the present series seem to fall in the same category as FNH-like nodules in cirrhotic liver, and should be taken account in screening programs including patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.
