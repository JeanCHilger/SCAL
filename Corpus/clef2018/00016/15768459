Laparoscopic left hemicolectomy in a patient with cirrhosis scheduled for liver transplantation. Hepatic cirrhosis is a negative prognostic factor for major abdominal surgery, with a greater risk of bleeding, infection, and ascites. The case of a 54-year-man with adenocarcinoma of the sigma affected by hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus hepatopathy as well as micro- and macrconodular cirrhosis (Child's B7 stage) waiting for liver transplantation is reported. After a consultation with the liver transplantation our hospital, and considering the the patient's age laparoscopy was determined to be the procedure of choice because it would give him the possibility of a transplantation in the future. A typical left hemicolectomy with left flexure mobilization and mechanic colorectal T-T-anastomosis was therefore performed. All surgical maneuvers in the right hypochondrium were avoided. Mobilization was performed using an ultrasonic scalpel to reduce the risk of bleeding, and the anatomic stump was pulled out by means of a midline minilaparotomy, sparing the anastomotic circles of the abdominal wall. Follow-up evaluation was uneventful. At an 8-month follow-up visit, the patient was in good general condition. In this case, laparoscopic surgery allowed an oncologically suitable colonic resection without complication and poor surgical stress. Moreover, open surgery would have reduced the possibility of a transplantation in the future.
