Can Doppler sonography grade the severity of hepatitis C-related liver disease? Many authors have claimed that Doppler sonography indexes are of value in grading and assessing diffuse liver disease. However, there is much controversy regarding the reliability and reproducibility of these techniques. We performed a prospective study to evaluate whether these methods can grade disease in a well-stratified cohort of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease.Sixty-five patients with biopsy-proven HCV-related liver disease were recruited, and Doppler sonography was performed by one operator. The patients were classified into one of the following three groups on the basis of the Ishak-modified histologic activity index (HAI) fibrosis (F) and necroinflammatory (NI) scores: mild hepatitis (F < or = 2 and NI < or = 3), moderate or severe hepatitis (3 < or = F < 6 or NI > or = 4), or cirrhosis (F = 6/6). We measured the following Doppler indexes: main hepatic artery peak velocity (Vmax) and resistive index, main portal vein peak velocity (Vmax), and maximal portal vein diameter and circumference that allowed calculation of the portal vein congestive index (portal vein area and portal vein velocity). The ratio of the hepatic artery velocity (Vmax) to the portal vein velocity (Vmax) was also calculated, and the phasicity (triphasic, biphasic, or monophasic) of the hepatic veins of each patient was recorded. We also measured the maximal spleen length longitudinally.A total of 65 patients with liver disease (mild hepatitis, n = 20 moderate or severe hepatitis, n = 25Doppler-derived indexes, which have previously been recommended for the assessment of severity in chronic liver disease, are difficult to reproduce reliably and therefore have a limited clinical role in the noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis or inflammation.
