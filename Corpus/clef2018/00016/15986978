Preoperative evaluation of endoscopic ultrasonography and portography in selecting devascularization surgery for esophagogastric varices. This study assesses the role of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and portography in selection of mode of devascularization surgery for esophagogastric varices (EGV) in patients with portal hypertension and reports our experience in the treatment of EGV with modified devascularization surgery. Forty-two cirrhotic patients with EGV were treated with devascularization surgery for variceal hemorrhage. Preoperatively, percutaneous transhepatic portography (PTP) and EUS were used as the guiding mode for therapy of EGV. In addition to devascularization and splenectomy, esophageal transection (ET) was performed in 26 patients with upward-flow varices (UFV), whereas 16 patients with downward-flow varices (DFV) underwent proximal gastrectomy instead of ET. In both UFV and DFV groups, grade II of intramural varices and extramural collaterals were most commonly observed on EUS imaging. There was no significant difference of EUS grading between these two groups (P > 0.05). The incidence of postoperative complications, mortality, and recurrent varices were not significantly different between these two groups. The overall 5-year survival rate for UFV group was 69.2 per cent, whereas that for the DFV group was 68.7 per cent (P > 0.05). Our study shows that devascularization surgery is highly effective for the prevention of recurrent bleeding from EGV, and it provides an alternative treatment modality. Combined PTP and EUS are very helpful in determining adequate modalities of devascularization surgery.
