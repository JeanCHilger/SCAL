Transthoracic electrical bioimpedance: a non-invasive technique for the evaluation of the haemodynamic alterations in patients with liver cirrhosis. Transthoracic electrical bioimpedance is a non-invasive technique for the evaluation of systemic haemodynamics. Compared to Doppler ultrasound, it has the advantage of being operator-independent, providing continuous monitoring and being less influenced by postural changes. Until now, transthoracic electrical bioimpedance has been applied to a very limited extent in liver cirrhosis. We, therefore, aimed to compare transthoracic electrical bioimpedance and echocardiography in the assessment of haemodynamic status in cirrhotic patients.Thirteen patients with compensated cirrhosis, 10 patients with cirrhosis and ascites and 12 controls were enrolled. Haemodynamic parameters (stroke volume, cardiac output, heart rate, mean arterial pressure and vascular peripheral resistance) were assessed simultaneously by transthoracic electrical bioimpedance monitoring with BioZ.com for at least 10 min and Doppler ultrasound.The absolute mean values of haemodynamic parameters obtained by the two techniques were quite similar in all groups furthermore, a good agreement between transthoracic electrical bioimpedance and echocardiography measurements was found for all the parameters. Finally, transthoracic electrical bioimpedance proved easy to employ and provided continuous real-time monitoring of cardio-circulatory variations.The present study showed a significant correlation between transthoracic electrical bioimpedance and echocardiography in the assessment of systemic haemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis, supporting the employment of transthoracic electrical bioimpedance in pathophysiological studies requiring real-time continuous monitoring of haemodynamic parameters.
