Chronic allograft dysfunction: diagnosis and management. Is it always progressive? 1. There are many causes of graft dysfunction post-liver transplant, but recurrent disease remains the most common cause. 2. Viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic and alcoholic steatohepatitis, and autoimmune diseases are the most common causes of recurrent disease. 3. Graft hepatitis occurs frequently and in many cases will not progress. 4. Cirrhosis in the absence of any identifiable cause develops in a minority. 5. Treatment is of the underlying cause but some, such as recurrent and de novo autoimmune hepatitis and recurrent primary sclerosing cholangitis may not respond well, and regraft may be required.
