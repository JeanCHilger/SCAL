Value of radiological methods in the diagnosis of biliary diseases. The modern cross-sectional radiological methods of ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging provide manifold possibilities for the diagnosis of inflammatory and tumorous diseases of the gallbladder and the bile ducts as well as stone-related diseases. The invasive methods for direct imaging of the bile ducts, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, are mainly used within therapeutic concepts. According to the literature, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging show a sensitivity of up to 100% in the diagnosis of intra- and extrahepatic cholestasis, but concerning the diagnosis of the cause of cholestasis these methods are limited. Therefore, additional MRI sequences or computed tomography are necessary. Computed tomography is particularly efficient for the diagnosis of the biliary system and adjacent anatomical and pathological structures within the pre- and postoperative period.
