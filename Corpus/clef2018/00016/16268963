Review article: the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with thiazolidinediones. It is generally accepted that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease will be the most frequent liver disease in the near future and that the management of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease will be a challenge for hepatologists in the next decades. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, in which insulin resistance plays a crucial role. Although steatosis will often not progress to severe liver disease, in some patients, it results in cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, it is important to identify those patients at risk for developing fibrosis. Age, diabetes, obesity and hypertriglyceridaemia are independent risk factors for fibrosis in patients with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase levels and steatosis on ultrasound. The presence of multiple metabolic disorders increases the risk. Apart from diet, exercise and correction of underlying metabolic abnormalities, no specific treatment is available at the moment. Theoretically, thiazolidinediones are an attractive way to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, because they improve insulin resistance. Some preliminary studies with thiazolidinediones were encouraging, as steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis improved in a substantial number of patients. Although no serious side effects occurred in the pilot studies, we should look vigilantly for hepatotoxicity, as the first generation thiazolidinediones proved to be toxic for the liver.
