Venous complications after orthotopic liver transplantation. We report venous complications, including portal vein and hepatic vein stenoses, that required interventional radiological treatment in three pediatric and two adult living related liver transplant recipients. Between April 2001 and April 2005, 81 liver transplantations were performed at our hospital. Sixty-two grafts were from living donors. During follow-up, three portal vein stenoses were identified in three pediatric recipients, and two hepatic vein stenoses in two adult patients. In the children, two had received left lateral segment grafts, and one had received a right lobe graft from two mothers and one father, respectively. The etiologies of liver failure were Alagille syndrome, biliary atresia, and fulminant Wilson's disease. Portal vein stenoses were identified at 8, 11, and 12 months after transplantation all three patients underwent percutaneous transhepatic portal venous angioplasty with a success rate of 100%. The mean follow-up was 102 days
