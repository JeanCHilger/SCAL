Hepatoblastoma: clinico-radiological study of fifteen cases. From January 1976 to October 1989, 15 patients with hepatoblastoma who underwent surgery at the National Cancer Center Hospital were evaluated by clinico-radiological techniques. Eight patients were boys and seven were girls their average age was 3 years and 5 months. Abdominal mass or distention was initially noted in 12 patients. Alpha-fetoprotein level was extremely high (average, 327 micrograms/ml) in all cases but one. Hepatitis B surface antigen was negative in all cases. Tumors occupied mainly the right lobe of the liver in 67% of patients, and the mean tumor diameter was 11.1 cm. Of 15 hepatoblastomas, 10 were grossly classified as massive type and five as multinodular. Histopathological diagnosis was well differentiated (fetal type) hepatoblastoma in 10 patients and poorly differentiated (embryonal type) hepatoblastoma in five. Fibrous capsule was also recognized in eight. The noncancerous liver was normal in all cases. Ultrasonography (US) (n = 7 patients) demonstrated an inhomogeneous internal echo with well demarcated margin in five cases and without such margin in two. Nonenhanced CT (n = 6) showed an isodense or low density mass in all cases. Drip infusion CT (n = 5) revealed isodensity in the early phase. Dynamic CT performed in one patient showed a well enhanced mass that appeared hypervascular on angiography. Preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy provoked histological changes such as necrosis, fibrosis and calcifications. These changes were reflected on CT images. Both US and CT demonstrated the characteristic internal structure and gross appearance of hepatoblastoma.
