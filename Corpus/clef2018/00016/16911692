Factors influencing the prevalence of gallstones in liver cirrhosis. To investigate the prevalence of gallstone disease in Chinese patients with liver cirrhosis and to identify risk factors for cholelithiasis.Blood samples were tested and ultrasonographic examination of the upper abdomen was conducted to observe the prevalence of gallstones in 90 compensated cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh A), 180 decompensated cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh B, C) and 300 controls. Risk factors for gallstone formation (age, sex, pregnancy, family history) and the characteristics of liver cirrhosis (Child class, inside diameter of portal vein), and gallbladder (wall thickness) were assessed.Gallstones were found more often in cirrhotic patients (23.7%) than in controls (7.33%, P < 0.001). The prevalence of gallstones in decompensated cirrhotic patients was higher than that of the compensated cirrhotic patients (P < 0.001). Advanced age, female sex, family history of gallstones, gallbladder wall thickness 4 mm or greater and inside diameter of portal vein 13 mm or greater were significantly associated with gallstone disease in patients with liver cirrhosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that age (P < 0.001), sex (P = 0.0005) and thickness (4 mm or greater) of the gallbladder wall (P = 0.0064) were independently associated with gallstone disease in such patients.This study confirms the high prevalence of cholelithiasis in liver cirrhosis. Age and sex are risk factors for gallstones and gallbladder wall thickness could be an additional risk factor for the development of gallstone in patients with liver cirrhosis.
