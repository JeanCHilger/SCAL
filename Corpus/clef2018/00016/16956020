Non-alcoholic liver disease (NASH). NASH, an increasingly recognized condition resembles alcohol-induced liver disease, but occurs in patients who do not abuse alcohol. Obesity, insulin resistance and oxidative stress have critical roles in the pathogenesis of NASH. Liver biopsy remains the only modality that can reliably distinguish steatosis from steatohepatitis. Simple steatosis may have the best prognosis. In patients with NASH liver enzymes are insensitive and can not be used reliably to confirm the diagnosis or stage the extent of fibrosis. Currently no effective medical therapy is available. Weight reduction may improve the disease. Liver-transplantation in end-stage liver disease is a potential therapeutic option also in patients with NASH.
