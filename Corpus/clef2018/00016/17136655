Transient elastography for diagnosing liver cirrhosis. Detection of liver cirrhosis has numerous implications because of the potential sequelae of cirrhosis. Transient elastography (Fibroscan), was evaluated as a novel, non-invasive means of assessing cirrhosis by measuring liver stiffness.147 consecutive patients with different forms of liver disease and histologically determined stages of liver fibrosis were prospectively studied by transient elastography. 48 patients had liver cirrhosis.The number of transient elastographic measurements per patient was 12+/-4 (range 6 - 30). Valid elastography measurements were available for 135 out of 147 patients (92 %). The results of transient elastography correlated positively with the histological score of liver fibrosis (r = 0.8 95 % CI: 0.72 - 0.85Measuring liver stiffness by transient elastography proved to be an easy method to assess liver cirrhosis. In combination with clinical signs, ultrasound and biochemical markers noninvasive diagnosis of liver cirrhosis will be further improved.
