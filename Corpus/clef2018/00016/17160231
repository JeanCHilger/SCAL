Correlation of Doppler ultrasound of the portal system with endoscopic changes caused by portal hypertension in cirrhotic patients. The portal hypertension in cirrhotic patients is the main cause of this illness complication, that are clinically translated to visible collateral circulation in the abdominal wall, ascites and esophageal varices.To evaluate if the portal system echodoppler is able to estimate the presence of esophageal varices, gastric varices and congestive gastropathy in patients with hepatic cirrhosis.One hundred and eighty six patients of the gastroenterology and hepatology ambulatory of the Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Paran√°, Curitiba, PR, Brazil, had been selected for evaluation. Of those, 145 had completed all the stages of the evaluation and 133 had been enclosed in the final analysis. All had been submitted to high digestive endoscopy for evaluation of esophagogastric varices and congestive gastropathy and then to Doppler ultrasound of the portal system with study of the systolic peak speed of the portal vein, diameter of the portal and splenic vein and spleen size, presence of the umbilical vein recanalization and hepatofugal flow.The patients with esophagogastric varices had significant difference of the spleen size when compared to patients without these change. However, none of the Doppler ultrasound parameters showed good accuracy and specificity in this group of cirrhotic patients. Congestive gastropathy patients had their diagnosis predict with significant manner not only by the portal and splenic vein diameter but also by the spleen size. Similarly to that described above, they do not have a good accuracy and specificity. These evaluations were validated by the construction of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves, whose areas below the curves had always been less than 0,8.There was not a good correlation of the Doppler ultrasound parameters of the portal system to the presence of the main endoscopic alterations (esophagogastric varices and congestive gastropathy) in patients with hepatic cirrhosis.
