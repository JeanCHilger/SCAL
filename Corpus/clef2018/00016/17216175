Bleeding from peristomal varices in a cirrhotic patient with ileal conduit: treatment with transjugular intrahepatic portocaval shunt (TIPS). We report an unusual case of a 71-year-old man with liver cirrhosis who presented recurred bleedings from the stoma of the ileal conduit after radical cystoprostatectomy. The haemorrhages could not be treated by local measures, and a transjugular intrahepatic portocaval shunt was performed, displacing an endoprosthesis and a self-expandable stent. We highlight the role of TIPS to treat recurrent bleedings from the stoma in cirrhotic patients with ileal conduit and portal hypertension.
