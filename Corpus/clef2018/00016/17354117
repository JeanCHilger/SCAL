Improvement in the routine diagnostic assessment of the liver by high-resolution sonography: an analysis of 999 cases. High-frequency ultrasound transducers have been helpful in certain settings of transabdominal ultrasound examination, and their role in the evaluation of the liver surface in patients with cirrhosis is well documented. However, their value in the routine assessment of the liver has not yet been analysed systematically. The aim of this pilot study was to clarify whether the additional use of high-frequency ultrasound as compared to the standard 3.5 MHz-transducer is of any benefit.A total of 999 patients from a tertiary care medical centre were examined with a wideband 3.5 MHz- and a high-frequency transducer (band width 4.5 to 10 MHz) with tissue harmonic imaging using one of two high-end ultrasound machines (Siemens Sonoline Elegra or Hitachi EUB-8500). Findings on hepatic pathologies were collected on a standardized documentation sheet and were evaluated using descriptive statistics.In all, 948 patients showed a plain liver surface when the 3.5 MHz transducer was used, whereas this was only true for 862 patients examined with the high-frequency probe. Using the 7.5 MHz probe, the structure of the liver parenchyma appeared to be homogeneous (n=800 80.1%) less often than when the 3.5 MHz probe (n=822This study demonstrates that the additional use of a high-frequency transducer during routine abdominal examinations reveals new hepatic pathologies in a significant proportion of examined patients, without substantial prolongation of the overall examination period.
