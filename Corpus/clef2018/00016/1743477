Managing a high risk pregnancy after liver transplantation from the obstetrician's point of view. A case report. We report about a pregnancy and obstetrical management of a patient who had undergone a liver transplantation. Following a normal pregnancy, the newborn was born spontaneously in the 39th week of pregnancy. During the pregnancy the CSA blood levels were controlled frequently as well as the fetal development. An amniocentesis for chromosomal analysis, measurement of AFP blood levels, virus diagnostic and a phase III ultrasound diagnostic were performed. Immediately after delivery the baby was examined carefully by a pediatrician. Management of such a risk pregnancy, after organ transplantation, is possible if there is a close interdisciplinary cooperation between obstetricians, pediatricians, transplant surgeons and internal medicine specialist.
