Reversibility of cirrhosis in HIV/HBV coinfection. HIV infection worsens the course and the natural history of chronic hepatitis B (HBV) leading to rapid progression to cirrhosis and to end-stage liver disease. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens including nucleoside and/or nucleotide analogues with activity against both HIV reverse transcriptase and hepatitis B virus polymerase have clearly improved the survival rates of HIV/HBV-coinfected patients. How HAART beneficially affects the natural course of chronic hepatitis B in coinfected patients is not known. We report a biopsy-proven case of reversal of HBV-related cirrhosis in a coinfected patient, paralleling long-term suppression of HBV replication with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as part of a HAART. Pathological reversibility of cirrhosis was ascertained by normalization of biochemical (platelet count) and morphological (abdominal ultrasonography and gastrointestinal endoscopy) tests as well as non-invasive markers of fibrosis. In conclusion, a HAART regimen including tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in a HBV/HIV-coinfected cirrhotic patient might lead to sustained HBV viral suppression and result in cirrhosis reversal.
