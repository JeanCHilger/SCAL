EUS for detection of the hepatocellular carcinoma: results of a prospective study. Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and accurate determination of the number of lesions are critical in determining eligibility for liver transplantation or resection. Current diagnostic modalities (CT and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) often miss small lesions.To compare the accuracy of the EUS with CT for the detection of primary tumors of the liver.Prospective single-center study.Academic medical center.Subjects at high risk of HCC (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or alcoholic cirrhosis) were enrolled.US, CT, MRI, and EUS examinations of the liver were performed. Liver lesions identified during EUS underwent EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA).Seventeen patients were enrolled in the study. Nine of these patients had liver tumors (HCC, 8 cholangiocarcinoma, 1). EUS-FNA established a tissue diagnosis in 8 of the 9 cases. The diagnostic accuracy of US, CT, MRI, and EUS/EUS-FNA were 38%, 69%, 92%, and 94%, respectively. EUS detected a significantly higher number of nodular lesions than US (P = .03), CT (P = .002), and MRI (P = .04). For HCC lesions, a trend was observed in favor of EUS for the detection of more lesions than US (8 vs 2Small sample size.EUS-FNA is a safe and accurate test for the diagnosis of HCC. EUS increases the accuracy of intrahepatic staging of the HCC by delineation of lesions, which are missed by CT and MRI. We recommend EUS for suspected HCC, particularly in cases that are being considered for liver transplantation.
