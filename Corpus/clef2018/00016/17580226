Successful outcome after a technically challenging liver transplant during pregnancy. Little is known about the implications of liver transplantation (OLT) during pregnancy. We report the case of a 26-year-old woman with cryptogenic familial biliary cirrhosis that decompensated rapidly. OLT was performed using the donor iliac vein for a retrogastric portal vein conduit to the superior mesenteric vein and the donor iliac artery for an infrarenal aortic conduit. During the latter anastomosis, a viable fetus was noticed. Both donor and recipient were cytomegalovirus positive. Postoperative ultrasound revealed a 13.5-week-old viable fetus. The patient received tacrolimus, azathioprine, and prednisolone. The pregnancy progressed normally with the vaginal delivery of a healthy male infant after 36 weeks gestation. Nineteen months later, both the mother and child were well. This case demonstrated that even technically difficult OLT during pregnancy can have a successful outcome, raising the question of whether transplant patients of childbearing age should be routinely tested for pregnancy.
