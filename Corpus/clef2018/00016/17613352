Viral hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common tumor worldwide, and one of the fastest rising tumors as a result of chronic hepatitis B and C infection. The patients at risk for developing HCC are those with underlying cirrhosis secondary to viral hepatitis. External factors such as alcohol, tobacco, obesity, and diabetes increase the risk of HCC among those with chronic viral hepatitis. Surveillance of patients with cirrhosis with alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasound has been shown to reduce survival. The diagnosis of HCC is established by the presence of an arterially enhancing mass in the presence of cirrhosis. Viral hepatitis represents an opportunity for prevention of HCC.
