The effect of diltiazem on hemodynamic parameters in patients with liver cirrhosis. Previous investigations of authors abroad provided evidence of a reduction of portal pressure by blockers of slow calcium channels group II by verapamil. We decided to investigate the effect of a quite new preparation dilthiazem on the portal haemodynamics in patients with compensated cirrhosis of the liver and oesophageal varices. Doppler examinations of the width, rate of blood flow and flow through the trunk of the portal vein did not prove a statistically significant effect of dilthiazem on the investigated parameters. After the preparation a significant decline of the median pressure in the pulmonary artery was recorded at the 5% level of significance. The significantly elevated pressure values in the wedged position in the hepatic vein (WHVP) as well as of the portohepatic gradient (P-H) rose further after administration of the preparation (WHVP by 12.3%, p P-H by 15%). Even maximum doses of dilthiazem did not influence the portal flow in patients and did not lead to a reduction of the portohepatic gradient. From the results it is apparent that dilthiazem is not suitable for the treatment of portal hypertension.
