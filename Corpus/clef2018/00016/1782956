Right ventricular dilated cardiomyopathy associated with primary biliary cirrhosis. A case of right ventricular dilated cardiomyopathy associated with primary biliary cirrhosis is described. The patient was a middle aged woman, who initially complained of fatigue and itching. The diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis was made based on clinical, biochemical and histological evidence of the disease. Seven years later severe right-sided heart failure developed. The diagnosis of right ventricular dilated cardiomyopathy was made based on echocardiographic and angiographic evidence of a globally dilated and poorly contracting right ventricle. Left ventricular function was within normal limits. Autoimmune serology screening at this time revealed the presence of organ-specific cardiac antibody (titre 1/20) and of antinuclear antibody (titre 1/80) by indirect immunofluorescence. There were no findings of mitochondrial antibody or other non-organ specific or organ-specific antibodies. Overall, this assessment demonstrates autoimmunity in both hepatic and heart muscle disease in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis and right ventricular dilated cardiomyopathy.
