Clinical and ultrasound findings before and after praziquantel treatment among Venezuelan schistosomiasis patients. Abdominal ultrasound can be a useful tool for diagnosing periportal fibrosis related to Schistosoma mansoni infection, and also for planning and monitoring the evolution of hepatic morbidity following control measures. We evaluated the standardized ultrasound methodology proposed by the World Health Organization for detecting periportal fibrosis and portal hypertension, among patients from an endemic area in Venezuela, and the impact of praziquantel treatment 3-5 years later. After chemotherapy, complete reversal of periportal lesions was observed in 28.2% of the cases and progression of the disease in 5.1%. Improvement in the hepatic disease started with a reduction in the periportal thickening followed by a decrease in the size of the left hepatic lobe, spleen and mesenteric and spleen veins. Ultrasound confirmed the clinical findings after chemotherapy among the patients with reversal of the disease. However, in patients with more advanced disease, these findings were contradictory. There was no correlation between evolution of the disease seen on ultrasound and age, intensity of infection or serological findings.
