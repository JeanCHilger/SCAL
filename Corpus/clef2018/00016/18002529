A magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) approach for liver investigation. Due to its key role in carbohydrate metabolisation, blood detoxification, filtering and substance storing, liver is prone to a wide variety of diseases: hepatitis, cirrhosis, cancer. As such, liver investigation is a major field of interest. We describe here a non invasive way to obtain important information on liver elasticity properties. In vitro Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) experiments are realized using a normalized substance (Agar gel in different concentrations) and this technique is also demonstrated in the context of an in vivo investigation of the elastic properties of a normal control liver.
