Increased fasting gallbladder volume: a new ultrasonic sign of cirrhosis?. Ultrasound was used to calculate fasting gallbladder volume in three groups of patients: 90 with cirrhosis (alcoholic in 75 cases), 41 with non cirrhotic liver disease (alcoholic in 14 cases), and 38 controls. Gallbladder volume was evaluated according to sex, age, alcoholism, presence of gallstones, time of diagnosis, and biological tests of hepatocellular function. Mean fasting gallbladder volume was significantly higher in cirrhotic patients (45.89 +/- 32.65 ml, m +/- 1 SD) than in patients with non cirrhotic liver disease (25.31 +/- 14.08 ml) and in control subjects (21.28 +/- 10.30 ml) (P less than 0.001), but there was a great overlap between individual results in each group. No relationship was found between gallbladder volume and all clinical and biological tested parameters, except for decreased prothrombin time (P less than 0.02). Further studies are necessary to consider this ultrasound sign as an useful diagnostic tool in cirrhosis.
