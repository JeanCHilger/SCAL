Contrast-enhanced sonography in the characterization of small hepatocellular carcinomas in cirrhotic patients: comparison with contrast-enhanced ultrafast magnetic resonance imaging. To evaluate the role of low mechanical index (MI) contrast-enhanced sonography (CEUS) for the characterization of small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in cirrhotic patients by comparing the results to ultrafast dynamic gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies.Between September 2003 and June 2004, 73 patients (49 male and 24 female mean age, 63 yearsHCCs < or =10 mm (11 cases): On CEUS, 3/11 HCCs were hypervascular, while 8/11 were not visible (sensitivity, 27.3% specificity, 100%CEUS is a promising technique for the characterization of small HCCs in cirrhotic patients. It could be complementary to conventional sonography in evaluating focal liver lesions larger than 10 mm.
