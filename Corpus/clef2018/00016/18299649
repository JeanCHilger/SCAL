Prevalence of gastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy in patients with Symmers periportal fibrosis. Symmers periportal fibrosis secondary to schistosomiasis is a common cause of portal hypertension worldwide. Data on the prevalence of gastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy in this group of patients with portal hypertension is relatively scarce. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of gastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy in patients presenting with portal hypertension secondary to Symmers periportal fibrosis.In a prospective study, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was carried out to determine the prevalence of gastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy in patients with portal hypertension secondary to Symmers periportal fibrosis.Of 143 patients studied, 24 patients (16.8%) had gastric varices (grade I in 10.5%, grade II in 6.3%) and 31 patients (21.7%) had portal hypertensive gastropathy (mild in 11.2%, severe in 10.5%). Gastric varices were more prevalent in patients with grade I and II esophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy was more prevalent in those with grade III and IV esophageal varices, but the differences were not statistically significant.We concluded that both gastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy seem to have a lower prevalence in patients with portal hypertension secondary to Symmers periportal fibrosis when compared to reported data in patients with portal hypertension secondary to liver cirrhosis and non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis.
