Detection and characterization of focal liver lesions with contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in patients with hepatitis C-induced liver cirrhosis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated liver cirrhosis provides a major preneoplastic condition for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ultrasonography (US) is usually used for screening of HCC, but needs improvement.To assess whether use of a second-generation ultrasound contrast agent can improve characterization of focal liver lesions and detection of HCC in HCV-infected patients with liver cirrhosis.In total, 96 US studies in 49 HCV-infected patients with liver cirrhosis were performed. The patients were first examined with a baseline US. After this, a diagnostic decision was made and recorded. The patients were then re-examined with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), and the diagnostic triage was repeated. The patients were followed up for at least 1 year.On baseline US, indeterminate focal lesions were found in 27 examinations. After CEUS, a confident diagnosis of HCC was made in eight of these examinations. In an additional eight US examinations, diagnosis of regenerative/dysplastic noduli was established. In one patient with no detectable focal lesion at baseline examination, an indeterminate malignant lesion was detected with CEUS. This lesion was further investigated with computed tomography and diagnosed as HCC.Our study indicates that the use of CEUS significantly improves diagnostic confidence. CEUS improves the detection of HCC in patients with HCV-induced liver cirrhosis. Also, CEUS makes it possible to rule out malignancy in many cases where baseline US shows indeterminate focal lesions. In low-endemic countries, the use of CEUS in screening for HCC may be considered.
