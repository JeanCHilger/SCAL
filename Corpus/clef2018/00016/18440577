Schistosoma mansoni morbidity among adults in two villages along Lake Victoria shores in Mwanza District, Tanzania. The study aimed to describe morbidity patterns due to intestinal schistosomiasis in adults living in two villages along the southern shores of Lake Victoria, Mwanza District, Tanzania. Nine hundred and fifty persons from Msozi and 497 from Sangabuye, aged between 14 and 87 years, were examined by abdominal ultrasound according to the Niamey protocol. Liver image patterns (LIP) A and B were considered normal and C-F as distinct periportal fibrosis (PPF). The frequency of PPF was higher in Msozi (41.5%) than in Sangabuye (16.7%) (P<0.001) and was associated with high prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection. PPF was shown to be more common in males than females. Abnormal increase of segmental branch wall thickness (SBWT) and dilated portal vein diameter (PVD) were also more common among males than females. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were frequently encountered in both villages. The LIPs were positively correlated to size of SBWT and PVD but not to size of left liver lobe or spleen. In the study communities the risk of developing PPF differed greatly among individuals depending on various risk factors especially alcohol consumption.
