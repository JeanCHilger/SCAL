Community-based mass ultrasonographic screening of hepatocellular carcinoma among thrombocytopenic adults. Thrombocytopenia has been reported as a valid surrogate for liver cirrhosis and could be used to identify groups at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for ultrasonographic (US) screening. We designed this two-stage community-based screening for HCC. In 2004, subjects (ages > or =40 years) were invited to undergo comprehensive health examinations, with 17,551 men (ages 63.0 +/- 11.5 years) and 39,151 women (ages 59.9 +/- 11.7 years) participating. Subjects with platelet counts <150 x 10(9)/L or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) >20 ng/mL were enrolled for the second-stage US screening 3,242 subjects (5.7%
