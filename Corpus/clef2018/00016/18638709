The effect of QuYuHuaTanTongLuo Decoction on the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most common cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis, is becoming more prevalent in China. However, there is as yet no clearly established therapy for reversing fatty liver. Our aim is to explore the effect of traditional Chinese herbs QuYuHuaTanTongLuo Decoction (QYHTTLD) on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Sixty-nine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients were randomly divided into two groups. One group of 35 patients were treated by QYHTTLD, another group of 34 patients were treated by Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The TNF-alpha, IL-8, MDA level, SOD activity and liver function, as well as B ultrasonic image were detected before and after being treated. The results showed: after 6 months treatment, MBI of the treatment group was obviously decreased (p<0.05). The levels of TC, TG and LDL-C were significantly decreased whereas the level of HDL-C increased (p<0.01, p<0.05, p<0.05, and p<0.05, respectively) in the treatment group, the levels of TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C had no significant difference in the control group (p>0.05). The levels of TNF-alpha, IL-8 and MDA were significantly decreased whereas SOD activity was significantly increased (p<0.01, p<0.05, p<0.01, and p<0.01, respectively) in the treatment group, the level of MDA was significantly decreased in the control group (p<0.05). B ultrasonic images were ameliorated in different degree (p<0.01 and p<0.01, respectively). Both QYHTTLD and UDCA had the effect in improving the scores of symptoms and signs of patients, however, the difference value of the scores in treatment group were significantly higher than that in control group after being treated for 6 months (p<0.05).QYHTTLD is effective for treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and its effect seems to relate with the ways of QYHTTL down-regulating inflammation cytokine IL-8 level and relieving lipid peroxidation of liver.
