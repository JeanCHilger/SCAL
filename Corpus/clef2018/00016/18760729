US, CT, and MR imaging of hepatic masses in Alström syndrome: a case report. Alström syndrome is among the rarest genetic disorders described in the medical literature. It is characterized by retinal pigment degeneration, obesity, sensorineural deafness, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, progressive chronic nephropathy, cardiomyopathy, and hepatic dysfunction. Hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, which leads to cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and liver failure, is the final pathway of the hepatopathy in Alström syndrome. We report a case of Alström syndrome with particular emphasis on hepatic findings.
