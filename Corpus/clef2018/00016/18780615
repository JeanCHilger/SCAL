Pyogenic liver abscesses. Pyogenic liver abscesses were a relative rare disease. In the last decades the management of the liver abscesses was changed due to the new imaging and surgical techniques.To evaluate the clinical features, imaging techniques and treatment of the liver abscesses.We performed a retrospective study during the last twenty years (1987-2007). The patients were divided in two groups: group I treated during the period 1997-2007 and group II, 1987-1996. We compare the clinical features, biological tests, imaging techniques and the treatment.Of the 71 patients with liver abscesses, 39 (54.9%) were included in group I and 32 (45.1%) in group II. The male/female ratio was 49/22 liver abscesses were more frequent to the males, in group I (63.3%) and more frequent to the women, in group II (63.6%) (p = 0.035). The mean age was 47.49 +/- 2.09 years old (range 18-85) with no difference between the groups (p = 0.059). The symptoms were similar in the two groups. We noted, as associated disease: diabetes--16% (N = 12), liver cirrhosis--7% (N = 5), malignancies--4.2% (N = 3). White blood cells were higher than 10000/mm3 in 51 patients (71.83%)Pyogenic liver abscess is a challenging disease with high rate of postoperative morbidity. Most of the abscesses are unique and situated in the right lobe of the liver. The imaging techniques, especially ultrasound exam and CT-scan, are essential for the diagnosis and the treatment of liver abscesses. The treatment is usually surgical, by open or laparoscopic approach in selected patients the percutaneous approach can be performed.
