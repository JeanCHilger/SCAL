Splenectomy improves liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis. Partial splenic embolization or splenectomy has been reported to improve liver function as well as hypersplenism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of splenectomy in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) on liver function.Twelve consecutive patients with LC were followed for more than 6 months using laboratory examinations, ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography. Portal blood flow was measured using color Doppler US before and after splenectomy in 6 cases.Hypersplenism was improved in all patients. Protein synthesis in the liver was improved, which significantly correlated with these patients' increased liver volume. Having a large spleen and a low serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are predictive factors for favorable improvement of liver function after splenectomy. Splenectomy was safely carried out in all patients without major complications except for portal thrombus occurred in 4 patients, but did not affect liver function if it was well treated.Splenectomy improved liver function in patients with LC, and could be a supportive and bridging therapy for patients waiting for liver transplantation, especially with large spleen and lower ALT levels.
