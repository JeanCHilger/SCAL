Use and effectiveness of scintigraphy, sonography and angiography in circumscribed disease of the liver (author's transl). The effectiveness of scintigraphy, sonography and angiography is compared in a material of 140 cases of circumscribed disease of the liver. Typical clinical starting points are defined as points of reference of the diagnostic techniques. Clinical diagnosis is very safe in cases of secondary blastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma of the liver. Since the great majority of these conditions cause space-occupying lesions of the liver, problems of radiologic diagnosis are confined to the smaller number of clinically ill-defined lesions. For the diagnosis of secondary blastomas and cystic process of all kinds, scintigraphy and sonography are not improved by angiography. Solid space-occupying lesions of unknown origin, however, can only be recognized with angiography. Histology of both benign and malignant processes will be correct in more than 90% of cases.
