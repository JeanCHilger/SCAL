Relationship between hepatic fibrosis measured by transient elastography and peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocyte values. Advanced hepatic fibrosis decreases absolute CD41 lymphocyte count in HIV-infected patients. The correlation between hepatic stiffness measured by transient elastography and absolute CD41 lymphocyte count is unknown. Analysis of the correlation between transient elastography parameters and absolute CD41 lymphocyte count in 223 HIV-infected patients with chronic viral hepatitis. As compared to patients without significant fibrosis, absolute CD41 cell count was lower in patients with significant hepatic fibrosis (384 cel/microL vs. 431 cel/microL P = 0.023) and in patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis (330 cel/microL vs. 431 cel/microL
