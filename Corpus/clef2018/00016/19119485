The relationship between chronic HCV infection and the level of plasma adiponectin. Metabolic products (TNFalpha, adiponectin, resistin, etc.), which are effective in insulin sensitivity and in the regulation of inflammation, play an important role in the development of metabolic disorders and fatty liver disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of HCV infection alone on plasma adiponectin levels and insulin sensitivity when metabolic factors are minimized and to determine whether chronic HCV infection causes hepatosteatosis through its effect on these factors.This study was carried out between 2006-2007, at the Gastroenterology Clinic of Izmir Atat√ºrk Training and Research Hospital, in 30 non-diabetic patients with chronic HCV infection and 30 healthy subjects as controls. BMI (<26 kg/m2), fasting plasma glucose level, and ultrasonography were normal in both groups. In the patient group, HCV RNA was > or =1.90 x 10(3) IU/ml, ALT and AST were two times normal, and histological fibrosis scores were 1-2 in liver biopsy. Serum adiponectin levels and HOMA-IR were compared.Fasting blood glucose levels, body mass index and HOMA-IR of the two groups were similar and normal. The mean ALT value was significantly higher in the patient group [61.8 U/L vs 28.17 U/L (p<0.05)]. The mean viral load was determined as 5.6 x 10(5) IU/ml in the chronic HCV patient group. The mean plasma adiponectin concentrations were 71.07 microg/ml in chronic HCV patients and 82.07 microg/ml in the control group, and the difference was statistically insignificant (p>0.05).In the absence of metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and hepatosteatosis, chronic HCV infection does not affect insulin sensitivity or adiponectin concentration.
