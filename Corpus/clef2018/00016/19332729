Long-term outcome of cirrhotic patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma treated with ultrasound-guided percutaneous laser ablation: a retrospective analysis. Percutaneous laser ablation (PLA) has been proposed as an active treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, large multicenter studies using this technique have not been reported.We retrospectively analyzed treatment and survival parameters of 432 cirrhotic patients with nonsurgical early HCC (single nodule < or = 4 cm or three nodules < or = 3 cm each) who had received PLA in nine Italian centers.Single tumors were seen in 344 (80%) of 432 patients, and two to three nodules were seen in 88 patients (20%), for a total of 548 tumors. An initial complete response after PLA was observed in 338 patients (78%). Median overall survival time was 47 months (95% CI, 41 to 53 months). The 3- and 5-year cumulative survival rates were 61% and 34%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of survival were serum albumin levels more than 3.5 g/dL (P = .002 risk ratio [RR] = 0.580This analysis confirms that a complete tumor ablation results in improved survival in patients with nonsurgical HCC. Ideal candidates for PLA are younger patients with normal serum albumin levels and tumor size < or = 2 cm.
