Laparoscopic treatment of stone recurrence in a gallbladder remnant: report of an additional case and literature review. Cholecystectomy is an effective treatment of gallstones. Nevertheless, recurrence of biliary symptoms following cholecystectomy, either laparotomic or laparoscopic, is quite common. Causes are either biliary or extrabiliary. Symptoms of biliary origin chiefly depend on bile duct residual stones or strictures. Rarely, they depend on stone recurrence in a gallbladder remnant. Diagnosis of gallstone recurrence in gallbladder remnant is difficult, mainly arising from ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.Incomplete gallbladder removal may be either voluntary or inadvertent: in the first case, it is performed to remove gallstones without dissecting a difficult Calot's triangle or an excessively bleeding posterior wall of gallbladder caused by liver cirrhosis. Available data do not support the hypothesis that laparoscopic cholecystectomy entails an increased incidence of this condition, in spite of some opposite opinions. Treatment of lithiasis in gallbladder remnants is chiefly surgical. Although technically demanding, completion cholecystectomy can be safely performed in a laparoscopic way. We report a case of stone relapse in a gallbladder remnant, discovered 16 years following laparoscopic cholecystectomy and successfully treated by laparoscopic completion cholecystectomy. We furthermore review literature data in order to ascertain whether recent large diffusion of laparoscopic surgery causes an increase of such cases.
