Hepatolithiasis--a rare disorder in our population. The authors describe diagnostic and therapeutic options of hepatolithiasis, which is a rare disorder in our population.The authors present 3 case--reviews of patients operated for hepatolithiasis in the Plzen Faculty Hospital Surgical Clinic during 2000-2008. In a single subject, the finding was related to a Caroli syndrome. All subjects suffered from symptomatic hepatolithiases (abdominal pains, cholangiogenic sepsis), which was complicated by advanced liver cirrhosis in one case. The diagnostic measures included ultrasonography, computer tomography, MRI cholangiography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. In all the subjects, left-sided lobectomy was performed for findings located in the liver segments 2 and 3.The 30-day postoperative mortality was nil. In a single female patient, liver resection (segment 4) was performed for segmental bile duct dilation, bile fistule and chilangiogenic sepsis.Resection of the affected liver region is the method of choice in the management of hepatolithiasis.
