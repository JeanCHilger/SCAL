Ultrasound of the right lateral intercostal space. When performing an abdominal ultrasound examination in dogs, a right lateral intercostal approach often is indicated. This approach allows for a complete examination of the abdomen, especially in large deep-chested dogs, dogs with microhepatica, or dogs with a large volume of intestinal gas or peritoneal effusion. The right lateral intercostal approach provides an acoustic window for the evaluation of the right side of the liver, porta hepatis, right limb and body of the pancreas, duodenum, right kidney, right adrenal gland, and hepatic lymph nodes.
