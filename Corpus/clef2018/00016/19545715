Effects of cardiac valve dysfunction on perioperative management of liver transplantation. Our aim was to investigate the effects of cardiac valve dysfunction on perioperative management of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) among a retrospective cohort.Three hundred forty-six patients underwent echocardiographic (ECHO) examination prior to OLT. Data of patients with valvular dysfunctions were compared to subjects with normal ECHO. We evaluated patient characteristics, operation variables, hemodynamic course, blood products, fluid and drug requirements, extubation, and mortality rates.Ninety-five patients (27.5%) with cardiac valve dysfunction were classified as mitral valve insufficiency (MVI n = 32), tricuspid valve insufficiency (TVIOur study demonstrated that cardiac valve dysfunction may be associated with end-stage liver disease among patients undergoing OLT. Patients with MVI or both MVI and TVI required more care in perioperative management.
