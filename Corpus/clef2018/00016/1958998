Oesophageal varices in a region of the Sudan endemic for Schistosoma mansoni. In a field study of two villages in the Gezira, an area of the Sudan endemic for Schistosoma mansoni, liver ultrasonography was used to detect subjects with Symmers' hepatic periportal fibrosis, some of whom underwent oesophagoscopy to detect oesophageal varices. The prevalence of oesophageal varices in subjects undergoing oesophagoscopy was 54 per cent and 67 per cent respectively, occurring mainly in males aged about 30 years. The varices were usually asymptomatic. Symptomatic varices (with a positive history of haematemesis) occurred in 4 per cent and 3 per cent respectively of subjects with sonographic evidence of liver periportal fibrosis. By detecting oesophageal varices in an asymptomatic phase, hepatic ultrasonography and fibreoptic oesophagoscopy may elucidate the natural history of the varices and their response to periodic anti-schistosomal chemotherapy.
