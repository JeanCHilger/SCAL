Insulin resistance is associated with liver stiffness in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. The factors that influence liver fibrosis progression in patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus (HIV/HCV) are not completely understood. It is not known if insulin resistance (IR), a condition that promotes liver fibrosis in HCV mono-infected individuals, is one of these factors.To evaluate the association between IR and liver stiffness (LS).Multicentre cross-sectional study.330 patients co-infected with HIV/HCV.LS was assessed by transient elastography, which has shown a high accuracy to predict significant fibrosis in patients co-infected with HIV/HCV. The outcome variable of the study was LS. Patients with LS> or =9 kPa were considered as having significant fibrosis. IR was calculated using the HOMA method.LS was > or =9 kPa in 150 (45%) patients. HOMA correlated with LS (Spearman's rho correlation coefficient, 0.37 p<0.0001). The median (Q1-Q3) HOMA in patients with LS> or =9 kPa was 3.30 (2.17-5.16) while it was 2.09 (1.37-3.22) in patients with LS <9 kPa (p<0.0001). Ninety-six (39%) individuals with a HOMA <4 and 54 (63%) with a HOMA > or =4 showed LS> or =9 kPa (p<0.0001). Analyses after excluding patients with cirrhosis yielded similar results. After multivariate analyses, age > or =40 years (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 1.85IR is associated with LS in patients co-infected with HIV/HCV.
