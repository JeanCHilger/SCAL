Non-invasive liver elastography (Fibroscan) for detection of cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease. Cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease (CFLD) is the second cause of mortality in CF. The prevalence is estimated to be 26-45%, but sensitive diagnostic tools are lacking. We investigated whether non-invasive liver elastography (Fibroscan) could serve as a screening tool.Fibroscan measurements were performed in 66 CF patients. Age-specific cutoff values were determined in a control population (n=59). The measurements were compared to clinical data, bi-yearly biochemistry and ultrasound.Fibroscan was easy to perform in this patient population. There were 14 patients (21%) with abnormal liver stiffness measurements. Liver stiffness was significantly increased in patients with clinical CFLD (11.2 kPa versus 5.1 kPa), biochemical CFLD (7.4 kPa versus 5.4 kPa) or ultrasonographical CFLD (8.2 versus 4.3 kPa) (p<0.02 for all).Fibroscan is an objective measure and is easy to perform in CF patients, even in children and could provide a valuable tool to detect, and quantify CFLD.
