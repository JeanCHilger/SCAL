Bloodless emergent laparotomy for acute abdominal syndrome. Bloodless laparotomy (BL) is defined as an opened exploration of the abdominal cavity that yields negative results, i.e., "provides no information as to the cause of the clinical and paraclinical symptoms responsible for prompting the surgical investigation". The authors report a retrospective study spanning January 1975 to December 1989, on the incidence of and mortality associated with emergent BL in patients with acute abdominal syndrome, with the intent of reducing its frequency. Over this period, 24 BL occurred in 3480 emergent laparotomies, i.e., 0.63%. These involved 7 men, 5 women, 5 boys and 7 girls, aged 4 to 52 years (mean age = 19.5 years). Indications for surgery were based on clinical signs, as well as on laboratory findings such as chest X-ray and plain radiography and needle-puncture of the abdomen. Surgical data indicated:liver cirrhosis--3 cases mesenteric adenopathy--3 cases
