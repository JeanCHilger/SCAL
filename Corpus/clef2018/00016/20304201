Ectopic placement of Sengstaken-Blakemore device to correct outflow obstruction in liver transplantation: case reports. Liver transplantation is a complex procedure that has become the treatment for some end-stage liver diseases. Some technical features are important for the success of the transplantation, including the patency of the vascular anastomoses. In cadaveric whole organ liver transplantation, a large right subphrenic space may contribute to a twist of the inferior vena cava, leading to outflow obstruction, simulating an acute Budd-Chiari syndrome. Some devices can be used to correct this drainage problem. Herein, we have described 2 cases in which the Sengstaken-Blakemore balloon was safely used, in an ectopic position, to fix drainage complications in whole liver orthotopic transplantation.
