Correlation of transient elastography with APRI and FIB-4 in a cohort of patients with congenital bleeding disorders and HCV or HIV/HCV coinfection. Patients with inherited bleeding disorders frequently suffer from chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) mono- or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfection. Non-invasive markers for liver fibrosis are warranted for these patients. We tested a large cohort of haemophilic patients with HCV mono- or HIV/HCV coinfection for correlation of transient elastography (TE) with two simple surrogate markers of liver fibrosis and for differences in fibrosis stages according to these markers. We prospectively enrolled HCV-positive patients with congenital bleeding disorders with or without HIV coinfection. Liver function tests and platelet counts were determined and TE was performed. Aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and a simple index called FIB-4 were calculated and results were correlated with TE. A total number of 174 patients were included (23% HCV, 36% HIV/HCV coinfected, 33% with cleared HCV and 8% with ongoing HIV but cleared HCV). TE correlated significantly with APRI and FIB-4 (r = 0.60 P < 0.001 and r = 0.54
