Chemical composition and inhibitory effect on hepatic fibrosis of Danggui Buxue Decoction. The present study was carried out to investigate chemical components and therapeutic effects on hepatic fibrosis of Danggui Buxue Decoction (DBD) in rabbits. The chemical components of DBD were analyzed by LC-DAD-MS. Schistosomiasis hepatic fibrosis was employed as models of hepatic fibrosis. The rabbits were divided into treatment and control groups. DBD was orally administered at a dose of 50 g/kg rabbit's weight in treatment group. We evaluated the therapeutic effects of DBD on hepatic fibrosis in rabbits using B-ultrasound images, histopathologic examination, and hyaluronic acid content in serum. The results indicated that DBD had good therapeutic effects for hepatic fibrosis.
