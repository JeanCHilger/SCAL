Portal hypertension with visceral leishmaniasis. We conducted this study to observe evidence of portal hypertension in children with visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Eighty-eight consecutive cases (50 male) of VL were subjected to ultrasonography. Those with evidence of portal hypertension also underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and liver biopsy. Eight patients had portal hypertension as evidenced by dilated caliber of portal and splenic veins. Two patients had periportal, splenic and peripancreatic collaterals and one patient had cavernous transformation of portal vein. Out of eight patients, four patients had esophageal and gastric varices. Liver biopsy was done in four patients and revealed hepatic sinusoidal dilations without any evidence of fibrosis. Portal hypertension may be an independent manifestation of VL and remain undiagnosed unless a physician maintains a high index of suspicion.
