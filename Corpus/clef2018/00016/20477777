Noninvasive diagnosis of large esophageal varices by Fibroscan: strong influence of the cirrhosis etiology. Large esophageal varices (LOV) were diagnosed by endoscopy in patients with cirrhosis. Noninvasive method would be valuable.To evaluate the diagnostic performance of Fibroscan for LOV prediction and to investigate the prognostic value of liver stiffness (LS) in cirrhosis.One hundred and eighty-three patients with cirrhosis (103 alcohol, 58 viral, and 22 others) underwent an endoscopy and a Fibroscan. Of those patients, 41 (22.4%) had LOV.Median LS was 33.66 kPa (range: 12-75), higher in patients with LOV than those without (51.24 +/- 1.61 vs. 29.81 +/- 1.82 kPa, p < 0.0001), and in alcoholic than nonalcoholic (40.39 +/- 1.75 vs. 25.73 +/- 1.82, p < 0.0001). In whole population, a LS > or =48 kPa predicted LOV with sensitivity, specificity, positive, negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of 73.2, 73.2, 44.1, and 90.4%, respectively, and an area under ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.75 (CI 95%: 0.69-0.82). For alcoholic cirrhosis, LS was > or =47.2 kPa with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV of 84.6, 63.6, 44, and 92.5%, respectively, AUROC 0.77 (0.68-0.85). For viral cirrhosis, a LS > or =19.8 kPa generated diagnostic values of 88.9, 55.1, 26.7, and 96.4% and 0.73 (0.60-0.84). Sixteen (8.75%) patients died at 1 year. In multivariate analysis, LS was not predictive of mortality.Etiology of cirrhosis has strong impact on LS cutoff for diagnosis of LOV. Studies should be performed with homogenous cirrhosis etiology.
