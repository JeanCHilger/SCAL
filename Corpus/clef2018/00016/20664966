Percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: increased coagulation diameter using a new electrode and microwave generator. We performed percutaneous microwave co-agulation therapy (PMCT) using a new microwave electrode and microwave generator to lessen the number of microwave electrode insertions for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) measuring <or=3.0 cm in diameter. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of this new system. Fifty-two patients with liver cirrhosis and HCC measuring <or=3.0 cm in diameter (tumor size: <or=2 cm, 27 patients >2 to <or=2.5 cm, 13 patients
