Percutaneous embolization of periduodenal varix due to portal hypertension in a patient with kidney-pancreas transplantation: a case report. Kidney-pancreas transplantation is a valid therapeutic option for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. However, vascular complications associated with pancreas transplantation are not uncommon. Herein we have reported a 32-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and celiac disease. She underwent liver transplantation for acute hepatitis. After 7 years, the patient developed end-stage kidney disease beginning hemodialysis and being listed for a kidney-pancreas transplantation, which was successfully performed when she was 29 years old with enteric diversion (Roux intestinal loop reconstruction). Five years after kidney-pancreas transplantation, she was admitted to our hospital with serious intestinal bleeding and poor liver function. The ultrasound showed a pattern like a arteriovenous fistula near the head of the pancreas. Computed Tomography was not diagnostic an arteriogram showed the presence of a mesenteric varix and a mesenteric-caval shunt through the duodenum of the pancreatic graft. The liver biopsy and portal pressure gradient showed portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis. To obtain time a waiting a new liver, the patient underwent percutaneous embolization of the mesenteric varix through jugular access. The procedure was uneventful. The patient was successfully transplanted 2 months later. Pancreas function was always satisfactory.
