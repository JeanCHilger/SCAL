Diagnostic sensitivity of imaging modalities for hepatocellular carcinoma smaller than 2 cm. To compare the imaging results with histology and to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity of imaging modalities for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) smaller than 2 cm.Nodules smaller than 2 cm (n = 34) revealed by ultrasonography (US) in 29 patients with liver cirrhosis were analyzed. Histological diagnosis of HCC was performed by ultrasonographic guidance: moderately-differentiated HCC (n = 24) well-differentiated HCC (n = 10). The patterns disclosed by the four imaging modalities defined the conclusive diagnosis of HCC: (1) contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), hypervascularity in the arterial phase and washout in the equilibrium phaseOverall, the sensitivity of diagnosing HCC smaller than 2 cm was 52.9% (18/34) (95% CI: 35.1-70.2) by CECT 67.6% (23/34) (95% CI: 49.5-82.6) by Sonazoid CEUSChanging the main diagnostic modality for HCC smaller than 2 cm from CT arterioportal angiography to Sonazoid CEUS and Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI is recommended.
