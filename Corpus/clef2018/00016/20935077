Decompensated chronic heart failure: increased liver stiffness measured by means of transient elastography. To analyze transient elastography-measured liver stiffness in patients with acute decompensated heart failure to describe variations in liver stiffness measurements and assess their relationship with the patients' clinical course and laboratory data.This study was approved by the local institutional review board, and all of the subjects gave verbal informed consent. Twenty-seven hospitalized patients with heart failure with no signs of liver disease (mean age, 79 years ± 12 [standard deviation] 12 men [mean age, 78 years ± 11], 15 women [mean age, 80 years ± 12]) underwent liver stiffness and N-terminal proβ brain natriuretic peptide (NTproβBNP) assessments at admission, and 24 patients underwent stiffness measurements at discharge. (Three patients had failed measurement at admissionAmong the patients with heart failure, median liver stiffness at admission was 8.80 kPa (interquartile range, 5.92-11.90 kPa), greater than 7.65 kPa in 14 (58%) cases and greater than 13.01 kPa in five (21%). During hospitalization, liver stiffness decreased in 18 patients (including all five patients with baseline measurement > 13.01 kPa) and increased in five. Median liver stiffness (P < .003) and NTproβBNP (P < .001) levels both significantly decreased during hospitalization. Liver stiffness was less than 7.65 kPa in all control patients and did not significantly change during hospitalization (P = .261).Most patients with acute decompensated heart failure have high liver stiffness values which, like NTproβBNP levels, tend to decrease with clinical improvement.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.10100013/-/DC1.
