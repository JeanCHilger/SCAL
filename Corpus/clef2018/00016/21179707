Shearwave-based ultrasound viscoelasticity measurement system for evaluation of liver fibrosis. This paper describes a liver elasticity and viscosity measurement system based on existing medical ultrasound platforms. This system relies on acoustic radiation force to invoke transient response on soft tissue, and employs displacement estimation algorithms to detect the propagation of shear wave. The research proves that the velocity of the shear wave may serve as a reliable estimation of the Young's modulus and viscosity coefficient of the liver tissue, and existing commercial products may be easily adapted to support this technique without extra hardware cost.
