Radiological diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in 2010. The aim of diagnosis imaging is to detect hepatocellular carcinoma at an early stage, when a curative treatment is available. Biopsy is no longer required prior to treatment, and diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is heavily dependent of imaging characteristics. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to describe the typical features of small (<20mm) and larger hepatocellular carcinomas with noninvasive diagnostic criteria, including ultrasound, computed tomography and MRI. Advances in these imaging modalities have greatly improved the detection of small hepatic nodules on liver cirrhosis, including the different steps of carcinogenesis, from regenerative to dysplastic nodules, and we emphasize the difficulties of radiological differentiation of precancerous lesions and small hepatocellular carcinomas.
