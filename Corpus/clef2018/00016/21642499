Liver growth factor treatment restores cell-extracellular matrix balance in resistance arteries and improves left ventricular hypertrophy in SHR. Liver growth factor (LGF) is an endogenous albumin-bilirubin complex with antihypertensive effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We assessed the actions of LGF treatment on SHR mesenteric resistance and intramyocardial arteries (MRA and IMA, respectively), heart, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats treated with vehicle or LGF (4.5 Î¼g LGF/rat, 4 ip injections over 12 days) were used. Intra-arterial blood pressure was measured in anesthetized rats. The heart was weighted and paraffin-embedded. Proliferation, ploidy, and fibronectin deposition were studied in carotid artery-derived VSMC by immunocytochemistry. In MRA, we assessed: 1) geometry and mechanics by pressure myography 2) function by wire myography
