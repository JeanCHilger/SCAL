Lobar and segmental atrophy of the liver. Lobar atrophy of the liver has been recognized as a complication of hepatic and biliary disease for many years. Previously regarded as rare and clinically unimportant, it is now accepted as reasonably common and clinically significant in many patients. Atrophy of liver lobes and, now, also segments, is much more frequently diagnosed because of the routine use of ultrasound and computed tomography scanning in the assessment of hepatobiliary disease, together with its recognition on angiograms and at laparoscopy.
