Evaluation of liver fibrosis by transient elastography in methotrexate treated patients. Methotrexate (MTX) safety is questioned by the risk of inducing liver fibrosis (LF). As transient elastography (FibroScan®) is an effective non-invasive technique to evaluate LF, our aims were to assess LF in MTX-treated patients, to evaluate LF regarding treatment duration and cumulative dose, and to determine differences depending on the underlying disease.Prospective study including patients with rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis treated with MTX. Hepatic stiffness was determined by FibroScan®. The LF cut-off values were established using METAVIR score.Of 53 patients, 22 were men (41.5%), mean age was 55 (15) years, 17 (32%) had rheumatoid arthritis, 18 (34%) inflammatory bowel disease, and 18 (34%) psoriasis. Mean MTX cumulative dose was 1,805 (1,560) mg, and mean treatment duration was 178 weeks. Mean hepatic stiffness was 6.19 (2.43) KPa. In 49 patients (92.5%), absence/mild LF was found (F ≤ 2), and 4 patients (7.5%) had advanced LF (F ≥ 3). Treatment duration or cumulative doses of MTX were not associated with LF.Regarding LF development, MTX therapy is safe. FibroScan® is useful for monitoring LF in MTX-treated patients.
