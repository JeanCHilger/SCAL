Descriptive analysis of diseases associated with Streptococcus bovis bacteremia. It is well-known the relationship between Streptococcus bovis (S. bovis) bacteremia and colon cancer, liver cirrhosis and others neoplasms. However, a study protocol to rule out these underlying diseases has not been carried out yet. Our objective was to describe S. bovis bacteremia and associated diseases.Multicenter, retrospective cohort study. S. bovis bacteremias episodes between 2001 and 2009 were included. Mean variables: colon neoplasm, non-colonic neoplasm or liver cirrhosis. Epidemiologist aspects, bacteremia related variables, personal and familiar history and clinical and analytical data were collected.Ninety three patients were included. One out of four individuals had a colon neoplasm. Fifty seven per cent were concomitant cases with bacteremia and six cases were diagnosed after bacteremia (time bacteremia-diagnosis of neoplasm [months], median [Q1-Q3], 2.6 [1-11]). Fourteen (15%) patients were diagnosed with any non-colonic neoplasm (mainly biliary and pancreatic [6 cases] or esophagus-gastric [3 cases]). There were three patients (21%) with concomitant bacteremia non-colonic neoplasm and two after it (1.2 and 10.4 months). Twenty-one (23%) patients suffered from liver cirrhosis.Patients with S. bovis bacteremia must undergo a study designed to rule out underlying diseases. We suggest that this study should include: a colonic evaluation, ideally by colonoscopy, a liver evaluation by serum chemistry, an abdominal ultrasound scan or a method of liver fibrosis assessment, a gastroscopy and an evaluation of biliary and pancreatic areas by magnetic resonance imaging.
