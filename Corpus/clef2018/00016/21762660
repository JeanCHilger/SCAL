Cardiac structural and functional alterations in infants and children with biliary atresia, listed for liver transplantation. Cirrhotic liver diseases are associated with abnormalities in cardiac geometry and function in adults (cirrhotic cardiomyopathy) but rarely explored in cirrhotic infants or children. We proposed that features of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy are present in infants with cirrhosis due to biliary atresia (BA) as early as the time of evaluation for liver transplant and will correlate with mortality and postoperative morbidity.Two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) of infants with BA (n=40 median age, 8 months), listed for transplantation at the Texas Children's Hospital from 2004 to 2010, were reviewed and compared with age- and sex-matched infants without cardiac or liver disease (controls). Length of stay and correlation with 2DE results were assessed.Compared with controls, children with BA had significant increases in multiple 2DE parameters, notably left ventricle wall thickness (23% increase), left ventricular (LV) mass indexed to body surface area (51% increase), and LV shortening fraction (8% increase). Overall, features of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy were observed in most infants (29/40 72%)Cardiomyopathy is a prevalent condition in infants with end-stage cirrhotic liver disease due to BA (>70%). This underrecognized condition likely contributes to the prolongation of posttransplant hospitalization.
