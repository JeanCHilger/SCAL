Influence of the degree of liver failure on portal blood flow in patients with liver cirrhosis. Portal vein haemodynamics as demonstrated by the pulsed Doppler system were studied in 37 patients with cirrhosis who had been classified in three groups (A, B, and C) in accordance with the degree of liver failure. Maximal inner diameter of the portal vein was significantly lower in patients who were considered to be in good condition (group A) than in patients with moderate and severe liver failure (group B and group C) (p less than 0.001). A significant difference was also found between group A and group B and between group A and group C with regard to the portal blood velocity and portal blood flow (p less than 0.001). In accordance with the presence and size of the oesophageal varices, in patients with large varices the portal blood velocity and portal blood flow were significantly lower than in patients without varices (p less than 0.001), whereas maximal inner portal vein diameter was significantly higher (p less than 0.001). This study demonstrated that in patients with cirrhosis circulatory alterations in the portal vascular bed may be, at least in part, an indicator of the stage of liver disease.
