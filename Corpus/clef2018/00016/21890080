Comparison of the frequency of coronary artery disease in alcohol-related versus non-alcohol-related endstage liver disease. There are conflicting data as to the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) being assessed for liver transplantation (LT). The aims of this study were to compare the prevalence of CAD in patients with alcohol-related versus non-alcohol-related ESLD and to assess the diagnostic utility of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in predicting angiographically important CAD. Consecutive patients with ESLD being assessed for LT (n = 420, mean age 56 ± 8 years) were identified and divided into groups of those with alcohol-related ESLD (n = 125) and non-alcohol-related ESLD (n = 295). Demographic characteristics, CAD risk factors, results of DSE, and coronary angiographic characteristics were recorded. There were no significant differences in age or CAD risk factors between groups. The incidence of severe CAD (>70% diameter stenosis) was 2% in the alcohol-related ESLD group and 13% in the non-alcohol-related ESLD group (p <0.005). In the 2 groups, the presence of ≥1 CAD risk factor was associated with significant CAD (p <0.05 for all). Absence of cardiac risk factors was highly predictive in ruling out angiographically significant disease (negative predictive value 100% for alcohol-related ESLD and 97% for non-alcohol-related ESLD). DSE was performed in 205 patients. In the 2 groups, DSE had poor predictive value for diagnosing significant CAD but was useful in ruling out patients without significant disease (negative predictive value 89% for alcohol-related ESLD and 80% for non-alcohol-related ESLD). In conclusion, there was a significantly lower prevalence of severe CAD in patients with alcohol-related ESLD. These findings suggest that invasive coronary angiography may not be necessary in this subgroup, particularly in the absence of CAD risk factors and negative results on DSE.
