Splenic elasticity measured with real-time tissue elastography is a marker of portal hypertension. To prospectively correlate spleen elasticity and degree of portal hypertension estimated with the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and to evaluate splenic elasticity as a predictor of gastroesophageal varices.The institutional review board approved this study, and patients provided written informed consent. In a pilot study of 60 patients with chronic liver damage, the authors measured liver and spleen elasticity with real-time tissue elastography (RTE), obtained serum markers related to fibrosis, examined hepatic and splenic blood flow with duplex Doppler ultrasonography, estimated HVPG, and performed upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Then, with use of thresholds determined in the pilot study, the authors conducted a validation trial with another 210 patients, performing all studies except the measurement of HPVG. The relationship between HVPG and the other parameters was analyzed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal varices were calculated by using cutoff values obtained from receiver operating characteristic curves.Among the parameters associated with HVPG, correlation was closest with splenic elasticity (R = 0.854, P < .0001). When 8.24 was selected as the cutoff of splenic elasticity for predicting HVPG of more than 10 mm Hg, the accuracy of diagnosing gastroesophageal varix was 90% (sensitivity, 96% specificity, 85%Splenic elasticity determined with RTE is the most closely associated parameter for evaluating HVPG and is useful as a clinical marker of portal hypertension and a predictive marker of gastroesophageal varices.
