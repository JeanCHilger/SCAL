MR elastography for noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis: experience from a tertiary center in Asia. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of MR elastography (MRE) in the staging of hepatic fibrosis (HF) using histopathology as the reference standard in an Asian population.MRE was performed on 55 patients with chronic liver diseases or biliary diseases and on 5 living related liver donors (48 men and 12 women mean age, 55.7 years). MRE was performed with modified, phase-contrast, gradient-echo sequences, and the mean stiffness values were measured on the elastograms in kilopascals(kPa). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the cutoff value and accuracy of MRE for staging HF. Histopathologic staging of HF according to the METAVIR scoring system served as the reference.Liver stiffness increased systematically along with the fibrosis stage. With a shear stiffness cutoff value of 3.05 kPa, the predicted sensitivity and specificity for differentiating significant liver fibrosis (â‰¥ F2) from mild fibrosis (F1) were 89.7% and 87.1%, respectively. In addition, MRE was able to discriminate between patients with severe fibrosis (F3) and those with liver cirrhosis (sensitivity, 100% specificity, 92.2%), with a shear stiffness cutoff value of 5.32 kPa.MRE could be a promising, noninvasive technique with excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant HF and liver cirrhosis.
