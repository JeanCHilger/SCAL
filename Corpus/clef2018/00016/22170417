Non-selective β-blockers improve the correlation of liver stiffness and portal pressure in advanced cirrhosis. Liver stiffness (LS) correlates with portal pressure (hepatic venous pressure gradient, HVPG). However, the dynamic components of portal hypertension (PHT) in advanced cirrhosis may not be adequately assessed by TE. The influence of treatment with non-selective β-blockers (NSBB) on the correlation of HVPG and LS has not been investigated.One hundred and twenty-two patients with esophageal varices were included. LS, hemodynamic parameters, and HVPG were recorded at baseline (BL) and after 6 weeks of treatment with NSBB (FU). The correlation of LS and HVPG was compared to control patients with HVPG ≤ 12 mmHg.Patients with higher Child-Pugh stages (A:88/B:25/C:9) had higher levels of liver stiffness (47.4 ± 16.5 vs. 70.3 ± 7.9 vs. 73.7 ± 2.1 kPa) and HVPG (21 ± 5 vs. 26 ± 5 vs. 26 ± 4 mmHg). The correlation of LS and HVPG was stronger in controls with HVPG ≤ 12 mmHg (R = 0.951 P < 0.0001) than in patients with HVPG > 12 mmHg (R = 0.538Targeting the hyperdynamic circulation and the increased splanchnic blood inflow by treatment with NSBB unmasks the linear (mechanical) correlation of HVPG and LS in patients with HVPG > 12 mmHg. Measurement of LS by TE is not a feasible method to assess the dynamic components of PHT.
