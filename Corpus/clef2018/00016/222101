Morphological liver diagnosis in radiology. Based on the experiences incurred in the years 1970 to 1977, this thesis deals with the efficiency of sonography, scintigraphy and angiography as well as such supplementary diagnostic procedures as ERCP, hepatography and computed tomography in circumscribed hepatic processes. Based on the typical clinical findings obtained, recommendations are made on further diagnostic procedures according to the given hospital structure in Austria: 80% of liver metastases and circumscribed space-occupying primary lesions may be diagnosed by sonography in Basic Hospitals (Standardkrankenanstalten) while cystic processes may be excluded. Solitary space-occupying lesions will have to be examined further by scintigraphy and angiography on the next highest level, the General Hospital (Schwerpunktkrankenanstalt). In combined application, diagnostic accuracy increases to 90%. ERCP, hepatography and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography are used in special clinical cases only. Computed tomography, available in Central Hospitals (University Hospitals), will not replace the other morphological, diagnostic procedures.
