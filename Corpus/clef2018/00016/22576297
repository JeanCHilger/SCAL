Common genetic variation in vitamin D metabolism is associated with liver stiffness. Recently, genome-wide studies identified genetic variants that affect serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in healthy populations (rs12785878, near dehydrocholesterol reductase, DHCR7 rs10741657, at CYP2R1Common variation in 25(OH)-vitamin D metabolism is associated with liver stiffness in patients presenting with low to moderately increased elasticity. Although the susceptible DHCR7 genotype confers small risk, we speculate that the observed stiffness differences indicate a stronger influence of 25(OH)-vitamin D on initiation rather than progression of hepatic fibrosis.
