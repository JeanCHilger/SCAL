Course of liver fibrosis in HIV-hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients depending on the response to hepatitis C therapy. To evaluate the course of liver fibrosis, 328 HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients (210 HCV treated and 118 HCV untreated) were followed-up for 38-42 months. Liver fibrosis was assessed by biopsy or elastometry at baseline and by elastometry afterward, in addition to other noninvasive indexes. A combined liver stiffness stage (LSS) was established and evaluated over time. Eighty patients had sustained virological response (SVR) and 130 had treatment failure (TF) after a standard course of peginterferon-ribavirin therapy. LSS decreased significantly in all fibrosis indexes during HCV therapy in treated patients, but the improvement persisted only in those with SVR. At the end of study, median elastometry values suffered variations of -29%, -5.0%, and +15.4% in SVR, TF, and untreated patients, respectively. Likewise, LSS worsened in 2.5%, 33.1%, and 39% of these groups, respectively: [OR (95% CI) 19.3 (4.4-119), p<0.001] for TF vs. SVR [24.9 (5.6-154), p<0.001] for no therapy vs. SVR
