Noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis in Egyptian patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. To evaluate the accuracy of specific biochemical markers for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.One hundred and fifty-four patients with chronic HCV infection were included in this study 124 patients were non-cirrhotic, and 30 were cirrhotic. The following measurements were obtained in all patients: serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin, total bilirubin, prothrombin time and concentration, complete blood count, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HCVAb, HCV-RNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, abdominal ultrasound and ultrasonic-guided liver biopsy. The following ratios, scores and indices were calculated and compared with the results of the histopathological examination: AST/ALT ratio (AAR), age platelet index (API), AST to platelet ratio index (APRI), cirrhosis discriminating score (CDS), Pohl score, GÃ¶teborg University Cirrhosis Index (GUCI).AAR, APRI, API and GUCI demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy of liver cirrhosis (80.5%, 79.2%, 76.6% and 80.5%, respectively) P values were: < 0.01, < 0.05, < 0.001 and < 0.001, respectively. Among the studied parameters, AAR and GUCI gave the highest diagnostic accuracy (80.5%) with cutoff values of 1.2 and 1.5, respectively. APRI, API and GUCI were significantly correlated with the stage of fibrosis (P < 0.001) and the grade of activity (P < 0.001, < 0.001 and < 0.005, respectively), while CDS only correlated significantly with the stage of fibrosis (P < 0.001) and not with the degree of activity (P > 0.05). In addition, we found significant correlations for the AAR, APRI, API, GUCI and Pohl score between the non-cirrhotic (F0, F1, F2, F3) and cirrhotic (F4) groups (P values: < 0.001, < 0.05, < 0.001, < 0.001 and < 0.005, respectivelyThe use of AAR, APRI, API, GUCI and Pohl score measurements may decrease the need for liver biopsies in diagnosing cirrhosis, especially in Egypt, where resources are limited.
