Hepatic steatosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus in health workers. patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) appear to have an increased risk of developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and have higher risk to develop hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. The aim was to determine the prevalence of NAFLD in health workers with T2DM by liver ultrasound.health workers with T2DM attended at the Family Medicine Unit No. 77, Madero City, Tamaulipas, Mexico, were screened. Risk factors, BMI, % of body fat (% BF), fat mass, waist circumference (WC), blood pressure, HbA1C and lipid profile, were evaluated. The patients were categorized into two groups according to NAFLD status. Differences between groups were assessed by independent t test and Ï‡(2) test.the NAFLD prevalence found in females on ultrasound examination was 40 % and 17.1 % in males. NAFLD patients were more obese (p < 0.001) and they had significantly higher values of % BF (p < 0.001), fat mass (p < 0.01) and WC (p < 0.01). They also had significantly higher values of HbA1C (p < 0.04) and triglycerides (p < 0.03) than patients without NAFLD.NAFLD is common among health workers with T2DM. It is important to prevent NAFLD progression.
