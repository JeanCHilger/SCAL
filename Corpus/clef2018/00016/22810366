Serum lactate level predict mortality in elderly patients with cirrhosis. Cirrhotic patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) usually have multi-organ failure. Multiple organ failure entails a very poor outcome in all intensive care patients. Cirrhotic patients show high morbidity and mortality rates compared with other critically ill patients. Severity scores have been developed for cirrhotic patients admitted to ICU. The main aim of this study was to determine whether lactate level gives any predictive value for mortality in cirrhotic elderly patients admitted to the ICU.In all the patients enrolled, a diagnosis of cirrhosis was confirmed either histologically or by resorting to clinical, laboratory, and ultrasonographic findings. During this period, patients with cirrhosis were admitted to the ICU with varying indications. Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and lactate were compared between deceased and discharged patients.A total of 90 consenting patients were enrolled in this study. The mean age of all the patients was 69 ± 5.919. We detected etiological factors for cirrhosis as HBV, HCV, alcohol, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Hepatorenal syndrome and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were significantly higher in patients who died than in those who were discharged from the ICU (p values were 0.01 and 0.028, respectively). Lactate level, CTP, APACHE II, MELD and SOFA scores were significantly higher in patients who died than in those who were discharged from the ICU (p values were 0.002,  <  0.001, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively).Many factors may be useful as a predictor of mortality in ICU in elderly patients with cirrhosis. In terms of prognostic value, the lactate level and APACHE II score are the two best predictive factors in cirrhotic elderly patients admitted to the ICU.
