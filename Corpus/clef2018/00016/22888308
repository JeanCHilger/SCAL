Ultrasonographic prevalence and factors predicting left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients with liver cirrhosis: is there a correlation between the grade of diastolic dysfunction and the grade of liver disease? Presence of cardiac dysfunction has been associated with an unfavorable prognosis in patients with liver cirrhosis. In the present study, 92 consecutive, newly-diagnosed patients with liver cirrhosis were prospectively evaluated. Liver disease was graded according to the modified Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score whereas left ventricular diastolic function was assessed by Doppler-echocardiography and graded (Stage 0 to 4) according to current guidelines. Overall, DD was diagnosed in 55/92 (59.8%) patients [DD-stage-1: 36/92 (39.1%), DD-stage-2: 19/92 (20.6%)]. Prevalence of DD-stage-1 among the different stages of liver cirrhosis was: CTP-class A: 11/29 (37.9%), B: 15/39 (38.5%), C: 10/24 (41.6%), (P > 0.05 in all comparisons), whereas for DD-stage-2 the corresponding proportions were CTP-class A: 3/29 (10.3%), B: 5/39 (12.8%), C: 11/24 (45.8%), (P = 0.0009 between CTP-class C versus A and B). Age > 53 years (Odd's Ratio [OR]: 4.2 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-12.1) and CTP-class C (OR: 4.6
