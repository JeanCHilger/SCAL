Effect of metoclopramide on transmural oesophageal variceal pressure and portal blood flow in cirrhotic patients. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of metoclopramide on transmural oesophageal variceal pressure and portal blood flow in cirrhotic patients. Sixteen cirrhotics were randomly assigned to metoclopramide (10 mg i.v.) or saline. Metoclopramide significantly decreased transmural variceal pressure (15.7% decrease, p less than 0.05 vs. basal value). In order to evaluate if the metoclopramide-induced drop in transmural variceal pressure was due to an effect on portal haemodynamics, we also measured, by means of real time and pulsed Doppler ultrasonography, portal vein diameter, mean velocity of portal flow, and portal venous flow. No significant change was observed before and after metoclopramide. In conclusion, metoclopramide, which increases lower oesophageal sphincter pressure, significantly decreases transmural variceal pressure in cirrhotic patients. However, it does not have any effect on portal haemodynamics.
