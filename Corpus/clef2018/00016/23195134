Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products and liver stiffness in postoperative biliary atresia. Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) has emerged as a possible biomarker of several disease conditions, including liver injury. This study was aimed to assess serum sRAGE and liver stiffness in biliary atresia (BA).Forty postoperative BA patients and 20 controls were enrolled. Serum sRAGE levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Liver stiffness scores were measured by transient elastography.BA patients had higher serum sRAGE and liver stiffness values than controls (P<0.001). Serum sRAGE and liver stiffness values were significantly elevated in BA patients with jaundice compared to those without jaundice (P<0.001). Additionally, serum sRAGE was correlated with liver stiffness and serum total bilirubin (r=0.65, P<0.001 and r=0.71, P<0.001, respectively).Serum sRAGE was associated with the severity of BA. Accordingly, serum sRAGE and liver stiffness may serve as indicators reflecting the severity and the development of hepatic fibrosis in postoperative BA.
