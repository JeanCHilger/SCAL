Impact of the severity of end-stage liver disease in cardiac structure and function. The impact of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) in cardiac remodeling of patients with cirrhosis is unknown. Our aim was to correlate the severity of ESLD with morphologic and functional heart changes.184 patients underwent a protocol providing data on the severity of ESLD and undergoing echocardiography to assess the diameters of the left atrium and right ventricle the systolic and diastolic diameters of the left ventricle, interventricular septum, and posterior wall of the left ventricleLeft-atrial diameter (r = 0.323 IC 95% 0.190-0.455Changes in cardiac structure and function correlate with the severity of ESLD.
