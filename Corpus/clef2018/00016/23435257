Associating portal congestive gastropathy and hepatic fibrosis in hepatosplenic mansoni schistosomiasis. Upper digestive bleeding is one of the most serious complications of mansoni schistosomiasis, and portal congestive gastropathy (PCG) is responsible for 25-30% of the cases of bleeding instead of bleeding due to esophageal varices. This study aimed to investigate the association between PCG with parameters of portal hypertension and the intensity of periportal fibrosis assessed by ultrasonography, in patients with mansoni schistosomiasis. A prospective study was made of 71 patients whether or not they had a history of upper digestive bleeding, and who had not been previously treated for portal hypertension (splenectomy, use of beta blockers or endoscopic treatment). Patients with other liver diseases were excluded. After signing a form of consent, the patients underwent endoscopy, as well as ultrasonography of the abdomen, and hematological, biochemical and viral markers tests. Chi-square and Fischer's exact tests were used in the statistical analysis. The mean age of the 71 patients was 50 Â± 14.5 years of whom 59.2% were women. 45.1% had antecedents of upper digestive bleeding. PCG was observed in 39 patients (54.9%): severe in 8.5%, and mild in 46.5%. A positive association was observed between PCG and the grade of esophageal varices (p=0.017) and the pattern of periportal fibrosis (p=0.041). A negative association was observed between PCG and red spots on the varices (p=0.024). PCG in patients with mansoni schistosomiasis not submitted to treatment for portal hypertension is associated with the sonographic pattern of hepatic fibrosis, as well as with the grade of esophageal varices.
