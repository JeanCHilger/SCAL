Liver fibrosis assessment using transient elastography guided with real-time B-mode ultrasound imaging: a feasibility study. Liver fibrosis is a kind of chronic damage of the liver and can lead to cirrhosis, one of the top 10 causes of death in the Western world. However, there is still a lack of noninvasive methods for diagnosing liver fibrosis. Fibroscan (Echosens, Paris, France), a device based on A-mode transient elastography, has shown promising results. In this study, a transient elastography system with real-time B-mode imaging for non-invasive liver fibrosis assessment, named Liverscan, was developed its performance was tested and compared with that of the Fibroscan. A specific measurement probe was designed and fabricated with a B-mode ultrasound transducer fixed along the axis of a mechanical vibrator. It was integrated with the Liverscan to measure liver stiffness based on the shear wave propagation in liver tissues. The system was validated by mechanical indentation test using custom-made agar-gelatin phantoms with different stiffness. To further test its feasibility, in vivo measurements were conducted in 67 volunteers (age, 34 ± 3 years
