Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy and hepatopulmonary syndrome: prevalence and prognosis in a series of patients. Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is of prognostic value in patients awaiting for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), but little is known about the effect of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (CCM). The aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence and possible relation between respiratory and cardiac abnormalities in a same series of patients awaiting OLT. Special attention was paid to the prognostic value of CCM in comparison to HPS. Eighty-three patients were included (19 females, 64 males 52.1 ± 10.0 yrs). All had lung function testing with arterial blood gases and echocardiographic evaluation at rest with a contrast echocardiography in case of arterial oxygenation defect. To estimate the presence of CCM, patients underwent a complete left and right echocardiography and Doppler examination. Complete echocardiographic assessment could be obtained in 64 of the 83 patients of the study. HPS was observed in 16.9% (14/83) and CCM in 23.4% (15/64) of patients. There was a tendency of more serious adverse events before and after OLT in patients with HPS in comparison to others but CCM was not of prognostic value. HPS and CCM were frequent in these patients awaiting OLT but both abnormalities were not found in the same patients. CCM was neither related to death before OLT nor to death or serious adverse events after OLT.
