Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is associated with significant changes in mitral inflow parameters. Liver cirrhosis is associated with hyperdynamic circulation which can result in heart failure. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) due to increase of cardiac output is a stressful stimulus for cardiovascular system. Therefore, new methods for early detection of heart failure are needed. Transmitral flow is a marker of diastolic dysfunction.To analyze short- and long-term effect of TIPS procedure on transmitral flow.55 patients (38 men and 17 women, 55.6 Â± 8.9 years) with liver cirrhosis treated with TIPS were enrolled in the study. Echocardiography was performed before, 24 h, 7, 30 and 180 days after the procedure. During 6 month follow up 22 patients died. Results. Left ventricle end-diastolic diameter was increasing during the follow-up [baseline: 47 (44.7-51.2) mm, day 7: 50 (46.5-51.3) mm, p < 0.05 day 30: 49.5 (46.7-55.2) mm, p < 0.01Hemodynamic changes following TIPS procedure can be monitored using echocardiography. Transmitral flow analysis can serve as a useful tool for evaluating of diastolic function in these patients.
