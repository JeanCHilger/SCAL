Obesity and diabetes: newer concepts in imaging. Quantifying body fat is currently an area of active research. Recent studies have shown that the quantity and location of fat in different compartments have varying clinical significance. This information can now be obtained from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR), and it can inform clinical decision making for patient management. Diabetes patients with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ranging from steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis, typically diagnosed by liver biopsy or serum markers. There is now an emerging role of noninvasive imaging tests such as MR imaging or MR spectroscopy or elastography, which can provide quantitative information and have potential to avoid biopsy. Obese patients with diabetes are also at risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer. There is an emerging role for imaging in early detection of not only structural but also functional abnormalities of myocardium at a subclinical stage. Screening for cancer is currently recommended only for breast, colon, prostate, and cervix. Given wider availability and advances in imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography/CT (faster scans with higher resolution and less ionizing radiation) and better understanding of molecular biology and risk-stratification, more and more cancers are being detected in early stages with better clinical outcomes. Concerns related to cost, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary interventions must be addressed before population-based screening for other cancers is recommended. Based on ongoing imaging research, it is expected that it will be possible to provide more precise measurement of body fat and detect cardiovascular disease and cancers earlier in their course.
