Recurrent variceal bleeding and shunt patency: prospective randomized controlled trial of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt alone or combined with coronary vein embolization. To prospectively evaluate the efficacy of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) alone and TIPS in association with embolotherapy (TIPS+E) in the variceal coronary vein to prevent recurrent variceal bleeding and stent dysfunction after TIPS creation.Institutional review board approval was obtained all participants provided informed consent. A total of 106 patients (66 men, 40 womenTIPS placement was successful in all patients. Recurrent variceal bleeding ranked second among causes of death after TIPS placement. Although the 3-year cumulative rates of shunt patency, recurrent variceal bleeding, and survival in the two groups were not significantly different (P > .05), the 6-month overall rate of shunt patency in the TIPS+E group was significantly higher than that in the TIPS group (96.2% vs 82.0%, P = .019), and the 6-month overall rate of recurrent variceal bleeding was also significantly lower than that in the TIPS group (5.7% vs 20.0%, P = .029).The TIPS+E regimen may reduce the risk of recurrent variceal bleeding during the first 6 months after the TIPS procedure by preventing shunt dysfunction, which may improve liver function and quality of life.
