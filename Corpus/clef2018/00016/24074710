Supplemental Fuzhenghuayu capsule therapy for improving liver fibrosis markers in patients with chronic hepatitis B following unsatisfactory outcome of nucleos(t)ide analogue monotherapy. To investigate the ability of Fuzhenghuayu capsule to improve markers of liver fibrosis when provided as supplemental therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who achieved complete virological response but unsatisfactory resolution of fibrosis markers with nucleos(t)ide analog (NAs) monotherapy.One-hundred-and-ten patients with CHB-related liver fibrosis who had received NA for more than or equal to 2 years and achieved sustained virological response (SVR) but no improvement in liver fibrosis index were randomly divided into two equal groups: experimental group, continued oral NAs (one tablet, 1 time/day) with simultaneous Fuzhenghuayu capsule (1.5 g, 3 times/day) for 48 weeks control group, continued oral NAs only for 48 weeks. Serum fibrosis markers (hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), amino terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIIP) and IV collagen (IV-C)), liver fibrosis stages, B ultrasonic wave, and liver function were observed before (baseline) and after treatment and compared by statistical analysis.The baseline levels of fibrosis markers were not significantly different between the experimental and control groups. After treatment, the levels of all of the fibrosis markers were lower in the experimental group (P less than 0.05 vs. control group HA t = 19.548, LN t = 2.264, PIIIP t = 2.230, and IV-C t = 6.649) and lower than the baseline levels (P less than 0.01For CHB patients who achieve SVR by antiviral treatment with NAs, but unsatifactory improvement in liver fibrosis indices, administration of supplemental Fuzhenghuayu capsule with continued NAs therapy may represent a safe and effective treatment.
