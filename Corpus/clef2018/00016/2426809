Malignant tumors of the liver. HCC occurs infrequently in Western countries, with recent increases being reported in California and parts of Europe. Southeast Asia, Japan, and South Africa continue to have a high incidence of this tumor with HBV, cirrhosis, and the ingestion of aflatoxins being identified as probable risk factors. Although the majority of patients present with abdominal pain or mass indicative of extensive tumor, asymptomatic, small HCCs are being detected with increasing frequency. Early detection in high-risk individuals is best accomplished by screening with serum AFP determinations and liver ultrasonography. CT and arteriography are valuable preoperatively in defining anatomy and determining resectability. Five-year survival following resection for cure of HCC ranges from 20 to 40 per cent, with improved survival reported for small asymptomatic tumors. Resection of metastatic liver tumors from colorectal primaries results in 48 per cent 2-year and 24 per cent 5-year survivals, with an additional 5 per cent dying of recurrent cancer after 5 years. Although patients with simultaneous and metachronous metastases do equally well after resection, the presence of four or more individual deposits adversely affects survival. Hepatic artery ligation or embolization can produce a significant palliative reduction in total tumor mass in patients with unresectable liver metastases. Regional chemotherapy using implantable hepatic artery drug infusion pumps is promising, with reports of prolonged survival compared with historical controls. Regional hyperthermia, laser vaporization of tumor, and cryosurgical techniques may prove to have useful roles in the selective treatment of liver cancer in the future. Orthotopic liver transplantation has been successful primarily in those in whom the malignancy is found incidentally in the chronically diseased liver.
