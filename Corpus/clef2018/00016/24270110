Magnetic resonance elastography of liver: clinical applications. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) has been successfully implemented in the assessment of diffuse liver diseases. Currently, MRE is the most accurate noninvasive technique for detection and staging of liver fibrosis with a potential to replace liver biopsy. Magnetic resonance elastography is able to differentiate isolated fatty liver disease from steatohepatitis with or without fibrosis. Potential clinical applications include the differentiation of benign and malignant focal liver masses and the assessment of treatment response in diffuse liver diseases.
