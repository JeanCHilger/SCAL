Shear wave elastography for evaluation of liver fibrosis. The prognosis and management of chronic viral hepatitis mainly depend on the extent of liver fibrosis, particularly in chronic hepatitis C. Liver histologic analysis is still considered the reference standard in the assessment of liver fibrosis despite the interobserver and interobserver variability in staging and some morbidity and mortality risks. Thus, noninvasive methods for assessing liver fibrosis are of great clinical interest. In the last decade, ultrasound-based techniques to estimate the stage of liver fibrosis have become commercially available. They all have the capability to noninvasively evaluate differences in the elastic properties of soft tissues by measuring tissue behavior when a mechanical stress is applied. Shear wave elastography relies on the generation of shear waves determined by the displacement of tissues induced by the force of a focused ultrasound beam or by an external push. This article reviews the results that have been obtained with shear wave elastography for assessment of liver fibrosis.
