Asymptomatic hepatocellular carcinoma in Child's A cirrhosis. A comparison of natural history and surgical treatment. The present study deals with the natural history of 37 asymptomatic patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, 25 with 2-9-cm tumors who were not surgically treated (first group) and 12 with tumors smaller than 4 cm who underwent resection (second group). All patients were in Child's A class. Two-year survival (according to life-table analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method) was 50% in the first group and 39% in the second group. This difference was not significant. In the first group no relation was found between survival and initial tumor size or alpha-fetoprotein levels. Ultrasound examinations at 3-mo intervals revealed the following patterns of tumor growth: (a) no significant growth during the follow-up (9 patients) (b) significant growth (tumor size at least doubling) only in the final stage of the disease (11 patients)
