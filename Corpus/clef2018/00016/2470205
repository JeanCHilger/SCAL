Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma. Review and perspective. In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, early diagnosis offers the only hope for resection and cure. Data from Asia, where it is closely associated with viral hepatitis, indicate that serum alpha-fetoprotein assay and abdominal ultrasonography are the most effective and feasible screening tests. These data may not be applicable in America, where most patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma have underlying alcoholic cirrhosis. Also, it is unclear whether resecting "curable" lesions prolongs survival, particularly in patients with cirrhosis. Screening trials are indicated to answer these questions. Preventing risk factors, however, especially hepatitis B viral disease, is of paramount importance throughout the world.
