Ultrasonically guided percutaneous ethanol injection therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Ultrasonically guided percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (US-PEIT) was performed in 26 patients with hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in whom neither surgery nor transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) was indicated, or TAE had proved ineffective. Comparison of results by various diagnostic imaging techniques with histopathological findings revealed that tumor necrosis after US-PEIT was correlated with increased echogenicity of the tumor by US, decreased density of the tumor and disappearance of contrast enhancement by computed tomography (CT), and change to a lower signal in the tumor by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI, 0.15 T permanent magnet, spin-echo sequence, repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 2000/80 ms]. Thus, findings by imaging are useful in evaluating the initial effect of US-PEIT. Of three specimens obtained by liver resection and three obtained at autopsy, four showed complete necrosis after US-PEIT (maximum tumor diameter, 3 cm). This method also appeared to be effective in cases of capsular invasion. In this study, the 2-yr survival rate of patients with HCC was 75%. Although this study was not a controlled clinical trial, we conclude that US-PEIT may be a potentially effective treatment for HCC.
