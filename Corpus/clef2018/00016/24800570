Correlation between levels of liver fibrosis and liver fibrosis biochemical parameters of advanced schistosomiasis patients. To explore the correlation between the levels of liver fibrosis and liver fibrosis biochemical parameters of advanced schistosomiasis patients.A total of 48 advanced schistosomiasis patients were investigated and they were examined by the liver biopsy and B ultrasound imaging. At the same time, the liver fibrosis biochemical parameters, including glutamine transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), procollagen III (PC-III), collagen type IV (IV-C), hyaluronic acid (HA) and laminin (LN), were detected. The liver fibrosis levels were classified by the liver biopsy and B ultrasound imaging, respectively, and the correlation between the levels of liver fibrosis and liver fibrosis biochemical parameters were analyzed statistically.There was no correlation between the liver fibrosis levels classified by the liver biopsy and all the liver fibrosis biochemical parameters there was a weak correlation between the liver fibrosis levels classified by the B ultrasound imaging and GGT, AKP, LN and PC-III, respectivelyB ultrasound examination is a better, noninvasive fibrosis inspection method. Liver fibrosis biochemical parameters combined with the B ultrasound examination may better reflect the overall condition of liver fibrosis.
