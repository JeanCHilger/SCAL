Alpha-fetoprotein in hepatic pathology and hepatocarcinoma. We have examined a population of 1099 patients, suffering of HCC and chronic hepatitis of different nature, to determine the frequency and significance of alpha-fetoprotein elevation. Moreover we have followed up a group of 206 patients with liver cirrhosis referred to our department of hepatology in Turin, from January 1981 through April 1989. The AFP test with a cut-off of 50 ng/ml, is positive in 67.2% of tumor patients and in 12.9% of chronic hepatitis. No differences exist in patients carriers of hepatitis B virus versus alcoholic or criptogenetic subjects. Twenty-one out of 206 cirrhotic patients followed-up have developed HCC during the observation period (36.5 +/- 22.4 months). Fifteen out 21 patients (71%) showed an increase of AFP values. In 14 patients the HCC was graded as small (less than 4 cm of diameter at US) and in other 7 as advanced or multifocal. The underlying cirrhosis was alcoholic in 11 (53.3%), cryptogenic in 5 (23.8%), and hepatitis B chronic infection related in 5 (23.8%). Serological surveillance has led, to the identification of 71% of the tumors developing during this study. Using the time-course of AFP as the diagnostic parameter of the risk of HCC, we obtained the best performance in term of sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy. Screening patients at risk of HCC, using abdominal US and AFP testing, is an effective way of determinating small lesions, but how much early determination of HCC in a cirrhotic patient will improve the prognosis remain to be defined.
