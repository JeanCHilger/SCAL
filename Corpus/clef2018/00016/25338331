Selected apoptotic markers in serum of patients with chronic viral hepatitis C. In chronic viral hepatitis C, hepatocytes inflammation, necrosis and apoptosis occur. To evaluate hepatocyte apoptotic rate, a serum concentration of proapoptotic FaS protein and its ligand (FaS/FaSL) as well tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and antiapoptotic hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) may be used. The aim of the study was to evaluate the hepatic apoptosis rate in patients with hepatitis virus C infection and its correlations with the degree of liver inflammation and staging, biochemical tests, viral load and the duration of the infection.60 adults (30 chronic hepatitis C patients and 30 controls) were included into the study. Serum levels of FaS/FaSL, TNFalpha and HGF were evaluated using the ELISA method. The results were correlated with viral load, biochemical tests, as well ultrasonographic and histopathological (grading, staging) examinations.TNF-alpha level in HCV-infected patients was significantly higher than in the controls (11.0 +/- 19.3 pg/ml vs. 3.3 +/- 2.8 pg/ml, p = 0.04). FaS/ FaSL and HGF did not differ significantly in both groups. TNF-alpha level was higher in patients with low staging (fibrosis F-0) than in those with higher staging (F-1, F-2, F-3)--according to the Batts-Ludwig scale. Other markers (FaS/FaSL and HGF) did not differ in groups with variant staging. No significant differences were observed in relation to grading.The measurement of FaSIFaSL, TNF-alpha and HGF does not allow for the assessment about apoptotic rate in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Explanation of this problem need follow-up studies on larger groups with the use of more complex methods.
