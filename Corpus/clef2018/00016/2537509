CT portography in malignant space-occupying lesions of the liver. CT portography was performed in 32 patients with liver tumours and in four patients with cirrhosis of the liver, but without evidence of tumour, after angiographic injection of contrast into the superior mesenteric or splenic arteries. Compared with CT using no contrast, or contrast by intravenous injection, CT portography has the following advantages: better tumour detection, better detection of tumour size, better demarcation and localisation of tumours, better demonstration of the portal system, more inhomogeneity of the parenchyma. Of 12 patients with a number of tumours shown on CT, CT portography demonstrated tumours in four cases, which could not be shown by any other imaging method. Problems concerning CT portography in patients with cirrhosis of the liver are discussed.
