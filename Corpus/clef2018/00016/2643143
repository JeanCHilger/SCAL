Pseudoportal Doppler signal in the partially obstructed inferior vena cava. The Doppler spectrum of the normal inferior vena cava (IVC) shows a majority of flow toward the right atrium, with wide variations in flow velocity and direction owing to effects of the cardiac and respiratory cycles. Seventeen subjects underwent duplex sonography: nine children after liver transplantation, two children with right upper quadrant neuroblastoma, and six healthy control subjects. In six children the spectrum obtained from the IVC bore a strong resemblance to the unidirectional, low-velocity, continuous-flow pattern associated with the portal vein these children included two children with biliary atresia and cirrhosis, two liver transplant recipients, and two children with IVC compression by neoplasm. In healthy children and adults, a pseudoportal Doppler signal in the IVC can be generated by subcostal right upper quadrant compression. The pseudoportal IVC appears to be a sign of partial IVC obstruction. Knowledge of this potential pitfall and meticulous morphologic imaging can help prevent mistaking the IVC for a patent portal vein.
