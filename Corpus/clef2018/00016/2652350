Doppler echography for hemodynamic studies of the azygos vein. Using a convex array transducer, the advantages and shortcomings of transesophageal real-time two-dimensional Doppler echography (TE2DD) were assessed in a study of the vessels around the esophagus and the stomach in 67 adult patients with (n = 56) or without (n = 11) liver cirrhosis. In most cases, all but the upper- and lowermost margins of the azygos vein could be visualized. The more caudally the portion located, the smaller its diameter and flow velocity became. The average number of intercostal veins visualized by TE2DD was 4 per person. The observable esophagogastric varices seemed to be limited to deeply located ones around the esophagogastric junction. In five patients who had undergone distal splenorenal shunt, splenic venous flow, or shunt flow could be seen from the stomach over a length of about 5 cm. The azygos venous flow in cirrhotic patients was significantly greater than that of patients without cirrhosis. TE2DD appears to be very useful for evaluating flow in the cephalad collateral veins and other vessels around the esophagus and the stomach.
