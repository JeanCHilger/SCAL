Monolobar (unilateral), secondary biliary liver cirrhosis in Klatskin tumor. A 79-yr-old male was diagnosed as having an extrahepatic jaundice caused by an adenocarcinoma invading the hepatic duct at its bifurcation (Klatskin tumor). The presented case illustrates an unusual clinical and pathological feature, since in the patient's liver the progression from grossly normal liver parenchyma (right lobe) to a pathological picture of secondary biliary cirrhosis (left lobe) was found.
