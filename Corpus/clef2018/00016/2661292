Value of a score using clinical and biological variables for determining the benignity or malignancy of a hepatic mass. The purpose of this study was to show that clinical and biological data can help in the diagnosis of benignity and malignancy in liver tumors seen on ultrasound. Three hundred and ninety-four patients with liver masses detected by ultrasound (270 malignant, 124 benign) were prospectively studied. Clinical and biological data were tested by univariate and multivariate analysis. The most important variables were gamma-glutamyl-transferase, sedimentation rate, known primary cancer, proven cirrhosis, abnormal abdominal palpation, ascites and weight loss. A regression model was used and a score was defined with these variables. Using this score, 94.8 p. 100 of the liver masses were accurately classified as benign and malignant tumors.
