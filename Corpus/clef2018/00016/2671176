Pattern of gall bladder sonography in chronic liver diseases. Seventy eight patients with diffuse hepatic lesions were selected for this study. They were classified after liver biopsy histopathologically into four groups. 45 patients with pure bilharzial hepatomegaly (group 1). 12 patients with mixed bilharzial hepatosplenomegaly with hepatitis (group 2). 16 patients with chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis (group 3) and 5 patients with extrahepatic cholestasis (group 4). Ultrasonography of gall bladder was done for all patients. Group 3 patients showed the highest incidence of gall stones (29.4%) as compared to other groups (P less than 0.05).
