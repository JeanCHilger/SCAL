H-type shunt with an autologous venous graft for treatment of portal hypertension in children. From 1981 to 1987, 86 children aged 16 months to 16 years underwent a portosystemic shunt procedure using an autologous venous graft (internal jugular vein in 80 cases). Fifty-five mesocaval, 20 splenorenal, 4 portacaval, and 7 makeshift shunts were constructed. The indication for shunting was an extrahepatic portal obstruction in 59 cases, intrahepatic portal obstruction in 23 cases (including 6 cases of congenital hepatic fibrosis), and Budd-Chiari syndrome in 4 cases. One patient of the latter group died early from intractable ascites with a nonfunctioning shunt, and a second child died 2 months after operation from unknown reasons with a patent shunt. With a follow-up over 1 year for 58 of the 84 survivors, 78 successes and 6 failures were recorded according to the clinical outcome and the findings of ultrasonic and endoscopic examinations. Three of the six children with a failed shunt have been submitted to a second successful H-type shunt operation. No case of encephalopathy was recorded in this series. Thus, with an approximate success rate of 95%, the H-type shunt with a venous graft should be recommended for treatment of portal hypertension of extrahepatic origin, especially in young children.
