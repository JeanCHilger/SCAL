Changes in portal blood flow by intravenous administration of glucagon--the relationship between those changes and the total serum bile acid values in UDCA.GLUCAGON tolerance test. G30TBA is the total serum bile acid concentration obtained thirty minutes after injection of glucagon in the UDCA.GLUCAGON tolerance test. We have previously reported the usefulness of G30TBA in evaluating liver function. In this paper, changes in the portal blood flow in response to glucagon administration are measured and the relationship between those changes and G30TBA studied. We used an ultrasonic duplex system composed of a B-mode scanner and doppler flow meter of measure portal blood flow after injection of glucagon in thirty seven patients with chronic liver diseases. The results are as follows: The increase in portal blood flow by exogenous glucagon in liver cirrhosis is statistically significantly lower than that in chronic hepatitis. G30TBA in the good-response-to-glucagon group is statistically significantly lower than that in the poor-response group. These results suggest that the effect of glucagon on portal blood flow significantly influences the serum bile acid concentration in the UDCA.GLUCAGON tolerance test.
