Metastatic nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma: detection with angiography, CT, and US. Accurate detection of intrahepatic metastases, or daughter nodules, of primary hepatocellular carcinoma is of crucial importance. Due to the introduction of infusion hepatic angiography, computed tomography (CT) after Lipiodol (iodized oil) infusion, and intraoperative ultrasound (US), tumors less than 10 mm in diameter are now frequently found. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of these three modalities in the detection of nodules in 45 patients who had hepatocellular carcinoma (confirmed by biopsy). CT with Lipiodol was superior to hepatic angiography in demonstrating nodules when they were overlapped by the primary tumor or very small in size. Intraoperative US demonstrated nodules in four avascular or hypovascular hepatocellular carcinomas, which both hepatic angiography and CT failed to demonstrate. In cases associated with severe liver cirrhosis, differentiation of small nodules from regenerating cirrhotic nodules was sometimes difficult with intraoperative US. The combined use of these three modalities is indispensable for the accurate detection of small nodules of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.
