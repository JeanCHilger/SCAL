Pulsed Doppler in the diagnosis of small liver tumours. Doppler ultrasound detection of the blood flow associated with liver tumours was studied in primary hepatocellular carcinoma as well as in metastatic liver cancer and haemangioma. Doppler signals were detected from 48 of 55 hepatocellular carcinomas (87.3%), seven of 25 metastatic liver cancers (28.0%) and four of 30 haemangiomas (13.3%). The waveforms of Doppler signals were divided into two types: the pulsatile wave, which was detected from hepatocellular carcinoma (in 35 of the 48 with Doppler signals) and metastatic liver cancer (in all seven with positive signals), and the continuous wave, which was seen from hepatocellular carcinoma (41 out of 48) and haemangioma (in all four with signals). In six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent transcatheter arterial embolization, the pulsatile wave detected before therapy disappeared immediately thereafter and it is possible that this type of wave originates from tumour vessels. In the study of small, hypoechoic, mass lesions appearing in liver cirrhosis, such signals were also demonstrated, even in eight of 10 small hepatocellular carcinomas less than 2 cm in diameter, whilst they were not detected from nine regenerative nodules related to cirrhotic change. In conclusion, the Doppler ultrasound method may be a useful technique in detecting blood flow within liver tumours and may offer the possibility of a differential diagnosis of small tumours.
