Radionuclide and ultrasound studies in liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Combined radionuclide and ultrasonic investigations (USI) were performed in 95 patients with liver cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension. Liver and splenic shape structure and the presence of fluid in the abdominal cavity were assessed in USI. Radionuclide methods of investigation were used for determination of the hepatic blood flow, assessment of the shape, size and structure of RP distribution in the liver and spleen, and for calculation of the hepatosplenic index. The most significant signs of differentiation of stages of portal hypertension were the presence and amount of fluid in the abdominal cavity and a hepatic blood flow value reflecting the gravity of protal hypertension. Combined radionuclide and ultrasonic investigations permitted a differentiated approach to staging of portal hypertension and assessment of liver and splenic morphofunctional state that could play an important role in the choice of tactics of surgery of liver cirrhosis.
