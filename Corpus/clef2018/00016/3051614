In vivo acoustic attenuation in liver: correlations with blood tests and histology. Results of in vivo attenuation measurements in the liver have been obtained in 26 normal controls and in 51 patients with chronic diffuse liver disease. A modified real-time sector scanner was used for narrow-band amplitude attenuation examination. In the control group (people without apparent liver disease), a statistically significant correlation was found between acoustic attenuation in liver and two blood tests reflecting liver function: serum albumin (n = 24, r = 0.67, p = 0.002) and prothrombin time (n = 23, r = 0.63, p = 0.019). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between attenuation and fat for all biopsied patients (n = 51, r = 0.32, p = 0.023) and for patients with minimal fibrosis (n = 25, r = 0.45, p = 0.027). Although no correlation with fibrosis was found for all patients, in the group of patients with minimal fat there was a correlation with portal fibrosis (n = 33, r = 0.37, p = 0.035). This double blind prospective study shows that in the liver: (1) attenuation estimates appear correlated with clinical parameters (blood tests) in normal volunteers, and (2) large changes in fat affect narrow-band acoustic attenuation estimates to a greater degree than severe portal fibrosis in patients with chronic diffuse liver disease. Further research is needed before these estimates can become a clinical tool.
