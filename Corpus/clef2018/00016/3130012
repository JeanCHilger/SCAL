Intrapulmonary right-left shunt associated with liver cirrhosis: diagnosis by contrast echocardiography. The hypoxaemia associated with hepatic cirrhosis is classically attributed to an intrapulmonary shunt caused by small vascular abnormalities. Severe hypoxaemia (47 mmHg) associated with dyspnoea, cyanosis and clubbing was observed in a 57-year old man who presented with cirrhosis of the liver. At contrast echocardiography, a right-to-left shunt was demonstrated by the appearance of microcavities in the left atrium and ventricle after peripheral intravenous injection of the contrast medium. The intrapulmonary location of the shunt was determined by a 4 cardiac cycles interval between the arrival of the microcavities in the right heart and their appearance in the left heart. The right-to-left shunt was confirmed by the pure oxygen ventilation test and by pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy with radiolabelled albumin microaggregates. Pulmonary angiography proved normal. Thus, contrast echocardiography is capable of diagnosing right-to-left shunts associated with hepatic cirrhosis and to demonstrate their intrapulmonary location.
