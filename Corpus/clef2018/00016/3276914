Appendices epiploicae of the large bowel. Sonographic appearance and differentiation from peritoneal seeding. Solid hyperechogenic nodules of different sizes and shapes surrounded by ascitic fluid were seen growing from the peritoneal surface of the large bowel in three patients with biopsy-proven alcoholic liver cirrhosis they were spaced at regular intervals along the course of the colon.
