Deep and localized hyperthermia of the liver induced by stereotaxic Nd-YAG laser irradiation. Thirty six hepatic lesions (12-18 mm) of localized hyperthermia are induced in eleven pigs by means of a Nd-YAG laser. Laser shots of 80 W/10 sec. are transmitted through a stereotaxic handpiece coupled to a water cooling circulation protecting the optic fibre. The handpiece placement is performed through an ultrasound-guided trocar. The efficiency of the irradiation is visualized by immediate temperature increasing, by ultrasonographic imaging and by anatomical verifications from operating time to four months. The center of lesion initially occupied by coagulative necrosis is rapidly marginated by a gaining ground fibrosis. At long term a fibrotic network invades the scar and confirms healing free of complications. This ultrasonographically assisted technique is proposed for deep vaporisation of disseminated hepatic metastases.
