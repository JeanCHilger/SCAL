Hepatopancreatic syndrome in chronic alcoholism. The results of puncture biopsy of the liver, ultrasonic and angiographic investigation of the liver and pancreas in 114 patients with chronic alcoholism revealed an increment of changes in these organs in parallel with an increase in the duration of chronic alcoholic intoxication. A simultaneous study of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and C-peptide showed that an increase in the IRI basal level in the patients suffering from alcoholism up to 10 yrs was determined mainly by an increase in the activity of beta-cells. In a long period of alcoholism an increase in the IRI basal level resulted from a decrease in the rate of insulin degradation in the liver as assessed by a lower level of C-peptide. In liver cirrhosis a noticeable decrease in pancreatic incretory function was combined with noticeable disturbance of insulin degradation in the liver. The above investigations showed that there were morphological, functional and clinical signs of the "hepatopancreatic syndrome" in chronic alcoholism.
