Cirrhosis: value of caudate to right lobe ratio in diagnosis with US. To verify the value of ultrasound (US) in the diagnosis of cirrhosis, the ratio of transverse caudate lobe width to right lobe width (C/RL) was determined with US in 25 healthy subjects and 156 consecutive patients with either histologically proved acute viral, chronic persistent, or chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis. The C/RL ratio had a sensitivity of 43%, a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy of 79% in cirrhosis. The sensitivity was very low in alcoholic cirrhosis, low in cryptogenic cirrhosis, and high in hepatitis B virus related cirrhosis. In spite of its fairly low overall sensitivity, the C/RL ratio is a useful measurement in assessing chronic liver disease because of its high specificity in cirrhosis.
