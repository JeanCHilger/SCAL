Value of ultrasound-guided cytopuncture in the diagnosis of tumors in cirrhosis. Study of 29 cases. Ultrasonically guided fine needle aspiration biopsy is known to be of great value in the diagnosis of malignant liver disease, with an overall accuracy rate of 73-94 p. 100. However, investigators have essentially reported cases of liver metastases. In this report, we examined the diagnostic value of this method in the specific case of tumors associated with cirrhosis. Twenty-seven patients with cirrhosis (20 alcoholic, 4 post-hepatitis, 3 hemochromatosis) with ultrasonically suspected hepatic malignancy were studied. They all presented severe blood clotting disturbances and/or ascites. At the end of the study, all patients had proven malignancy (by post mortem biopsy in 14 cases and/or serum AFP greater than 500 microgram/l in 17 cases). There were 25 primary and 2 metastatic tumors. Twenty-nine fine needle aspiration biopsies were performed under ultrasonic guidance. material suitable for cytologic evaluation was obtained in 25 patients. In 14 cases, a diagnosis of malignant involvement of the liver was firmly established by cytological examination it was suggested in 4 other cases. Tumor typing was possible in 12 primary and 2 metastatic tumors, in agreement with the proven diagnosis. The present study shows that fine needle aspiration biopsy under ultrasound guidance is a safe and accurate diagnostic procedure in malignant liver disease associated with cirrhosis.
