Ultrasound in the detection of chronic liver disease (the "bright liver"). The association of high amplitude echoes returned from the liver and advanced cirrhosis is well recognized. We have become increasingly aware of a bright liver echo pattern in relatively mild cases of cirrhosis and in other chronic liver diseases. The pattern is very characteristic but non-specific in pathological terms. We have undertaken a small pilot study based on the observation of this characteristic ultrasound appearance to assess its clinical significance. Recognition of this pattern has always corresponded with liver disease of one of five types: cirrhosis, fatty infiltration, portal tract fibrosis, severe hepatitis or longstanding congestive cardiac failure. Although the use of ultrasound appears to be sensitive in the detection of generalized liver disease, it is relatively non-specific.
