Analysis of the portal vein flow with two-dimensional echo-Doppler method. Blood flow of the portal vein was non-invasively studied in healthy and diseased humans with the combined use of the ultrasonic pulsed Doppler technique and real-time two-dimensional echography. In addition, the influence of food intake to the portal flow was assessed.
