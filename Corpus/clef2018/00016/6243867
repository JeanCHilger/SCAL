Hepatoma metastatic to the orbit. A 69-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis of the liver had unilateral progressive proptosis without jaundice, abdominal pain, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Results of laboratory and radiographic studies were also normal. Orbital biopsy revealed hepatocellular carcinoma. Although hepatocellular carcinoma has often been shown to metastasize to the brain and often to the flat bones of the skull, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first histologically proven case of hepatoma metastatic to the orbit.
