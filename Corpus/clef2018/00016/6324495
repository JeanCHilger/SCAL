Primary biliary cirrhosis. The results from the complex study on 26 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), 20 females and 6 males, an average age of 46 years, are reported. The most frequent symptoms of PBC are itching, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly from the laboratory tests--most characteristic is the increase of serum 5'-nucleotidase, AP, LAP, gamma GTP, GOT, cholesterol, cholic acid and antimitochondrial antibodies and IgM (AP, 5'-nucleotidase and antimitochondrial antibodies, being most significant in making the early diagnosis). The laboratory results in PBC are compared with those of the chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, extrahepatic cholestasis, with outlining the characteristic differences, depending on the diagnosis. The diagnostic advantages of the various methods are discussed (mainly laparoscopy and liver biopsy) and the histologic and electron microscopic changes of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, via echography--81 per cent, laparoscopy--73 per cent, scintigraphy--61.53 per cent and liver biopsy--50 per cent. The results from the treatment with cholestrimine, corticosteroids and azathioprine and surgical treatment, observing a temporary improvement and progressing of PBC, are reported. With the follow-up care of 20 patients, it was established, that 9 had died 5 years, on the average, after making the diagnosis, 11 survived after the 5 years and they are still followed up. The longest survival was reported in two females--11 and 15 years after the onset of PBC.
