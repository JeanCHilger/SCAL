Adiastole caused by a secondary cardiac hemochromatosis. Successful treatment with an iron chelating agent. Severe congestive cardiac failure developed in a few weeks in a 44 year old man who had undergone porto-caval anastamosis for post-hepatitis cirrhosis one year previously and then treated for anaemia by repeated blood transfusion and chronic daily oral iron therapy. Infiltrative, congestive and restrictive cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in the presence of global cardiomegaly, electrocardiographic changes (microvoltage, diffuse ST-T wave changes), echocardiographic appearances (dilatation of the left ventricle, with hypertrophic and hypokinetic walls), and hemodynamic signs of adiastole with equalisation of filling pressures at 15 mmHg and a cardiac index of 1,88 l/min/m2. Cardiac haemochromatosis was confirmed by the laboratory (serum iron: 35 mumol/l siderophilin saturation: 100 p. 100
