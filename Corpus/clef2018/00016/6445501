Echography, laparoscopy and histology in diffuse liver diseases (author's transl). The incidence of error of echography (21.0%), laparoscopy (15.0%) and histology (17.4% was investigated in 504 cases of diffuse liver disease. In the assessment of fatty liver, acute fatty liver, fatty cirrhosis and fibroses the accuracy of echography was comparable to that of laparoscopy and histology. A prerequisite for this is that the assessment of the spleen is given particular attention during the diagnosis of diffuse liver diseases. The assessment of diffuse liver diseases demands a high degree of training of the echography diagnostician.
