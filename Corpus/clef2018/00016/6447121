Left ventricular function in liver cirrhosis: an echocardiographic study. Left ventricular (LV) size and function were studied by echocardiography and measurement of systolic time intervals in 14 patients with liver cirrhosis. There was a small increase in LV end-diastolic dimension, and an increase in systolic ventricular performance, calculated stroke dimension and stroke and cardiac indices. Mean blood pressure was low normal. Preejection period was shortened and the preejection period/LV ejection time ratio, decreased. The data indicate that patients with liver cirrhosis have mild LV enlargment, reduced peripheral resistance and an increase in mesurements of systolic LV performance.
