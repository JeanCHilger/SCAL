Cystic kidneys. Genetics, pathologic anatomy, clinical picture, and prenatal diagnosis. According to the classification of Osathanondh and Potter of cystic kidneys we give an overview of the different types of cystic changes taking genetic aspects into account. Usually pathoanatomic types do not represent genetic entities: All type I kidneys are transmitted in an autosomal recessive way with varying clinical symptoms in rare cases they even present in adults. The relationship to "congenital hepatic fibrosis", "cystic liver", and to the "Caroli syndrome" is discussed. Type II kidneys are usually not genetic in origin
