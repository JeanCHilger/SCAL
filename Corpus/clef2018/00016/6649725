Value of sonographic representation of the portal artery in clinical practice. While in chronic liver diseases we up to now above all depended on laparoscopic indices of the hypertension of the portal vein, also the non-invasive sonography is able to prove an adequate morphological substrate in form of the dilated splenic vein and the portal vein. A comparative study of 50 patients with liver cirrhosis who underwent laparoscopy shows significantly higher values in patients with clear portal hypertension. Provided a correct valuation of the findings by the clinical and a subtle examination technique, the non-invasive sonographic estimation of the portal vein represents a prognostically important diagnostic contribution in patients with chronic liver diseases.
