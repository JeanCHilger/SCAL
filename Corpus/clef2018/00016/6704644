A comparison of computed tomography, ultrasound and scintigraphy in the diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease. In 35 alcoholics with histologically proven liver disease, computed tomography (CT), grey scale ultrasonography and liver scintigraphy were evaluated for their abilities to detect an abnormal liver and to identify the patients with cirrhosis. Abnormal studies were present on CT in 83% of patients, in 64% on ultrasound and in 94% on scintigraphy. In 10 control patients specificity was 90% by CT, 100% by ultrasound and 70% by scintigraphy. CT and ultrasound were poor in identifying the alcoholics with cirrhosis. Scintigraphy suggested cirrhosis in all but one of the patients with this diagnosis. Similar images were obtained in half of the patients with fatty change without cirrhosis but, with the exception of one patient, this appeared to be due to co-existent hepatitis. The results suggest that scintigraphy is the best of the imaging tests for screening alcoholics for cirrhosis.
