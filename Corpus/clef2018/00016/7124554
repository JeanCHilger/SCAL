Primary biliary cirrhosis in elderly females. A series of 29 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis has been studied in the last seven years. An unusual feature of this group was that 38% wee over the age of 65, and 24% over the age of 70 at presentation. Detailed analysis of the seven patients presenting over the age of 70 is provided. All of these patients had symptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis rather than representing prolonged survival of the asymptomatic state. It is important that primary biliary cirrhosis be included in the differential diagnosis of liver disease presenting in the elderly.
