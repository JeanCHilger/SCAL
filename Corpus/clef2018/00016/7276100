Intrahepatic biliary lithiasis : role of Ascaris infection in 150 cases. Experimental study on bile stone formation (author's transl). Biliary infection was the cause of intrahepatic biliary lithiasis in 150 patients operated upon over the last twenty years. Diagnosis was established during operation in the majority of cases, but cholangiography, or ultrasound and/or scintiscan examinations were required in a few patients. To determine the mechanism of formation of these biliary stones, a study was conducted in 30 rabbits divided into three groups, each forming a model of lithogenesis. Pathological examination of the liver demonstrated the presence of multiple abscesses, fibrosis, bile duct stenosis, and perihepatitis. The results of the different types of operative techniques employed in these patients are described.
