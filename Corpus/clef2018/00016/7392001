Ultrasonography appearance of recessive hepatorenal polycystic disease in children (author's transl). Six cases of recessive hepatorenal polycystic disease in infants and young children were explored by intravenous urography and ultrasonography. Sufficient specific ultrasonography findings for making a diagnosis were obtained. The kidneys are large and produce strong echos, with inversion of the normal strength of medullary when compared to cortical echos, and poor definition of the renal sinus. Strong echos are also obtained from the liver, especially in the juvenile forms, because of the large amount of fibrosis. Large intrahepatic biliary ectasias were discovered in a 3-year-old child.
