Choledochus cyst: a case with dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts and congenital liver fibrosis. The authors report the case of a 2-year-old girl with hepatomegaly and failure to thrive in whom the diagnosis of congenital hepatic fibrosis was first considered on the basis of the histological examination of a percutaneous liver biopsy. Further radiographic and ultrasonic investigations of the biliary tree showed a choledocal cyst and dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts. Surgical operation consisted in complete removal of the cyst with hepaticojejunostomy. The congenital intrahepatic abnormalities associated with the choledochal cyst are commented.
