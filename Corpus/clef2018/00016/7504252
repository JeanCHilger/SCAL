Hepatocellular carcinoma. Identifying and screening populations at increased risk. Hepatocellular carcinoma appears to be associated with hepatitis B and C infections and is common in patients with cirrhosis caused by chronic viral hepatitis. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma can lead to early detection and surgical intervention, resulting in improved survival rates. Patients with cirrhosis or unexplained elevation of alphafetoprotein levels should be examined every 3 to 6 months. Patients with chronic viral hepatitis but no underlying liver disease and normal levels of alpha fetoprotein may be examined yearly. Seronegative contacts of hepatitis B virus carriers should be immunized.
