Effectiveness of galactose-based intravenous contrast medium on color Doppler sonography of deeply located hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of intravenously injectable sonographic contrast medium for color Doppler sonographic diagnosis of deeply located hepatocellular carcinoma. Subjects were 7 hepatocellular carcinomas, an adenomatous hyperplasia and a hemangioma located more than 7 cm below the abdominal surface. Levovist, a galactose-based sonographic contrast medium was injected through median cubital vein as a phase-two clinical study, and the pre- and post-enhanced color Doppler sonographic findings of these lesions were compared. The incidence of the positive findings for hepatocellular carcinoma increased from 29% (2/7) to 86% (6/7) of hepatocellular carcinoma after contrast enhancement. Positive findings were 0% in other cases even after enhancement. Levovist brought a certain improvement in the visualization of the tumor vessel by color Doppler sonography without any noteworthy side effects. Contrast enhancement was useful for the diagnosis of liver lesions suspected to be hepatocellular carcinoma by ordinary sonography, but could not be confirmed by color Doppler sonography.
