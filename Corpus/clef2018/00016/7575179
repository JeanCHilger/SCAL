Small hepatocellular carcinoma. New concepts on intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy in orthotopic liver transplantation. Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Epidemiologic studies shows a striking correlation between areas where this tumor is prevalent and where hepatitis virus B and C are endemic, contaminations of food with mycotoxin aflatoxin B1, excessive alcohol intake, prolonged cigarette smoking, sexual hormones. Combination of chemical, physical, and genetic insults to individual hepatocytes involve changes in the genome transformed or neoplastic cell, depending to both the activation of oncogenes (e.g., ras) and the inactivation of tumor supressor genes (e.g., p53). Advances in radiologic techniques such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, angiography and dosages of tumor markers like alpha-fetoprotein offers still the best for diagnosis and screening for hepatocellular carcinoma. Then the diagnosis has become possible during the early stages, characterized to be a very well-differentiated tumour that has returned its preexisting liver structure, with a certain proportion have a multicentric origin. Hepatocellular carcinoma carries an extremely poor prognosis, with a median survival between 2-4 weeks, for those without treatment. Surgical resection are the only curative modality for this disease. In these patients two main patterns of intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy are defined, and depends on the growth of residual satellite tumours or synchronous and metachronous multicentric carcinogenesis. This evolution is estimated to be nearly 50%, with 5-year survival rate of nearly 30%. The presence of cirrhosis, satellite nodules, venous invasion, the absence of capsule formation and positive surgical margin (< or = 5 mm) were associated with higher intrahepatic recurrence rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
