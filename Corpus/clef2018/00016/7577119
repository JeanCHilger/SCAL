Changed hepatic vein flow in patients with cirrhosis. A Doppler study of hepatic veins in patients with cirrhosis. To evaluate the changes in the Doppler waveform of the hepatic veins in patients with cirrhosis.We analyzed prospectively with Doppler ultrasound the flow of the hepatic veins and we compared the different Doppler waveform patterns with the degree of liver failure according to the Child-Pugh score.Forty three patients with cirrhosis and 60 normal individuals with similar age and sex.Abnormal hepatic vein waveforms were found in 40 of 43 patients with cirrhosis and in none of the 50 controls subjects. No statistically significant differences were detected between the different Doppler waveform patterns and the Child-Pugh score (p = 0.063).Our findings indicate that an alteration of the Doppler waveform pattern of hepatic veins suggest the presence of cirrhosis and that there is no association between the degree of the liver failure and the waveform patterns.
