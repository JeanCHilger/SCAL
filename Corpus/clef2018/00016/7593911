Measurements of ultrasonic backscatter coefficients in human liver and kidney in vivo. Ultrasonic backscatter coefficients, in the range of 2.0-4.0 MHz, were measured in normal human livers and kidneys in vivo. In liver, data were acquired and analyzed from 15 normal volunteers and 19 patients with hepatitis. No significant difference between normal and chronic hepatitis was found. The power-law fit to the backscatter coefficient in normal liver as a function of frequency was eta(f) = 4.5 x 10(-5) f1.6 cm-1 Str-1. This is comparable to that measured by other investigators in in vitro preparations of human and animal liver and to that measured by two other teams of investigators in in vivo human liver. In kidney, data were acquired from 11 normal volunteers. The power-law fit to the backscatter coefficient in normal kidney was eta (f) = 2.3 x 10(-5) f2.1 cm-1 Str-1. This is in the range of that measured by other investigators in in vitro preparations of human and animal kidney. In order to assess the system dependence of in vivo abdominal organ backscatter coefficients, measurements were performed using two different ultrasonic data-acquisition systems. The two systems exhibited close agreement.
