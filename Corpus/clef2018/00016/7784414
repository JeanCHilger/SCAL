Directional velocity of the arterial flow, systemic vascular resistance and urinary excretion of sodium in cirrhotic patients. We have studied the vascular resistance at the posterior tibial artery utilizing the Doppler reverse/forward flow ratio, and its relationship to systemic vascular resistance and renal function in 32 nonazotemic cirrhotic patients.Patients were divided into three groups. Group A comprised 10 patients without ascites or oedema group B comprised 9 patients with ascites and a relatively high sodium excretion (40 +/- 34 mmol/day)No significant differences were found in urine flow, creatinine or creatinine clearance between the three groups. Renin and aldosterone levels were found increased in group C. Systemic vascular resistance differed significantly in the three groups, being lower in group C. Significant higher values in the Doppler reverse/forward ratio were observed in patients with markedly increased sodium retention and less systemic vascular resistance (group C). The Doppler reverse/forward ratio showed significant correlations with systemic vascular resistance (r = 0.65 n = 32These preliminary results suggest in patients with hepatic cirrhosis vascular resistance, assessed non-invasively, at the posterior tibial artery, increases with the severity of sodium retention and the impairment in systemic hemodynamics. Thus, this measurement may be useful for the evaluation and follow-up of patients with cirrhosis of the liver.
