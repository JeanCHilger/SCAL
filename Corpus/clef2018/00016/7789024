The prevalence and clinical significance of lymphadenopathy in primary biliary cirrhosis. We present the results of a retrospective review of abdominal computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance examinations of 12 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis undertaken to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of previously reported coexistent intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy in patients with this disorder. Lymphadenopathy, in the form of bulky periportal and retroperitoneal nodes, was identified in a single patient secondary to an occult metastatic adenocarcinoma. We conclude that coexistent intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy occurring in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis is uncommon. Although it may represent a benign component of the primary disease, it may equally be due to unsuspected coexistent occult malignancy.
