Vasodilatory effects of propylthiouracil in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. An experimental study has shown that propylthiouracil increases portal blood flow in normal rats. Whether propylthiouracil has a similar effect in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis remains to be demonstrated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of oral propylthiouracil (300 mg) on systemic and portal hemodynamics in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.Plasma propylthiouracil levels were also measured by high performance liquid chromatography in five patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. In eight patients with cirrhosis, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output and portal blood flow were evaluated before and after placebo and propylthiouracil administration. Hemodynamic measurements were performed by the Doppler technique. The plasma peak level of propylthiouracil was achieved at 1.4 +/- 0.1 h in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. This time was chosen to express hemodynamic changes.Propylthiouracil administration caused a significant increase in portal blood flow (+16.5%, p < 0.05) in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. This effect was associated with a mild and significant rise in cardiac output (from 5.8 +/- 0.2 to 6.1 +/- 0.3 l/min, p < 0.05) and a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance (from 1171 +/- 69 to 1070 +/- 67 dyn . s-1 . cm-5, p < 0.01). A significant correlation was observed between changes in portal blood flow and peripheral vascular resistance (r = 0.79, p < 0.05). No significant changes were observed after placebo.Our findings show that propylthiouracil has a vasodilatory effect in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. We postulate that this effect could be the mechanism by which propylthiouracil decreases hypermetabolic state, and increases oxygen delivery to the liver, in patients with alcoholic liver diseases.
