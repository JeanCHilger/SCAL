Low-reflectivity periportal collar on hepatic ultrasound. A low attenuation periportal collar is frequently found on computed tomography (CT) in association with a variety of liver diseases and other conditions (Lawson, T L, Thorsen, M K, Erikson, S J et al, Periportal halo: a CT sign of liver disease, Abdom. Imaging, 18, 42-46 (1993)). Abnormal periportal intensity has been reported on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in various hepatobiliary diseases. Transient low reflectivity periportal cuffing has recently been described and was presumed to be due to periportal lymphoedema associated with malignant lymphadenopathy. We report the finding of such bands in four patients with chronic hepatobiliary disease and present the associated histological findings.
