Fibrolamellar carcinoma. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FL-Ca) is a primary malignant liver tumor at unknown etiology, without cirrhosis and usually without an increase at tumor markers, which occurs mainly in young patients. As it can simulate malignant and benign tumors, particularly FNH, diagnosis is difficult. Ultrasound and angiography show mostly uncharacteristic features. The highest specificity has CT, if calcifications are present, because these calcifications in a tumor similar to FNH are pathognomonic for FL-Ca. In MRI the central scars of FL-Ca and FNH have a different signal intensity in T2-weighted images, so that MRI becomes more and more important in the differential diagnosis to FNH.
