Incidence of gallstones in a population of patients with cirrhosis. One hundred and sixty-five patients with cirrhosis were prospectively investigated, by regular ultrasonographic follow up, to assess the incidence of gallstones. The mean length of follow up was 33 months (range 12 to 108). Cholelithiasis was diagnosed in 31 patients (18.8%), with a cumulative incidence over 84 months of 38.3% (4.7% yearly incidence). The risk of gallstones was similar in males (38%) and females (38.3%), although the final cumulative incidence was reached at 72 months in males. The percentage of patients with new stones was higher in alcoholic cirrhosis (28.9%) (with a cumulative incidence of 48.8% at 84 months) and lower in hepatitis-related cirrhosis (1.9%) (only one new case at 96 months of follow up) (p < 0.001). The cumulative incidence of gallstones in the Child's C group reached 49.3% at 48 months versus 24% in Child's B and 6.4% in Child's A (p < 0.0001). At multivariate analysis, Child's C and alcoholic cirrhosis were shown to be the independent variables significantly associated with a high risk of development of cholelithiasis. This study confirms that cirrhosis represents a high risk factor for gallstones. The risk is greater for alcoholic cirrhosis and increases with the severity of the disease.
