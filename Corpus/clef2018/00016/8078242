Role of puncture biopsy in the diagnosis of focal lesion of the liver. The authors performed 69 puncture biopsies (in 12 cases--under guidance of laparoscopy, in 57--ultrasound investigation) in 63 patients with indeterminate diagnosis of focal hepatic lesion. A positive result was noted in 59 (96.9%) patients. Of them, 43 had a malignant tumour been diagnosed, 16--non-tumour process. In 2 cases, a false negative result was obtained, in 1--a false positive one.
