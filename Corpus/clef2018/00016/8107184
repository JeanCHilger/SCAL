Duplex Doppler ultrasonographic comparison of the effects of propranolol and isosorbide-5-mononitrate on portal hemodynamics. Eighteen cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices at risk for bleeding took part in a double-blind study. The variations in PFV induced by either 40 mg of propranolol or 60 mg of sustained-release isosorbide-5-mononitrate on two consecutive days were evaluated with a duplex Doppler device. Both drugs caused a significant decrease in maximum (propranolol, P = 0.002 isosorbide-5-mononitrate, P = 0.021). Four patients responded to propranolol, three to isosorbide-5-mononitrate, and eight to both drugs
