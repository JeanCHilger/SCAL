Intrahepatic subcapsular biloma. A rare complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Bile leaks leading to bilomas in the subhepatic space are amongst the most common complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). We describe the case of a large (1,100 cc) intrahepatic biloma that presented with pain and fever 14 days post LC. The diagnosis was suspected as a result of ultrasound and CT scan and the problem was solved by percutaneous catheter drainage. We believe this intrahepatic biloma was caused by a lesion of an abnormal bile duct near the bed of the gallbladder during a difficult dissection due to severe contraction and fibrosis.
