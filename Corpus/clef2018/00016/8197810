Yersinia enterocolitica infection with extraintestinal manifestations: case report and overview. Five weeks after a four-day visit to Malta, a 39-year old white male German national developed septic temperatures of up to 40 degrees C, progressive jaundice and a pronounced hepatosplenomegaly. The initial examination showed a very sick, somnolent patient with jaundice, cyanosis, tachypnea and a markedly enlarged liver on both physical examination and sonography. The laboratory evaluation revealed a moderate leukocytosis, markedly accelerated ESR, poor liver function with strongly elevated gamma-GT and alkaline phosphatase levels. Primary antibiotic therapy consisted of doxycycline. Ultrasound examination of the liver four days after admission revealed multiple hypodense abscesses. On the sixth day after admission, gram-negative rods were first isolated from blood cultures antibiotic therapy was switched to ofloxacin (2 x 400 mg/day) and amoxycillin (3 x 2 g/day) after sensitivity testing. As a result of treatment with this combination of antibiotics, the patient was free of fever 10 days after hospitalization
