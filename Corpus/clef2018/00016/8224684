Endoscopic ultrasonographic evaluation of the rectum in cirrhotic portal hypertension. Rectal endoscopic ultrasonography was performed using an ultrasound fiberscope in 20 patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension (6 alcoholic patients, 4 patients with hepatitis B surface antigen positive, and 10 cryptogenic patients) and in 10 patients with irritable bowel syndrome as controls. Rectal varices were diagnosed endoscopically when either tortuous or saccular distended veins were seen beneath the mucosa. At rectal endoscopic ultrasonography rectal varices were seen as rounded or oval echo-free structures in the submucosa. Rectal endoscopic ultrasonography also showed perirectal veins outside the rectal wall. Rectal varices were detected by endoscopy in 9 patients and by rectal endoscopic ultrasonography in 17 patients. Rectal endoscopic ultrasonography also detected submucosal veins in 3 of 10 controls. The number and size of submucosal veins seen on rectal endoscopic ultrasonography in patients with portal hypertension were greater than in controls (p < 0.01 for both number and size). The size of perirectal veins was greater in patients than in controls (p < 0.05), although their number was no different (p = NS). A perforating vein communicating between a submucosal and perirectal vein was seen in only one patient. Rectal wall thickness was not different in patients and controls (p = NS). Rectal endoscopic ultrasonography was superior to endoscopy in detecting the presence (85% versus 45%, p < 0.01), and number (p < 0.01) of rectal varices. Our study suggests that rectal endoscopic ultrasonography is useful in detecting changes in rectal and perirectal vasculature in patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension.
