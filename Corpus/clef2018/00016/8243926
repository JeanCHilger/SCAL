Transjugular intrahepatic portacaval shunt. Preliminary results. Transjugular implantation of a metallic prosthesis between main portal branch and a hepatic vein is a new intrahepatic portosystemic shunt method to treat portal hypertension. Forty-nine cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension were treated using this technique. The success rate of implantation was 94%. Mortality due to the procedure was 2%. Early complications decreased with the operator's learning curve consisting of bleeding (20%): digestive hemorrhage (n = 5 12%), hemobilia (n = 4
