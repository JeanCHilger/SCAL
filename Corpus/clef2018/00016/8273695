Portal vein thrombosis: imaging findings. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is usually a complication of pre-existing cirrhosis, abdominal malignancy (e.g., pancreatic or hepatocellular carcinoma), or abdominal inflammation (e.g., appendicitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis). Less frequently, PVT can be associated with myeloproliferative or connective tissue disorders or inflammatory bowel disease [1]. PVT can cause or exacerbate portal hypertension variceal bleeding or hypersplenism may then develop acutely or several years later. PVT also complicates portosystemic shunt surgery or hepatic transplantation. Unfortunately, the signs and symptoms of PVT can be subtle or nonspecific and can be overshadowed by the underlying illness. The radiologist may be the only physician to suggest the preoperative or premortem diagnosis of PVT. Familiarity with the imaging findings of PVT, therefore, is imperative.
