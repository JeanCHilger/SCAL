Effect of propranolol on portal vein hemodynamics in patients with liver cirrhosis: assessment by duplex sonography. Portal vein hemodynamics of 11 patients with cirrhosis confirmed by liver biopsy and of 5 healthy volunteers were studied by duplex sonography during oral treatment with 80 mg propranolol. One hour after oral administration of 80 mg propranolol, portal blood flow measured by duplex sonography was reduced by 35.3% in cirrhotic patients and by 28.1% in healthy volunteers (n.s.). Portal blood flow reduction was maximal three hours after administration of propranolol (46.9%). During the follow up of cirrhotic patients to whom 80 mg propranolol was administered daily, the reduction of portal blood flow persisted and was 45.0% after 1 week and 37.0% after 4 weeks. Each cirrhotic patient responded with a reduction in portal blood flow. Duplex sonography was found to be an accurate follow-up method of cirrhotic patients under therapy with propranolol.
