Autopsy case of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with lupoid hepatitis and complicated by malignant lymphoma. An 81-year-old woman in whom liver dysfunction had been pointed out 3 years previously was diagnosed as having liver cirrhosis due to lupoid hepatitis. Considering the poor prognosis of cirrhosis and her age, immunosuppressive therapy was not adopted. Nine months later, a small liver tumor was found by ultrasonography and was diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The tumor was treated with transcatheter arterial embolization, but grew continuously. She also developed gingival lymphoma that was successfully treated. Three years after initial diagnosis of lupoid hepatitis, she died of hepatic failure. An autopsy was performed and confirmed the clinical diagnosis, liver cirrhosis with HCC. HCC is regarded as a rare complication of lupoid hepatitis, but cases of HCC complicating lupoid hepatitis may increase with progress in treatment methods and elongation of survival. The present case suggests that any malignancy can be developed in long-term surviving patients with lupoid hepatitis.
