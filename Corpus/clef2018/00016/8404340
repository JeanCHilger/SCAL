Gallbladder contractile function in patients with portal hypertension. Gallbladder fat meal-stimulated contractile function and its relation with portal hemodynamic changes in patients with portal hypertension were observed using ultrasonic pulsed Doppler duplex system. The results showed that the patients gallbladder contractile function decreased significantly and there was a negative correlation between gallbladder empty rate and portal vein diameter, congestion index and blood flow volume. It was suggested that the decreased gallbladder empty rate may be one of the causes in gallstone formation in cirrhotic patients.
