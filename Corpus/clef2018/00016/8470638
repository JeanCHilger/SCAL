Ultrasonographic prediction of esophageal varices in Schistosomiasis mansoni. Bleeding from esophageal varices is a common and serious problem in Schistosomiasis mansoni. A simple and accurate method of detection would facilitate measurement of individual and community morbidity and allow institution of preventive measures. An ultrasonographic scoring system grading periportal fibrosis, portal vein diameter, spleen size, and portasystemic anastomoses was evaluated as a predictor of esophageal varices and a past history of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 43 patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. Ultrasonographic variceal score correlated (r = 0.86, p < 0.001) with the endoscopic variceal grade. Patients with a sonographic score of 5 or greater were highly likely (21 of 23) to have varices of grade II or greater (sensitivity, 91.3% specificity, 94.7%). Only those with sonographic scores of 5 or greater (15 of 23) had bled from esophageal varices. The ultrasonographic score provided a simple, inexpensive, accurate, and noninvasive means of screening individuals with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis for esophageal varices, and correlated strongly with prior gastrointestinal hemorrhage. It is not known whether a similar score would be useful in hepatic cirrhosis.
