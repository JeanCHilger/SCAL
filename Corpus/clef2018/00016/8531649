The use and limitations of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of liver morbidity attributable to Schistosoma mansoni infection in community-based surveys. The objective of this population-based study was to estimate the liver morbidity attributable to Schistosoma mansoni infection by ultrasonography adopting the proposed standard protocols of the Cairo Meeting on Ultrasonography, 1991. We examined 2384 individuals representing 20% of the households of the rural population of the Ismailia Governorate, East of Delta, Egypt. Prevalence of S. mansoni and S. haematobium infections were 40.3% and 1.7% respectively. Portal tract thickening (PTT) grade 1, 2 and 3 considered diagnostic of schistosomal liver morbidity was detected in 35.1%, 1.3 and 0.2 individuals respectively. Generally, ultrasonographically-detected pathological changes increased with age, but correlated with intensity of infection only in age group 20-59 years. Comparing individuals with and without S. mansoni infections in an endemic and a non-endemic community indicated no significant difference between the former and the latter in either case.ultrasonography had a limited value in estimating schistosomal liver morbidity in our population-based study where early grades of liver morbidly were prevalent. The criteria of diagnosing grade I portal fibrosis need to be revised as well as the staging system proposed by the Cairo Meeting on ultrasonography in schistosomiasis.
