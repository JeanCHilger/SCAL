Metabolic markers of chronic liver disease. The association between chronic liver disease and plasmatic lipids and glucidic metabolism was studied. The liver was evaluated with biochemical variables, ultrasound and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. 12 chronic liver diseases patients and 10 normal were studied. 83.3% of patients showed lipidic abnormalities, 66.6% on the cholesterol levels and 41.7%, reduced HDL. When patients received 100 gr of glucose the response was abnormal in 83.3%. These results were compared with other "liver function test". 75% had abnormal bilirubin, 58.3% abnormal albumin, prothrombin time 58.3%, aminotransferases 75%. Esophageal verices were found in 75% of cases and ultrasound abnormalities in 91.6% (27.3% cirrhosis, 54.4% diffuse abnormal patter and 18.2% splenomegaly). These findings show that lipidic and glucidic metabolism, and ultrasound, in chronic liver diseases are the more frequent abnormalities.
