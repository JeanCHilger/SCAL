Computed sonography observation on the effects of cimetidine on the liver blood flow in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. The effects of cimetidine on the hepatic and portal vein blood flow were investigated in 20 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension by computed sonography. Cimetidine given intravenously at a dose of 0.4g significantly increased the hepatic vein blood flow (60.2% +/- 63.6%, P < 0.01), at the same time its calculated cross section area increased by 40.2% +/- 81.3% (P < 0.01). The portal vein blood flow increased by 53.2% +/- 52.3% (P < 0.01). While its cross section area was 16.8% +/- 17.3% (P < 0.01). These results showed that the histamine H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine may dilate liver vascular bed and reduce portal blood flow resistance in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension.
