Hepatocellular carcinoma associated with anabolic steroid therapy: report of a case and review of the Japanese literature. We report herein the case of a 35-year-old woman with aplastic anemia who developed hepatocellular carcinoma after long-term therapy with oxymetholone. She was treated with 60 mg/day of oxymetholone for 3 years (total dose 64.8 g). Alpha-fetoprotein, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibody were all negative, but serum titers of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen were elevated. Lateral segmentectomy of the liver was performed. The histopathological findings were compatible with those of multiple hepatocellular carcinoma without liver cirrhosis. Three years since the operation, the patient is doing well and no signs of tumor recurrence have been detected. According to our review of Japanese cases of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with anabolic steroid therapy, in all instances the tumors developed after long-term administration of anabolic steroids for hematologic diseases. In patients under long-term anabolic steroid therapy, routine screening of the liver by ultrasonography and computed tomography should be performed to detect liver tumors in the early stages.
