Longitudinal study of intrahepatic portal flow: a novel approach using Doppler technique. The present study investigates whether the application of the summation of portal blood flow (SPBF), measured from the left umbilical portion and the right anterior branch by Doppler, could be of use in the longitudinal study of intrahepatic portal flow or not. Forty-five subjects were divided into two groups. Group I subjects included males and post-menopausal females. Thirty-seven subjects (19 normal volunteers, 12 subjects with chronic hepatitis, six cirrhotics) were investigated by the more experienced doctor A at 9 day intervals for an intra-observer study. Among them, seven subjects (four normal volunteers, three with chronic hepatitis) were also investigated consecutively at 10 min apart by doctor B on days 1 and 10 for an interobserver study. Group II subjects included eight normal subjects with a regular menstrual cycle. They were investigated by doctor A during menstruation, mid-follicular, ovulatory and mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle to evaluate the possible impact of the menstrual cycle on SPBF measurement. The reproducibility of measurements was assessed by the coefficient of variation (CV) and the reproducibility coefficient. Data are expressed as mean +/- s.d. The CV of the SPBF for intra-observer and interobserver study were 4.88 +/- 3.36 and 4.19 +/- 2.53, respectively. All differences of SPBF were within their corresponding reproducibility limits. The results of SPBF measurements obtained from different phases of the menstrual cycle were variable. Only the comparison between the data obtained from mid-follicular and mid-luteal phases could demonstrate acceptable CV values (3.98 +/- 3.12%) and all the differences in SPBF measurements were within the repeatability limit. In conclusion, Doppler SPBF measurement may be useful in the longitudinal evaluation of intrahepatic portal flow changes.
