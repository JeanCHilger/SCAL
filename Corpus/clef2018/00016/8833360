Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt with the Strecker stent for control of refractory acute and chronic variceal bleeding. We wanted to assess prospectively the safety, efficacy, and applicability of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) with the Strecker stent, focusing mainly on clinical and hemodynamic medium- and long-term follow-up.Fifty-two patients reached an indication to perform a TIPS, in an emergency or after refractory variceal bleeding. It was completed in 50 of them. All presented with cirrhosis (Child C = 15, B = 23, A = 12). The prosthesis was a Strecker stent. During the follow-up, clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, ultrasound, and pressure measurement studies were performed at 1, 3, 6, 12 months. Mean follow-up was 13.5 + or - 7.8 months.Portal pressure decreased from 32.3 + or - 8.1 (mean + or - standard deviation) to 22.3 + or - 6.7 mm Hg and portocaval gradient from 21 +/- 5.2 to 8.7 +/- 3.9 mm Hg (average, 56 + or - 16%). Shunt dysfunction was diagnosed when the portocaval gradient was >12 mm Hg (20 patients). Eleven patients (22%) presented with variceal rebleeding because of shunt dysfunction. The probability of remaining free of bleeding was 78%, 74%, and 68% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Actuarial survival rate was 91% and 86% after 12 and 18 months, respectively.TIPS with the Strecker stent is a safe alternative for variceal bleeding. Shunt dysfunction is frequent and increases the rebleeding rate, requiring a close follow-up with pressure measurements. Randomized trials comparing stents and other alternatives are needed to fully address the role of this procedure.
