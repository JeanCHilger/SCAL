Choledochal cyst in neonates. Common bile duct cyst, or choledochal cyst is known to be an uncommon cause of neonatal jaundice. It is usually associated with distal biliary tract obstruction and presents a clinical picture that is indistinguishable from biliary atresia. We report two cases of neonatal choledochal cyst encountered from 1992 to 1994. The infants were free from perinatal insult and presented with prolonged jaundice. In both cases, antenatal ultrasonography was unremarkable. Biochemical examinations revealed elevated levels of serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and direct bilirubin. Abdominal sonograms disclosed a cystic mass close to the gall-bladder. Intrahepatic duct dilation was noted in one patient. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy demonstrated accumulation of the radionuclide in the porta hepatis without subsequent intestinal activity. Cystic dilatation of the common bile duct with distal obstruction was noted during surgery. Both infants underwent cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and cholecystectomy. Liver biopsy in one infant showed mild proliferation of the interlobular bile duct and mild portal fibrosis. The postoperative course was uneventful. We conclude that early detection and treatment of choledochal cyst in neonates are important for preventing serious complications of biliary obstruction.
