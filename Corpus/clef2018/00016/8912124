Gastrointestinal bleeding in children. We prospectively evaluated 139 consecutive children presenting to the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (Lucknow, India) with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding from January 1991 to November 1994. Our aims were to find out whether the causes of GI bleeding in a developing country differed from developed countries and how the application of newer diagnostic techniques would help in the diagnosis of GI bleeding. Barium studies, endoscopy, technetium-99m-labelled (erythrocytes and pertechnetate) scans, selective abdominal angiography using a digital subtraction technique and rectal endoscopic ultrasonography were performed. Upper GI bleeding (n = 75) was variceal in 71 (95%) children (extrahepatic portal venous obstruction in 65, cirrhosis in six) and non-variceal in four (5%) cases (Henoch-Schonlein purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, drug-induced gastric erosions and pseudoaneurysm of the gastroduodenal artery due to idiopathic chronic calcific pancreatitis). Causes of lower GI bleeding (n = 64) were colitis (27 cases 42%), colorectal polyps (26 cases
