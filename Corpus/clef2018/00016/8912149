Transdermal nitroglycerin in cirrhosis. A 24-hour echo-Doppler study of splanchnic hemodynamics. The present study was aimed to evaluate the 24-hour effect of transdermal nitroglycerin on splanchnic hemodynamics in cirrhotic patients.Hemodynamic parameters (blood velocity and resistance indexes) were determined by means of pulsed echo-Doppler, a non-invasive method which proved to be useful to evaluate the effects of drugs on splanchnic vessels. Nine patients with biopsy-proven liver cirrhosis were studied. They were kept on a standard diet divided into 3 meals served at 8, 12 a.m. and 6 p.m. Echo-Doppler measurements were determined for 2 consecutive days at 7, 8, 9, 12 a.m, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 12 p.m. and again at 7 a.m. A transdermal nitroglycerin tape, capable of releasing 15 mg of the drug in 24 h, was applied to the skin of the chest at 7 a.m. of the second day.After nitroglycerin mean portal blood velocity and flow significantly decreased by 18 and 22%. Similarly superior mesenteric artery velocity decreased, while resistance indexes increased. ANOVA analysis showed a significant effect of the drug on superior mesenteric artery and portal flow, while the effect on hepatic artery flow and renal indexes were low.This study shows that nitroglycerin, given as transdermal long-acting system, significantly influences portal hemodynamics in liver cirrhosis. Its use, favoured by easy administration, may be proposed for long-term clinical studies to test its efficacy in preventing gastrointestinal bleeding.
