Comparison of in-phase and opposed-phase GRE and conventional SE MR pulse sequences in T1-weighted imaging of liver lesions. Our goal was to compare in-phase (IP) and opposed-phase (OP) GRE and conventional SE sequences in T1-weighted (T1-W) imaging of the liver and to evaluate chemical shift GRE imaging in characterizing liver/lesions for fat content.IP and OP T1-W GRE with fast low angle shot (FLASH) technique and T1-W SE sequences were compared in 162 patients at 1.0 T. Chemical shift GRE imaging was used to characterize lesions with fat content. Two hundred sixteen lesions were analyzed in three groups of liver: (a) "normal" liver (n = 74 with 110 lesions) (b) cirrhotic liver (n = 76 with 85 lesions)The OP GRE sequence had significantly higher contrast for normal and cirrhotic livers (p < 0.001), and the IP GRE sequence had significantly higher contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio for fatty liver (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between OP, IP, and T1-W SE imaging in cirrhotic cases for contrast-to-noise ratio (p < 0.28). Chemical shift imaging detected fat in 21 lesions (9.7%, mean SIV, 191.1%) (sensitivity and specificity 100% when compared with fine needle aspiration cytology).OP GRE sequences could replace conventional SE sequences in T1-W imaging in nonfatty livers, whereas in fatty livers, T1-W SE sequences could be obviated, but both OP and IP sequences are necessary. Chemical shift imaging (OP and IP) can be used to accurately characterize lesions for fat content.
