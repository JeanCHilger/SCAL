Association of pulmonary and portal hypertension. The association between portal venous hypertension and pulmonary arterial hypertension has received scarce attention in the italian medical literature. Nevertheless the association is relatively frequent, it needs a multidisciplinary approach and it is a stimulus for the search of causes of so-called primary pulmonary hypertension. The purpose of the article is to review the frequency of the association, the main pathogenetic hypothesis formulated to explain the appearance of pulmonary hypertension, the clinical and the laboratory findings, the evolution of the association and to present briefly a personal series of cases. The pulmonary arterial hypertension has been found in approximately 2% of patients with portal hypertension due to either hepatic cirrhosis or extraepatic lesions. Microembolism from the portocavat system or a number of vasoactive substances which enter the pulmonary circulation without being inactivated by the liver have been held responsible for the appearance of pulmonary hypertension in predisposed patients. Clinical and laboratory findings do not differ from those a patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. Also the prognosis is similar. In conclusion on accurate examination of the pulmonary circulation by noninvasive methods, in particular by echocardiography, appears to be mandatory in patients with chronic hepatic lesions. When pulmonary arterial hypertension is detected the study of the biochemical factors which at present are known to determine pulmonary hypertension may be warranted. The study may enhance our knowledge of the pathogenesis of the so-called primary pulmonary hypertension.
