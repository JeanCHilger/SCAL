Immunogenic hyperthyroidism with hyperdynamic heart failure and early cirrhotic transformation of the liver. A 58-year-old woman was admitted because of jaundice, ascites and marked oedema. For three years she had suffered from nervousness, decreasing fitness and weight loss, which had been assumed as due to chronic alcoholism. Liver biopsy revealed extensive fibrosis, in part with early cirrhotic transformation. This was followed by cardiac failure with atrial fibrillation (ventricular rate 140/min) and marked pleural effusions. The thyroid was diffusely enlarged and there were signs of exophthalmos.Bilirubin concentration was 3 mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase activity was 310 U/l, cholesterase 1.3 kU/l and the prothrombin test was 21%. The TSH level was 0.01 microU/ml while the free thyroxine level was 4.7 ng/dl and that of free triiodothyronine 13.5 pg/ml. Chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly, bilateral peripheral pulmonary congestion and pleural effusions to midfield. Right heart catheterization excluded pulmonary hypertension cardiac output was 10l/min. The thyroid was enlarged on ultrasound and diffusely echopoor, as in immune thyroid disease.Cardiac failure regressed and thyroid function normalized within ten days on propranolol, 4 x 40 mg and thiamazole 3 x 40 mg daily intravenously. Subtotal thyroidectomy was performed three weeks later with subsequent thyroid hormone substitution. Liver functions were normal six months later and ultrasound showed no signs of cirrhotic change and the ascites had resolved.Hyperthyroidism is frequently associated with changes in liver functions. In extreme cases, high-output cardiac failure may occur, with liver congestion and clinical as well as histological changes like those in liver cirrhosis.
