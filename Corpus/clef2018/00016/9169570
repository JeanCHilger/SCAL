Scintigraphic evaluation of hepatic blood flow after intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). In patients with liver cirrhosis a transjugularly placed intrahepatic portocaval shunt (TIPS) is a non-surgical portosystemic device which aims to reduce portal venous pressure. In comparison with Doppler sonography, we evaluated in 28 patients the diagnostic impact of liver perfusion scintigraphy (with technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid) in the assessment of changes in the hepatic blood flow after TIPS shunting. The arterial and portal contributions to hepatic flow were calculated from the areas under the biphasic time-activity curve. In the course of TIPS shunting, patency is threatened by reocclusion. Angiography is the gold standard for TIPS shunt reassessment. However, there is a need for a less invasive diagnostic procedure, such as scintigraphy or Doppler sonography, for the early detection of shunt insufficiency. Scintigraphy demonstrated that prior to TIPS shunting the portal venous contribution to hepatic perfusion was reduced to 29.2%, this reduction being due to portal hypertension. After TIPS placement a significant increase in portal venous perfusion was observed (38.2% P<0.02). TIPS shunt occlusion was identified in patients by a significant reduction in the scintigraphically measured portal venous contribution to hepatic blood flow. Hepatic perfusion scintigraphy appears to be a valuable method to determine the immediate effect of TIPS on hepatic blood flow. Post-TIPS follow-up studies of hepatic haemodynamics by liver perfusion scintigraphy appear able to contribute to the detection of TIPS shunt occlusion before the clinical consequences of this complication have become apparent.
