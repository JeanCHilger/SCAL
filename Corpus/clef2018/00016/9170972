Record and preservation of ultrasound images and computer-assistant analysis--estimation of digital filing system and texture analysis. Digital filing systems have advanced with computer technology and are among the most interesting modalities for recording and preserving ultrasound images. The benefits are reduced expense, superior imaging, and ease in searching previous records compared with those factors in conventional constant film, videotape, and other storage systems. Computer-assisted analysis of digital images for automatic differentiation of diseases has recently been studied. Conventional quantitative estimation methods of tissue characterization or histogram are not easy to apply to clinical studies because these methods are time-consuming, and require a specialized machine for this propose. We propose a new method of texture analysis of echo images. This new method depends on the echo-texture of the organ, and can clearly differentiate liver cirrhosis from normal liver. These new digital techniques for clinical studies may facilitate examination.
