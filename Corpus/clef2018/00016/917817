Demonstration of the hepatic veins by echotomography (author's transl). Provided that a rigourous protocol is adopted, exploration of the hepatic veins by echotomography (grey scale) is practically always possible. It should be integrated into every echotomographic study of the liver (parenchyma, biliary tract, portal system and inferior vena cava). The findings cover a narrow range: hepatic veins free, compressed or not visible. This method is harmless, rapid, reproducible and inexpensive.
