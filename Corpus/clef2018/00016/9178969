An autopsy case of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies associated vasculitis accompanied by autoimmune hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we report an autopsy case with anti-neutrophil antibodies (ANCA) associated vasculitis accompanied by autoimmune hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A 69-year-old woman was admitted to Tokyo Metropolitan Ohtsuka Hospital in October 1995 because of leg edema. She had presented cough in 1990 and diagnosed as interstitial pneumonia, esophageal varices and liver chirosis. On admission, laboratory data showed mild anemia, hypoproteinemia, and marked gammagloblinemia. IgM-HA antibody, HBs antigen, HBs antibody, HCV antibody and HDV antibody were negative. Anti-nuclear antibody, anticentromere antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody against myeloperoxidase and cathepsin G (MPO-ANCA and cathepsin G), rheumatoid factor and direct coombs test were positive. Serum level of AFP and CEA were elevated. Ultrasonography and computed tomography of abdomen scowed liver chirosis and tumor in left lobe of liver. The diagnosis of liver chirosis based on autoimmune hepatitis and Interstitial pneumonia was made with clinical course, laboratory findings and radiographic findings although liver biopsy was not performed. She complained of bloody stool due to ulcer of the large intestine, and died of liver failure which progressed rapidly. The autopsy findings detected that pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis with multiple hepatocellular carcinoma, necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis, and vasculitis of small artery inn colon. This was the first report of MPO-ANCA associated vasuculitis complicated with autoimmune hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinical significance of ANCA and immunogenetic background of these diseases were discussed.
