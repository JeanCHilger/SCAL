Some peculiarities of hepatobiliary diseases in Vietnam. The most frequent hepatobiliary diseases in Vietnam are chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, liver abscess, hepatobiliary ascaridiasis, angiocholitis, biliary lithiasis and primary liver cancer. The principal causes of chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis are HBV and HCV infections. Alcohol and chemicals (drugs, agricultural, industrial, war herbicides) also play an important role. Malaria causes hepatitis and fibrosis lesions, however no cirrhotic lesions were observed. There are two categories of liver abscess, amoebic and cholangitic, often caused by ascaridiasis. Treatment of amoebic abscesses is, at first, non-surgical for small abscesses, often combined with ultrasound guided abscess puncture. Cholangitis abscesses are more serious and often require surgical intervention. Among the gallstones, only 15% are of the gall-bladder, the majority are choledocho- and intrahepatic-lithiasis, composed largely of calcium bilirubinate and are frequently caused by Ascaris-related cholangitis and the nucleation of Ascaris eggs. Forty-seven per cent of acute cholecystitis are acalculous, showing a higher frequency than in Western countries. Primary liver cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies in Vietnam. More than 90% of liver cancers are hepatocellular carcinomas. The principal causes are HBV infection, followed by HCV infection, aflatoxin, alcohol and chemicals. Recent efforts aiming at earlier diagnosis, by selective screening in high-risk groups, have used clinical surveillance, abdominal sonography and AFP level determination. Promising results were obtained in prevention trials by reducing the high AFP level of cirrhotic patients using a vegetal drug, Gacavit, and by treatment with percutaneous ethanol injection therapy, as an alternative therapeutic measure for liver tumour resection.
