Spectrum of liver diseases in HIV infection. Most earlier reports on the spectrum of liver diseases in HIV-infected individuals originated from the West.To study the spectrum of liver diseases in HIV-infected individuals.Seventy four consecutive HIV-positive patients (57 men age range 23-75 years, mean 34) were studied prospectively with clinical evaluation, liver function tests, ultrasonography, radioisotope liver scan, markers of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses, and liver histology whenever necessary.Thirty four patients (45%) were chronic alcoholics. Mean (SD) absolute lymphocyte count was 2521 (1271)/mm3 count < 2000/ mm3 was present in 20 patients. Serum bilirubin, transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated in 13%, 13% and 24% of patients, respectively. Ultrasonography detected an abscess in two patients (tuberculous-1, amebic-1). Evidence of exposure to HBV was present in 81% (HBsAg-12, hepatitis B core and/or surface antibody-48)Chronic alcoholism, HBV and HCV infection, hepatic tuberculosis, and evidence of other liver disease were common in patients with HIV infection.A prospective study of 74 consecutive HIV patients (mean age, 34 years) at a public hospital in Mumbai, India, found evidence of hepatitis B and C virus, hepatic tuberculosis, and other liver disease.  Clinical evaluation, liver function tests, ultrasonography, radioisotope liver scan, hepatitis B and C virus markers, and liver histology were performed.  34 patients (45%) were classified as chronic alcoholics on the basis of a history of consumption of at least 80 g of alcohol daily for at least 5 years and test findings.  59 (80%) had a history of multiple sex partners or encounters with commercial sex workers.  12 patients (16%) were hepatitis B surface antigen-positive and 22 (30%) were positive for hepatitis C virus antibody.  Bilirubin, transaminases, and alkaline phosphatase were elevated in 13%, 13%, and 24%, respectively.  Liver cirrhosis was present in 5 patients.  Hepatitis B virus was detected in 4 patients and dual hepatitis B and C infection was found in another patient.  Finally, 5 patients had liver tuberculosis.  The mean absolute lymphocyte count was 2521/cu. mm only 20 had a count indicative of immunosuppression (2000/cu. mm).  These findings confirm that hepatic effects are a major feature of HIV infection in India.
