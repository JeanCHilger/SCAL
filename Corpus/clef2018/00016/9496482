Laparoscopic partial hepatectomy. This article describes the surgical techniques and indications of laparoscopic partial hepatectomy, which is not as widely available as laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Three patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and associated severe liver cirrhosis were candidates for this technique from July 1993 to August 1994. The tumor size was 4 cm or less and all the tumors were located in segment 5 or 8 which had grown nodularly and protruded from the liver surface. A microwave tissue coagulator was used for parenchymal dissection under ultrasonographic guidance in a gas-less method with or without low-pressure pneumoperitoteum of 4 mmHg. The principle of dissection consists of tissue coagulation and fragmentation with dissecting forceps. Three hepatectomies were performed uneventfully without blood transfusion and the patients rapidly returned to their preoperative conditions. The laparoscopic partial hepatectomy can be an option of treatment in selected cases where the tumor can be removed by minor, superficial resection.
