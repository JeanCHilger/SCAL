Mesenteric vein thrombosis: a rare cause of abdominal pain in cirrhotic patients--two case reports. Mesenteric vein thrombosis is a rare disorder which can develop rapidly with intestinal infarction or subacutely with abdominal pain due to intestinal ischemia. Despite the availability of modern diagnostic tools, which allow an early diagnosis in most cases, the mortality from this disease has not significantly diminished over the years. The problem is that the syndrome is rare and unusual and the clinical presentation is usually vague or confusing. Particularly in cirrhotic patients, this diagnosis requires the exclusion of several other complications of liver disease, like spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, tense ascites or portal thrombosis. Here, we report the occurrence of acute mesenteric vein thrombosis in two patients with liver cirrhosis. Severe subcontinuous abdominal pain out of proportion to the physical findings and abdominal distension were the major symptoms in both patients. Magnetic resonance imaging in one case and ultrasound scan with color Doppler followed by computed tomography in the other patient confirmed the diagnosis and enabled an appropriate early therapy to be undertaken.
