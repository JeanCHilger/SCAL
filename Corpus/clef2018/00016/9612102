Clinical spectrum of chronic liver disease in north Indian children. Recent advances in serodiagnosis of hepatotropic viruses have revolutionized the approach to diagnosis and understanding of chronic liver disease (CLD). There are few studies on CLD in children from India. The present study was planned to define the clinical spectrum of CLD in children, its histopathology and seroepidemiology. Forty children with clinical features satisfying the criteria for diagnosing chronic liver disease were studied. All underwent routine laboratory investigations, liver function tests and ultrasound scan of the abdomen. Liver biopsy, upper GI endoscopy and other special investigations were done wherever indicated. The most common presenting features were jaundice (70%), fever (67%), and abdominal distention (60%). On examination hepatomegaly and icterus (80% each) and splenomegaly (67%) were the commonest findings. Serum transaminases were raised in 62.5% of children while prothrombin time was prolonged in 75% patients. Oesophageal and/or gastric varices were seen in 13 out of 29 patients subjected to upper GI endoscopy. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) was positive in 5 children (12.5%) while 3 (7.5%) tested positive for anti HCV antibody. The commonest histopathological diagnosis was infantile cholangiopathy (20%) followed by cryptogenic cirrhosis and idiopathic chronic active hepatitis (17.5% each). The study suggests that the incidence of chronic hepatitis B and C is rather low in childhood. However larger and longer studies are required to delineate the exact incidence of these conditions in childhood and their progression in adolescence and early adulthood.
