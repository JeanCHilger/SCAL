Hepatic steatosis: clinical-statistical study of patients diagnosed by histological or ultrasonographic methods. This study wants to document eziopathogenetic factors and clinical, instrumental and hystological characters that associate to the various types of hepatic steatosis.In this retrospective study have been examined two different groups of randomized patients. The "Group 1" comprehended 70 patients with hystologic diagnosis of hepatic steatosis (steatohepatitis--SH--60% steatosis--SE--40%). The "Group 2" comprehended 70 patients with ultrasonographic pattern of fatty liver (slight degree: 70%Analysis of results relative to the "Group 1" showed the role of HCV-infection in etiopathogenesis of the SH, significantly greater than in SE (76.2% vs 25% p < 0.0001). SE is often associated with exogenous noxae (alcoholism: 28.6%Analysis of results relative to the two groups of patients ones has shown that SE and SH are thick asymptomatics and associated at hepatomegaly and at increase of ALT, AST, gamma GT. The increase of ALT and/or AST leads to search for the markers of HBV and HCV when they are positive, hepatobiopsy is necessary for the diagnosis of possible SH or evolutive state to liver cirrhosis.
