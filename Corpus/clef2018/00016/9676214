Splenomegaly and hypersplenism in cirrhotic patients before and after orthotopic liver transplantation. To measure the spleen length in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension with US and compare the measurements before and after orthotopic liver transplantation. To correlate splenic measures with laboratory data and Doppler flowmetry (mean portal vein flow velocity).May, 1993, to January, 1997, fifteen patients with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and splenomegaly were examined and underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. The spleen length was measured before and after transplantation in 15/15 patients and it was also measured twice after transplantation in 10/15 patients. The mean portal venous flow velocity was measured before and after transplantation in 10/15 patients. The results were analyzed using the Student's t-test for paired and unpaired data the association between the variables was evaluated by linear regression analysisAt the first control after orthotopic liver transplantation (mean time from transplantation 5.5 +/- 2.6 months range 2.5-12.5 months) a significant decrease was found in spleen length (179 +/- 32 to 149 +/- 30 mm, p = .0001The measurement of the spleen length is proposed for the follow-up of the patients with cirrhosis and hypersplenism before and after orthotopic liver transplantation. In our study, the mean decrease in spleen length was 17% in the period from transplantation to the first US examination. In the patients who underwent a second measurement after transplantation no significant change in spleen length was observed.
