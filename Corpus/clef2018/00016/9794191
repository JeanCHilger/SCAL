Gastric mucosal blood flow and hepatic perfusion index in patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy. Endoscopic laser Doppler velocimetry is a simple non-invasive method to measure gastric mucosal blood flow. The present study is an attempt to determine a correlation, if any, between gastric mucosal blood flow and the hepatic perfusion index in patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy and their relationship to the severity of liver disease. Thirty patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy due to cirrhosis of the liver (eight class A, 13 class B, nine class C, according to Child-Pugh Classification) and six normal subjects were recruited into the study. In all subjects, the gastric mucosal blood flow and venous vasomotor reflex response was measured at two sites: the lesser and greater curvature, using endoscopic laser Doppler velocimetry. The hepatic perfusion index was measured using dynamic liver scintigraphy. The hepatic perfusion index (ratio of arterial/portal venous perfusion) in normal subjects and patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy belonging to Child-Pugh class A, B and C were 0.36 +/- 0.02, 0.53 +/- 0.08, 0.62 +/- 0.14 and 1.04 +/- 0.28, respectively. The gastric mucosal blood flow was similar in Child's A, B and C cases, while the venous vasomotor reflex response was reduced according to the Child-Pugh score (Child's A 37.4 +/- 5.4%, normal control 62.3 +/- 10.9%, Child's B 38.3 +/- 18.2%, Child's C 22.5 +/- 15.2%) and was statistically significant. The gastric mucosal blood flow and hepatic perfusion index are inversely correlated. The hepatic perfusion index altered with grading of cirrhotic change. This study confirms that the severity of portal hypertensive gastropathy is correlated with Child-Pugh score.
