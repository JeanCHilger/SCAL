Ultrasonography-guided percutaneous ethanol injection in large an/or multiple liver metastasis. Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) under sonographic guidance is an effective therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhosis, while less favorable results have been reported for liver metastases. Surgery and/or other new treatments (i.e., interstitial thermotherapy) are indicated only for small metastases (< 3 cm) and surgeons no longer perform the palliative debulking of neoplastic masses.From March, 1994, to December, 1997, thirty-three patients with 62 large (> 3.5 cm) and/or multiple liver metastases, who were not eligible for surgery nor thermotherapy, were treated with one-shot PEI under general anesthesia. The diameter of the nodules ranged 35-92 mm (mean: 39) the lesions were single in 15 patients and localized in both the right and the left lobe in 19 patients. 25-110 ml ethanol were injected per session. Post-treatment results were assessed with dynamic or dual-phase spiral CTComplete necrosis of the metastases was shown in 10 patients (30.3%). Necrosis rate ranged 70-90% in 21 patients (64%) and was 50% in 2 patients (5.7%). Survival rates were 94%, 80%, 80% and 44% at 12, 24, 36 and 44 months, respectively. No major complications were observed. Seeding of neoplastic cells along the needle tract has been never observed to date.Metastasis diameter and number impact on long-term survival. PEI under general anesthesia allows to treat also the patients who are not eligible for other treatments and to inject large amounts of ethanol per session in different tumor areas because metastases usually set on in an otherwise healthy liver.One-shot PEI can cause major, even complete, tumor necrosis in large and multiple liver metastases. The absence of any important complications and the survival rates in our series seem to indicate that one-shot PEI is effective for tumor debulking in patients not eligible for surgery and other alternative treatments.
