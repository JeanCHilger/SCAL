Giant hyperplasia of the caudate lobe of the cirrhotic liver: correlation with an anomaly of the caudate portal branch. Different imaging appearances of giant hyperplastic change of the caudate lobe of the liver are presented in a patient with liver cirrhosis. The mass like caudate lobe was isoechoic on ultrasound, hypodense on postcontrast computed tomography (CT), hyperintense on T1-weighted magnetic resonance, images and isointense on T2-weighted images. These imaging findings are similar to those of dysplastic nodule in cirrhotic liver. The caudate lobe received normal portal flow on CT during arterial portography, but superior mesenteric arteriography showed precocious or early division of the caudate portal branch. We suspect that caudate hyperplastic change may be correlated to anomalous caudate portal vein branch.
