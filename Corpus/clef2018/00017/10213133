Posttraumatic intra-gallbladder hemorrhage in a patient with liver cirrhosis. We report a case of intra-gallbladder hemorrhage secondary to blunt abdominal trauma in a patient with liver cirrhosis. A 58-year-old man was admitted to a local hospital with persistent right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Anemia was detected, and computed tomography (CT) revealed a high-density mass in the gallbladder lumen. He was transferred to our hospital because a gallbladder tumor was suspected. He had a history of habitual alcohol abuse and had sustained blunt abdominal trauma in the right upper quadrant 29 days before admission to our hospital (4 days before to the admission local hospital). The intra-gallbladder high-density mass depicted on the CT scan, observed as non-shadowing low-level echoes, was deemed to represent a blood clot on ultrasonography (US) performed 31 days after the trauma. US-guided percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder aspiration and cholecystography confirmed the presence of an old blood clot in the lumen. Because of the patient's persistent pain, a cholecystectomy was performed. The distended gallbladder was filled with old clotted blood.
