A prospective study of pancreatic disease in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis: comparative diagnostic value of ERCP and EUS and long-term significance of isolated parenchymal abnormalities. The prevalence of pancreatic disease in patients with alcohol-related liver cirrhosis is uncertain. We assessed the prevalence of pancreatic abnormalities in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, and we compared endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for the detection of chronic pancreatitis and other pancreatic lesions. In addition, we assessed the long-term significance of isolated pancreatic parenchymal abnormalities detected at EUS.EUS and ERCP were performed in each patient. Subjects with minimal parenchymal changes at initial EUS underwent clinical follow-up and subsequent EUS and/or ERCP to document the occurrence, absence, or progression of these changes.Seventy-two patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were recruited. Chronic pancreatitis was diagnosed in 14 patients (19%) by both methods independently. Isolated parenchymal lesions were observed in 18 patients by EUS alone. After a mean follow-up of 22 months the EUS appearance was unchanged. Ten of the 18 patients underwent follow-up ERCP and this was normal in all cases.This study demonstrated that (1) 19% of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis have chronic pancreatitis, (2) an additional 25% have isolated pancreatic parenchymal changes at EUS, and (3) these parenchymal abnormalities do not progress during follow-up.
