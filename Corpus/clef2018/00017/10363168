Sonographic estimation of liver tumor development induced by oral administration of thioacetamide in rat. Animal models for various types of cancer are of great help in the study of tumors and antitumor effects. Subcutaneous models have been widely utilized because they can be produced easily by subcutaneously implanting tumor cells into animals. Although subcutaneous models are very convenient for examining tumor development, they are definitely different from clinical manifestations of original tumors. In orthotopic animal models for internal tumors, however, it is difficult to examine tumor development without sacrificing animals. We demonstrate here that the occurrence and growth of liver tumors induced by oral administration of thioacetamide into rats were clearly observable by ultrasonography, and that the sonographic estimation was accurate. It was observed sonographically that the number and volume of liver tumors increased proportionately with TAA treatment periods. These results indicate that sonography is a useful and non-invasive method to investigate liver tumor development in rats.
