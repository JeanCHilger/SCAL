Ten year follow-up of patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon. The impact of the treatment with interferon (IFN) on the natural history of chronic hepatitis C is not defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long term effect of the treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C.In 31 patients with chronic hepatitis C (9 with cirrhosis) consecutively treated with recombinant alpha 2a interferon (r alpha 2a IFN), the evolution of the disease at 10 years from the therapy was evaluated by means of upper endoscopy, liver ultrasonography (US), liver function tests and hepatitis C virus (HCV) viremia.Among 10/31 patients previously classified as responders, only 1 has signs of evolution to cirrhosis HCV-RNA is still present in 2. Among 21 non-responder patients, 5 developed hepatocarcinoma (HCC) and 4 died during the follow-upPatients with chronic hepatitis C who respond to treatment with interferon have good outcome and rare evolution to cirrhosis. The treatment does not seem to influence the natural history of the disease in non-responders.
