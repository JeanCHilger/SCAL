Hepatic artery embolisation with a novel radiopaque polymer causes extended liver necrosis in pigs due to occlusion of the concomitant portal vein. In an attempt to overcome some of the problems encountered with the materials available for liver embolisation, we investigated a novel radiopaque polymer of the polyurethane family (Degra-Bloc).Hepatic artery embolisation of one liver lobe using polyurethane was performed in 19 healthy pigs. Microcirculatory changes were assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry. Radiological and pathological examinations of the livers, hearts and lungs removed provided information about the extent and effect of the embolisation.None of the pigs died due to hepatic failure or toxicity of polyurethane. Microcirculation of embolised liver lobes significantly decreased from 106 (+/-15) perfusion units (PU) to 45 (+/-6) PU immediately after embolisation and further to 28 (+/-7) PU before euthanasia. At this time conventional and angiographic X-ray controls demonstrated the radiopaque casts extending up to the peripheral arteries with signs of degradation over time but without formation of collateral vessels. The main pathological findings consisted of destruction of the portal tract structures and also of large areas of liver necrosis. Polyurethane was encountered in arterioles as small as 10-20 microm, but not in liver sinusoids, hearts or lungs.The novel polymer called DegraBloc is a biocompatible, slowly degradable, radiopaque embolic agent. The occlusion of the arterial tree up to the smallest arteriolar diameter combined with concomitant portal vein occlusion leads to sharp segmental necrosis in pig livers without formation of significant collaterals and without systemic embolism. In the treatment of liver tumours polyurethane might provide a promising alternative to conventional embolic materials, provided that it is used with care in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis.
