Hepatocellular carcinoma arising in an elderly male with primary biliary cirrhosis. We report the case of an elderly male with asymptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) who developed a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The 89-year-old man, who was otherwise healthy, was admitted for investigation of mild hepatic dysfunction, which had been detected during a routine physical check-up. Serum chemistry, positive anti-mitochondrial antibody (M2) and liver biopsy results led to a diagnosis of PBC. Three years later, at age 92, computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound scans of his abdomen revealed a large hepatic tumour, which was confirmed on liver biopsy to be HCC. The tumour ruptured 3 months after diagnosis and the patient was successfully stabilized by coil embolization of his right hepatic artery. We believe that, to date, this is the oldest reported patient to have had interventional radiology for the management of HCC.
