Liver volume estimated by ultrasonic scanning before and after portal decompression surgery. In 12 patients with cirrhosis of the liver, determination of the liver volume by ultrasonic scanning and of the galactose elimination capacity (GE) were made before and after portal decompression surgery. The liver volume decreased significantly, with a median decrease of 402 ml (psmaller than 0.01). Also the GE decreased, but relatively less than the liver volume, so that the calculated GE per unit liver volume increased, with a median increase of 5 mg per minute times 100 ml liver volume (psmaller than 0.005). The decrease in liver volume following portal decompression is assumed to be due in part to reduction of liver blood volume, in part to loss of tissue water and fat, and probably to some loss of parenchyma, accounting for a reduction of the GE.
