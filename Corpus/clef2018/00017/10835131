Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease: radiologic-pathologic correlation. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is a heritable but phenotypically variable disorder characterized by varying degrees of nonobstructive renal collecting duct ectasia, hepatic biliary duct ectasia and malformation, and fibrosis of both liver and kidneys. In the kidney, the dilated collecting ducts and interstitial fibrosis, when severe, may significantly impair renal function and result in hypertension and renal failure. Imaging typically shows large but reniform kidneys, diffusely increased renal parenchymal echogenicity at ultrasonography, and a striated nephrogram after contrast material administration. In the liver, periportal fibrosis accompanies the malformed and dilated bile ducts this may result in portal hypertension. The liver may appear normal or may show intrahepatic biliary dilatation
