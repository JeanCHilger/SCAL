Diagnostic evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma in a cirrhotic liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the world's most common cancers. It is closely associated with cirrhosis, especially that due to viral hepatitis. The incidences of viral hepatitis and HCC are rising steadily in the United States. When symptomatic, HCC is usually unresectable and associated with a median survival of less than 6 months. Nodular lesions of undetermined malignant potential are often found in cirrhotic, explanted livers. There appears to be a continuum of increasing malignant potential from regenerating nodules to dysplastic nodules and to HCC. Pathologic differentiation of high-grade dysplastic nodules from HCC is often difficult. Early diagnosis offers the best potential for curative intervention. Screening of high-risk patient populations using serum alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasound has been attempted but is hindered by low sensitivity and specificity. The multinodularity and vascular flow anomalies of the cirrhotic liver complicate imaging. However, recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging technology allow for more accurate examination of the liver. We review the current status of hepatic imaging techniques and the results of screening a high-risk population for HCC.
