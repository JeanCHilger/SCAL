The treatment of portal hypertension by videolaparoscopy in situs inversus totalis. A rare case of a 32-year-old male with situs inversus totalis viscerum admitted to hospital for hematemesis owing to portal hypertension of Laennec cirrhosis was treated for the first time by videolaparoscopic surgery. Situs inversus diagnosis was confirmed by thoracic radiography, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, abdominal echography and computed tomography. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed esophageal varices and large varices in the fundus of the stomach. A successful operation (azygo-portal disconnection, splenic artery ligation without splenectomy transesophageal suturing of esophageal varices without opening the esophagus and cholecystectomy), was performed by videolaparoscopy. The uneventful postoperative evolution (4-day hospitalization) reinforces the viability of the videolaparoscopic approach and the possibility of the application of this procedure even to situs inversus totalis organorum.
