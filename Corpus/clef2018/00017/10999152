Hepatitis B subtypes and hepatitis C genotypes in cirrhosis in western India: results of a pilot study. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the major causes of viral chronic liver diseases in India. HBV subtypes and HCV genotypes have not been reported from Western India. The aims of the study were (i) To study the prevalence of viral markers to HBV and HCV in adult cirrhotics, (ii) To determine HBV subtypes and HCV genotypes using serological and molecular biological methods.A total of 99 adult cirrhotic patients, proven by liver biopsy, laparoscopy, or a combined score of clinical features, biochemical tests, ultrasonography of abdomen, and radioisotope 99m Technetium scan in presence of oesophageal varices were studied. Sera collected from these patients were stored at -8 degrees C and subjected to various tests. HBsAg was determined by ELISA, anti-HBc by ELISA and anti HCV Ab was determined by the third generation ELISA. HBsAg subtypes were determined by enzyme immunoassay. HCV RNA was determined by PCR in those who tested positive for anti HCV antibody. Genotyping of HCV was done with a second generation PCR.HBsAg was detected in 16, out of which subtyping was possible in 14, adw was found in 6 and ayw in 8. Anti HCV Ab was found in 5. Genotyping was possible in three samples which revealed one to be of genotypes 3, one of genetic group 4, and one of genetic group 5.Subtypes and genotypes of HBV and HCV have not been reported from Western India. Their determination can have implications in understanding the spectrum of disease, characteristics and response to treatment.
