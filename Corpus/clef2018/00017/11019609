Previous tuberculosis, hepatitis C virus and lichen planus. A report of 10 cases, a causal or casual link? We report 10 cases of lichen planus (LP) and chronic liver disease linked to HCV. The mean age was 63.4 +/- 5.1 years (range 51-73), five were female six patients had an established cirrhosis of the liver, as shown by either a liver biopsy or the ultrasonographic and biohumoral evidence. The remaining four patients had chronic hepatitis. Histological examination confirmed the presence of LP: the localization of the dermatosis was restricted to the skin in four patients, to the mucous membranes in five (4 atrophic erosive and one erosive) while the remaining had mucous-cutaneous localization. A type II cryoglobulinemia was demonstrated in two and a type III in one of the patients, while no one had otherwise circulating autoantibodies (anti-nuclear, anti-smooth muscle, anti-liver kidney microsomal type 1 and anti-mitochondrial antigens) such as other etiological factors of liver disease. In six of the patients the history was positive for previous Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. In clinical practice the patients with chronic liver disease and HCV infection can also suffer from severe extrahepatic manifestations, including lichen planus.
