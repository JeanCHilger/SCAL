A case of the development of two hepatocellular carcinomas and a cholangiocarcinoma with cirrhosis after elimination of serum hepatitis C virus RNA with interferon therapy. A 64-year-old man who had exhibited abnormal transaminase levels for about 20 years was admitted to a hospital for the treatment of liver damage. Laboratory testing demonstrated that he was suffering from chronic hepatitis C, and a liver biopsy showed chronic active hepatitis with septal fibrosis. He was treated with interferon-alpha, and HCV-RNA became undetectable. Four years after the completion of interferon treatment, 3 lesions in the patient's liver were revealed by routine ultrasonography, and he was referred to Nagoya University Hospital for further examinations on November 1997. Radiographical examinations such as computed tomography and angiography demonstrated 2 hypervascular tumors (size: phi 35 mm and phi 20 mm) and 1 hypovascular tumor (phi 28 mm). Qualitative analysis for HCV-RNA by polymerase chain reaction method was negative. Partial hepatectomy was performed, and pathological examination of the tumors showed 2 moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinoma accompanied with liver cirrhosis. We propose that even patients with disappearance of HCV-RNA after interferon therapy, especially with liver cirrhosis or severe fibrosis, should be followed-up closely and examined at regular intervals because of the high risk of developing primary liver cancers.
