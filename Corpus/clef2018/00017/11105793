Resolution of skin lesions and long-term survival in a dog with superficial necrolytic dermatitis and liver cirrhosis. A nine-year-old, neutered female Shetland sheepdog was presented with crusted, ulcerative skin lesions affecting the footpads, commissures of the lips and the lateral canthi of the eyes. Histopathological examination of skin biopsies revealed changes consistent with superficial necrolytic dermatitis and biochemical analysis demonstrated elevated liver enzymes. Abdominal radiography revealed a small liver which, on ultrasonography, appeared diffusely mottled and showed changes suggestive of periportal fibrosis. On exploratory laparotomy, the pancreas appeared normal, but the liver was small and had multiple nodules throughout the parenchyma. This appearance was confirmed as cirrhosis on histopathological examination. The dog was placed on a hepatic support diet and treated with colchicine, essential fatty acid supplementation and raw egg yolks. After four weeks, the skin lesions had resolved and the dog remained free of clinical signs over a 22-month follow-up period.
