Genetic predisposition to bilharziasis in humans: research methods and application to the study of Schistosoma mansoni infection. The development of genetic epidemiology methods using recent human genetic mapping information together with the growing availability of candidate genes has led to major advances in the identification of host genes in human schistosomiasis. Two phenotypes have been studied so far in the infection by Schistosoma mansoni: infection levels by the parasite as measured by the faecal egg counts, and the severe hepatic fibrosis caused by S. mansoni assessed by ultrasound examination. The first study was performed on Brazilian pedigrees and provided strong evidence for a major gene controlling infection levels by S. mansoni denoted as SM1 which was mapped to chromosome 5q31-q33. This region contains several candidate genes involved in the regulation of the Th1/Th2 response, and the direct role of polymorphisms located within these genes is under investigation. The second study conducted in Sudan also showed the presence of a major gene influencing the development of severe hepatic fibrosis due to S. mansoni infection denoted as SM2. This gene is not located in the 5q31-q33 region, but maps to chromosome 6q22-q23 and is closely linked to the IFN-gamma R1 gene encoding the receptor of the strongly anti-fibrogenic cytokine Interferon-gamma. These findings indicate that two distinct genetic loci control human predisposition to schistosomiasis, SM1 located in the 5q31-q33 region which is likely to play a role in the Th1/Th2 differentiation, and SM2 in 6q22-q23 influencing disease progression with a possible involvement in the regulation of IFN-gamma.
