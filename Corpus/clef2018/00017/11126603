Improved accuracy in the diagnosis of intrahepatic bile duct ectasia in Caroli's disease by combination of ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. Caroli's disease is characterized by dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Cholangitis, liver cirrhosis and development of a cholangiocarcinoma are possible complications. For optimal therapy, a correct diagnosis of the extent of the disease is mandatory. The present report demonstrates that the combination of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and ultrasound may lead to a more reliable diagnosis of the extent of Caroli's disease. It is therefore essential to perform ultrasound in all these patients.
