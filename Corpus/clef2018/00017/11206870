Hepatopulmonary syndrome: prevalence and clinical profile. The hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is defined as a triad of liver dysfunction, intrapulmonary vascular dilatations (IPVD) and arterial hypoxemia. There is paucity of Indian studies regarding the prevalence of IPVD and arterial hypoxemia particularly amongst patients with non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF) and extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO), where liver dysfunction is not a feature.All patients with portal hypertension and esophageal varices seen at a tertiary care hospital during 1995-98 were studied. Ultrasonography of abdomen, contrast-enhanced echocardiography (CEE), arterial blood gas analysis and assessment of alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient were done.Of 138 patients with portal hypertension seen during the study period, 88 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These included 63 with cirrhosis, 15 with NCPF and 10 with EHPVO. CEE showed IPVD in 17 (27%) patients with cirrhosis, of which 11 (17.5%) fulfilled the criteria for HPS. IPVD were also noted in 4 (26.6%) cases of NCPF and 3 (30%) of EHPVO, though only 2 (13.3%) and 1 (10%) respectively had elevated alveolar-arterial gradient and liver dysfunction in addition. Age and sex distribution and duration of symptoms were not different in patients with HPS. Patients with HPS had higher incidence of dyspnea, platypnea, clubbing and spider nevi.Hepatopulmonary syndrome is present in 17.5% of cirrhotics, 13.3% of patients with NCPF and 10% with EHPVO. Patients with HPS had significantly higher incidence of dyspnea, platypnea, clubbing and spider nevi.
