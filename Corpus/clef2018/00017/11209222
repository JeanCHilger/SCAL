Surgical correction of blood and lymph circulation in liver cirrhosis. After modeling cirrhosis of the liver in experimental dogs the gastroesophagolienal hemo- and lymphocirculation and that of the greater omentum were transferred into the system of the vena cava inferior, the mesenterial outflow being preserved through the liver. The dynamic observation of the experimental animals has shown the intervention performed to be valid. In 6 patients the gastroesophagolienal circulation and that of the greater omentum were transferred into the system of the vena cava inferior. The proposed method of surgical correction leads to lower portal pressure, to saved hepatopetal blood flow along the portal vein. The reestablished absorbing capacity of the greater omentum and the developed collateral lymph circulation decrease the transudation of the lymph into the abdominal cavity and increase its reabsorption.
