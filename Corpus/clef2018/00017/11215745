Parameters of microsomal and cytosolic liver function but not of liver perfusion predict portal vein velocity in noncirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C. Our aim was to compare color-coded Doppler sonography (CCDS) and quantitative testing of liver function (QTLF) in patients with chronic hepatitis C. In all, 74 patients with chronic hepatitis C and mild fibrosis underwent QTLF, which included aminopyrine breath test (ABT), galactose elimination capacity (GEC), sorbitol clearance (SC), and indocyanine green clearance (ICG). Hepatic artery velocity and resistance index (HA-V, HA-RI) as well as portal vein velocity (PV-V) were measured by CCDS. ABT, GEC, and PV-V were significantly reduced, whereas SC1, ICG, HA-V, and HA-RI showed normal levels. There was a significant correlation between reduction in PV-V only with GEC and ABT. QTLF did not correlate with HA-V and HA-RI. In conclusion, in hepatitis C patients with liver fibrosis, ABT and GEC are decreased significantly, which was paralleled by a reduction of PV-V. Unexpectedly SC1 and ICG, the classical hepatic perfusion parameters, do not correlate with the parameters measured by CCDS.
