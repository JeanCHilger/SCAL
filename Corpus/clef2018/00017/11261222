Usefulness of magnetic cholangioresonance in the study of hepatobiliary disease in patients adults with cystic fibrosis. Because alterations in the bile ducts found in cystic fibrosis mimic those found in primary sclerosing cholangitis, magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) could be a useful diagnosis technique, especially because it is non-invasive.We prospectively studied 26 adult patients with cystic fibrosis. Of these, 11 had liver disease previously diagnosed on the basis of symptomatology, physical examination, liver function tests and abdominal ultrasound (group A) and 15 had no apparent liver disease (group B). In all patients liver function tests, abdominal ultrasound and MRC using 1.5 Teslas General Electric and Siemens systems were carried out. The images were interpreted blind by two radiologists with experience in the interpretation of biliary alterations in cystic fibrosis.In 6 of the 11 patients in group A, MRC showed signs of liver cirrhosis (nodularity, irregular surface, splenomegaly, varicosity) 4 patients showed rose-colored images in the choledoch and intrahepatic ductsMRC is a useful technique in the study of hepatobiliary disease in cystic fibrosis because it detected anomalies in all our patients previously diagnosed with liver disease and revealed ductal lesions not revealed by other non-invasive techniques.
