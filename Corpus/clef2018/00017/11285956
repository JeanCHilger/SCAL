Radiofrequency interstitial thermal ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma in liver cirrhosis. Role of the laparoscopic approach. The laparoscopic approach to radiofrequency interstitial thermal ablation (RITA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with intraoperative ultrasound guidance has been proposed with the aim of obtaining additional information for a better neoplastic staging and a complete and effective treatment of the liver lesions in patients with a difficult percutaneous approach.In this pilot study, 29 patients with HCC in liver cirrhosis were submitted to laparoscopic RITA under sonographic guide. Most of these patients were in Child's A class of liver function. Patients with large tumors (> 5 cm), portal vein thrombosis, or severe liver disease (Child's C class) were excluded from the study.The laparoscopic RITA procedure was completed in 27 of 29 patients (93% feasibility rate). The laparoscopic ultrasound examination identified new malignant liver nodules in five patients (18.5%). A total of 44 lesions were treated. The mean operative time was 75.8 +/- 20.5 min (range, 45-120 min), and the mean RITA time was 18 +/- 10 min (range, 10-56 min). There was no operative mortality, and postoperative morbidity was low (four cases) without any mortality. A complete tumor necrosis was observed in 90% of the patients via spiral computed tomography (CT) 1 month after treatment.Laparoscopic RITA of hepatocellular carcinoma proved to be a safe and effective technique, at least in the short term. Its role in the treatment of HCC needs to be defined in larger series.
