Role of autoimmunity in nonviral chronic liver disease. To evaluate the prevalence and clinical profile of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in patients with chronic liver disease.Four hundred and thirty five consecutive patient with chronic liver disease seen in our department from January 1997 to December 1998 were studied with detailed history and clinical examination. All the patients underwent liver function tests, ultrasonography, isotope liver scanning, viral markers, autoimmune markers ANA, ASMA, LKM1 and AMA (by immunofluorescence technique) and liver histology whenever permissible. Appropriate work up for Wilson's disease was done whenever suspected clinically. Diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis was made by the composite scoring system by international autoimmune hepatitis group. Twenty out of the 435 patients met the criteria of definite autoimmune hepatitis and seven patient had probable autoimmune hepatitis. Forty out of 408 patients showed markers of autoimmunity positive but did not qualify diagnosis of AIH on composite scores.Demographic profile of 27 patients with autoimmune hepatitis was as follows male:female ratio 1:8, mean age 39.8 +/- 13 years (Range 4-65 years)Autoimmune liver disease is not uncommon in India and should be suspected in all patients with chronic liver disease, especially in non-viral, non-alcoholic, female patients. The diagnosis of AIH should however be made on the composite scoring system given by international group and not only on the presence or absence of autoimmune markers.
