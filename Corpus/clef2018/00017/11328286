Clinical spectrum of hepatitis C-related liver disease and response to treatment with interferon and ribavirin in haemophilia or von Willebrand disease. Our aim was to evaluate the severity of liver disease resulting from chronic hepatitis C in haemophilia or von Willebrand disease and the efficacy of 6 months treatment with interferon alpha and ribavirin. Fifty-five liver biopsies were performed in 43 patients without any bleeding complications, as seen with ultrasound immediately after the biopsy and 48 h thereafter. Histological changes were mild, with low scores for both inflammation and fibrosis, in spite of long exposure to blood products (mean 27 years). Two patients had compensated cirrhosis. Thirty-five out of 39 included patients completed study treatment. Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA was negative in 77% (30/39) of patients at the end of treatment, and 36% (14/39) achieved a complete sustained response at follow-up 6 months after treatment. Treatment failure was more frequent in patients with virus genotype 1 compared with non-1 (P = 0.0003). The response rate correlated well with that of non-haemophilic patients. In summary: (1) liver biopsy was safe with our regimen (2) liver disease in our patients was usually mild and had a slow progress
