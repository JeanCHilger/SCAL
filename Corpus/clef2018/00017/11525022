Less invasive medical therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Since hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually occurs in chronic liver disease, especially viral cirrhosis, it often recurs even after surgical resection. Because of the high recurrence rate of HCC, less invasive therapies have become more common recently, including percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy(PMCT), and radiofrequency ablation(RFA). A PEI needle or a coagulation electrode is usually inserted into an HCC nodule under ultrasonographic-guidance, and chemical or heat ablation is carried out with local or general anesthesia. A patient with a few numbers of small HCCs of 3 cm or less in diameter is a good candidate for these therapy modalities. Although RFA is the easiest and most effective of these therapies the best therapy for each patient is selected according to the number, size, and location of target lesions.
