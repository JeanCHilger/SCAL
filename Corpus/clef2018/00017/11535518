The natural history of chronic hepatitis C in a cohort of HIV-negative Italian patients with hereditary bleeding disorders. This study looked at 102 anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive, hepatitis B virus (HBV)-negative, and HIV-negative patients (median age, 45.1 years range, 15-71) affected by hereditary bleeding disorders who have been infected with HCV for 15 to 34 years (median, 25.1). All these patients were infected before the mid 1980s because of non-virally inactivated pooled blood products. Fourteen patients (13.7%) were HCV-RNA negative with no signs of liver disease and were considered to have cleared the virus. Eighty-eight patients (86.3%) were HCV-RNA positive. The HCV genotype distribution was 1a in 20.5%, 1b in 36.4%, 2 in 17.0%, 3 in 15.9%, 4 in 3.4%, and mixed in 6.8% of cases. Twenty-four patients (23.5%) had serum cryoglobulins, symptomatic in 4 cases, and associated with liver disease and with genotype 1. Among the 88 HCV-RNA-positive patients, 15 (17.0%) had normal alanine aminotransferase levels and abdominal ultrasound, 61 (69.3%) had nonprogressive chronic hepatitis, and 12 (13.7%) had severe liver disease (6 [6.9%] liver cirrhosis, 4 [4.5%] hepatic decompensation, and 2 [2.3%] hepatocellular carcinoma) after a follow-up period of 25 years. There were 3 (3.4%) liver-related deaths. HCV genotype 1, patient's age at evaluation, duration of infection, and severity of congenital bleeding disorder were associated with more advanced liver disease. The results confirm the slow progression of HCV infection in HIV-negative hemophiliacs.
