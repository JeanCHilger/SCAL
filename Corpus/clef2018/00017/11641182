Intrahepatic spontaneous retrograde portal flow in patients with cirrhosis of the liver: reversal by food intake. The purpose of our study was to assess whether intrahepatic spontaneous retrograde portal flow in patients with cirrhosis of the liver can be reversed to a normal portal venous flow by food intake.Of the 18 cirrhotic patients with intrahepatic spontaneous retrograde portal flow, 16 (89%) showed a marked change in portal flow direction after food intake. This evidence strongly suggests that intrahepatic spontaneous retrograde portal flow may be reversible. Furthermore, this finding implies that regular food intake may be important in the maintenance of effective hepatic blood flow in cirrhotic patients.
