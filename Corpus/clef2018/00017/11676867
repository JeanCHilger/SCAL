A preliminary study of the combination of noninvasive parameters in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis. To explore the combination of noninvasive parameters and its significance in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis.Liver biopsy was performed on 200 patients with chronic liver diseases, and the biochemical parameters, serum fibrotic markers, and B ultrasound, CT, and MRI were detected in the corresponding period. Then, by the regression, we obtained the combination of the noninvasive parameters and evaluated the significance in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis.Three combinations have been obtained. The parameters in the first combination which was used to differentiate fibrosis and no fibrosis(S0 vs S1+S2+S3+S4) were the parameter of blood flow of portal vein per minute by B ultrasonography, age, the maximum oblique line of right liver by B ultrasound, the wave expression of the surface of liver by CT/MRI and GGT. The parameters in the second combination which was used to evaluated the degree of fibrosis(S1+S2 vs S3+S4) were HA, A/G and the longest length of spleen by B ultrasound. The third combination which was used to distinguish fibrosis with cirrhosis (S1+S2+S3 vs S4) was composed by HA, the little cyst-like change near the intrahepatic duct, thickness of liver capsule by B ultrasound, age and the index of symptoms. All the three combinations were sensitive, specific, and accurate.The combinations of noninvasive parameters is more valuable than single parameter in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis.
