An ultrasound scoring system for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. To establish noninvasive semiquantitative ultrasonic criteria for evaluating liver fibrosis and differentiating cirrhosis from chronic hepatitis.A total of 66 HBsAg positive patients (chronic hepatitis 42 patients, cirrhosis 24) were included. Ultrasonography was performed 24 hours before liver biopsy. A fibrotic scoring system was used to evaluate the ultrasound findings in contrast with fibrotic stages in each patient.The total liver fibrotic scores had a significantly positive correlation with the histological liver fibrotic stage (r = 0.952, P < 0.001) the stage of histological liver fibrosis (Y) was calculated by the total fibrotic scores (X) according to the experiential formula: Y = X/2 -2The total fibrotic scores of ultrasonic dimensional image provide a semiquantitative marker to evaluate liver fibrosis and differentiate cirrhosis from chronic hepatitis.
