Progress in liver surgery. In the 1980s, new methods such as intra-operative ultrasonography, hemihepatic vascular occlusion and ultrasonically guided subsegmentectomy were introduced in clinical practice for use in hepatic surgery. Because of the progress, surgical resection of hepatocellular carcinomas associated with cirrhosis became safer, and curativity and hepatic functional preservation were promoted. The long-term survival rate after operation has improved. Recently, the use of the procedures of vascular surgery transplant surgery has allowed the indication for hepatectomy to be expanded. Here we describe the transition and progress in hepatic surgery.
