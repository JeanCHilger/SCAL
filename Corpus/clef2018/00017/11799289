Hepatectomy using the coagulating shears type of ultrasonically activated scalpel. Since the ultrasonically activated scalpel (UAS) incorporates multiple functions, we have used it for hepatectomies. The present study discusses the noteworthy points and problems of use, and shows initial results. Intraoperative ultrasonography is an important tool for comprehending the positional relationship between the plane of division and the main blood vessels. It allows initial adjustment of coagulation and cutting effects according to the rigidity of the liver parenchyma by means of variable ultrasound levels and exchangeable blade tips, and offers good visibility of the cut surface in deep sites as long as adequate tension on the tissue and an upper position for the blade are maintained. 30 patients underwent hepatectomies using the UAS. The amount of blood loss for lobectomy was significantly less than that for partial lobectomy in normal livers in addition to a significant difference between normal and damaged livers in each group according to the extent of resection. There were no serious complications seen in all cases during the operation. The incidence of positive bile leakage was high. It is recommended that bile leakage testing be carried out as thoroughly as possible. There were 3 postoperative bile fistulas and 1 postoperative hemorrhage. In conclusion, although a dramatic improvement in blood loss and shortened operating time could not be obtained in all procedures, the safety and usefulness were demonstrated in lobectomy. The UAS can be considered as a surgical device that can contribute to the efficiency of hepatectomy, depending on the indications selected.
