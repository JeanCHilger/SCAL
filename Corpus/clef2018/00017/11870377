Hepatic arterial buffer response in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Hepatic arterial buffer response (HABR) is considered an important compensatory mechanism to maintain perfusion of the liver by hepatic arterial vasodilation on reduction of portal venous perfusion. HABR has been suggested to be impaired in patients with advanced cirrhosis. In patients with hepatopetal portal flow, placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) reduces portal venous liver perfusion. Accordingly, patients with severe cirrhosis should have impaired HABR after TIPS implantation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of TIPS on HABR as reflected by changes in resistance index (RI) of the hepatic artery. A total of 366 patients with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, 106 class B, 168
