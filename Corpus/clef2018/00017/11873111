Huge adenomatous hyperplasia of the liver. Adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) of the liver is defined as a regenerative overgrowth with limited growth potential. Patients with AH of the liver usually have cirrhosis of the liver as well. Adenomatous hyperplasia is also described as a benign nodule more than 8 mm, which is the main differentiation between AH and regeneration nodules (which are less than 8 mm). Adenomatous hyperplasias more than 20 mm is extremely rare in the clinicopathologic studies. We present two cases of extraordinarily large AH (one was 100 mm and the other, 30 mm). Both patients were alcoholic, and one also had viral hepatitis B. By clinical, biochemical, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations, we diagnosed liver cirrhosis in both. Sizable nodules were discovered in their livers using imaging studies (including ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography), and percutaneous liver biopsies of the nodules showed their cirrhotic background. However, neither of the patients developed hepatocellular carcinoma during the follow-up period.
