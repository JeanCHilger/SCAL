Arteroportal fistulas between the accessory right hepatic, gastroduodenal and superior mesenteric arteries and portal vein: a difficult technical problem to overcome in liver transplantation. Fistulous communications between the accessory right hepatic (ARHA), gastroduodenal (GD), and superior mesenteric (SMA) arteries and the portal vein (PV) may represent a contraindication for liver transplantation (LT).A patient with HCV-related liver cirrhosis and progressive liver decompensation underwent preoperative LT work-up. Doppler ultrasound (DU), Angiography and MRI revealed arteroportal fistulas (APF) and diversion of mesenteric-splenoportal flow through spontaneous splenorenal shunts (SSRS) in the systemic circulation. The patient was transplanted and the ARHA and GDA were distally sectioned the HA was anastomosed to the donor HAReperfusion and late liver function were good. DU and MRI studies showed an effective portal flow and the maintenance of a normal splenopancreatic vein outflow through the SSRS.APF represent a serious clinical problem, particularly in patients who need LT. The persistence of arterial flow into the PV is dangerous for the long-term liver function. A particular surgical strategy, strictly tailored to the hemodynamic conditions, has to be planned.Extrahepatic multiple APF would no longer to represent a contraindication to LT, although this claim needs to be confirmed in the light of further experience and a longer-term follow-up.
