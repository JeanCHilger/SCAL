Pericarditis as the initial manifestation of retroperitoneal fibrosis--a case report. A 70-year-old patient with invasive ductal breast cancer underwent conserving surgery of the right breast and right axillary dissection as well as postoperative irradiation therapy. Five months later, she presented with dyspnoea and progressive weakness.Clinically, the patient showed anasarca and petechial hemorrhages, laboratory tests revealed thrombopenia, hepatic dysfunction, radiologic investigations showed enlargement of the liver and spleen, effusions of the pleura and pericardium, and ascite. Echocardiography showed pericardial effusion without cardiac tamponade.Despite supportive therapy the patient's performance status deteriorated significantly, the diagnosis of the underlying disease could not be established, the patient died with the clinical signs of cardiovascular failure. Autopsy revealed progressive retroperitoneal fibrosis with systemic involvement of pleura, pericardium, epicardium, myocardium, lungs, and kidneys and pericarditis. Retrospectively clinical symptoms were interpreted as right heart insufficiency due to pericardial effusion.This case report reminds of occurrence of manyfold clinic manifestations of retroperitoneal fibrosis in dependence of particular organic involvement and that retroperitoneal fibrosis represents a differential diagnosis.
