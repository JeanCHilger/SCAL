Examination of the organs in the upper abdomen with ultra sound (author's transl). Ultrasonography is a harmless reproducibel technique with its own specific indications, an established part of clinical diagnosis in obstetrics, gynecology, ophthalmology, neurology and cardiology. Investigations on the organs of the upper abdomen have greatly extended the indications. Interpreting the sonograms requires experience in providing and evaluating the picture. In part I of this paper normal ultrasonic findings on liver, pancreas, spleen and kidneys are shown and explained on thebasis of the physical characteristics of ultrasound techniques and the various ultrasoundtopographic data. This echographic normal anatomy of the organs mentioned enables us to understand pathologic changes shown in part II. An attempt is also made to allocate and evaluate ultrasonography among other diagnostic techniques.
