Correlation of ultrasonographic findings with ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration of liver lesion. Ultrasonographic findings of liver were correlated with cytological findings in a series of 50 patients. Multiple lesions described by ultrasonography and suggested as HCC/TB were proved to be metastatic in 60% cases and hepatocellular carcinoma in 40% cases by cytological examination. Multiple lesions suggested as metastatic lesions in ultrasonography was proved as such by cytology in 83% cases. Solitary lesion suggested as neoplastic in ultrasonography was proved as such in cytology in 90% cases. Of the 2 patients suggested as diffuse parenchymal lesion revealed cytological findings of cirrhosis in one case and that of TB in other. Serum alpha-feto protein and Carcinoembryogenic antigen (CEA) was done in all the cases. Serum alpha-feto protein was higher in hepatocellular carcinoma and CEA was higher in metastatic lesions. Ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration of liver can play more role in diagnosis and classification of liver disease than ultrasonographic comment alone, as it requires greater degree of precision to reach diagnostic accuracy.
