Hepatocellular carcinoma: risk groups--screening. Cirrhosis of the liver has to be regarded as a premalignant condition independent of its etiology. The annual risk of developing HCC in cirrhosis is between 1% and 6%. Surveillance-programs have been introduced to detect early stages of HCC in order to improve mortality. However, only controlled trials will answer the question of the efficacy of such programs. Studies on the potential benefit of surveillance-programs comparing survival in surveilled and unsurveilled patients are so far lacking. It seems clear, however, that surveillance-programs can detect small tumors, often unfocal and potentially treatable by a curative approach. Moreover, the etiology (HBV, HCV, genetic hemochromatosis) and activity of liver cirrhosis as measured by serum-transaminases, liver histology (small-cell dysplasia and atypical regenerative nodules), Child-Pugh-stage and the concentration of alpha-fetoprotein at the beginning of a surveillance-program--all these factors reflect a high risk of developing HCC in an individual patient. Until programs are introduced on the basis of randomized, controlled trials of surveillance vs. usual care (with liver-related, specific deaths and all-cause-mortality as end-points) it seems reasonable to screen high-risk patients semi-annually by liver ultrasound and determination of AFP-concentration in the serum.
