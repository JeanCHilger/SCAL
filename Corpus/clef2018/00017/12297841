Increasing intra-abdominal pressure increases pressure, volume, and wall tension in esophageal varices. Many daily activities cause acute elevations of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). In portal hypertensive cirrhotic patients, increased IAP increases absolute portal pressure and azygos blood flow, suggesting that it may have detrimental consequences at the esophageal varices. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of increased IAP on variceal pressure, size, and wall tension. Endosonography and a noninvasive endoscopic pressure gauge were used to measure variceal pressure, radius, wall tension, and volume in baseline conditions and after increasing IAP by 10 mm Hg using an inflatable girdle in 14 patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices. Increasing IAP markedly increased variceal pressure (from 13.3 +/- 4.2 to 17.4 +/- 4.6 mm Hg P =.0001) and radius (from 2.9 +/- 1.0 to 3.9 +/- 1.1 mm
