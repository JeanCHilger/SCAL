High intensity focused ultrasound alone for malignant solid tumors. To investigate the efficacy and side-effects of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in the treatment of malignant solid tumors.Thirty such patients who refused surgery and or refractory to chemotherapy, were treated by HIFU alone, with the efficacy and side effects monitored in terms of vital organ signs observation, functional assay of important organs, imaging examinations: digital subtraction angiography (DSA), CT, MRI, single photoemission computed tomography (SPECT), large core needle biopsy, complications or metastasis.After HIFU therapy, the vital signs remained stable and the function of heart, lung, kidney and liver was also normal. DSA images showed that small or larger arteries were not damaged. After a follow-up of 10 - 38 months (23.1 months), 26 patients (87%) have been alive. The volume of the tumor underwent complete regression in 10 patients. Shrinkage of tumor volume >/= 50% was observed in 13. Eight of 13 patients were examined by large core needle biopsy, all showing necrosis and/or fibrosis though 3 patients (10%) had local recurrence. Two of these were retreated again by HIFU and the locally recurrent tumor became well controlled. New metastases developed in 5 patients after HIFU therapy. Two patients suffered from peripheral nerve injuries, most of which have recovered during the follow-up. However, one patient developed skin injury.High intensity focused ultrasound alone is effective and safe in the treatment of malignant solid tumors.
