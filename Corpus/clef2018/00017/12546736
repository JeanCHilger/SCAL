Study on the influence factors of the serum fibrosis markers. To analyse the factors which influence the four serum fibrosis markers hyaluronic acid (HA), type III procollagen (PCIII), laminin (LN) and type IV collagen (CIV).The levels of serum HA, PCIII, LN and CIV were measured by RIA in 141 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), then the patients were divided into two groups according to the serum fibrosis markers, namely consistent group and inconsistent group. the liver biopsy materials were examined pathomorphologically and liver function was detected by automatic biochemistry analyzer, The interior diameters of the portal vein, the spleen vein and the thickness of the spleen were also measured with ultrasonography.16 patients (14.16%) whose serum fibrosis markers were inconsistent with histological stage of liver fibrosis were found. Their serum fibrosis markers were not correlated with staging of liver fibrosis (P>0.05), but were positively correlated with inflammation grade (x(2)=12.07, P<0.05), at same time, the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase(AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and globulin (GLB) decreased obviously, from 89.28 U/L +/- 64.25 U/L to 49.31 U/L +/- 26.75 U/L (t=2.45, P<0.05), 66.10 U/L +/- 42.30 U/L to 40.83 U/L +/- 22.40 U/L (t=2.33, P<0.05), 86.26 U/L +/- 70.36 U/L to 48.99 U/L +/- 29.96 U/L (t=2.08, P<0.05) and 32.13 g/L +/- 5.18 g/L to 28.05 g/L +/- 3.47 g/L (t=3.03, P<0.01) respectively. And the level of albumin (ALB) and the ratio of albumin and globulin (A/G) increased evidently, from 42.34 g/L +/- 4.81 g/L to 46.19 g/L +/- 3.61 g/L (t=3.06, P<0.01) and 1.35 +/- 0.28 to 1.63 +/- 0.26 (t=3.70, P<0.01). But the serum level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (TBil), total protein (TP), the width of main portal vein, the width of splenic vein and the thickness of the spleen did not change clearly (P>0.05).As diagnostic markers, serum fibrosis markers as well as inflammation grade and liver function should be taken into account.
