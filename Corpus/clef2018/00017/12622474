Diagnosis and management of hepatic copper accumulation in a Skye terrier. A one-year-old, neutered female Skye terrier presented with anorexia, vomiting, seizures and ascites. Portal venography demonstrated the presence of multiple acquired portosystemic shunts. Hepatic biopsy confirmed the presence of copper accumulation and fibrosis. Treatment included ursodeoxycholic acid therapy, colchicine and oral zinc. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case report detailing successful management of Skye terrier hepatopathy.
