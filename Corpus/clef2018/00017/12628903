Pericardiocentesis and pancreatic aspiration needle biopsy in coagulopathic and thrombocytopenic cirrhotic patient. We report on the case of a 40-year-old patient with coagulopathic alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent ultrasound-directed pericardiocentesis and fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the pancreas after receiving recombinant human factor VIIa (rhFVIIa). The infusion of rhFVIIa rapidly corrected her coagulopathy and made it possible to perform both procedures. The marked changes produced in the prothrombin time and international normalized ratio as a result of the infusion of rhFVIIa are presented. As a result of these changes in coagulation status, both procedures were performed safely, and the patient's clinical management and subsequent care plan were defined.
