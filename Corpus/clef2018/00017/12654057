Clinical approach to graft hepatic artery thrombosis following living related liver transplantation. Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) has an occurrence rate of 1.7-26% following living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and is one of the most common reasons for graft loss and mortality in this population. There is a higher incidence of HAT in pediatric recipients. The aim of this case report is to discuss clinical approaches for the treatment of HAT occurring in the early post-operative period after LDLT. An 11-month-old, 7.8-kg female with cirrhosis secondary to biliary atresia underwent LDLT at Gazi University Hospital in Ankara. The graft was a left lateral segment from her father with a left hepatic artery (HA) of 2 mm diameter and a graft weight/recipient body weight ratio of 2.0%. After an uneventful early post-operative period, HAT was diagnosed by Doppler ultrasonography (USG) on the fifth post-operative day. Following angiographic evaluation, immediate exploration and reanastomosis was performed using an operation microscope. Post-operatively, the HA was patented by Doppler USG and graft function returned to normal. Now, 42 months later, the patient continues to do well with normal graft function, using a regimen of tacrolimus monotherapy for immunosuppression. In countries which have very limited resources for urgent re-transplantation, given their serious donor shortage, graft salvage may be the only option for patient survival when HAT occurs. In these circumstances, early diagnosis and immediate revascularization may be the only method for graft salvage. A daily routine of Doppler USG examination in the early post-operative period may provide a method for the early diagnosis of HAT, before liver enzymes are elevated and hepatic necrosis has begun.
