Liver transection with the harmonic scalpel in elective liver surgery. More procedures used in transection of the liver parenchyma include also resection by means of a harmonious scalpel with an enhanced haemostatic effect. Based on analysis of 51 patients operated on account of liver disease using a harmonious scalpel, the authors evaluate its asset to the liver resection technique. The harmonious scalpel was used in transection of the liver in seven patients with benign liver disease (inborn cysts, follicular nodular hyperplasia, haemangioma, hepatocellular adenoma) and in 44 with malignant disease (hepatocellular carcinoma, metastases, most frequently, i.e. 34x of colorectal carcinoma). Anatomical liver resection (hemihepatectomy, lateral bisegmentectomy, segmentectomy) was implemented in 34 patients, and in 17 a wedge-shaped resection. Transection of the parenchyma by a harmonious scalpel was made using 10 mm coagulation scissors, i.e. their blunt blade with a lower oscillation grade. The preoperative blood loss was from 30 to 300 ml. As to postoperative complications 2 patients developed cholascos, 2 fluidothorax, 1 respiratory failure and 2 early infection. Liver resection by means of a harmonious scalpel is a new method of parenchyma transection with adherence to the resection line without damage of the deeper structures, reducing preoperative haemorrhage and minimalizing the extent of resection in liver diseases with impaired regeneration of the parenchyma (cirrhosis). Liver transection by a harmonious scalpel is a safe method where it is essential to respect recommended technical parameters, incl. the necessary time.
