Relation between hepatocarcinoma and hepatitis C virus infection. The incidence of hepatocarcinoma (HCC) has increased in industralized countries. Its relation with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has already been established. The mechanisms by which HCV promotes HCC development are poorly understood. The continuous necrotic and inflammatory effect with subsequent liberation of various cytoquines and modifications in hepatocyte genome have been proposed. Chronic infection with HCV leads to chronic liver disease and cirrhosis which is described as the main precursory lesion to HCC. The assessment methods for patients with chronic liver diseases allow those patients with high risk for HCC to be identified and the process to identify this tumor at an early stage to be initiated.
