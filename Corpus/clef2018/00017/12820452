Usefulness of alpha-fetoprotein in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. With the widespread use of ultrasonography (US) and computerized tomography (CT), the usefulness of alpha-fetoprotein assay in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has decreased. The aim of our study was to evaluate the best cut-off value for serum alpha-fetoprotein to discriminate between liver cirrhosis (LC) and HCC and the factors influencing levels in a Sicilian population. Three hundred and seventy-two patients with LC and 197 with HCC-associated LC were studied. The etiology was: HCV in 288 cases (77.4%) of LC and 147 cases (75%) of HCC HBV in 31 cases (8.3%) of LC and 15 cases (7.6%) of HCC
