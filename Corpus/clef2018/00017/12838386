Endovascular treatment of giant splenic aneurysm that developed after liver transplantation. Splenic artery aneurysms (SAAs) are not uncommon in patients with portal hypertension. They are usually diagnosed in preliminary examinations prior to orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and are treated surgically at the time of transplantation. In our case, the patient developed a giant SAA after liver transplantation. This was detected incidentally upon routine ultrasound follow-up, and the diagnosis was confirmed on magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. The patient was treated by endovascular embolization because it is believed that this minimally invasive approach is beneficial in an immunocompromised patient following OLT. After coil embolization, to achieve complete and immediate blood flow exclusion of the sac, it was decided to inject some glue ( N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate) directly into the aneurysm. The aneurysm was successfully obliterated. To the best of our knowledge the use of cyanoacrylate glue in an SSA has never been reported.
