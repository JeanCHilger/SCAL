Transcatheter hepatic arteriography combined with ultrasound in the diagnosis of space occupying lesions. Super-selective hepatic arteriography was performed in 40 patients with liver neoplasma by injecting H2O2. The final diagnosis were as follows: 23 hepatic cases of carcinoma, 14 patients had cavernous hemangioma, 1 case of hepato-cirrhosis and 2 cases excluding neoplasma. According the contrast, the entrance of H2O2 into neoplasma could be divided into four types: rapid-filling, middle speed-filling, low speed-filling, enclostic but no entering. The acoustic contrast technique, pathological basis, and qualitative diagnosis were also discussed.
