Modification of the liver resection technique with radiofrequency coagulation. Since the introduction of liver resection, intraoperative blood loss is considered to be a major risk factor for perioperative morbidity and mortality. Radiofrequency energy-an established technique for in situ ablation-was used to facilitate liver resection by creating a nearly bloodless tissue plane.After thorough manual and sonographic exploration of the liver, the planned and marked resection plane was coagulated by radiofrequency and then transected. Seven patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma were operated on employing this technique.A nearly bloodless transection of the parenchyma could be achieved in all cases. Only two patients received blood transfusions: one due to a low preoperative hemoglobin and one due to extended additional abdominal surgery. Procedure-related complications included one case of a second-degree burn to the thigh and one case of postoperative bile leakage requiring hemihepatectomy.Radiofrequency-assisted resection offers a valuable additional option in liver surgery, especially in patients with an increased risk of intraoperative bleeding (cirrhosis, coagulopathy).
