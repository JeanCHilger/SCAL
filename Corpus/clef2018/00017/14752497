Hepatocellular carcinoma with invasion into right cardiac cavities: report of a case and literature review. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a tumor that rarely invades the inferior vena cava and right heart. We describe the case of a 63-year-old man with jaundice and a history of cryptogenic hepatic cirrhosis with diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. He was referred to the echocardiography laboratory for sudden dyspnea and suggestion of pulmonary thromboembolism. Echocardiographic study reported a mass in the right atrium proceeding from the inferior vena cava.
