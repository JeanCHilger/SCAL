Laparoscopic cholecystectomy of cirrhotic patients. In a period of 9 years in our clinic were performed 18 laparoscopic cholecystectomies (1.5%) at cirrhotic patients. In most of the cases (16) cirrhosis was diagnosed intraoperative. Retrospective, suggestive for a chronic hepatic disease were: patient history (9 cases), transaminases elevations (all cases), low platelet number (8 cases) and some echographic findings (6 cases). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was difficult in all cases. Conversion to open surgery was necessary in one case because of an important hemorrhage from gallbladder bed. No diseases were recorded. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is proven as a secure operation and with incontestable advantages comparing to open surgery.
