Clinical, biochemical and imaging-verified regression of hepatitis B-induced cirrhosis. In a 65-year-old patient with ascites, jaundice and positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the histological diagnosis of cirrhosis with knodell total score 13 was made in 1995. The patient was followed up for 8 years. Spontaneous seroconversion of HBsAg appeared. Except for slight hyperbilirubinemia, all pathologic, clinical laboratory data remained normal from the second year of diagnosis till 8 years of follow-up. In the last follow up, the markers of liver fibrosis were all normal. The portal vein diameter was decreased and the esophageal varices disappeared. The imaging of liver by sonography and CT-scan did not reveal any abnormality.
