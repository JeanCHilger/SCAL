Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis: comparison of sonographic findings in Brazilian and Sudanese patients--correlation of sonographic findings with clinical symptoms. Twenty-seven Brazilian and 32 Sudanese patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis from areas where the disease is endemic were examined with ultrasound (US). Hyperechoic periportal areas indicating periportal fibrosis (PPF) were present in all patients irrespective of their origin. Nonspecific findings were splenomegaly (all patients), gallbladder wall thickening (81% and 92%, respectively, in Brazilian and Sudanese patients), portal vein (74% and 87%, respectively) and splenic vein (59% and 70%, respectively) enlargement, and portosystemic vascular shunts (62% and 61%, respectively). The hepatic alterations were congruent and the frequency of their occurrence was similar in both patient groups. With a standardized grading system, it was shown that grade of PPF was significantly correlated with a history of bleeding from endoscopically proved esophageal varices and with distention of the portal vein as measured with US. It was concluded that sonographic grading may be used in patients with hepatosplenic Schistosoma mansoni infection who originate from completely different endemic areas.
