Combined devascularization and proximal splenorenal shunt: is this a better option than either procedure alone? We aimed to determine the rationality of pericardial devascularization (PCDV) plus proximal splenorenal shunt (PSRS) for cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension with variceal bleeding, using a duplex sonography study of the effects of the different surgical procedures (PCDV, PSRS, and PCDV + PSRS) on the hemodynamics of the portal system.Ninety-nine patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension and a history of bleeding esophageal varices were studied. These patients were divided into three groups (PSRS group, PCDV group, and PCDV + PSRS group). The hemodynamic parameters of the portal systems of all patients were measured by Doppler color-flow imaging perioperatively.In the PSRS group, the postoperative portal venous flow (PVF) and free portal pressure (FPP) decreased by 57 +/- 9% and 52 +/- 5%, respectively (P < 0.01). In the PCDV group, the postoperative PVF lessened by 8 +/- 5% (P > 0.05), and the postoperative FPP was reduced by 19 +/- 7% (P < 0.05). In the PCDV + PSRS group, the postoperative PVF and FPP were lowered by 36 +/- 8% and 34 +/- 10%, respectively (P < 0.05). The postoperative decreases of PVF and FPP in the PCDV + PSRS group were between those of the PSRS and PCDV groups. The differences among these groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05).Combined devascularization and splenorenal shunt (PCDV + PSRS) significantly decreases portal venous flow and portal pressure, as well as maintaining hepatopedal flow, thus entailing fewer complications compared to either PCDV or PSRS.
