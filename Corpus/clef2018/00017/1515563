Duplex-Doppler assessment of cirrhosis in patients with chronic compensated liver disease. Portal venous flow velocity (PFV) was measured with duplex-Doppler equipment in 50 normal subjects and in 117 patients with suspected chronic liver disease who showed no evidence of decompensation such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice or oesophageal bleeding. All the patients underwent percutaneous liver biopsy which demonstrated non-cirrhotic liver disease in 58 cases (CH-patients: steatosis 8, persistent chronic hepatitis 8, active chronic hepatitis 42) and liver cirrhosis in the other 59 cases (LC-patients). The normal subjects and the CH-patients had similar values of max-PFV and mean-PFV (max-PFV 26.7 +/- 3.2 and 25.7 +/- 3.4 cm/s respectively mean-PFV 22.9 +/- 2.8 and 22.4 +/- 3.8 cm/s respectively). The LC-patients' values (max-PFV 19.3 +/- 3.5
