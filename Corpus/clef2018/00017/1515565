Duplex-Doppler ultrasonography in the evaluation of cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension and in the analysis of their response to drugs. Sixteen patients (15 males, aged 48-70) affected by liver cirrhosis and oesophageal varices were subjected to duplex-Doppler ultrasonographic study (DDUS). Four patients (three with a portal thrombosis and one with a hepatofugal portal flow) were excluded from the subsequent pharmacological test. The twelve remaining patients took part in a double blind cross-over study that evaluated the variations of heart rate (HR), mean systemic arterial pressure (SAP), portal vein diameter (PVD), maximal and mean portal flow velocity (PFV) after the administration of either 40 mg of propranolol or placebo per os, on two consecutive days. Propranolol caused no significant variation in mean SAP and in PVD, whereas it reduced the HR from 67.7 +/- 8.0 to 58.4 +/- 7.0 beats/min (mean +/- s.d. P less than 0.001)
