Foscarnet therapy for congenital cytomegalovirus liver fibrosis following prenatal ascites. We report on an infant with multi-system disease including liver fibrosis, right microphthalmia with cataract, interstitial pneumonitis, and hyperechoic lesions in the basal ganglia and in the periventricular and thalamic regions. Prenatal ascites with hepatomegaly concomitantly with detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA in the amniotic fluid, following recurrent maternal CMV infection, had been shown. Although CMV culture and DNA detection were negative in the urine, the infant was given foscarnet because CMV infection was demonstrated in the liver by DNA detection and immunohistochemical staining. Favorable clinical outcome and absence of CMV in the liver were subsequently shown. Our case suggests that congenital CMV disease following maternal recurrence may not be associated with disseminated infection but only with intracellular infection. The diagnosis should therefore be based on CMV detection in the involved organs. Moreover, this is the first report on the possible efficacy and safety of foscarnet for therapy of immunocompetent infants with congenital CMV disease.
