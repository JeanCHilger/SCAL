Autoimmune cholangitis with vasculitic ulcers, rheumatoid arthritis and IgA glomerulonephritis. A 51-year-old woman was admitted because of relapsing episodes of fever and leg ulcers for 14 years. In addition, she had polyserositis, polyarthralgias and polyarthritides, renal failure with proteinuria and elevation of gamma-GT and alkaline phosphatase. The patient was in a reduced general condition and cachectic nutritional state. She had slight scleral icterus, the liver being palpable 5 cm under the costal margin, edema of the lower limbs and two ulcers at the right foot.Laboratory examinations revealed leukocytosis, anemia, elevation of cholestasis and inflammation parameters as well as renal failure. During a 24 hour collection period, a significant proteinuria was demonstrated. Immunoserologically, an ANA titer of 1:100 and a positive rheumatoid factor were found, ANCAs and AMAs were negative. On ultrasound, both kidneys exhibited a blurred pelvic parenchymal border. Thyroid ultrasound demonstrated parenchymal changes consistent with Hashimoto's disease. Ultrasound of the wrist revealed extensive arthritis with tendovaginitis. A renal biopsy revealed mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis.Due to serologically persistent cholestasis, a liver biopsy was performed which, together with negative AMAs, revealed the diagnosis of an autoimmune cholangitis (AIC AMA-negative primary-biliary cirrhosis (PBC)). In addition, the patient presented with rheumatoid arthritis, polyserositis, IgA glomerulonephritis, vasculitic leg ulcers and Hashimoto's thyreoiditis which were interpreted as extra-hepatic manifestations of the AIC. After initiation of high dosage corticosteroid therapy, rapid healing of the leg ulcers occurred. Therapy of the AIC consisted in ursodeoxycholic acid.The multitude of associated immunological phenomena in this patient resulted in a delay of the diagnosis. A AIC/PBC, however, should, always be considered in case of cholestasis.
