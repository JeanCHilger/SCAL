Complications after percutaneous saline-enhanced radiofrequency ablation of liver tumors: 3-year experience with 336 patients at a single center. Our objective was to report the complications that occurred in a large series of patients with primary or metastatic liver tumors treated with percutaneous saline-enhanced radiofrequency ablation under sonographic guidance at a single center during 3 years of experience.Between September 2000 and October 2003, 336 consecutive patients (221 men and 115 women age range, 44-78 yearsThe number of sessions performed was 375 (39 patients had two sessions). The number of patients with major complications, including death, was three (0.9%). The overall mortality rate was 0.3% (1/336). One patient died because of worsening liver decompensation. Two other major complications occurred. In one patient (0.3%), liver abscess and sepsis developed and were successfully treated with percutaneous sonography-guided needle (18-gauge) aspiration and IV antibiotics. Mild posttreatment ascites occurred in one patient (0.3%). One patient showed self-limiting subcutaneous cellulitis along the electrode-needle path that healed in 2 weeks. Fever lasting 1-3 days and pain lasting 12-24 hr were observed in 141 patients (42%) and 211 patients (63%), respectively. So far, no cutaneous or abdominal wall seeding has been observed clinically or sonographically.Radiofrequency ablation of liver tumors can be considered safe. Life-threatening acute liver failure can be considered a rare possible complication.
