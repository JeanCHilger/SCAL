Postprandial splanchnic haemodynamic changes in patients with liver cirrhosis and patent paraumbilical vein. The haemodynamic changes induced by a meal on collateral vessels in portal hypertensive cirrhotic patients are not well characterized. We aimed to study the postprandial modifications of splanchnic circulation in patients with a patent paraumbilical vein (PUV).We studied 10 cirrhotic patients with patent PUV and 10 matched cirrhotic patients without PUV, by using echo colour Doppler at baseline and 15, 30 and 45 min after a standard mixed liquid meal (400 ml 600 kcal). Calibre and blood flow velocities of the superior mesenteric artery, portal vein and PUV were obtainedWe observed a postprandial splanchnic hyperaemia (superior mesenteric artery and portal vein blood flow increased after the meal in both groups ANOVA P < 0.05), with no changes of hepatic impedance. In PUV patients, PUV constricted significantly postprandially, maximally at 30 min (calibre -17.5 +/- 7.0%PUV constricts after the meal, and this vasoconstriction is associated with an increase of splenic impedance which may indicate the postprandial increase of portal pressure observed in cirrhosis. The increase in postprandial portal liver perfusion in the PUV group is allowed by a paradox constriction of the collateral vessel.
