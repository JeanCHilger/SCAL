Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in Asian Indians is neither associated with iron overload nor with HFE gene mutations. The pathogenesis of occurrence of liver inflammation and fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is not completely understood. Other than insulin resistance, iron abnormalities have been thought to be one of the triggering factors. Therefore, our aim was to study the role of iron abnormalities and HFE gene mutations in patients with NASH.Thirty-one patients of NASH diagnosed on the basis of clinical examination biochemistry, ultrasonography and liver biopsy (n = 14) were included in the study. Serum iron parameters (n = 23) (iron, ferritin, total iron-binding capacity and transferrin saturation), Perls' iron staining on liver biopsies (n = 14) and HFE gene mutations (C282Y and H63D) (n = 16) were studied in these patients. The association between iron staining, necroinflammatory activity and fibrosis stage on liver biopsies was also determined.Elevated serum iron, ferritin and transferrin saturation above 55% were observed in 4.3% of patients. On histology, 71% of the patients had negative iron staining, 21.4% had 1+ staining, 7.2% had 2+ staining and none had 3+ or 4+ staining. There was no association between the degree of iron staining and necroinflammatory activity (P = 0.55) and fibrosis stage (P = 0.09) on histology. None of the patients had C282Y HFE gene mutation and four patients (25%) were found to be heterozygotes for H63D gene mutation.Our study does not favor iron overload and HFE gene mutations as major factors in the pathogenesis of NASH in Asian Indians.
