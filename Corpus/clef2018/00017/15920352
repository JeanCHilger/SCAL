Primary sclerosing cholangitis and hepatitis C virus infection. Two cases of primary sclerosing cholangitis with hepatic C virus infection in a 62-year-old man and a 60-year-old woman are presented. The infection in the man was eradicated with interferon therapy in 1992. Seven years thereafter, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed a diffuse 2.5-cm-long stenotic lesion in the common bile duct which was consequently resected. Histological examination of the resected specimen revealed proliferation of epithelial cells, plasma cell infiltration, and fibrosis in the submucosal layer of the common bile duct. The human leukocyte antigen DR loci were 2 and 9. In the woman, a 6-month course of interferon therapy in 1992 failed to eradicate the infection. Cholangiography in 1999 revealed multiple narrowings and dilatations of intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. Ultrasound guided biopsy of the liver in 1992 had revealed onionskin lesions around the bile duct epithelium in the portal tract. The human leukocyte antigen DR locus was 2. From these findings, the 2 cases were diagnosed as primary sclerosing cholangitis. Further studies may provide insights into the relation between the pathogenesis of the disease and the infection.
