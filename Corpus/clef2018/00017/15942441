Diagnosis of liver cirrhosis: a comparison of modified ultrasound and laparoscopy in 100 consecutive patients. Liver cirrhosis, the final stage of chronic liver disease, is characterized by an unfavorable prognosis and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and also requires an appropriate management. Laparoscopy, the gold standard in the diagnosis of cirrhosis, is hampered by its invasiveness. Therefore, a noninvasive method for diagnosing liver cirrhosis would be of great benefit.A consecutive series of 100 patients, sent to our gastroenterological unit for diagnostic laparoscopy, underwent a standardized ultrasonographic examination prior to laparoscopy.Conventional ultrasonographic examination revealed a sensitivity of 55% and a specificity of 86% in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. Considering the assessment of the transmission of heart pulsation on the liver surface, the corresponding values improved by increasing to 85% and 93%.Evaluating the transmission of heart pulsation on the liver surface improves the ability of ultrasound to diagnose liver cirrhosis therefore, it should be an integral part of routine sonographic examination of the liver.
