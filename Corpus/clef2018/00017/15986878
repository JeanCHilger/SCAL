Portal venous flow pattern as a useful tool for predicting esophageal varix bleeding in cirrhotic patients. This study aimed to evaluate whether (1) the portal venous flow pattern determined by color Doppler sonography could be related to the clinical severity of liver cirrhosis and (2) whether the flow patterns differ between patients with bleeding and nonbleeding esophageal varices. One hundred twenty-nine cirrhotic patients and 60 noncirrhotic healthy controls were enrolled after endoscopic survey for the presence of esophageal varices. Each patient received color Doppler echography to define the pattern of blood flow direction as hepatopetal or nonhepatopetal (hepatofugal, turbulence, and bidirection) in type. The patients with esophageal varices were further categorized into two groups: with recent bleeding (BEV n = 99) and without recent bleeding (NBEV
