Intraoperative echography as an aid in the therapy of Caroli's disease. A case report. Congenital polycystic dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary ways (Caroli's disease) is a rare disease. The "pure" type and the one associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis are accepted. Although the current exploration methods, its diagnosis is rare before the surgical procedure. Treatment of the diffuse pure types and the ones associated with hepatic fibrosis is difficult and the outcome is bad. A case of the less frequent type is communicated, in which, as a novelty, intrasurgical echography was used in its treatment.
