Efficacy and safety of azosemide in patients with edema and ascites. To assess the efficacy and safety of azosemide in patients with edema and ascites.A multicentral, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was applied. All 223 patients (cardiac edema 92, hepatogenic edema 63, renal edema 68) were randomized to azoesmide and furosemide group, and all patients were treated for 2 weeks. Patients with cardiac or renal edema took azosemide (30 mg/d) or furosemide (20 mg/d) patients with hepatogenic edema took azosemide (60 mg/d) or furosemide (40 mg/d). The dosage were adjusted to azosemide 60 mg/d (cardiac, renal edema), 90 mg (hepatogeic edema)At the end of the study, the weight changes were (2.87+/-3.10) kg and (2.81 +/-2.84) kg the total effective rate of edema lessen was 89.19% and 89.81%Azosemide could effectively lessen edema, improve heart function and decrease ascites√ªit is well tolerated and is particularly useful for the diuretic treatment.
