Analysis of different contrast enhancement patterns after microbubble-based contrast agent injection in liver hemangiomas with atypical appearance on baseline scan. We describe different possible enhancement patterns in liver hemangiomas with atypical appearance on baseline ultrasound after microbubble-based contrast agent injection.From a series of 253 consecutive lesions that were indeterminate on baseline ultrasound and then scanned after injection of air-filled microbubble contrast agent, 65 focal liver lesions were retrospectively selected on the basis of a diagnosis of liver hemangioma on multiphase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (n = 23), magnetic resonance imaging (n = 27), or histology (n = 15). Each lesion was scanned during arterial phase (30 s after microbubble injection) and late phase (5 min after injection). On-site sonologists performed retrospective assessment of contrast-enhancement patterns by consensus.Centripetal fill-in preceded (n = 50) or not preceded (n = 3) by peripheral nodular/rim-like enhancement was the prevalently observed contrast-enhancement pattern, equivalent to the typical enhancement pattern of liver hemangiomas on contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. In the remaining lesions, additional enhancement patterns (diffuse contrast enhancement with rapid fill-in and a late hyper-isoechoic appearance, n = 6 peripheral nodular enhancement with a late hypoechoic appearance, n = 3Different contrast-enhancement patterns are possible in atypical liver hemangiomas after microbubble injection. Typical centripetal fill-in is the prevalent pattern and its evidence allows diagnosis.
