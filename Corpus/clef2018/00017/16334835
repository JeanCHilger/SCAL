Hepatic transit time of ultrasound contrast in biopsy characterized liver disease. To study the hepatic transit time of an ultrasound contrast agent in patients with liver disease, and to evaluate the mechanism(s) of the well-established shorter cubital vein to hepatic vein transit time in cirrhosis.Thirty-four patients scheduled for Menghini liver biopsy were studied by ultrasound after injection of 2.5 g Levovist (Schering, Berlin, Germany) into an arm vein. The time from injection until the first appearance of contrast echoes in the hepatic artery and hepatic veins was registered. Hepatic transit time was the difference between the two.Biopsy showed cirrhosis in 9 patients, other diffuse hepatic pathology in 23 patients, and normal liver in 2 patients. Mean hepatic vein arrival time was earlier in cirrhosis than in other liver disease (19.4 s versus 26.0 s P = 0.013), and hepatic transit time was shorter (6.6 s versus 11.6 sHepatic transit time measurement could not be used to distinguish between cirrhosis and other hepatic pathology, but a transit time = 10 s excluded cirrhosis. The earlier hepatic vein arrival time in cirrhosis is apparently mainly caused by intrahepatic shunting rather than by early arrival of contrast to the liver.
