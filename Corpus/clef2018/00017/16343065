Noninvasive assessment of liver steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation in chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Duplex-Doppler ultrasound is a noninvasive method for the assessment of hepatic hemodynamics beyond conventional gray-scale imaging. The clinical value of the method for the grading and staging of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and the prediction of hepatic steatosis still has to be determined. This study aimed to compare Duplex-Doppler and ultrasound with the histologic staging and the estimation of hepatic steatosis in chronic HCV infection.One hundred and nineteen consecutive patients with chronic HCV infection underwent both liver biopsy and ultrasound with Duplex-Doppler. Maximum portal venous blood flow velocity, portal venous flow undulation, hepatic venous flow pattern and spleen size were assessed and compared with histologic findings. Histologic grading and staging was performed according to the modified HAI and hepatic steatosis was estimated.Doppler ultrasound was unable to discriminate between different degrees of fibrosis. Sensitivity/specificity of portal venous flow and undulations for the diagnosis of hepatic cirrhosis was 74.5%/53% and 76.5%/100%. The PPV and NPV of reduced undulations was 100% and 96.2%. Mono- or biphasic hepatic venous flow indicated advanced hepatic steatosis (sensitivity 88.2%, specificity 74.5%, PPV 36.6%, NPV 97.5%). Spleen size was significantly enlarged both in patients with cirrhosis and steatosis.Although Duplex-Doppler of the portal and hepatic veins is not a substitute for histologic grading and staging, portal vein undulations can predict liver cirrhosis with considerable accuracy. Moreover, triphasic patterns of hepatic venous flow virtually exclude significant fatty liver disease. Additional studies should perform intraindividual follow-up investigations to further define the role of Duplex-Doppler ultrasound in chronic HCV infection.
