The use of a composite graft of iliac artery and inferior mesenteric vein in liver transplantation. Innovation may be required for satisfactory arterial reconstruction in liver transplantation, particularly when the vessels obtained from the donor are inadequate. We have used a composite graft of donor iliac artery and recipient inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) between the infrarenal aorta and donor hepatic artery. Postoperative liver function was satisfactory, with normal daily duplex ultrasound scans for the first 2 weeks. At 4 years follow up, graft function is normal, a duplex ultrasound scan shows normal arterial flow and no dilatation of the composite graft, and a magnetic resonance angiogram reveals no evidence of dilatation or thrombosis of the composite graft. This is one of the few reported cases in which a composite graft has been used to arterialize the allograft in liver transplantation. A composite graft of iliac artery and IMV provided a satisfactory outcome in this patient and may be a valuable addition to the arterial grafts available to the liver transplant surgeon.
