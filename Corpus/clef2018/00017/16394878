Management of patients with cirrhosis in Southern California: results of a practitioner survey. Cirrhosis is an important medical and public health concern. A paucity of data exists on how patients with cirrhosis are managed. Our aims were to determine how cirrhosis is managed and whether current management practices follow established recommendations.A questionnaire was mailed to Southern California Society of Gastroenterology members. Most had practiced for more than 15 years (67%) in a private practice setting (69%). Proportions of physicians who followed established guidelines versus those who had not were compared using chi test.Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, and pneumococcus vaccinations were recommended by most respondents. Ninety-one percent of respondents routinely screened patients for hepatocellular carcinoma. A significantly greater proportion of respondents screened for hepatocellular carcinoma using either alpha-fetoprotein or ultrasound every 6 months (P < 0.05). Seventy-six percent recommended antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with prior spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, whereas less than half recommended prophylaxis in patients with ascitic protein fluid <1 g/dL, current variceal bleed, and those on the liver transplant list. Sixty-seven percent of respondents performed screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy upon diagnosis of cirrhosis. Most respondents did not recommend repeating endoscopy in 1 to 2 years if a patient was found to have small varices (P < 0.05), and would repeat an endoscopy if large varices were found (P < 0.05).The management of patients with cirrhosis in the community varied and did not always conform to established guidelines. These results should be confirmed in a larger group of physicians, and the rationales for physicians accepting or rejecting established guidelines should be further assessed.
