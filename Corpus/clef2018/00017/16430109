Diagnostics and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Recommendations of the Portal Hypertension Working Group of the Czech Hepatology Society and the J.E. Purkinje Czech Medical Society . Hepatocellular carcionma (HCC) is almost exclusively associated with liver cirrhosis as a significant HCC risk marker in advanced countries. Applicable therapy depends on early diagnosis, and risk patients should be screened for the presence of HCC on a regular basis. Liver ultrasound and determination of alpha-fetoprotein serum levels (AFP) are the screening methods used. Spiral CT is the most often used method for HCC staging. Non-invasive methods may under certain circumstances replace aimed biopsy. There are 3 basic curative therapies for the early stage of HCC: liver transplantation, surgical resection and different methods of local destruction of tumour (i.e., ethanolisation, thermoablation, etc.). Patients at medium stage of HCC may profit from chemoembolisation. Current available systemic chemotherapy is ineffective. Patients with advanced HCC are treated symptomatically. Patient survival prognosis after the application of one of the above treatment methods may be similar with that for HCC free cirrhosis patients, however, prognosis for advanced HCC patients is bad, with survival period from one to nine months.
