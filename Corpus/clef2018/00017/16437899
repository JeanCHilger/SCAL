Interstitial laser treatment of small hepatocarcinoma on cirrhosis without anesthesia: feasibility study. We evaluated if interstitial laser photocoagulation (ILP) under ultrasound (US) guidance of intraparenchymal small HCC (<2 cm) in cirrhosis can be safely and effectively performed without any anesthesia.Twelve cirrhotic patients with 14 nodules of HCC (diameter 1.2-2.0 cm mean: 1.7) underwent ILP. All procedures were performed without local or general anesthesia. Necrosis of the nodules was evaluated with triphasic contrast-enhanced CT.Post-treatment CT showed complete necrosis in all cases. Pain occurred in 5 patients during the treatment was treated with iv pain-killer and only in 1 case the procedure was stopped before the scheduled time. No major complication occurred.ILP under US guidance is feasible without any anesthesia in patients with small intraparenchymal HCC.
