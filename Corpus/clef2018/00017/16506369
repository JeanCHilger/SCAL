Noninvasive quantitative testing of liver function using ultrasonography in patients with cirrhosis. Chronic liver disease is characterized by progressive hepatic fibrosis and changes in hepatic hemodynamics. Although there are sufficient hemodynamic ultrasonography data about patients with liver cirrhosis, reports of combinations of these data are insufficient. This study aimed to address the possibility of noninvasive diagnosis for the degree of hepatic fibrosis by evaluating the ultrasonography score, HCI (Hepatic Circulation Index), A/P (The peak velocity of hepatic artery/The peak velocity of portal vein), and CAT (hepatic vein circulation time) in patients with cirrhosis.53 cirrhosis patients underwent ultrasonographically-guided liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of cirrhosis. Values were correlated with the ultrasonography score, blood fibrosis makers, metabolic liver function tests and Child-Pugh classification.53 patients participated in this study. The fibrosis stage of a total of 53 patients was > or = S2 22.6% of the patients (n= 12) had cirrhosis of Child-Pugh grade A, 41.5% of grade B (n=22) and 35.9% of grade C (n=19). Liver function showed a steady decrease from Child-Pugh grade A to grade B and to grade C. In contrast, ultrasonography score was significantly increased in Child-Pugh grade A, B and C patients compared to healthy controls. Differences between the three Child grades were significant.Ultrasonography score and A/P correlated with Child-Pugh grades and HCI, CAT correlated inversely with Child-Pugh grades so they may be useful tools to predict prognosis or complications in cirrhosis.
