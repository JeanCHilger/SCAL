Residual fibrous formations after hydatidectomy and their clinical significance. After radical hydatidectomies in the organ still remains a fibrous cyst capsule in which the maternal chitinous membrane has signs of destruction (the second phase of vital activity). Germinal elements capable to transform in cyst-satellites can be introduced into the fibrous cyst capsule. Most cyst-satellites while growing break inside the initial cyst. The residual fibrous cyst capsule which is in the second phase should be considered as a risk factor of recurrence and so hydatidectomy must be followed by intraoperative ultrasound scanning of the peri-parasitogenic space for a detection of cyst-satellites as well as by anti-recurrence courses of medication at the postoperative period. In the USI the area of localization of the residual fibrous capsule is visualized as polymorphous focal structures which can be classified as: an unechogenic focus (a residual cavity) heterogeneity of the echo-structure with minimal unechogenic foci
