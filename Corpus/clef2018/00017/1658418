Tumor hemodynamics in hepatic nodules associated with liver cirrhosis: relationship between cancer progression and tumor hemodynamic change. Tumor hemodynamics including arterial vascularity (AV) and portal perfusion (PP) were evaluated in histologically confirmed 55 hepatic nodules associated with cirrhosis using ultrasonographic (US) angiography during intraarterial carbon dioxide microbubbles injection and CT during arterial portography. Tumor hemodynamic patterns were classified into 6 types as follows: Type I (n = 10): PP (+), AV (hypo) Type I' (n = 2): PP (+), AV (iso)
