Hepatocellular carcinoma--retrospective analysis. The etiologic relationship of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and chronic hepatitis B viral infection was proved clinically, epidemiologically, virologically, serologically and by other methods. Together with viruses, carcinogenesis is promoted by faster recovery of hepatocytes (liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, etc.). We have discovered 103 HCC in the period of 21 years. There were 81 men and 22 women they were in the sixth and seventh decade of life in 90% of cases. Liver cirrhosis was also confirmed in 55% of cases and chronic hepatitis in 19%, namely, in 74% of patients HCC has developed on the changed liver. Fifty three patients were HBsAg positive (51.45%). The ultrasound and determination of alpha-feto proteins proved to be most valuable. It is a slow growing tumour and by its early detection surgical treatment is possible.
