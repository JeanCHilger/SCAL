Clinical profile: prognostic index in hepatocellular carcinoma. A clinical study and follow-up of 77 patients (63 males and 14 females) with hepatocellular carcinoma with age range from 22 to 80 years were collected from the Institute of Post Graduate Medicine and Research and eight private hospitals from Dhaka City. Past history of transfusion was present in 16 (20.8%), Jaundice in 20 (26%) and 13 (16.9%) patients had associated cirrhosis. HBs Ag was positive in 17 (33.33%) out of 51 patients and liver ultrasound suggested hypoechogenic lesion in 44 (57.2%) patients. CT was performed in 7 (9.1%) and in one MRI was done. Eight (50%) out of 16 patients had alphafetoprotein ranging from 1000-12000 ng/ml. Space occupying lesion was detected in 25 (71.4%) out of 35 cases by isotope scan and needle biopsy was confirmatory in 25 (32.5%). Commonest presentations were abdominal lump (96.2%), weakness (79.3%), weight loss (74%), and loss of appetite (78%). Fifty six (72.2%) patients were followed weekly till death (2.9 +/- 2.4 months). The mean survival was higher under 30 years (5.9 +/- 3.7 months P less than 0.05). Serum bilirubin above 5 mg/dl with HCC also had poor prognosis (1.6 +/- 0.8 months
