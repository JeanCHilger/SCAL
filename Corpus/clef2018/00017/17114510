Prevalence and sonographic detection of Chilaiditi's sign in cirrhotic patients without ascites. Although Chilaiditi's sign is uncommon, its recognition is mandatory to avoid intestinal injury during percutaneous transhepatic procedures. Our purpose was to investigate the prevalence of Chilaiditi's sign in cirrhotic patients without ascites and to review the diagnostic ability of sonography to detect this rare abnormality.The prevalence of Chilaiditi's sign was much higher in cirrhotic patients without ascites than in the general population. A precise diagnosis of Chilaiditi's sign was possible using sonography. Percutaneous transhepatic procedures can be performed safely if a route that avoids the intestine is found.
