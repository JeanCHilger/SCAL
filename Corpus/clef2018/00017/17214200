Comparative study between different diagnostic techniques in huge splenomegaly cases in El-Minia Province. Fifty four patients presenting by huge splenomegaly were admitted to Tropical Medicine Department, El-Minia University Hospital. Tissue biopsy revealed pure bilharziasis due to S. hematobium in 10 (19%) cases, liver cirrhosis in 23 (42%), mixed schistosomiasis and cirrhosis in 8 (15%), hepatoma in 3 (6%), lymphoma in 6 (11%) and hematological diseases in the form of chronic myeloid leukemia in 2 (3.5%) and thalassemia major in 2 (3.5%) cases. The sensitivity and specificity of abdominal ultrasonography was 100% and 97% in cases of schistosomiasis, 100% and 100% in cases of hepatoma, 87% and 100% in cases of liver cirrhosis, 33% and 100% in cases of lymphoma respectively. There was a positive significant correlation between endoscopic variceal grading, portal vein diameter, splenic vein diameter, size of the spleen and the grading of the portal tract thickenings. The pathological and ultrasonographic diagnosis was the same in 38 (70%) cases. Splenogram was characteristic but not diagnostic in cases of schistosomiasis and liver cirrhosis. It was diagnostic and similar to peripheral blood picture in the 2 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia and was normal in cases of thalassemia major. Splenic aspiration was able to diagnose all cases of lymphomas. It can be considered as a useful adjunct to the usual diagnostic procedures, both in staging and follow up, especially in cases presenting only by splenomegaly.
