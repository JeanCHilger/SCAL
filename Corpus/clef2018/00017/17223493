Non-invasive diagnosis of cirrhosis and the natural history of its complications. Several methods have been studied in the attempt to reach a diagnosis of cirrhosis by non-invasive means. Although abdominal ultrasound can detect the hepatic and extra-hepatic changes consistent with cirrhosis, its ability to distinguish chronic hepatitis from compensated cirrhosis is limited. Serum markers can rule in or rule out fibrosis in up to 35% of patients but, in individual patients, cannot differentiate the stages of fibrosis reliably. Transient elastography (Fibroscan) might be of value for the non-invasive diagnosis of cirrhosis however, its reproducibility needs to be further validated. Cirrhosis can be divided into 4 stages: stage 1, no varices, no ascites
