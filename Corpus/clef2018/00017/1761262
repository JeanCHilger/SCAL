Diagnosis of gastroenterologic diseases with sonography. Part 1: Principles--ultrasound diagnosis of diffuse and local liver damage. Ultrasonography has now become an integral part of the gastroenterological diagnostic work-up and treatment. In some clinical problems it may be employed as the sole procedure, for example in the diagnostic evaluation of gallstones, for measuring the size of the liver and spleen, or in the detection of free fluid within the peritoneal cavity. Among the diffuse lesions of the liver, macronodular cirrhosis and typical forms of fatty liver can be diagnosed ultrasonographically, while the majority of such diffuse changes are not amendable to ultrasonographic evaluation. Cystic lesions of the liver are often diagnosable with ultrasonography, while many circumscribed solid lesions, such as metastases or focal-nodular hyperplasia, pose a differential diagnostic problem.
