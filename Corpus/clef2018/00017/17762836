Imaging nodules within cirrhotic liver: how do I do it?. Cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease characterized by the presence of diffuse parenchymal necrosis, reactive fibrosis and nodular regeneration. These regenerative nodules may evolve into dysplastic nodules and finally nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Improved survival of cirrhotic patients with HCC depends on eligibility to liver transplantation. The purpose of this paper is to review the imaging features of liver nodules within cirrhotic liver and to propose the imaging strategies when considering the possibility of liver transplantation.
