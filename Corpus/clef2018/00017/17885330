Preliminary experience with patch-enlarged brachial artery for hemodialysis access. The patency of patch-enlarged (capsule-shaped) brachial arteries for long-term hemodialysis access was evaluated retrospectively. Twelve brachial arteries were patched with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts (standard wall thickness), making 1 x 2 cm aneurysms proximal to the elbow joints in 10 patients (six men with six patches, four women with six patches patient age: 53 to 76 years, mean age +/- SD: 65.4 +/- 8.5 years) between September 2001 and April 2002. Ten patches were needled for each hemodialysis session as blood-drawing ports. The port's 1-year primary patency rate was 90%, 2-year patency was 70%, and 3-year patency was 70%. Two patches were needled in each hemodialysis session for dialyzed blood infusion access
