The diagnostic value of quantitative Doppler ultrasound signal analysis in diagnosis of postoperative organ dysfunction following orthotopic liver transplantation. As hepatic transplantation becomes more successful, there is increasing demand on noninvasive methods for studying graft dysfunction during the postoperative period. Duplexsonography now is a routine investigation with the possibility of quantitative description of changes in hepatic blood flow during graft dysfunction. Serial quantitative doppler measurements of hepatic artery, portal vein and hepatic veins were obtained in 20 adult patients during hospitalisation after transplantation and retrospective correlated to clinical datas. The resistive index of hepatic artery was maximal elevated in the initial period after graft reperfusion. There was no correlation with acute rejection. The angle independent damping index (minimum frequency shift/maximum frequency shift) calculated for portal- and hepatic vein showed significant changes during acute rejection, chronic rejection and cholangitis.
