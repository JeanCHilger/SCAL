Abnormality of the hepatic vein waveforms in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension and its prognostic implications. We investigated the prognostic significance of changes in the Doppler hepatic vein (HV) waveforms in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension and the mechanisms of these changes.A total of 103 consecutive patients were included in this study and their HV waveforms were classified into four types: type I, triphasic waveform type II, biphasic waveformType I was observed in 34, type II in 40, type III in 23, and type IV in six patients. The 5-year survival rates were 90%, 89%, 41%, and 0% in type I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Five variables including the Child-Pugh score, albumin, bilirubin, ascites, and HV waveform significantly correlated with the survival in a univariate analysis. A multivariate analysis only identified the HV waveform (type III and IV) to be an independent prognostic value. Even in Child-Pugh class B patients, the 5-year survival rate for type III or IV was as poor as 26% in comparison to 92% for type I or II. In contrast, in Child-Pugh class C patients, the 5-year survival rate for type I or II was as good as 63% in comparison to 25% for type III or IV. Furthermore, the changes in HV waveforms correlated with the extent of hepatic fibrosis, the increase in portal perfusion per liver volume, or the decrease in portal vascular resistance.Analyzing the HV waveforms was thus found to be a simple method for accurately assessing the prognosis in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension.
