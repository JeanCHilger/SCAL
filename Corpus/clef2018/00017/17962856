Role of liver function and portal vein congestion index on rebleeding in cirrhotics after distal splenorenal shunt. Bleeding from esophagogastric varices is the worst and most lethal complication of cirrhotic portal hypertension. Distal splenorenal shunt (Warrens surgery) is used in the therapeutic of this patients, Child A and B, with rebleeding after clinical endoscopic therapy. The portal vein congestion index is elevated in cirrhotic portal hypertension and could predict rebleeding after Warrens surgery in these patients.To verify if the portal vein congestion index or liver function (Child-Pugh) at preoperative are predictive factors of rebleeding after Warrens surgery.Sixty-two cirrhotic patients were submitted to Warrens surgery at "Santa Casa" Medical School and Hospital - Liver and Portal Hypertension Unit, SÃ£o Paulo, SP, Brazil. Fifty-eight were analyzed for Child-Pugh class and 36 for portal vein congestion index, divided in two groups: with or without rebleeding and statistical analysis was performed.In the rebleeding group, 69% were Child B, with portal vein congestion index = 0.09. The group without rebleeding show us 62% patients Child A with portal vein congestion index = 0.076. The difference was significant for Child-Pugh class but not to portal vein congestion index.Portal vein congestion index was not predictive of rebleeding after Warrens surgery, but cirrhotics Child B have more chance to rebleed after this surgery than Child A.
