The echotextural characteristics for the diagnosis of the liver cirrhosis using the sonographic images. Various statistical parameters have been tried for the computer-aided diagnosis of the liver fibrosis. The region of interest (ROI) for the liver and spleen parenchymas have been chosen, and the hepatolienal textural contrast for each ultrasound (US) image has been examined. The selectively chosen textural parameters are linearly combined with the pre-determined coefficients to give the computer-aided diagnostic parameter for the liver fibrosis, whose final stage is named as cirrhosis. From the comparison with the clinical diagnosis it is suggested that the proposed calculation scheme using the textural parameters show the quite promising classification performance for the computer-aided diagnosis of the liver cirrhosis.
