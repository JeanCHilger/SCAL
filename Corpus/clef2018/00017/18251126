Experimental study on the relation between the noninvasive ultrasonography quantitative scoring system and the degree of the hepatic fibrosis. The fibrosis models were constructed in the experimental rats which underwent complex fibrosis models methods, and the aim was to assess the value of noninvasive ultrasonography quantitative scoring system in the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis using high-frequency ultrasonography unit.Thirty-five male rats were included in this study. The fibrosis models were constructed in the 35 experimental rats which underwent complex fibrosis models methods. Ultrasonography, serum fibrosis markers were submitted in week 0, week 2, week 4, and week 6, during the construction of fibrosis models, which were also detected with pathological diagnosis. Ultrasonography quantitative scoring system was used to discriminate the degree of hepatic fibrosis, and the results were compared with pathological diagnosis.The complex fibrosis models methods can be used to construct hepatic fibrosis model. The ultrasonography quantitative scoring system had a higher relativity to pathological stage (r=0.86), when it was combined with serum fibrosis markers, the sensitivity (96.5%) and specificity (95.8%) were increased.High-frequency ultrasonography appears to be an efficient tool allowing new possibilities to use this animal model, ultrasonography quantitative scoring system, especially when it was combined with CT, serum fibrosis markers, had a higher value in noninvasive quantitative diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis in longitudinal studies, which are much more powerful.
