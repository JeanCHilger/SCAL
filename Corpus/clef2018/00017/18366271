Portal and mesenteric thrombosis associated with protein S deficiency. liver cirrhosis is the main cause of portal thrombosis (PT), while hypercoagulability syndromes are rarely found as the etiology of PT. We report a case of portal and mesenteric thrombosis secondary to protein S deficiency.a 74-year-old woman was admitted with melena secondary to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She reported mild, diffuse abdominal pain in the last 2 weeks. Endoscopy revealed ruptured esophageal varices. Doppler ultrasonography and CT demonstrated a heterogeneous liver, splenomegaly and ascites, and complete non-occlusive PT involving the hilum and portal branches, as well as the superior mesenteric vein, with portosystemic collaterals. At this point a complete study for cirrhosis etiologies was negative, including a liver biopsy that showed nonspecific architectural changes secondary to diminished blood flow, which suggested non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. The search for hypercoagulability states determined a deficiency of S protein, with total pS = 107% and free pS = 56%. The patient was started on anticoagulant treatment and no other thrombotic events occurred.PT usually manifests without specific symptoms. The most common presentation is upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as occurred in our patient. Liver cirrhosis is one of the most frequent cause of PT. Up to 65% of these patients present an associated prothrombotic state, including protein S deficiency. Our case reminds us of the importance of a systematic search for hipercoagulability syndromes in patients with TP, even when the etiology can be conferred to liver cirrhosis.
