Usefulness of Doppler blood flow ultrasonography in diagnosis of liver diseases. The usefulness of Doppler blood flow ultrasonography in diagnosis of some liver diseases was investigated. Normal subjects and patients with AH and CPH had no blood flow signal on their abdominal wall and their femoral veins were normal. One (5%) of 20 patients with CAH was found to have blood flow signals on abdominal wall and the direction of the flow was normal, suggesting that collateral circulation has been established due to portal hypertension as a result of liver cirrhosis. 12 out of 20 cases of liver cirrhosis with no varices on abdominal wall had blood flow signals on their abdominal wall and the direction of the flow was normal. One case of Budd-Chiari syndrome with occlusion of hepatic vein and inferior vena cava showed blood flow signal on his abdominal wall and the direction of the flow was abnormal. One case of constrictive pericarditis showed abnormal blood flow in the femoral veins. In conclusion, this method is highly useful for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of portal hypertension of cirrhosis and Budd-Chiari syndrome. It is also of help for the diagnosis of pericarditis and some other vascular deformity.
