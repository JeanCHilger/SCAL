Liver cell adenomas and portosystemic shunt. We report the case of a young man who developed multiple liver cell adenomas 13 years after a mesentericocaval shunt. Radiological findings did not provide diagnosis. Histological findings of two biopsied nodules were compatible with liver cell adenoma. Our patient had no known risk factors for liver cell adenomas. We discuss the hypothesis that disturbed hepatic vascularisation could promote the development of liver cell adenomas.
