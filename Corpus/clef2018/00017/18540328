Acute renal failure in patients with liver cirrhosis--what to do? An update. A lot of patients suffering from liver cirrhosis show a decreased renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate. An impaired renal function is the result of complex e.g. hemodynamic disturbances, resulting of the chronic liver disease. This explains its disposition to renal dysfunction and the higher incidence of acute renal failure in liver cirrhosis. In the case of renal failure hepatorenal syndrome, apart from prerenal, renal and postrenal causes, should be included in the differential diagnosis especially when signs of portal hypertension are apparent regarding its high mortalityand fatal prognosis requiring an immediate therapeutically approach. Special attention must be due to preventive strategies to avoid renal deterioration. This includes simple steps e.g. a careful election of medication but also an adequate therapy of infection-associated complications in patients with liver cirrhosis.
