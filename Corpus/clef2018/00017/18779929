Focal liver lesions in cirrhosis: value of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography compared with Doppler ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein levels. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in characterising focal liver lesions in cirrhosis and to validate its use in lesions discovered during surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Between 2003 and 2006, 128 cirrhotic patients with focal liver lesions at baseline ultrasonography (US) were studied by power colour Doppler US (Doppler US) and CEUS. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were assessed in all patients. Fine-needle biopsy or other reference modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were used as the gold standard. The accuracy of baseline US, Doppler US, AFP levels, combined US and AFP levels and combined US, Doppler US and CEUS in characterising focal liver lesions was assessed. Diagnostic performance was compared using the McNemar test.A total of 207 focal liver lesions (101 benign and 106 malignant) were identified in 128 patients. CEUS sensitivity and specificity for lesion characterisation were 96.2% and 97.0%, respectively, whereas its positive and negative predictive values were 97.1% and 96.1%. CEUS accuracy was 96.6%, higher than that of US (72.0%), Doppler US (70.0%), AFP levels (65.7%), combined US and Doppler US (70.0%) and combined US and AFP levels (90.3%). The differences between US and CEUS were statistically significant (p<0.05).CEUS can characterise focal liver lesions with 96.6% accuracy, a value higher than US, Doppler US, AFP levels, combined US and AFP levels and combined US and Doppler US. CEUS should therefore be used to characterise focal liver lesions detected during HCC surveillance of cirrhotic patients.
