Frequency and histopathologic basis of hepatic surface nodularity in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. To determine the frequency and histopathologic basis of hepatic surface nodularity at imaging in patients with fulminant hepatic failure.The committee on human research approved this HIPAA-compliant study and waived written informed consent. Thirty-five consecutive patients [24 female [mean age, 38 years +/- 19 (standard deviation) range, 1-67 years] and 11 male [mean age, 29 years +/- 22Fifteen of 35 patients (43%) demonstrated hepatic surface nodularity at pretransplant imaging, none of whom had cirrhosis at histopathologic examination. One patient with a smooth liver surface had cirrhosis. Compared with those who had a smooth liver surface, patients with hepatic surface nodularity had a significantly greater proportion with the histopathologic finding of a combination of alternating foci of confluent regenerative nodules and necrosis (12 of 14 vs one of 19, P < .001), longer illness duration (31 days +/- 32 vs 13 days +/- 13, P = .029), and lower maximum liver biochemical indices.Hepatic surface nodularity is commonly seen at imaging in fulminant hepatic failure and usually reflects a combination of alternating foci of confluent regenerative nodules and necrosis this is important because an erroneous radiologic diagnosis of cirrhosis in this setting could adversely affect transplantation status.
