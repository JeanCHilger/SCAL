Usefulness of FibroScan for detection of early compensated liver cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B. It is difficult to differentiate early compensated cirrhosis from chronic hepatitis solely by clinical features. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) for detection of early compensated liver cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Ninety-one consecutive CHB patients who underwent liver biopsy (LB) and LSM were recruited. All patients did not fulfill the clinical criteria for cirrhosis. The cutoff of LSM for cirrhosis was 10.3 kPa.All patients were divided into either group A (cirrhosis) or group B (CHB) according to LB result. The median LSM values of groups A and B were 11.8 and 7.6 kPa, respectively (P < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of LSM in predicting cirrhosis were 0.59, 0.78, 0.68, and 0.72, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of LSM was 0.803, whereas the AUROCs of aspartate to alanine aminotransferase ratio (AAR) and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) were 0.488 and 0.723, respectively.LSM showed an acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting early compensated cirrhosis in CHB.
