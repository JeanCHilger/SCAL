Case of cardial varices rupture due to danaparoid sodium with portal venous thrombosis. A 54-year-old man had been admitted to Nara city hospital because of hematemesis and dyspnea caused by physical exertion, and was given a diagnosis of esophago-cardial varices and portal venous thrombosis. He was transferred to our hospital for further examinations and treatments. Ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) revealed the progression of portal venous thrombosis. Danaparoid sodium was administered to treat the portal vein thrombus. 5 days later, the patient was found to have hematemesis resulting from a cardial varices rupture. After endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) and endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) was performed, danaparoid sodium was administered for 2 weeks. After the treatment, portal vein thrombus had almost disappeared. Due to an increased risk of bleeding, cases of esophago-cardial varices with portal venous thrombosis must be treated with care. This is the first report of upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to danaparoid sodium. Danaparoid sodium must be carefully administered when patients have portal venous thrombosis with delicate varices.
