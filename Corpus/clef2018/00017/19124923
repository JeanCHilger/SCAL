Fibroscan and FibroTest/FibroMax to assess liver fibrosis/cirrhosis in patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection in Georgia. Although, liver biopsy is the gold standard in assessment of the degree of liver damage, the method has some limitations. For this reason, assessment of liver damage using non-invasive methods is currently an important topic in hepatology. The aim of the study was to evaluate liver fibrosis/cirrhosis using Transient Elastography and FibroTest/FibroMax in patients with chronic HCV and HBV infection in Georgia and to compare Fibroscan and FibroTest/FibroMax results. 252 patients were included in the study, among them 185 with chronic HCV infection and 67 with chronic HBV infection. These patients were investigated at the Georgian-French Joint Hepatology Clinic "Hepa", from December 2007 to November 2008. In patients with chronic HCV or HBV infection Fibroscan and Fibrotest/FibroMax results were correlated in 127 (68.6%) and 45 (67.2%) cases, respectively. Discordance in one degree of fibrosis stage was found in 36 (19.5%) patients with chronic HCV infection and in 14 (20.9%) patients with chronic HBV infection. Discordance in more then one degree of fibrosis stage was found in 22 (11.9%) and 8 (11.9%) cases. In patients with Fibroscan and Fibrotest/FibroMax concordant results liver biopsy might be avoided. Fibroscan and Fibrotest/Max appear to be very valuable methods for detecting early stages of fibrosis among patients with chronic HCV and HBV infection, allowing to avoid the progression of liver damage, as well as end-stage liver disease. These methods are easy to perform and therefore allows regular follow-up of the course of LF.
