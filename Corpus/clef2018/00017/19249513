Use of an esophageal echo-Doppler device during liver transplantation: preliminary report. Determination of cardiac output (CO) is crucial for perioperative monitoring of orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) recipients. A pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) has always been considered the "gold standard" of hemodynamic monitoring. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of a transesophageal echo-Doppler device (ED) as a minimally invasive device to measure CO in OLT. ED was compared with the standard PAC technique taking into account the disease severity of OLT recipients as defined by the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. We enrolled 42 cirrhotic patients scheduled for OLT 3 thermodilution CO measurements were taken by a PAC and the most recent ED measurement (CO(ED)) was also recorded. Paired measurements of CO were performed at standard times, unless there were additional clinical needs. Recipients were stratified into 3 groups according to MELD score: MELD score < or = 15 (14 patients) MELD score between 16 and 28 (17 patients)
