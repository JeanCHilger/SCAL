Spectrum and bleeding complications of sonographically guided interventions of the liver and pancreas. Sonographically guided fine-needle punctures (p.) are considered to be a low risk procedure. Interventions with needles with a larger diameter seem to cause more complications. In search of potential complications, we examined 1923 sonographically guided interventions of the liver and pancreas in a retrospective analysis.We examined the coherence of the kind of intervention and complications. We considered bleeding with a need for transfusion and/or a need for surgical treatment as complications. Diseases and medication increasing the probability of post-interventional bleeding were also detected.1923 sonographically guided interventions in the abdomen (1800 in the liver, 123 in the pancreas) were analyzed (n = 1696 diagnostic interventions, n = 227 therapeutic interventions). Needles with diameters > 1 mm were primarily used. Drainage and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (12 % of all interventions) were performed with devices with diameters between 2 - 3.96 mm. A need for transfusion was found in 8 / 1923 patients (0.4 %), predominantly in the first 24 h. There was no significant correlation between coagulation preventing drugs (heparin, NSAIDs, antiaggregants) and bleeding events. Patients who suffered from liver cirrhosis with a thromboplastin time of < 50 % had a higher risk of post-interventional bleeding than patients with liver cirrhosis and a thromboplastin time > 50 %. Furthermore, therapeutic interventions showed higher complication rates than diagnostic procedures.Severe bleeding complications with a need for transfusion in sonographically guided procedures are rare (0.4 %). Our results showed that liver cirrhosis with a low thromboplastin time (< 50 %) seems to be the most important risk factor for patients. Overall, sonographically guided interventions are safe and have low complication rates considering careful performance and contraindications.
