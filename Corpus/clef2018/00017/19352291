Detection of splenomegaly on Meckel's diverticulum scan. A 16-year-old boy was seen with the complaint of intermittent lower gastrointestinal bleeding and was referred for a radionuclide Meckelogram. Although Tc-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy failed to reveal heterotopic gastric mucosa, focal accumulation of radiotracer in a large area involving the left side of the abdomen and liver were seen. Both areas of activity cleared gradually, but the first one remained longer and based on its configuration, raised the possibility of splenomegaly. Further ultrasonographic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of splenomegaly, which was subsequently determined to be secondary to noncirrhotic portal fibrosis. The findings of radionuclide Meckelograms can be more than detecting heterotopic gastric mucosa.
