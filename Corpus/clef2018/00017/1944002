Long-term prognosis of patients with extrahepatic biliary atresia successfully treated with surgery. Our experience. The long-term prognosis of extrahepatic biliary atresia after surgical restoration of bile flow is still controversial. An ongoing process of cirrhosis and the development of portal hypertension continue to create frequent and frustrating management problems. Clinical features, hepatic function, echotomography aspect, calcium-phosphorus metabolism and serum levels of 25-OH-D-3 were evaluated in 12 anicteric patients with extrahepatic biliary atresia successfully treated in a period from 1974 through 1987. Seven of these children had a total of 21 episodes of cholangitis. In five patients liver biopsy, obtained at the time of the external diversion closure, showed a biliary cirrhosis. Growth, development and hepatic function were normal in all children studied one patient had esophageal varices. The serum levels of 25-OH-D3 in patients without oral supplementation of vitamin D are lower than normal. This deficit can be corrected by oral administration of vitamin D. Our study revealed that the children with successful portoenterostomy appeared to thrive normally and that they tolerated the relatively mild liver damage. We believe that Kasai operation should be done in all patients with extrahepatic biliary atresia and that the liver transplantation is to be reserved only in those with unsuccessful Kasai. In our experience external diversion was not useful to prevent cholangitis and moreover it complicates the hepatectomy in case of transplantation.
