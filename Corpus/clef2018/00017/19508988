Effect of signal intensity from the accumulated microbubbles in the liver for differentiation of idiopathic portal hypertension from liver cirrhosis. To examine the possibility of using contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) to differentiate idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) from cirrhosis.This was an institutional review board-approved prospective study with written informed consent. The study consisted of 23 patients (mean age, 60 years +/- 11 range, 37-85 years) with biopsy-proved cirrhosis, 10 patients (mean age, 65 years +/- 8Onset time of contrast enhancement in the right portal vein was significantly longer for both IPH (22 sec +/- 3.9, P = .0035) and cirrhosis (19.3 sec +/- 4.7, P = .04) patients than for control subjects (17 sec +/- 3.3), with no significant difference in the onset time in the right hepatic artery. Images obtained in both IPH patients (21.2 dB +/- 1.4) and control subjects (22.1 dB +/- 2.2) had significantly higher signal intensity differences than those obtained in cirrhosis patients (13.8 dB +/- 2.8, P < .0001), with no significant difference between images of IPH patients and control subjects. Signal intensity differences of more than 18 dB had 100% sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis in IPH patients and control subjects. Interobserver variability for signal intensity differences was 8.7%.Contrast-enhanced US may offer the possibility for a simple, easy, and noninvasive diagnosis of IPH.
