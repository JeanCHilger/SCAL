Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stenting in Portal Hypertensive Gastropathy. Portal Hypertensive Gastropathy (PHG) is a rare cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with Chronic Liver Disease (CLD). This is the case report of a 46-year-old female known case of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) CLD, who presented with melena and coffee ground vomitings for 6 months. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed PHG while an ultrasound revealed chronic liver disease. The patient had a history of repeated blood transfusions over the last 6 months. She was given propanolol but no benefit occurred. She was referred for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stenting (TIPSS) to an interventional radiologist, which was followed by a reduction in PHG and the need for transfusion.
