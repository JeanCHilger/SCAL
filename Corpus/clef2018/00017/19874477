Prospective comparison of Fibroscan, King's score and liver biopsy for the assessment of cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis C infection. Historically, liver biopsy (LB) was the sole method to evaluate the severity of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. However, LB is expensive and associated with a risk of severe complications. Therefore, noninvasive tests have been developed to assess the severity of liver fibrosis. The accuracy of Fibroscan (FS) and King's score (KS) was evaluated individually and in combination using liver histology as the reference standard. One hundred and eighty-seven patients were identified who had undergone a biopsy with a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) mono-infection (HCV RNA-positive by RT-PCR), attending King's College Hospital (n = 88) or the Royal Free Hospital (n = 99) (London) between May 2006 and December 2007. Liver fibrosis was scored using the Ishak method significant fibrosis was defined as Ishak fibrosis stage F3-F6, and cirrhosis defined as Ishak fibrosis F5-F6. The diagnostic accuracy of each test was assessed by area under receiver operator characteristic curves (AUROC). Median age was 49 years (43-54) and 115 (61%) were male. The AUROC for FS, KS and FS + KS for the diagnosis of Ishak F3-F6 were 0.83, 0.82 and 0.85, respectively and for the diagnosis of cirrhosis (>or=F5) were 0.96, 0.89 and 0.93, respectively. The negative predictive values for the diagnosis of cirrhosis using the optimal cut-off results for fibrsocan (10.05 kPa), KS (24.3) and the two combined (26.1) were 98%, 91% and 94%, respectively. The noninvasive markers and, particularly, FS were effective tests for the prediction of cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis C. Both KS and FS also had clinical utility for the prediction of Ishak fibrosis stages F3-F6.
