Portal vein flow rate used as a early predictor of portal vein thrombosis after periesophagastric devascularization. To evaluate the predictive value of portal vein flow rate preoperative for portal vein thrombosis (PVT) after periesophagastric devascularization in hepatitis B cirrhosis-related portal hypertension.From January 2007 to July 2008, 45 patients with portal hypertension caused by hepatitis B cirrhosis were performed splenectomy with peri-esophagogastric devascularization in the same medical group in West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The portal vein flow rate and the diameter of portal vein were measured with doppler sonography respectively before and after the operation. At the same time, the level of PT and PLT were detected. The weight of spleens were measured after operation.Thirteen cases suffered from PVT postoperatively. Portal vein flow rate was significantly lower in patients with PVT postoperation than that in patients without PVT (P < 0.01). In patients with PVT (n = 13) postoperation, the preoperative portal vein flow rate was (19.5 +/- 5.3) cm/s. Among the 13 cases, there were 12 cases whose flow rate were lower than 25 cm/s, and 1 case whose flow rate was 32. 3 cm/s In patients without PVT (n = 32), the preoperative portal vein flow rate was (9.6 +/- 8.0) cm/s. In patients with lower rate (n = 17), the incidence rate of PVT was 70.6%The portal vein flow rate preoperative can be used as an early predictor of portal vein thrombosis after periesophagastric devascularization in hepatitis B cirrhosis-related portal hypertension to give a guide to clinical work.
