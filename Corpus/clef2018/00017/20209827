Treatment was prescribed in only fifteen patients, in the other patients, treatment was not made because of the multifocal character of the hepatocellular carcinoma. Complications were cirrhosis decompensation (n=3), fever (n=3), portal thrombosis (n=1) and pleurisy (n=1).Regardless of the improvement of diagnostic and therapeutic means, 17.5% of our patients having a hepatocellular carcinoma were subjected to a curative treatment.
