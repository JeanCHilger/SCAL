Gallbladder agenesis in a Chihuahua. A 4-year-old neutered male Chihuahua was presented with a history of anorexia and vomiting. Continuous elevation of liver enzymes was found on repeated blood examinations and the dog was referred to us for further evaluation. The absence of gallbladder was suspected on ultrasonography. Exploratory laparotomy and retrograde cholangiography confirmed gallbladder agenesis and a possible hypoplasia of the right medial and lateral liver lobes. Histologically, proliferation of bile ductules associated with portal fibrosis and pseudolobular formation were apparent in the liver lobes.
