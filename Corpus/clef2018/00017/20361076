Performance of unidimensional transient elastography in staging non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Transient elastography (TE) is a noninvasive method for predicting liver fibrosis, mainly validated in patients with viral hepatitis. Information is still limited concerning its performance in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients. We aimed to assess the value of TE in the prediction of fibrosis stage in NASH as well as the factors determining the discordance between the TE-predicted and the biopsy-proven fibrosis stage in these patients.Liver biopsy and TE were performed on 72 consecutive NASH patients. Fibrosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning and steatosis were evaluated (Brunt system).Liver stiffness (LS) values ranged from 2.80 to 16.90 kPa. In the univariate analysis, LS was correlated with fibrosis (r=0.661 p<0.0001), steatosis (r=0.435, p<0.0001), ballooning (r=0.385In NASH patients, TE allows a reliable assessment and prediction of liver fibrosis, especially in advanced stages. Steatosis, ballooning and inflammation do not influence liver stiffness.
