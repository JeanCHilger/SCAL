Assessment of hepatic fibrosis by transient elastography in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Hepatic ultrasonic transient elastography (FibroScan) is a new diagnostic method for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis. There are limited data available on its use as a follow-up tool for patients with chronic hepatitis B. In this study, 134 patients were enrolled. Hepatic fibrosis was evaluated by liver stiffness measurement and biopsy. The biopsy criteria of the Chinese Program of Prevention and Cure for Viral Hepatitis, Metavir classification, and the modified Chevalier's semiquantitative system were used for histological assessment. The liver stiffness value was correlated with fibrosis stage (r = 0.565, P < 0.001) and fibrosis semiquantitative score (r = 0.727, P < 0.001). The liver stiffness value of G2 was significantly higher than that of G1 within the same fibrosis stage for S1, S3, and S4, respectively. Three patients were graded as G1S1, and had moderate steatosis without distinct fibrosis in the portal area and lobule, while their liver stiffness values were higher than 6.2 kPa. Although belonging to the same fibrosis stage, for thinner thicknesses of the fibrous septa, the liver stiffness value and semiquantitative score were correspondingly lower. Liver stiffness values had a good correlation with hepatic collagen content. However, inflammatory activity and steatosis can influence liver stiffness values to some extent. Transient elastography may be useful as an ideal non-invasive post-treatment follow-up tool.
