Hepatic amyloidosis increases liver stiffness measured by transient elastography. Liver stiffness values in transient elastography (TE) have to be interpreted with caution. Steatosis, congestion, acute inflammation and extrahepatic cholestasis can indeed influence measurements. Obtained stiffness values in the cirrhotic range can also be present in the absence of fibrosis as in hepatic amyloidosis. Here we report two cases of systemic amyloidosis with hepatic involvement where high stiffness values were measured at TE. In fact, deposits of amyloid may increase the rigidity of the liver parenchyma resulting in higher liver stiffness values. Therefore, results of TE should always be interpreted in their clinical context and if inconsistent, the performance of a liver biopsy might be necessary.
