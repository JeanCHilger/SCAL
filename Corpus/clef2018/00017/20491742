Factors that affect the diagnostic accuracy of liver fibrosis measurement by Fibroscan in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Interquartile range/median value (IQR/M) of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) is a factor in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) leading to over estimation of fibrosis by Fibroscan.To investigate factors that affect the accuracy of LSM in chronic hepatitis B (CHB).One hundred and ninety-nine patients were enrolled. Only procedures yielding > or =10 valid measurements were considered reliable. Liver fibrosis was evaluated using the Batts and Ludwig system. Liver biopsy (LB) specimens <15 mm were considered ineligible.The mean age (142 men and 57 women) was 40.1 years. A significant discordance (discordance of at least two stages between LB and LSM) was identified in 38 (19.1%) and 47 (23.6%) patients respectively, according to Marcellin et al. and Chan et al.'s cutoff values. In multivariate analyses, BMI and fibrosis stage (F0-2 vs. F3-4) were identified as independent predictors for significant discordance (P = 0.040 hazard ratio [HR], 1.126Success rate and IQR/M were not predictive factors of the accuracy for diagnosing liver fibrosis by Fibroscan in CHB. Fibrosis stage (F0-2) was the only factor to predict significant discordance between LB and LSM.
