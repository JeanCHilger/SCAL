Ligation of oesophageal varices may increase formation of "deep" gastric collaterals. Endosonography (EUS) is rarely used in the routine diagnostic of portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis even though it has significantly higher sensitivity for detection of varices than gastroduodenoscopy. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the features of portal hypertension identified with EUS and to analyze the effect of variceal ligation on the prevalence of "deep" varices in subjects with cirrhosis.A cohort of 121 patients was divided into 2 groups depending on whether they had a history of variceal bleeding treated with ligation or not."Deep" oesophageal varices and large (> 5 mm) gastric varices occurred significantly more common in patients with previous banding. Also, large "deep" gastric varices occurred significantly more common in the banded group with no or small varices than in the not-banded group with similar endoscopy. Sixty percent of banded patients who had grade II/III oesophageal varices on endoscopy had large "deep" gastric varices comparing to 20% of not-banded with the same endoscopical findings (p = 0.04).Previous banding may increase the risk of the development of large "deep" oesophageal and gastric varices. Thus potential new indication for EUS in patients with cirrhosis could be a follow-up examination after successful eradication of varices.
