Prognostic value of endoscopy in children with biliary atresia at risk for early development of varices and bleeding. Biliary atresia is the most common cause of childhood cirrhosis. We investigated prospectively the development of portal hypertension in 139 children with biliary atresia, the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in the first years of life, and associations between endoscopic patterns of varices and risk.Children with clinical or ultrasonographic signs of portal hypertension underwent upper GI endoscopy examinations (n = 125, median age of 13 months). Information was recorded about esophageal varices and grade, red wale markings on the variceal wall, gastric varices along the cardia, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. A second endoscopy examination was performed in 64 children after a mean interval of 51 months to study their progression or regression.At the first endoscopy examination, 88 of 125 children had esophageal varices, including 74 who were younger than 2 years. Grade II and III varices, red markings, gastric varices, and signs of gastropathy were present in 29, 30, 24, and 27 children, respectively. At the second endoscopy examination, progression, stability, and regression of endoscopic signs were observed in 37, 18, and 9 of the 64 children, respectively. Twenty-eight children had GI bleeding at a median age of 17 months. Multivariate analysis showed that red markings, and most importantly gastric varices, were independent factors associated with bleeding.Children with biliary atresia have a high risk of portal hypertension in the first years of life. Spontaneous regression of varices is rare. Children with a combination of esophageal varices and red markings and/or gastric varices along the cardia should receive primary prophylaxis of bleeding.
