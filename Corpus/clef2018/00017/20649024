Analysis of the correlation between the degree of GBWT and hemodynamic changes of portal vein system. We retrospectively collected the ultrasound imaging data of 152 patients with cirrhosis, the gallbladder wall thickness (GBWT) and portal hemodynamics parameters (portal vein diameter, portal vein mean flow velocity, portal vein blood flow) were recorded,and SPSS 11.0 software was used to analyze the correlation between them. The results revealed that there was good correlation between portal vein diameter and the degree of gallbladder wall thickening (r 0.944, P < 0.05). Portal vein mean velocity and portal vein blood flow were both negatively correlated with gallbladder wall thickness (r = -0.939 or r = -0.950, respectively both P < or = 0.005). These indicate that gallbladder wall thickening is closely related to hemodynamic parameters. It is feasible to predict the degree of portal hypertension through the observation of gallbladder wall thickening in patients with liver cirrhosis.
