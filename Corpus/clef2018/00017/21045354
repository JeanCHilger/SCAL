Chronic hepatitis B infection in a hepatology clinic at a university hospital in Jeddah. The outcome of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection in a cohort of CHB patients at the hepatology clinics of King Abdul Aziz University Hospital in Jeddah was studied.The results of a complete blood count, prothrombin time, liver function test and hepatitis B virus polymerase chain reaction (HBV-PCR) performed over the previous two to five years of follow-up were reviewed. Results of abdominal ultrasound performed within the last year and the data on the treatment type, duration and resistance were also obtained.  The majority of the 109 patients studied were Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg-negative 87.2%). Male patients had higher serum ALT values compared to females at follow-up. HBeAg-positive patients had higher HBV-PCR levels at diagnosis compared to HBeAg-negative patients. Patients below 40 years of age had higher HBV-PCR compared to those above 40 years. Ultrasound showed liver cirrhosis in 11% of patients. Cirrhotic patients had higher GGT levels compared to non cirrhotic patients. Drug resistance developed in 25% of the 20 Lamivudine-treated patients. The mean duration of treatment was 2.5 ± .47 years.CHB was predominantly HBeAg negative, with a benign long-term outcome in most patients. Therapy may need to be individualized for patients with high risk of progression.
