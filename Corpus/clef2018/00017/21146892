Elastography for the diagnosis of severity of fibrosis in chronic liver disease: a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy. Transient elastography is a non-invasive method, for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis, developed as an alternative to liver biopsy. We studied the performance of elastography for diagnosis of fibrosis using meta-analysis.MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCI, Cochrane Library, conference abstracts books, and article references were searched. We included studies using biopsy as a reference standard, with the data necessary to calculate the true and false positive, true and false negative diagnostic results of elastography for a fibrosis stage, and with a 3-month maximum interval between tests. The quality of the studies was rated with the QUADAS tool.We identified 40 eligible studies. Summary sensitivity and specificity was 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.82) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.72-0.83) for F2 stage and 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.86) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.87-0.91) for cirrhosis. After an elastography result at/over the threshold value for F2 or cirrhosis ("positive" result), the corresponding post-test probability for their presence (if pre-test probability was 50%) was 78%, and 88% respectively, while, if values were below these thresholds ("negative" result), the post-test probability was 21% and 16%, respectively. No optimal stiffness cut-offs for individual fibrosis stages were validated in independent cohorts and cut-offs had a wide range and overlap within and between stages.Elastography theoretically has good sensitivity and specificity for cirrhosis (and less for lesser degrees of fibrosis) however, it should be cautiously applied to everyday clinical practice because there is no validation of the stiffness cut-offs for the various stages. Such validation is required before elastography is considered sufficiently accurate for non-invasive staging of fibrosis.
