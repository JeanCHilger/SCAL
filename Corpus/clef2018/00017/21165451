Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI)--a new modality for the evaluation of liver fibrosis. to assess the accuracy of transient elastography (TE) and Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) for liver fibrosis assessment, as compared to percutaneous liver biopsy (LB) in patients with chronic hepatitis.Our study included 71 patients (P) (54 with HCV and 17 with HBV chronic hepatitis) in which we compared TE and ARFI to the LB (evaluated according to the Metavir scoring system).On LB, from the 71P, 6P (8.4%) had F1, 25P (35.2%) had F2, 24P (33.8%) had F3 and 16P (22.5%) had F4. A direct, strong, linear correlation (Spearman r=0.707) was found between TE measurements and fibrosis (p<0.0001) and a weaker one, between ARFI and fibrosis (rho=0.469 p<0.0001). TE measurements were also correlated with ARFI measurements r=0.532, p<0.0001. By comparing the AUROC curves, TE and ARFI had similar predictive values for the presence of significant fibrosis (F greater or equal to 2 Metavir): AUROC ARFI=0.649, AUROC TE=0.731 (p=0.476)LS measurements assessed by means of TE correlate better than those assessed by means of ARFI to the histological fibrosis in patients with HBV and HCV chronic hepatitis. Both methods have excellent predictive values for the presence of cirrhosis.
