Role of serotonin in development of esophageal and gastric fundal varices. to determine the effect of free serotonin concentrations in plasma on development of esophageal and gastric fundal varices.this prospective study included 33 patients with liver cirrhosis and 24 healthy controls. Ultrasonography and measurement of serotonin concentration in plasma were carried out in both groups of subjects. The upper fiber panendoscopy was performed only in patients with liver cirrhosis.the mean plasma free serotonin levels were much higher in liver cirrhosis patients than in healthy controls (219.0 ± 24.2 nmol/L vs 65.4 ± 18.7 nmol/L, P < 0.0001). There was no significant correlation between serotonin concentration in plasma and the size of the esophageal varices according to Spearman coefficient of correlation (r(s) = -0.217, P > 0.05). However, the correlation of plasma serotonin concentration and gastric fundal varices was highly significant (r(s) = -0.601, P < 0.01).free serotonin is significant in pathogenesis of portal hypertension especially in development of fundal varices, indicating the clinical value of serotonergic receptor blockers in these patients.
