The role of plasma transforming growth factor beta-1 in the development of fibrosis in patient with HCV related steatohepatitis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major public health problem worldwide, which causes high rate of chronic liver disease such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Plasma transforming growth factor Beta-1 (TGFB-1) is a member of large family of peptides, which has a major regulatory role in hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. The study evaluated the role of transforming growth factor Beta-1 (TGFB-1) in induction of fibrosis in liver parasites-free HCV patients with related steatohepatitis. Thirty HCV patients who were clinically and serologically positive were selected. They were diagnosed as fatty liver by abdominal ultrasonography steatohepatitis and confirmed by histopathological biopsies examination. ELISA evaluated plasma transforming growth factor Beta-1 (TGFB-1) level. Also, 12 cross-matched subjects clinically, parasitologically and serologically free were used as a controls. The level of plasma transforming growth factor Beta-1 (TGFB-1) was highly elevated in the patients versus controls with mean +/- SD 18739.86 +/- 18539.46 and 6465 +/- 1142 respectively (P < 0.001). The TGFB-1 level in HCV related steato-hepatitis was elevated in all grades in contrast to controls (P < 0.05), without relation between the TGFB-1 levels and steatohepatitis severity. The TGFB-1 level showed high significant difference in all stages of fibrosis in patients in contrast to controls and the TGFB-1 level was very high when fibrosis started in stage I (P < 0.01) and tended to decrease in fibrosis of stage 2 & 3 (P < 0.05). There was highly significant positive correlation between TGFB-1 and body mass index (BMI) r = 0.774.
