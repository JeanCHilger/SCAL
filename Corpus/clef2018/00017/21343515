Microwave ablation in the spleen for treatment of secondary hypersplenism: a preliminary study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of microwave (MW) ablation for the treatment of hypersplenism, via a laparoscopic or percutaneous approach, and its effect on liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis.Twenty patients (17 men and three women mean age, 51.7 ± 11.4 yearsThe mean follow-up period was 26.4 ± 11.4 months (range, 6-48 months). After MW ablation, the ablation ratio ranged from 16% to 58% (mean, 30.9% ± 13%). All patients showed an increase in platelet count and leukocyte count after MW ablation, and patients with an ablation ratio greater than 40% showed more sustainable increase of platelet count in the follow-up period. Serum total protein levels significantly increased (p < 0.05). No severe complications occurred.MW ablation is a safe and effective technique for the management of hypersplenism in patients with liver cirrhosis. Ablating more than 40% of the splenic parenchyma may yield better long-term results.
