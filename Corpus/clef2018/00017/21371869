Biliary atresia: a condition requiring urgent diagnosis and treatment. Every neonatal jaundice lasting more than 2 weeks needs urgent investigations, beginning with examination of stools colour, and blood tests with total and conjugated serum bilirubin. If neonatal cholestasis (NC) is confirmed, vitamin K should be immediately injected, and the child should be referred to a specialised centre for investigations and treatment. Biliary atresia (BA) is the first cause of NC. Its diagnosis is urgent, since the chance of success of the conservative surgical treatment (Kasai operation or variants) decreases rapidly as the age at surgery increases. Normal ultrasound scans cannot rule out BA. After prompt work-up looking for the main other causes of NC, BA can often be strongly suspected before surgery, and is confirmed by operative findings and cholangiogram if needed. In case of failure to restore the biliary drainage, biliary cirrhosis progresses and leads to liver transplantation, generally in the first years of life. Currently, more than 90 % of children with BA can live, with a close to normal quality of life for most of them. Early diagnosis and treatment of BA contribute to decrease the needs for liver transplantation in infancy and childhood.
