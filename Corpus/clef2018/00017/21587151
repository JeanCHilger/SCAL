Evaluation of flow and structure abnormalities of splanchnic system veins in cirrhotic patients without portal hypertension. The aim of this study was to evaluate hemodynamic and anatomic alterations of the splanchnic venous system and the efficiency and safety of color Doppler radial endosonography in the assessment of cirrhotic patients by comparing Child A cirrhotic patients without portal hypertension findings versus a non-cirrhotic group.The study was carried out between January 2009 and February 2010 the study population was 38 cirrhotic patients without portal hypertension and 140 control patients.Hepatopedal flow was monophasic in all the control patients the flow pattern was chaotic and irregular in 8% of the cirrhotic patientsRadial Doppler endosonography may be efficient and safe for assessing the splanchnic system.
