Accuracy and diagnostic yield of CT-guided stereotactic liver biopsy of primary and secondary liver tumors. CT-guided biopsy still plays a decisive role in the management of liver tumors, especially if the lesions are not visible or accessible by ultrasound. As CT-guided stereotaxy appears to be a very accurate targeting technique, the aim of this study was to evaluate the targeting accuracy, diagnostic yield, and complications of CT-guided stereotactic liver biopsy of primary and secondary liver tumors.Prior to stereotactic liver biopsy, patients under general anesthesia were immobilized using a vacuum cushion. Respiratory motion was controlled by temporary disconnections of the endotracheal tube. An optical-based navigation system was used for 3D trajectory planning and placement of a 15-G coaxial needle via a stereotactic aiming device. The histological samples were obtained using a 16-G Tru-Cut(™) biopsy needle system. For evaluation of targeting accuracy the control CT image with the needles in place was fused with the planning CT image. The lateral error at the tip and skin entry point and the angular error were calculated. In addition, the skin-to-liver-surface (SL) distance, the needle-to-liver-surface (NL) angle, and the presence of liver cirrhosis were evaluated. The diagnostic yield was evaluated by histological reports from the institutional pathologists.The median lateral error was 2.5 mm (range: 0-6.5 mm) at the needle entry point and 3.2 mm (range: 0.01-9.4 mm) at the needle tip. The median angular error was 1.06° (range: 0-6.64°). Liver cirrhosis, NL angle and SL distance showed no significant impact on the targeting accuracy. Forty-five of the 46 liver biopsies (97.8%) were diagnostic according to the histological reports. No puncture-related complications such as bleeding or perforation of intestinal organs or lung tissue were recorded.
