Elevation of serum type IV collagen-degrading enzyme in hepatocellular carcinoma with metastasis. The activity of serum type IV collagen-degrading enzyme was measured in 21 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and the changes in the enzyme activity were investigated with respect to metastasis. The activity of serum type IV collagen-degrading enzyme did not increase until tumor invasion to the portal vein and intrahepatic metastasis were clearly detected ultrasonographically. Activities did not increase during the observation period in patients whose tumor grew slowly and did not invade the portal vein. Thus, the enzyme activity increases in relation to the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma and may be useful to detect ongoing metastases.
