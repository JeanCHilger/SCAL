Differential effects of terlipressin on pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis and pulmonary hypertension: an echo study. Terlipressin has been associated with pulmonary arterial vasodilation in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH). We investigated the effects of terlipressin on pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in patients with cirrhosis without and with PH. Pulmonary vascular resistance and cardiac output (CO) by Doppler ultrasound, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were evaluated in patients with cirrhosis with PVR -120 dyne s cm⁻⁵ (group 1, n = 20) and PVR >120 dyne s cm⁻⁵ (group 2, n = 10) before and 30 minutes after terlipressin infusion (2 mg). After terlipressin, PVR increased significantly in group 1 (96.1 ± 20.2 vs 85.1 ± 18 dyne s cm⁻⁵ P = .004) but decreased significantly in group 2 (170.4 ± 37.8 vs 157.8 ± 28.1 dyne s cm⁻⁵
