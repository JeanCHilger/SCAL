Liver cirrhosis as a delayed complication of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. A 26-year-old woman was referred to our department due to fever and skin rash after having taken medication for a common cold. Physical examination revealed erythematous skin changes on her body associated with mucosal involvement in her eyes and oral cavity. Peripheral blood examination revealed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Liver function test showed hyperbilirubinemia. She was managed with high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 1.0 gm/kg of body weight infused for 5 consecutive days. Although the patient's skin lesion improved dramatically with IVIG therapy, her hyperbilirubinemia aggravated progressively. Eighteen months after her presentation, liver cirrhosis was diagnosed by ultrasonography, laboratory and liver biopsy findings.
