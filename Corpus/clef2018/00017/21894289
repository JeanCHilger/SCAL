The influence of liver residual mass on the values of Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Elastography (ARFI) in cirrhotic patients. The aim of our study was to assess the influence of liver residual mass in cirrhotic patients on the liver stiffness (LS), measured by ARFI elastography.Two hundreds eleven cirrhotic patients were enrolled. To evaluate the liver residual mass, the Child-Pugh and MELD scores were used and 10 valid ARFI measurements were performed. The correlation between Child-Pugh, MELD scores and the LS were evaluated.Valid ARFI measurements were not obtained in 3 patients. A direct, very low correlation between the LS values and the Child-Pugh (r=0.264, p<0.001) and MELD scores (r=0.194, p=0.005) was found. A direct, low correlation between LS measurements and total bilirubin (r=0.271, p<0.001) and an inverse, low correlation with albumin (r=-0.270, p<0.001), prothrombin time (r=-0.196, p=0.006), cholinesterase (r=-0.241, p=0.003) was obtained. The LS mean values were statistically significant higher in patients with Child-Pugh class B vs. A (p=0.002) and in Child-Pugh C vs. A (p<0.001). The values were not significantly different in patients with Child-Pugh B vs. C (p=0.06).Higher values of LS measurements by means of ARFI could be an indicator of decreased liver functional reserve, evaluated by means of Child Pugh or Meld scores.
