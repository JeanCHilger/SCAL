Hepatic function and portal hemodynamics in patients with liver cirrhosis. We investigated the distribution of portal blood flow per kilogram of body weight (PBF/BW) in 112 healthy volunteers and 90 patients with liver cirrhosis using an ultrasonic Doppler duplex system. The PBF/BW in healthy volunteers showed a log-normal distribution, while the distribution was irregular and showed two peaks in patients with cirrhosis. This irregular distribution was thought to reflect their complex physiopathological state. We next analyzed the relationship between PBF/BW and the data from hepatic function tests (serum albumin, total bilirubin, indocyanine green 15-min retention rate, and indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate) in 48 patients with liver cirrhosis. The patients were divided into four groups according to their portal blood flow: group A with a hepatofugal or stagnant portal blood flow, group B with a hepatopetal PBF/BW of less than 12 ml/min/kg, group C with a hepatopetal PBF/BW of 12 or more but less than 20 ml/min/kg, and group D with a hepatopetal PBF/BW of 20 ml/min/kg or more. Among patients with cirrhosis, group A showed the worst results in hepatic function tests, group D the second worst, and group C the best. The effective hepatic blood flow was thought to have decreased because of the development of extrahepatic portosystemic shunts in the patients in groups A and B, whereas it decreased because of the development of intrahepatic shunts in patients in group D. The results of hepatic function tests deteriorated as a consequence of the decrease in the effective hepatic blood flow.
