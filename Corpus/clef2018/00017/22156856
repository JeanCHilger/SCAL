Liver fibrosis progression after acute hepatitis C virus infection in HIV-positive individuals. Fibrosis progression after acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with follow-up >9 months became similar to reported rates from studies in chronic HIV/HCV coinfection, as measured with transient elastometry. The duration of follow-up and serum alanine transaminase correlated with liver stiffness, and short follow-up resulted in high fibrosis progression rates.
