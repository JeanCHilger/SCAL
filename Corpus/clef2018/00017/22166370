Chronic Hepatitis E as a cause for cryptogenic cirrhosis in HIV. Chronic Hepatitis E infection (HEV) is reported in immunocompromised patients. A 45-year-old HIV-infected man had no cause found for a persistent transaminitis which predated commencement of antiretroviral therapy. Hepatic elastography and liver biopsy revealed cirrhosis. In 2010, he tested positive for HEV IgM/IgG antibodies. Plasma HEV RNA was detected. Archived samples revealed HEV viraemia since 2000. A 24-week course of pegylated interferon was commenced and HEV RNA became undetectable at week 4 until week 27 post treatment cessation. Chronic HEV infection should be considered in HIV patients as a cause for unexplained transaminitis and cryptogenic liver cirrhosis.
