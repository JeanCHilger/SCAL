Elastography efficiency in the liver fibrosis determination in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) is a noninvasive and reliable method for the indirect evaluation of liver fibrosis, but it may be less effective in case of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). AIM. To evaluate the relation between LSM and antropometric measurements - waist-hip ratio (WHR), proportion of excess of fat in body composition (%EFM), body mass index (BMI), insulin resistance index (HOMA IR), serum cholesterol an activity of ALT and AST.The antropometric sudies, bioimpedance analysis (ABC01-036, Medass, Russia), blood chemistry (Konelab 30i, Finland), and liver stiffness measurements using FibroScan (EchoSens, France) equipment were performed to 234 NAFLD patients. The availability of the LSM was estimated on the basis of calculation the proportion of patients with successive LSM (22 measurements, success rate no less then 30%). Correlation between LSM results and main studied parameters was evaluated by Spearman rank R correlation method.Availability of LSM in NAFLD patients was 52.56%. We found strong correlation between the availability of LSM and BMI (R = -0.28, p = 0.00002). In patients with NAFLD were found direct correlations between LSM and HOMA (R = 0.33, p = 0.0002) and %EFM (R = 0.2, p = 0.034). In patients with simple steatosis there was no correlation between LSM and studied parameters. In NASH patients the results of LSM correlated with HOMA-IR (R = 0.41, p = 0.0004), % EFM (R = 0.3, p = 0.01), WHR (R= 0.3, p = 0.01), and BMI (R = 0.32, p = 0.01).The diagnostic availability of liver stiffness measurement correlate with body mass index and goes up to 52.56%. In NAFLD patients there is strong correlation between LSM and results HOMA-IR (R = 0.33, p = 0.0002), and medium correlation with % EFM (R = 0,2, p = 0,034).
