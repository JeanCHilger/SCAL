Alkaline phosphatase: can it be considered as an indicator of liver fibrosis in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with type 2 diabetes? While isolated hepatosteatosis is a benign disease, in minority of cases non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may even lead to cirrhosis in long-term. In order to find the stage of the disease and determine the prognosis, a liver biopsy is indicated. In this study, we studied the relationship of liver histopathological findings with serum levels of hepatic enzymes.We recruited 52 cases of NASH with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diagnosis of NASH was made based on biochemical tests, ultrasound images and liver biopsy.Steatosis was mild in 57.7%, moderate in 30.8%, and severe in 11.6% of patients. While no infiltration was found in 78.8% of cases, there was a grade-1 infiltration in 15.4% and a grade-2 infiltration in 5.8% of cases. Similarly, no fibrosis was found in 42.3% of patients, but there was a stage-1 fibrosis in 50%, and a stage-2 fibrosis in 7.7% of cases. In patients with severe steatosis, serum levels of AST were higher than mild or moderate stage steatosis. Accordingly, in patients with no inflammation, serum levels of ALT were higher than in patients with inflammation. However, in patients with fibrosis, triglycerides levels were significantly lower and ALP was significantly higher than in patients without fibrosis. The correlation analysis indicated a positive association between serum levels of ALP and C-peptide.In addition to conventional risk factors such as age, presence of diabetes, female sex higher levels of ALP may be considered as a risk factor linked to hepatic fibrosis in patients with NASH and type 2 diabetes (Tab. 6, Ref. 8).
