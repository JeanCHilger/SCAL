Radiofrequency ablation for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: retrospective analysis of a single centre experience. To evaluate the usefulness and safety of radiofrequency ablation for primary and recurrent intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in our single centre experience.Ten patients with ICC refusing or not eligible for surgery underwent radiofrequency ablation for their tumor. The ICC was primary in 9 cases and recurrent, after 2 previous resections, in 1 patient. Radiofrequency ablation was performed percutaneously under ultrasound guidance using a 15G perfused electrode. Technical success of the procedure was assessed by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). Technical effectiveness was evaluated by CEUS and contrast enhanced CT 1 month after the last course of a defined ablation protocol. Follow-up contrast enhanced CT or MRI were performed every 3-6 months.RFA was always technically successful and effective for ICC lesions ≤3.4 cm and ineffective for lesion ≥4 cm. After a median follow-up of 19.5 months (range 9-64 months), 8 patients were still alive while 2 had died due to tumor progression. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rate of all patients with ICC of our series were 100%, 83.3% and 83.3%. No major complication was observed.Radiofrequency ablation seems to be a safe and effective option for small (≤3.4 cm) ICC nodules. In addition it may be considered as a palliative treatment for larger tumors.
