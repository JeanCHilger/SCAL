Ultrasonic diagnosis of liver diseases. Sonography has become widely used in the diagnosis of liver diseases. Fatty infiltration of the liver (adiposis hepatica), hepatic cirrhosis, cysts, metastases and tumors can be reliably diagnosed. A valid differentiation between benign and malignant new growths, however, can only be obtained by cytologic and histologic techniques. The lowest sensitivity can be expected in chronical benign diffuse diseases. Our results were compared with those in literature. Furthermore, other diagnostic approaches and procedures, e.g. fine needle biopsy and sclerotherapy in cysts, are recorded.
