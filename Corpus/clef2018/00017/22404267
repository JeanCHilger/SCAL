All-in-one sleeve patch graft venoplasty for multiple hepatic vein reconstruction in living donor liver transplantation. This paper presents an innovative technique to address complex multiple hepatic vein (HV) reconstruction in right lobe graft living donor liver transplantation (RL-LDLT).A patient with hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis underwent RL-LDLT. The graft had seven HVs, including: the right HV (17 mm) one segment VII HV (11 mm)Overall, six HV openings were incorporated in one sleeve patch to allow a single wide anastomosis with the recipient inferior vena cava. Doppler ultrasound after reconstruction showed adequate flow patterns in all the HVs.All-in-one sleeve patch graft venoplasty simplifies the reconstruction of multiple HVs and reduces warm ischaemia time in RL-LDLT with excellent outcomes.
