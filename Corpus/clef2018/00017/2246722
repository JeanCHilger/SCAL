Pediatric HBsAg chronic liver disease and adult asymptomatic carrier status: two stages of the same entity. Unlike adults (greater than 60% of cases), it is rare to find the chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier status with normal transaminases among children. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this status would depend on the duration of HBV infection, that is, whether chronic hepatitis in childhood would lead to the asymptomatic carrier status in later life. We reexamined all of our patients with chronic HBV infection of greater than 10 years' duration and with histologically documented chronic hepatitis during childhood. This was a group of 36 adolescents and young adults. All subjects were screened for tumor using alpha-fetoprotein assay and hepatic ultrasound. Eight patients with cirrhosis underwent esophageal fiberoptic endoscopy. All patients were in good general condition, with no clinical signs of liver failure. Only two patients had abnormal transaminase levels, both of whom had evidence of delta infection. All but one patient became anti-HBe positive. Five cases had HBsAg clearance. (Seventy-one percent of patients were HBeAg positive and 14% anti-HBe positive at the onset of the disease.) Hepatic ultrasound revealed no tumors in any of the subjects, and fiberoptic endoscopy demonstrated no esophageal varices. This study suggests that (a) chronic hepatitis and asymptomatic carrier status may be subsequent stages of the B virus infection and (b) chronic hepatitis in childhood is generally benign and may evolve into an asymptomatic carrier status. The main problem with the chronic carrier status is probably the increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.
