Ultrasonography and computed tomography in diffuse liver disease with cholestasis. Ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) were performed on respectively 67 and 42 (altogether 72) patients, for the assessment of intrahepatic cholestasis. The diagnostic ability to differentiate between malignant (17 patients) and benign (55 patients) liver disease was analyzed. Coarse echogenicity of the liver led to inconclusive results in differentiating between cirrhosis (2 out of 29 patients) and malignant infiltration (4 out of 15 patients) by US. Other benign liver diseases in 23 patients, including acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, fatty liver, and liver congestion, were correctly interpreted as benign. CT correctly disclosed malignant liver disease in all cases. A false positive diagnosis of malignancy was encountered in 4 (out of 17) patients with decompensated hepatic cirrhosis because of non-homogeneous expansive areas on CT in 3 cases. The true cause was in 2 patients non-uniform fatty infiltration, and in one patient with acute hepatitis A, small hypodense lesions. Among cholestatic patients, decompensated cirrhosis and malignant liver infiltration could not always be differentiated on US or CT.
