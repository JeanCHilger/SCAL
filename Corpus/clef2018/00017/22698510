Comparative study concerning the value of acoustic radiation force impulse elastography (ARFI) in comparison with transient elastography (TE) for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. Our aim was to compare liver stiffness (LS) measurements by means of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography and transient elastography (TE) in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C, according to the severity of fibrosis. We also compared the correlation strength of ARFI and TE measurements with liver fibrosis. We included 53 patients with hepatitis B and 107 with hepatitis C in which liver biopsy, ARFI and TE measurements were performed in the same session. The mean LS values measured with ARFI were similar in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C and depended on the stage of fibrosis. The correlation strength of LS measurements by ARFI and by TE with fibrosis was similar in chronic hepatitis B and C patients. In conclusion, for the same stage of fibrosis, the mean LS values by ARFI were similar in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. ARFI had similar predictive value with TE in both chronic viral hepatitis.
