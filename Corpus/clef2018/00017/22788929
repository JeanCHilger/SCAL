Efficacy of transient elastography in screening for large esophageal varices in patients with suspicious or proven liver cirrhosis. To evaluate the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using transient elastography (TE) to predict the risk of esophageal varices (EVs) in Chinese patients.In total, 46 patients with suspicious or proven liver cirrhosis underwent TE and liver biopsy. All participants were endoscopically screened for the presence of EVs and large EVs by two endoscopists who were blinded to the LSM status. Large EVs were defined as more than 5 mm in diameter. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for both TE and the platelet count/spleen diameter (PC/SD) ratio in predicting the presence of EVs or large EVs were calculated.Of the 46 patients, 30 (65%) had EVs including 19 (41%) with large EVs. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of LSM was 0.85 for the presence of EVs and 0.83 for large EVs, respectively. The cut-off values of LSM were ≥13.4 kPa for the presence of EVs and ≥14.6 kPa for large EVs. Notably, the AUROC of the PC/SD ratio was 0.92 for the presence of EVs but only 0.69 for large EVs.LSM using TE can predict the presence of EVs or large EVs in Chinese patients with suspicious or proven cirrhosis and may identify patients who require endoscopic surveillance.
