Reversible space-occupying lesions of the kidney in HIV infection. In January 1990 a 32 year old nurse was admitted with fever, weight loss of 9 kilogramms and pain of her right flank. HIV infection due to intravenous drug abuse had been diagnosed in 1986. Ultrasonic imaging revealed a solid tumor of low echogenicity in the cranial part of the right kidney. This finding could be confirmed with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Angiographic study showed a missing of blood vessels in the same area. A transcutaneous puncture with a thin needle resulted histologically in unspecific findings like detritus, lymphoid cells and neutrophils. Antibiotic treatment with amoxicilline and cefuroxim was without success. Symptoms as well as ultrasonic findings completely disappeared following oral administration of ofloxazine. The clinical course and the successful treatment support the diagnosis of an atypical renal abscess. As a second diagnosis a histologically proven cirrhosis of the liver could be established. Hepatitis C serology proved to be positive.
