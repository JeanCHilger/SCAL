Evaluation of different therapeutic approaches for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a significant cause of mortality in cirrhosis. Reducing toxic burden of infected ascitic fluid through paracentesis needs further studies as adjunctive therapy of SBP. We aimed to evaluate different therapies for SBP.Thirty-six cirrhotic ascitic patients with SBP were examined and classified according to treatment modality (5-7 days) into: Group A received cefotaxime, group B received cefotaxime and albumin 1.5 g/kg body weight within 6h of SBP being diagnosed and 1g/kg body weight on day 3, group C received cefotaxime and paracentesis with volume dependent albumin infusion. Control group of 12 cirrhotic ascitic patients free from SBP were included. Routine laboratory tests, ascitic fluid analysis for leucocytes and culture were done, inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide and tumour necrosis factor alpha were measured in serum and ascitic fluid. Duplex-Doppler assessment of portal flow volume and renal resistive index, Echocardiography to measure end diastolic and end systolic volumes, stroke volume and cardiac output were done. Tests were carried out before and after therapy.Treatment response was assessed by, cardiac haemodynamics, portal and renal flow and NO and TNF. All studied parameters laboratory, cardiac, Doppler exhibited a significant improvement in group B in contrast to the other groups as demonstrated by post therapy reduction of (blood and ascitic fluid WBCs & PNLS, serum and ascitic NO & TNF and renal resistive index), elevation of (serum albumin and portal flow volume) and improvement of cardiac haemodynamic.Treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis by cefotaxime and body weight based albumin infusion gave most favourable results compared to other regimens. Postulation of removing toxic burden through paracentesis has not been confirmed.
