The clinical significance of intrapulmonary vascular dilations in liver transplant candidates. Intrapulmonary vascular dilations (IPVD) are common in patients with cirrhosis, but the majority do not have hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). The clinical significance of IPVD is unknown. Our aim was to determine the clinical impact due to the entire spectrum of IPVD in liver transplant (LT) candidates. A total of 122 evaluees for LT underwent contrast transthoracic echocardiography (cTTE). The degree of shunting was graded 1-3 (severe). HPS was defined as PaO(2) < 70 mmHg in the presence of IPVD and exclusion of other causes of hypoxemia. IPVD were detected in 57/122 (47%), and of these HPS was found in 5. IPVD were associated with higher Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradients, with the highest occurring in patients with HPS (IPVD vs. no IPVD: p = 0.003 HPS vs. no IPVD: p = 0.004). All patients with HPS had grade 3 shunting, and had significantly widened A-a gradient and lower PaO(2) compared with grade 1 or 2 IPVDs. Presence of IPVD did not affect survival measured from evaluation or after LT. Other clinical outcomes were also similar among patients with and without IPVD. IPVD are common among LT candidates. HPS is unlikely in presence of only mild to moderate shunting. Clinical outcomes are similar among patients with and without IPVD.
