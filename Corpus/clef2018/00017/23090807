Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging findings of abdominal complications of cystic fibrosis. In this study, our aim is to discuss the imaging findings of the abdominal complications seen in Cystic Fibrosis (CF), with ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our first case, a 22 year-old female showed changes characterized by severe biliary involvement such as cholelithiasis and cholangitis. Our second case was a 36 year-old male with severe hepatic manifestations. In this case signs of severe cirrhosis, portal hypertension and marked splenomegaly were seen. Micro-gallbladder, cholecystolithiasis and diffuse fatty infiltration of the pancreas were seen in both cases.US and MRI are effective and noninvasive imaging techniques to evaluate the abdominal complications of cystic fibrosis.
