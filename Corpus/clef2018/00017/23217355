Liver stiffness measurement in cirrhotic patient -- implications of disease activity and treatment efficacy. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) is a noninvasive method for the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of hepatitis activity and antiviral therapy on LSM in cirrhotic patients. Consecutive patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis were enrolled for LSM. The medical records of hepatitis activity and antiviral therapy before enrollment were reviewed. Patients were stratified into inactive, fluctuating, and active groups by serial change of alanine transaminase level. For chronic hepatitis C, patients were stratified into sustained virological response (SVR) and non-SVR (NSVR) by effect of antiviral treatment. LSM results were compared among different groups. A total of 163 patients (mean age = 57.2 ± 11.0 years) were enrolled. The median (range) LSM values were 9.6 (4.2-20.6), 10.25 (3.9-49.6), and 15.75 (4.8-61.5) kPa in the inactive, fluctuating, and active groups, respectively. Patients in the active group had significantly higher LSM values. For chronic hepatitis C, median (range) LSM values were 16.6 (8.1-61.5), 22.9 (11.1-37.4), and 11.2 (3.9-27.0) kPa in patients without antiviral therapy, in NSVR, and in SVR groups, respectively. Patients with SVR had significantly lower LSM values. For chronic hepatitis B, median (range) LSM values were 11.8 (5.1-46.6), 16.85 (4.2-48), and 10.6 (4.3-46.4 kPa) kPa in patients without oral nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy, with NA < 12, and ≧12 months, respectively. There was a significantly lower LSM value in patients with NA therapy≧12 months. There were low LSM values in cirrhotic patients without hepatitis activity, as well as with SVR in chronic hepatitis C and long-term NA therapy in chronic hepatitis B.
