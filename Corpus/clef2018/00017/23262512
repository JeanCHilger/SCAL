Prevalence and risk factors for liver involvement in individuals with PiZZ-related lung disease. Î±1-Antitrypsin deficiency is one of the most common heritable human diseases, predisposing to liver and lung injury. Significant heterogeneity in phenotypic expression is well documented, but less is known of the prevalence, severity, and correlates of chronic liver disease among individuals presenting with lung disease.To determine the frequency of and risk factors for severe liver fibrosis and cirrhosis among individuals with PiZZ-related lung disease.A well-characterized cohort of 57 PiZZ adults attending a tertiary referral respiratory clinic was screened prospectively for clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and (when appropriate) histologic evidence of chronic liver disease.Thirty-six (63.2%) of 57 had a history or clinical findings suggestive of liver disease or had one or more abnormalities of liver function, or liver ultrasound, and 24 of these underwent liver biopsy. Ten (17.5%) had evidence of severe fibrosis or cirrhosis and were more likely to have higher body mass index (P = 0.04), alanine transaminase (P = 0.0001), alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.0009), prothrombin time (P = 0.0005), and maximal vital capacity (VCmax) (P = 0.04)Significant chronic liver disease is common in PiZZ individuals with lung disease and can be screened effectively by a combination of conventional tests of liver function, platelet count, and liver ultrasound.
