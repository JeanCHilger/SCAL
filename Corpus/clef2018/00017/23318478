Hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance at 4- vs. 12-month intervals for patients with chronic viral hepatitis: a randomized study in community. To compare the efficacy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance at 4- and 12-month intervals in a community for patients with chronic viral hepatitis and thrombocytopenia.In 10 townships, adults (≥ 40 years) with platelet ≤ 150 (× 10(9))/l, positive hepatitis B surface antigen, or antibody to hepatitis C virus were invited to this study. These townships were randomized into 4- (group A) and 12-month (group B) interval surveillance groups. Seven hundred and eighty-five and 796 residents met the study criteria in groups A and B. Ultrasonography (US) was the surveillance method.A total of 744 residents (group A: 387 group B: 357) were enrolled. In the study period, HCC was diagnosed in 39 residents (group A: 24Compared with 12-month interval, US surveillance at 4-month interval detected more patients with HCC ≤ 2 cm who were in BCLC very-early stage and were fit for curative treatments. Up to 4-year follow-up, however, the overall survival was not different.
