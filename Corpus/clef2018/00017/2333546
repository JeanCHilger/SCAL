Surgical treatment of congenital choledochal cyst. 20 cases of congenital choledochal cyst were operated by modified Lilly's method from 1980 to November 1985 in our Hospital. There were 4 males and 16 females. Their ages ranged from 50 days to 15 years with a mean of 5.1 years. All patients had preoperative ultrasonographic examination, barium meal radiography of the gastrointestinal tract or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. All had choledochal cystectomy with retention of the outer layer of the posterior wall of the cyst. We modified Lilly's method by injecting normal saline between the outer and inner layer of the choledochal cyst so that the outer layer could be isolated. Reconstruction of the biliary tract was then performed. 2 patients had choledochoduodenostomy and 18 patients had hepaticojejunostomy (1 end to end and 17 end to side). 19 patients had also had cholecystectomy. The post-operative course of the operation was found to be smooth and safe. Patients were followed up for a period from 6 months to 7 years. 3 patients had cirrhosis of liver, 2 of whom died within 8 months. The mortality rate in our series was 10%. The operative treatment and the problems of biliary reconstruction are discussed.
