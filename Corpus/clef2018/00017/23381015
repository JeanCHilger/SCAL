De novo portal vein thrombosis in virus-related cirrhosis: predictive factors and long-term outcomes. The objective of this study is to investigate predictive factors and long-term outcomes of de novo portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhosis.The incidence and factors predictive of PVT (diagnosed by Doppler ultrasound) and prognosis were examined in 150 patients with virus-related cirrhosis but without PVT at baseline.PVT developed in 28% of patients (42/150), with cumulative incidence of 12.8%, 20%, and 38.7% at 1, 5, and 8-10 years, respectively. The baseline flow volume in the largest collateral vessel was an independent risk factor for thrombosis (hazard ratio, 3.922 95% confidence intervals, 3.697-4.415Development of collateral vessels was a significant predictive factor for the occurrence of PVT in virus-induced cirrhosis. Spontaneous resolution or unchanged appearance was the most common outcome of thrombosis, which had little influence on prognosis.
