Role of proapoptotic p-53 factor in pathogenesis of nonalcoholic hepatosteatosis. The aim of the study was to establish the role of pro-apoptotic P-53 factor in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic hepatosteatosis in postmenopausal women. Study was performed on menopausal women (12 month amenorea) with sings of metabolic syndrome and high level of ALT in blood (2 fold higher as maximal normal level). Verification of steatosis diagnosis was made on the basis of ultrasonography and histological study of bioptats obtained by method of percutal biopsy. The study of anamnesis, lipid profile, the concentration of ALT level in blood, histological analysis of bioptats and immunohistological study of P-53 were conducted. The control group consisted of postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome, with normal level of ALT in blood. Histological analysis of liver bioptats revealed a micro-and macro-droplet steatosis of hepatocytes. Inflammation and fibrosis were present in all patients liver. Small necrotic focuses of hepatocytes without necrosis and single lymphocyte clusters were noted in samples of patients with high level of ALT. As a result imunohystochemical studies enhanced expression of the proapoptotic protein P-53 was found in that patients with hepatosteatosis any dependence was not revealed between the intensity of protein P-53 expression and the degree of steatohepatitis (ALT content). It is concluded that the enhanced protein expression of P-53 which indicates on the intensification of apoptosis in hepatocytes can be induced by activation of inflammatory stimuli and oxidative stress. Considering the fact that it was not found correlation between the intensity of the protein P-53 expression and severity of disease, we can assume that its participation is just one element of multiple factors involved in pathogenesis of steatohepatosis. The timely correction of lipid metabolism and redox balance in the body is usfull for the prevention of hepatosteatosis.
