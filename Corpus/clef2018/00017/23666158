MR-based measurements of portal vein flow and liver stiffness for predicting gastroesophageal varices. We evaluated flow parameters measured by phase-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (PC-MRI) of the portal venous system and liver stiffness measured by MR elastography (MRE) to determine the usefulness of these methods in predicting gastroesophageal varices (GEV) in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD).In patients with CLD and controls, we performed PC-MRI on the portal (PV) and superior mesenteric veins calculated mean velocity (V, cm/s), cross-sectional area (S, mmÂ²), and flow volume (Q, mL/min)Child-Pugh grade, VPV, SPV, liver stiffness, APRI, and visually identified GEV (visible GEV) differed significantly among the 3 groups (P<0.05). We investigated VPV, SPV, liver stiffness, and visible GEV as independent markers to distinguish patients with and without GEV and examined VPV and visible GEV to predict severe GEV. Visible GEV showed low sensitivity (14 to 30%) and high specificity (98%) for predicting GEV in patients with CLD. A subgroup analysis that excluded cases with collateral pathway demonstrated slightly improved diagnostic performance of VPV and liver stiffness.Portal vein flow parameters and liver stiffness can be useful markers for predicting GEV in patients with CLD.
