Diastolic dysfunction is a predictor of poor outcomes in patients with cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and a normal creatinine. We investigated left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) and its relationship with circulatory function and prognosis in cirrhosis with portal hypertension and normal creatinine. Conventional and tissue Doppler (TDI) echocardiography, systemic and hepatic hemodynamics, and the activity of endogenous vasoactive systems (AEVS) were measured prospectively in 80 patients. Plasma renin activity (PRA >4 ng/mL/hour) was used as a surrogate of effective arterial blood volume. Patients were followed up for 12 months. Thirty-seven patients had LVDD (19 with grade 1 and 18 with grade 2). Left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial volume, AEVS, and natriuretic peptide levels were significantly greater in patients with LVDD than without LVDD. Patients with grade 2 LVDD, compared to grade 1 LVDD and without LVDD, had significantly lower mean arterial pressure and higher Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, E-wave transmitral/early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/e' ratio), cardiopulmonary pressures, PRA, and natriuretic peptide levels. Systolic and cardiac chronotropic function were significantly lower in patients with grade 2 LVDD than without LVDD. LVDD was more frequent in patients with ascites and increased PRA than patients without ascites or with ascites but normal PRA. Fourteen patients with LVDD developed hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type 1 on follow-up. Survival was different according to degree of LVDD (without LVDD: 95%LVDD occurs simultaneously with other changes in cardiac structure and function and is associated with an impairment of effective arterial blood volume. LVDD is a sensitive marker of advanced cirrhosis, type 1 HRS development, and mortality.
