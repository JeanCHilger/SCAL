Bleeding risk in patients with esophageal varices undergoing transesophageal echocardiography. Bleeding from esophageal varices is a major potential concern during transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. As there are limited data on its risk in these patients, this was retrospectively assessed at our institution.The hospital electronic medical record database at our university affiliated teaching hospital was searched for all patients with esophageal varices undergoing TEE from 2000 to 2012 and patient charts were reviewed for procedure-related bleeding complications.Twenty-four patients with esophageal varices were found (18 men, 57 ± 14 years). Nine patients had grade 2 esophageal varices, 15 patients had grade 1 varices, and 12 patients had portal hypertensive gastropathy. Alcoholic liver disease (9) and hepatitis C (8) were the most common etiologies of the cirrhosis with an average MELD score of 15. The most common indication for TEE was for possible endocarditis (15). Medications potentially increasing bleeding risk included warfarin in 2 and aspirin in 7 patients. Twelve patients were taking β-blockers for portal hypertension. There were no immediate bleeding complications and none of these patients were readmitted with bleeding.TEE can be performed without serious bleeding risk in patients with grade 1 or 2 esophageal varices.
