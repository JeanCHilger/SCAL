Quantification of liver viscoelasticity with acoustic radiation force: a study of hepatic fibrosis in a rat model. Ultrasound elastography, based on shear wave propagation, enables the quantitative and non-invasive assessment of liver mechanical properties such as stiffness and has been found to be feasible for and useful in the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis. Most ultrasound elastographic methods use a purely elastic model to describe liver mechanical properties. However, to describe tissue that is dispersive and to obtain an accurate measure of tissue elasticity, the viscoelasticity of the tissue should be examined. The objective of this study was to investigate the shear viscoelastic characteristics, as measured by ultrasound elastography, of liver fibrosis in a rat model and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of viscoelasticity for staging liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis was induced in 37 rats using carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) 6 rats served as controls. Liver viscoelasticity was measured in vitro using shear waves induced by acoustic radiation force. The measured mean values of liver elasticity and viscosity ranged from 0.84 to 3.45 kPa and from 1.12 to 2.06 Pa·s for fibrosis stages F0-F4, respectively. Spearman correlation coefficients indicated that stage of fibrosis was well correlated with elasticity (0.88) and moderately correlated with viscosity (0.66). The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.97 (≥F2), 0.91 (≥F3) and 1.00 (F4) for elasticity and 0.91 (≥F2), 0.79 (≥F3) and 0.74 (F4) for viscosity, respectively. The results confirmed that shear wave velocity was dispersive in frequency, suggesting a viscoelastic model to describe liver fibrosis. The study finds that although viscosity is not as good as elasticity for staging fibrosis, it is important to consider viscosity to make an accurate estimation of elasticity
