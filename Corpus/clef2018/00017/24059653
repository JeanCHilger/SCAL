Rare cause of weight loss in a kidney transplant recipient: iron overload. Various reasons such as malignancies and chronic infections may cause weight loss in kidney transplant patients. In this report, iron overload as a rare cause of weight loss in a kidney transplant patient is presented. Forty-seven-year-old male patient who transplanted from a deceased donor 5 years ago was hospitalized because of 20 kg of weight loss. In medical history, he had history of hemodialysis for 89 months and received 100-300 mg of intravenous iron therapy per week before transplantation and transfused eight units of blood. In physical examination, weight and height were 45 kg and 185 cm, respectively. Respiratory and cardiac auscultation was normal. Laboratory results revealed as follow: glucose 76 mg/dL, urea 60 mg/dL, creatinine 1.35 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 74 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 77 U/L, C-reactive protein 2.59 mg/dL, albumin 3.3 g/dL, globulin 3.4 g/dL, white blood cells 3200/mm(3), hemoglobin 13.1 g/dL and platelets 190,000/mm(3). Chest and abdominal tomography didn't reveal any pathology. Portal Doppler ultrasound showed signs of early cirrhosis. Viral and autoimmune hepatitis markers were negative. Ferritin was 5300 ng/mL and transferrin saturation was 82%. In liver biopsy, hemosiderosis was diagnosed and heterozygous H63D gene mutation was detected. Totally, 19 units of phlebotomy were performed. Liver function tests and serum ferritin decreased gradually. At outpatient follow-up in 6 months, he returned to former weight. In conclusion, there can be several causes of weight loss in kidney transplant patients. Iron overload can come across as a rare cause of weight loss. In these patients, ferritin levels should be checked and diagnosis should be clarified by liver biopsy and gene mutation analysis.
