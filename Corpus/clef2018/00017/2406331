Prevalence and significance of abdominal lymphadenopathy in patients with chronic liver disease: an ultrasound study. Enlarged abdominal, mainly periportal, lymph nodes were detected by real time ultrasonography in 19% (42 of 227) of patients with chronic liver disease who had no evidence of tumor, upper gastrointestinal carcinoma, or lymphoproliferative disorder. Computed tomography, performed in 15 cases, always confirmed the sonographic findings. Lymph node biopsies from two patients showed reactive hyperplasia. Lymphadenopathy occurred more frequently in autoimmune (primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune, and liver-kidney microsomal antibody-positive chronic hepatitis: 33, 25, and 22% of cases, respectively) than nonautoimmune disease (cryptogenic, alcoholic, and hepatitis B virus-related chronic hepatitis: 16, 12, and 10% of cases, respectively) (p less than 0.005). Four of five patients with mixed polyclonal cryoglobulinemia or monoclonal gammopathy had lymphadenopathy. In 125 patients, including 25 with lymphadenopathy, who were monitored for a median period of 25 months, the ultrasonographic pattern remained unchanged. Abdominal, presumably benign, lymphadenopathy may accompany chronic liver disease, especially when prominent immunological features coexist. This should be kept in mind for the correct interpretation of such an ultrasound finding.
