Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma by real-time ultrasonography. A prospective study. For early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), real-time ultrasonography (US) was performed prospectively in 528 patients, including 236 with cirrhosis, 81 with chronic hepatitis, 168 asymptomatic hepatitis B surface antigen carriers, and 43 with a family history of HCC. Simultaneous measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was also done. In addition, 233 patients had regular controls at 3- to 6-month intervals, with an average follow-up period of 1.4 years. On initial screening, a total of 17 patients were found to have HCC: 13 in the cirrhotic group, 3 in the HCC family group, and 1 in the asymptomatic carriers. Of these HCCs, 7 were smaller than 3 cm, 6 were between 3 to 5 cm, and 4 were larger than 5 cm. In patients with tumors smaller than 5 cm, the AFP levels were normal in 46.2%, between 20 to 400 ng/ml in another 46.2%, and only 7.6% were over 400 ng/ml. On follow-up, another seven patients, all in the cirrhotic group, were found to have HCCs varying from 1.6 to 4.7 cm three of them had normal serum AFP level. The authors conclude that real-time US is more sensitive than AFP assay in early detection of HCC, and the high-risk subjects should receive this procedure at regular intervals.
