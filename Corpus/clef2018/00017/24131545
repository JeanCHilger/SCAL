Severe asymptomatic non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in routine diabetes care a multi-disciplinary team approach to diagnosis and management. To prospectively use a non-invasive algorithm to identify asymptomatic, advanced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in a secondary care diabetes clinic and to determine the short-term effect of a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) approach in a liver clinic.NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) was calculated in 64 asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes. Advanced fibrosis was identified using transient elastography and confirmed with liver biopsy. In a subsequent retrospective study, 95 patients newly referred to the NAFLD MDT clinic were investigated and the impact of the MDT approach assessed.25/64 (39.0%) of patients with diabetes had a low NFS (<-1.455). 39/64 (61.0%) patients had a high or indeterminate NFS and were referred for review in the NAFLD MDT clinic, of which 23/39 attended for assessment. 19/23 (82.6%) were diagnosed with NAFLD, of which 6/19 (31.6%) patients had a positive transient elastography (â‰¥8 kPa). Liver biopsy confirmed advanced fibrosis in 5/6 cases, with moderate fibrosis in 1 case. In the retrospective study, 65/95 (68.4%) new referrals to the NAFLD MDT clinic had a diagnosis of NAFLD. Over a median 98 days (IQR 70-182) follow-up, there was a significant improvement in weight (-0.8 kg P = 0.024), total cholesterol (-0.2 mmol/LA significant proportion of asymptomatic patients attending type 2 diabetes clinics have undiagnosed advanced NAFLD fibrosis. An MDT approach to NAFLD results in short-term improvements in metabolic and liver parameters.
