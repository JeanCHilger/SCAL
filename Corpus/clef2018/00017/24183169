Debulking surgery followed by intraarterial 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy plus subcutaneous interferon alfa for massive hepatocellular carcinoma with multiple intrahepatic metastases: a pilot study. The prognosis in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with multiple intrahepatic metastases is extremely poor. Combination therapy with subcutaneous interferon (IFN) alfa and intraarterial 5-fluorouracil was reported to be effective against such advanced HCC. We describe results of debulking surgery followed by combination therapy with IFN alfa and 5-FU for massive HCC with multiple intrahepatic metastases.In 27 HCC patients with massive tumors and multiple intrahepatic metastases, we performed combination therapy with IFN alfa and 5-FU after maximal liver tumor resection.Mean patient age was 63.3 years. Including intrahepatic metastases, tumors numbered 5 or more in 17 patients (63%). Portal or hepatic vein branches were invaded in 22 (81%). The mean maximum tumor diameter was 102 mm. Among 24 patients whose results were analyzed, an objective response by residual intrahepatic metastases was observed in 13 (54% complete response in 12, and partial response in 1). Overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival was 73.2%, 38.7%, and 38.7%, respectivelyDebulking surgery followed by IFN alfa and 5-FU combination chemotherapy offers possibility of long-term survival despite massive HCC with multiple intrahepatic metastases.
