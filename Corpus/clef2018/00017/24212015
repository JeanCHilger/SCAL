Texture analysis and classification of ultrasound liver images. Ultrasound as a noninvasive imaging technique is widely used to diagnose liver diseases. Texture analysis and classification of ultrasound liver images have become an important research topic across the world. In this study, GLGCM (Gray Level Gradient Co-Occurrence Matrix) was implemented for texture analysis of ultrasound liver images first, followed by the use of GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) at the second stage. Twenty two features were obtained using the two methods, and seven most powerful features were selected for classification using BP (Back Propagation) neural network. Fibrosis was divided into five stages (S0-S4) in this study. The classification accuracies of S0-S4 were 100%, 90%, 70%, 90% and 100%, respectively.
