Non-invasive methods for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis: transient elastography, hyaluronic acid, 13C-aminopyrine breath test and cytokeratin 18 fragment. BACKGROUND. In the management of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients, liver biopsy is the gold standard for liver fibrosis assessment despite some technical limits and risks. Non-invasive approaches have been proposed as alternative methods to evaluate structural liver damage. AIM. To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of transient elastography, 13C-aminopyrine breath test (13C-ABT), serum hyaluronic acid (HA) and cytokeratin 18 Asp396 fragment (CK-18) as non-invasive methods of liver fibrosis assessment ad their correlation to METAVIR score. MATERIAL AND METHODS. In a cohort of 57 CHC patients, liver stiffness, cumulative percentage of administered dose of 13C-aminopyrine at 120 min, serum HA and serum CK-18 concentration were determined. Diagnostic accuracy in detecting significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2), severe fibrosis (F ≥ 3) and cirrhosis (F = 4) was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS. Liver fibrosis score showed a strong correlation with liver stiffness (r = 0.667 p < 0.0001) and a significant inverse correlation with 13C-ABT results (r = -0.418
