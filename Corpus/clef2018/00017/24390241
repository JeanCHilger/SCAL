Serum lipocalin-2, cathepsin S and chemerin levels and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Several novel circulating adipokines are associated with insulin resistance and inflammation. Little information exists in NAFLD about three recently recognized adipokines lipocalin-2, cathepsin S and chemerin. To assess the relationship between serum lipocalin-2, cathepsin S and chemerin levels and the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver in Chinese subjects, we measured serum lipocalin-2, cathepsin S and chemerin levels in 903 Chinese subjects by ELISA. Among the study population, 436 patients are with B-mode ultrasound-proven NAFLD and 467 controls. Levels of lipocalin-2, but not cathepsin S and chemerin, were significantly elevated in NAFLD versus control [lipocalin-2, 89.67 ± 4.47 vs. 68.70 ± 3.65 ng/mL (p < 0.001)]. After stepwise linear regression analysis adjusting for potential cofounders, further revealed that serum lipocalcin-2 was an independent predictor of NAFLD in whole cohort (standardized β = 0.114, t = 2.347, p = 0.02). Lipocalin-2 levels correlated with insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) and inflammation (CRP) in whole cohorts and NAFLD, whereas cathepsin S and chemerin only correlated positively with insulin resistance and inflammation in whole cohorts. Our results indicated that circulating lipocalin-2, produced by adipocytes, are elevated and may contribute to the development of NAFLD. Serum lipocalin-2, which correlates with inflammation and insulin resistance, may have a direct pathogenic link to disease progression.
