Clinical significance of hyperechogenic focal lesions of the cirrhotic liver. A review was made of the ultrasonographic (US) examinations performed over the period 1981-1986 27 cirrhotic patients with hyperechoic liver lesions were identified, whose diagnoses had been made by means of either US-guided percutaneous biopsy, or laparoscopy, or autopsy. In 24 patients hepatocellular carcinomas nodules (HCC) were found, associated with cirrhosis, while in 3 cases only cirrhosis was seen. In the above mentioned 3 cases, a 2-year US follow-up showed no variation in the size of the nodules. These data confirm the importance of US in the screening of risk HCC patients, and point out that--however small--hyperechoic lesions in a cirrhotic liver suggest the cancerization of the substanding cirrhosis.
