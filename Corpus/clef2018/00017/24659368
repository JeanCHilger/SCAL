The impact of left ventricular hypertrophy on survival in candidates for liver transplantation. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) occurs in 12% to 30% of patients with cirrhosis however, its prognostic significance is not well studied. We assessed the association of LVH with survival in patients undergoing a liver transplantation (LT) evaluation. We performed a multicenter cohort study of patients undergoing an evaluation for LT. LVH was defined with transthoracic echocardiography. The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. LVH was present in 138 of 485 patients (28%). Patients with LVH were older, more likely to be male and African American, and were more likely to have hypertension. Three hundred forty-five patients did not undergo transplantation (212 declined, and 133 were waiting): 36 of 110 patients with LVH (33%) died, whereas 57 of 235 patients without LVH (24%) died (P = 0.23). After LT, 8 of 28 patients with LVH (29%) died over the course of 3 years, whereas 9 of 112 patients without LVH (8%) died (P = 0.007). This finding was independent of conventional risk factors for LVH, and all deaths for patients with LVH occurred within 9 months of LT. No clinical or demographic characteristics were associated with mortality among LVH patients. In conclusion, the presence of LVH is associated with an early increase in mortality after LT, and this is independent of conventional risk factors for LVH. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and identify factors associated with mortality after transplantation to improve outcomes.
