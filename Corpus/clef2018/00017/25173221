Natural clearance of hepatitis C virus in 96 patients with infection acquired by blood transfusion from a single donor in Guizhou. To investigate the clinical features and rate of natural viral clearance in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection acquired by blood transfusion from a single donor.Ninety-six patients who acquired HCV infection between January 1998 and December 2002, upon receipt of donated blood from a single infected individual in Guizhou,were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. Patients were clinically assessed to determine levels of anti-HCV antibodies, HCV RNA and biochemical indicators of liver function,as well as features of liver structure (by abdominal B ultrasonography and elastography). HCV genetic testing was used to determine the virus genotype. Measurement data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Count data were analyzed by the x² test,with P less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance.All 96 patients tested positive for antiHCV antibodies. The majority of patients (70% 34:33 male:female) had HCV RNA more than or equal to 1.0 * 103 copies/ml. All patients carried the same HCV genotype as the single blood donor:genotype lb. The overall rate of natural HCV clearance was 30.2%. but males had a significantly lower rate (19.0% (8/42) vs. females:38.9% (21/54)The course of blood transfusion acquired HCV infection is largely unknown and natural viral clearance rate may be associated with sex-and age-related factors.
