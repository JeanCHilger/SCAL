Value of ultrasound-guided cytopuncture in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Ultrasonically guided fine needle aspiration biopsy cytologies (external diameter inferior to 1 mm) were carried out in 28 patients with proved hepatocellular carcinoma. In all cases, the diagnosis of malignant involvement of the liver was firmly established by cytological examination. A correct diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was made in 26 of 28 patients (sensitivity = 93%). The specificity of the procedure was 100%. No complications were observed. The present study shows that fine needle aspiration biopsy under ultrasound guidance is a safe and accurate diagnostic procedure in hepatocellular carcinoma even associated with cirrhosis.
