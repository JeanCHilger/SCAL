Adverse effects of preoperative hepatic artery chemoembolization for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a retrospective comparison of 138 liver resections. During the past 8 years we have treated 268 patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) total extirpation of the tumor was carried out in 138. Thirty-one of the patients with resectable HCCs had already been treated with transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) of the liver before they were referred to us. The clinical values of preoperative TAE were retrospectively evaluated for those 31 patients and for the remaining 107 patients without TAE. There were no substantial differences between the two study groups in the clinical and histopathologic backgrounds. No differences were observed in the extent of liver resection, estimated blood loss during surgery, and operation time. During surgery, however, troublesome intra-abdominal complications relevant to TAE were encountered in 15 patients, and detection of tumors was impossible, even with intraoperative ultrasonography, in five patients in the group with TAE. Such findings were not present in any of the patients without TAE. Postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were similar in the two groups. There was no significant difference in the rate of recurrence of tumor in the liver, but the recurrence time was significantly shorter in the group with TAE. TAE did not improve the long-term survival rates in patients either with or without cirrhosis. Results of our study seem to indicate that preoperative TAE is meaningless in the treatment of resectable HCCs and therefore should be avoided, particularly in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver.
