Evolution of the echographic picture in primary liver tumor associated with cirrhosis. To study the sonographic (US) evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma, 53 tumors in 45 untreated patients were observed regularly with real-time US for a period of 6 to 56 months. At the beginning, 25 tumors were hypoechoic, 18 isoechoic, 4 hyperechoic, and 6 had mixed hypo/hyper echo patterns. At the follow-up, 7 initially hypoechoic tumors had changed to hyperechoic or to mixed echo patterns 8 hypoechoic tumors had become isoechoic
