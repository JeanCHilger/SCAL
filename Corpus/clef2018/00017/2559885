Intratumoral echo-guided injection of interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells in hepatocellular carcinoma. Interleukin-2 has proved to be effective for the intralesional treatment of tumors of the bladder. There are examples in literature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells infused in the hepatic artery. We decided to check the effects of echo-guided intralesional injection of these cells in this disease. We treated 5 patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma, following cirrhosis in 4 cases the mass had a diameter less than 3 cm (small HCC) while in the remaining case it measured 7 cm. Tumor size remained unchanged in 3 of the 4 small HCC, and increased only slightly in the other (over a period of 10 months). This would appear to indicate that treatment halted neoplasm growth or at least slowed it down. The echo pattern of the lesions changed, with a constant reduction in echogenicity. Finally, in multiple control biopsies, fibrosis, present in only one case before treatment, was found fairly constantly after treatment. There were no significant side effects, apart from slight water retention in one patient. On the basis of our preliminary results, we consider it worthwhile continuing this study to establish the most suitable IL-2 doses and analyze in more detail the modifications induced in the neoplasm.
