Size relations of the spleen and lymph nodes in normal and pathologic processes. 63 spleens and 79 lymph node specimens, both normal and diseased, were measured in three planes. The ratio of length to width and to thickness was established to determine if characteristic changes in proportion - in connection with the expansion of the respective organs - are evident. The healthy spleens did not differ markedly from the diseased ones, whereas striking differences were obvious among the diseased lymph nodes. Lymph nodes involved in malignant disease appeared globular, whereas those involved in inflammatory disease showed a longish and flattened shape.
