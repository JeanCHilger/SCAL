Cystic kidneys in children. From 1976-1987 a total of 26 infants and children with polycystic kidney disease were treated at the Children's Hospital of the Medical School Hannover. 13 of them suffered from infantile recessive polycystic kidney disease (IRPKD), and 13 from adult dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). IRPKD was diagnosed at a median age of 0.33 years (range 1 day-13 years), ADPKD at 6.0 years (3 days-14 years). Of those with IRPKD two infants died from bacterial infection and two others developed terminal renal insufficiency at the age of 8 years, while the others are living and 1-20 years old. All those suffer from severe arterial hypertension and have reduced renal function, but only 5 developed signs of liver fibrosis. Of those with ADPKD one infant died from sepsis and renal insufficiency, while the others are well and now 2-17 years old. Only one child needs an antihypertensive treatment. The most important criteria to differentiate IRKPD and ADKPD in children are the genetic transmission, age of first manifestation, hypertension and renal function. The prognosis is much more severe in IRPKD than in ADPKD, but is not as infaust in IRPKD as often assumed.
