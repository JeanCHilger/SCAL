Giant iatrogenic splenic pseudocyst. Partial splenic arterial embolization was used to treat hypersplenism in a 10-year-old boy with portal hypertension secondary to congenital hepatic fibrosis. After embolization the spleen remained enlarged, but the boy's platelet count increased and his variceal bleeding ceased. One month later, he returned with vomiting and an abdominal mass. Computed tomography showed a large cyst of the spleen with a small rim of residual splenic tissue. Percutaneous drainage with ultrasound guidance yielded 2,800 mL of brown fluid. Wedge-shaped infarctions are described early after splenic embolization, and these areas eventually fibrose and contract. In this case, the embolization resulted in splenic necrosis and liquefaction with pseudocyst formation. This unusual complication was effectively treated without surgery.
