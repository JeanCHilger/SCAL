A case of neurogenic pulmonary edema with repeated deterioration due to subarachnoid hemorrhage. A 55-year-old male was admitted to our hospital for subarachnoid hemorrhage complicated with liver cirrhosis on Jan. 8th, 1988. Chest X-ray film on admission showed bilateral infiltrative shadows, which disappeared on Jan. 10th. However the same type of shadow reappeared on Jan. 12th. Although he received surgical treatment for subarachnoid hemorrhage, pulmonary deterioration occurred five times until the 21st post-operative day. These changes responded to diuretics and control of water balance. Cardiac function evaluated by ultrasonocardiography and right cardiac catheterization, and the composition and amount of plasma protein concentration were within normal limits. Although the mechanism of repeated appearance of the shadow was not clear, the edema was thought to be neurogenic. As this case showed, the control of water balance and the use of diuretics are essential for treatment of this neurogenic pulmonary edema.
