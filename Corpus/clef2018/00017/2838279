Fibrolamellar carcinoma of the liver: CT, ultrasound and angiography. Case report. Two cases of fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) of the liver reported here illustrate that this rare neoplasm is a distinct variant of the usual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It occurs in younger individuals, is unrelated to liver cirrhosis and has a remarkably better prognosis due to a higher surgical resectability rate. It is sonographically hyperechoic and demonstrates angiographic and computed tomographic features of a very vascular tumor. The differential diagnosis includes focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatic adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and hemangioma.
