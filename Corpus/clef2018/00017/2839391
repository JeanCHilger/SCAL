Laparoscopically directed fine needle aspiration for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: a safe and accurate technique. Although ultrasonography and computerized tomography have been useful in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, the extent of metastases and the presence of cirrhosis are not identified by these techniques before surgery. We studied 27 cases of presumptive hepatocellular carcinoma by means of laparoscopy and fine needle aspiration. Fine needle aspirates provided positive diagnoses of hepatocellular carcinoma in all patients. Laparoscopy complements imaging studies and allows selection of patients amenable to hepatic resection.
