Role of ultrasonography and ultrasound-guided puncture in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. This retrospective study was undertaken to assess the place and efficacy of ultrasonography, and ultrasound-guided biopsy in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in a series of 34 patients. The sonographic signs were not specific, as tumor patterns were very different from one case to another there were no pathognomonic signs of hepatocellular carcinoma in comparison with hepatic metastases. Tissue characterization of the liver abnormalities was obtained by percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsies. In our experience, ultrasonography has a double role: demonstration of hepatic nodules, particularly in high risk patients (cirrhosis)
