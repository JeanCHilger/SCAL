Conditions for functioning of an effective peritoneo-jugular shunt. Doppler infrared thermographic study. A peritoneo-jugular shunt clinically effective in a 48 years old male patient with cirrhosis, is explored concomitantly with Doppler and infrared thermography. In this patient, without clinical signs of ascites, these two non invasive methods associated to sensitization techniques (decubitus, deep breathing, abdominal binding) specify the functioning conditions of the valve and permit to consider a close monitoring of these patients for screening and prevention of the frequent, asymptomatic obstruction of their shunt.
