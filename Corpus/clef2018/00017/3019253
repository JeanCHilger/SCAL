A case of hepatoma with a remarkable response to gamma-interferon administration. A 59-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with complaints of general fatigue, abdominal distension and edema in the legs in February, 1985. Laboratory findings were as follows: GOT 152 IU/l, GPT 129 IU/l, LDH 555 IU/l, ALP 1147 IU/l, gamma-GTP 413 IU/l, T.-Bil 2.1 mg/dl and AFP 422.6 ng/ml. Multiple SOLs were recognized in both lobes of the liver by abdominal CT scan and echography. Interferon-gamma (gamma-IFN: KW-2202 Kyowa Hakko Co.) therapy was started in March from an initial dose of 1 X 10(6) units and was increased up to 4 X 10(6) units, 2 X 10(6) units being administered as a maintenance therapy for 12 weeks. The tumors became remarkably smaller in size, AFP was decreased to 38.8 ng/ml, and PR was obtained. The only side effect was temporary fever. The patient was subsequently followed without gamma-IFN at an outpatient clinic for about 100 days, but finally died due to rupture of esophageal varices and hepatic failure.
