Effects of propranolol and nitroglycerin on cephalad collateral venous flow in patients with cirrhosis: evaluation using transesophageal real-time two-dimensional Doppler echography. We used transesophageal real-time two-dimensional Doppler echography (TE2DD) to assess the effects of propranolol (n = 18, 6 mg each) and nitroglycerin (n = 18, 0.5 mg each) on blood flow in the intercostal veins, azygos vein, thoracic aorta, and esophagogastric varices. The primary disease in all of the patients was liver cirrhosis. Propranolol infusion markedly reduced the flow velocity in the varices, intercostal vein, azygos vein, and thoracic aorta (-24%, -41%, -34%, and -24%, respectively). It also significantly reduced the blood flow volume index (BFVI), defined as mean velocity in cm/sec X the square of the diameter in cm2 of both the azygos vein and the aorta (-34%, -21%, respectively). Nitroglycerin infusion did not cause significant changes in the hemodynamics of the above vessels, because the hemodynamic responses to the drug differed from individual to individual. The BFVI of the azygos vein correlated well with the azygos venous flow measured by the conventional thermodilution technique (r = 0.79, p less than 0.01). TE2DD appears to be a useful method for studying the hemodynamics of ascending collaterals in patients with portal hypertension.
