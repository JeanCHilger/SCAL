Ultrasonographic findings with bleeding and nonbleeding esophageal varices. Real time ultrasonography was carried out in 49 cirrhotic patients within 10 days of esophagoscopy, and in 20 normal subjects. Among the cirrhotic patients, 42 had varices and 18 of these had hematemesis within 3 months of study. The varices were graded 0 to 4+ endoscopically the diameter of the portal vein, the splenic vein, the hepatic artery, and the maximal length of the spleen were determined on ultrasound. In addition, portal collateral veins and the sudden amputation of portal vein branches in the liver were identified when present. There was a significant correlation of the diameter of the portal vein and the maximal spleen length with the magnitude of varices on endoscopy
