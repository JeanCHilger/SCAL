Clinico-echographic parallels in diffuse liver diseases. The authors stressed the point that investigations conducted by them, showed a high value of ultrasonic scanning in the recognition of diffuse liver lesions. Ultrasonic diagnosis of persisting and active forms of chronic hepatitis can be only hypothetical because of the absence of pathognomonic echographic signs of this type of pathology. On echography fatty degeneration was characterized by hepatomegaly, blurred liver contours, preserved elasticity of the organ and diffuse homogeneous enhancement of its structure. Diffuse focal enhancement of the echo structure of the liver, its irregular surface, and an increase in the liver elasticity and echo permeability indicated a possibility of liver cirrhosis, and the combination of these signs with ascites or dilatation of the portal veins confirmed it. There was no relationship of an ultrasonic picture with clinical symptoms and laboratory findings.
