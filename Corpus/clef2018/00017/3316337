Frequency-dependent ultrasonic differentiation of normal and diffusely diseased liver. The attenuation coefficient in 38 pathologically graded in vitro liver specimens was measured over a frequency range from 1.25-8 MHz and fitted to the power law model. The attenuation in the normal group (n = 17) exhibited a frequency dependence of the form 0.399f1.139 in the mild disease group (n = 13), it exhibited a dependence of the form 0.395f1.212
