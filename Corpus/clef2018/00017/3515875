Sonography of diffuse benign liver disease: accuracy of pattern recognition and grading. Sonograms of 110 patients were compared to recently performed liver biopsies for evaluation of the accuracy of sonography in predicting the type (pattern) of pathology and its grade of severity (mild, moderate, or severe) in a wide variety of diffuse liver processes. There are two distinct, abnormal sonographic patterns: the fatty-fibrotic pattern seen primarily with cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, and/or fatty infiltration, and the centrilobular pattern seen primarily with acute hepatitis. Sonography was 88% accurate in assigning the correct pattern to the corresponding pathology (sensitivity 89%, specificity 86%, p less than 0.001). The degree of accuracy was dependent on the grade of pathologic severity, with mild disease offering the greatest difficulty moderate and severe diseases were accurately detected and placed in the correct pattern in all cases. Sonographic grading of the severity of disease was far less precise (63% overall). This study showed that sonography can distinguish between two abnormal sonographic patterns of diffuse benign liver disease as well as between normal and abnormal patterns.
