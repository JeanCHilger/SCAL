Frequency-demodulated US: evaluation in the liver. Work in progress. Frequency modulated (FM) imaging is a new ultrasound (US) modality that uses pulse-echo signal instantaneous frequency in addition to the conventional envelope information. Eight features of the FM image in nondiseased livers are described. The technique is evaluated in a study of 34 patients with biopsy-proved diffuse liver disease. Visual grading of FM US image features shows good correlation with levels of biopsy-graded hepatic fibrosis. Patients with diffuse parenchymal liver disease often exhibit evidence of the abnormality when FM liver imaging is used, while such evidence is not as well demonstrated with conventional envelope (AM) imaging.
