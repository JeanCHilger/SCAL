Noninvasive evaluation of hepatic fibrosis using frequency demodulation of ultrasound signals. A new ultrasound image can be produced by frequency demodulation (FM) of the conventional ultrasound signal. This new FM image appeared to produce a more accurate representation of the fine structure of the liver. The individual features of the FM image were correlated with hepatic portal fibrosis and cirrhosis on liver biopsy in 34 patients with minimal hepatic fat and sinusoidal collagen. An overall ultrasound score correlated with portal fibrosis (r = 0.788 P less than 0.001). We conclude that the FM image may be helpful in measuring and following the progression of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease.
