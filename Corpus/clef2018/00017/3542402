Magnetic resonance imaging in young adults with cystic fibrosis. It is difficult to distinguish between atelectasis, mucoid impaction, and peribronchial inflammation on chest roentgenograms (CXR) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Differentiation between hilar adenopathy and prominent pulmonary vessels is also sometimes difficult. We studied 16 young adults with CF using both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CXR to evaluate the usefulness of MRI in this clinical context. The same patients were studied with abdominal ultrasound and MRI for evaluation of the pancreas, gallbladder, liver, and spleen. The MRI was superior to CXR in detecting hilar and mediastinal adenopathy and in differentiating nodes from prominent vessels. It was useful in the evaluation of bronchiectasis. The CXR was superior for assessing infiltrates, hyperinflation, sternal bowing, volume loss, and hilar retraction. The MRI was only slightly better than sonography in depicting fatty infiltration of the pancreas. The modalities were equally effective in detecting hepatosplenomegaly and signs of portal hypertension. Gallbladder evaluation was far superior with sonography.
