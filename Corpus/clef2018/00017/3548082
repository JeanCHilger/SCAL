Sonographic comparative studies of the portal vascular system before and following endoscopic sclerosing of esophageal varices. On the occasion of 35 episodes of oesophageal injection therapy in which partly the intravascular and partly the perivascular injection technique were used, real time sonographic measurements were performed on the veins of the portal system immediately before and after sclerotherapy. In the case of intravascular injection, both the portal and the splenic vein and the confluens of the splenic and the superior mesenteric vein showed an increase in diameter, whereas in the cases of perivascular injection such changes were minimal or absent. The practical applicability of such sonographic calibrations could possibly lie in certain conclusions that could be drawn concerning the degree of vascular compression or obliteration during each session of sclerotherapy.
