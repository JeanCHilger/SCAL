Primary lymphoma of the liver: an uncommon disease. Ultrasonic and x-ray computed tomographic aspects. Apropos of a case with review of the literature. Although the very rare primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is resectable and responds to chemotherapy it has a very poor prognosis since the outcome was rapidly fatal in 7 of the 11 cases reported in the literature. Particular features in a patient with a primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of cirrhotic liver were the association of portal hypertension and portal thrombosis related to tumor invasion. Findings on ultrasound imaging and histologic diagnosis from guided needle puncture biopsy appear to be previously unreported aspects of this affection.
