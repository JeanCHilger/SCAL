Accessory ultrasonographic findings in chronic liver disease: diameter of splenic and hepatic arteries, fasting gallbladder volume, and course of left portal vein. We have assessed the incidence and significance of changes in the caliber of the splenic and hepatic arteries, in fasting gallbladder volume, and in the intrahepatic course of the left portal vein in a group of 46 patients affected by chronic liver disease (24 with chronic active hepatitis and 22 with liver cirrhosis). Thirty normal subjects were examined as a control group. Mean diameters of the splenic and hepatic arteries were significantly greater in cases of liver cirrhosis than in the control group. In the case of chronic active hepatitis, only the splenic artery proved significantly enlarged in comparison with the control group. These results demonstrate that caliber modification occurs in the splenic and hepatic arteries during chronic liver disease. In particular, changes in the splenic artery precede the onset of clinically evident portal hypertension. Gallbladder volume was significantly increased in patients affected by liver cirrhosis. Finally, statistical analysis did not reveal any significant difference in the angles formed by the transverse and longitudinal tracts of the left portal vein in controls and in subjects with liver disease.
