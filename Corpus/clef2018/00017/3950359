Treatment of Budd-Chiari syndrome by dorsocranial liver resection and direct hepatoatrial anastomosis. Since 1980 an operation which reestablishes the blood outflow from occluded hepatic veins was performed in 7 patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome by one of us (A. Senning). Using extracorporeal circulation a dorsocranial cylindrical resection of the liver including the confluence of the occluded hepatic veins was performed by transcaval approach. The incised right atrium was sutured around the resected liver area. There was one intraoperative death. In 6 patients with a mean postoperative follow-up of 19.2 months (4-42 months), the patency of hepatoatrial anastomosis was documented by angiography or Doppler-2d-echocardiography. Four patients are free of symptoms and signs of Budd-Chiari syndrome. In one of two patients with associated cirrhosis compression of inferior vena cava reoccurred and in another patient esophageal varices persist. We conclude, that the hepatoatrial anastomosis is an effective treatment of Budd-Chiari syndrome.
