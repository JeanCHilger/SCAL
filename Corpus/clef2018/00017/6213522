Sonography of the upper abdomen in cystic fibrosis (author's transl). Ultrasound scans of the upper abdomen were carried out in fifty patients with cystic fibrosis (age 2 to 26 years). 38% showed an abnormal hepatic sonogram. On eight occasions it was possible to confirm these changes by a liver biopsy. In 14% there was homogenous increase in liver echoes. 22% showed an non-homogeneous liver structure due to fibrotic and cirrhotic changes and cholangitis. Four of these patients had splenomegaly due to portal hypertension. 85% of the pancreatic scans which could be evaluated showed small pancreases with high echoes. Cholelithiasis was not present in any. Sonography of the upper abdomen is the method of choice for evaluating the liver, biliary system, pancreas and spleen.
