Sonographic findings in the Cruveilhier-von Baumgarten syndrome (author's transl). Portal hypertension is the most common complication of cirrhosis of the liver and leads to a reversal of blood flow and re-opening of pre-formed portal-systemic collaterals. Amongst a variety of possible hepato-fugal collaterals, the Cruveilhier-von Baumgarten syndrome, consisting of the re-opening of umbilical veins, is a rare variant. It has been possible to demonstrate this clearly by sonography in 18 patients.
