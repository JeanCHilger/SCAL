Ultrasonography of alcoholic liver disease with histological correlation. In alcoholic liver disease (fatty infiltration, alcoholic cirrhosis), the liver is diffusely abnormal on ultrasound. Changes in size, dilatation of the hepatic veins, and ascites may also occur. The authors conducted a histological correlation of these abnormalities in 22 alcoholic patients and 16 controls, grading the changes on a scale of 0 to 4+ for fat, fibrosis, and necrosis and noting tumor whenever present. Ultrasound detected abnormality in 21 cases (sensitivity = 95%) and correctly identified 15 controls (specificity = 94%). Of the 5 tumors seen, 4 hepatomas were detected and biopsied and 1 metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma was missed. Applications of commercially available A-scan module are considered and its limitations discussed. With the exception of minimal change (1+ fat or fibrosis), ultrasound detected many of the pathological changes seen in alcoholic liver disease.
