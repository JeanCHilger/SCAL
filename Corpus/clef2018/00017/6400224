In vivo stochastic ultrasonic characterisation of abdominal tissues. Two experimental systems have been used for digitization of waveforms backscattered from normal and pathologic abdominal tissues in vivo. Initial studies were performed with a digitization system which allowed only A-mode display of areas of interest before and during waveform recording. A new interactive system allows for digitization of waveforms from areas of interest in abdominal organs, selected with the aid of real-time B-mode images of a mechanical sector scanner. Statistical parameters of these waveforms, derived in the amplitude and frequency domains, show potential utility for diagnosis of diffuse diseases of the liver and spleen.
