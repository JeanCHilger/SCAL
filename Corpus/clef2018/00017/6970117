Percutaneous liver biopsy in difficult cases simplified by CT or ultrasonic localization. Repeat liver biopsy guided by CT and ultrasound was performed in ten prospectively selected patients with chronic liver disease, small liver size, and a previous unsuccessful biopsy. Biopsy sites selected by both radiographic techniques were essentially similar and within 1 cm of each other. The bulk of the liver was located more posteriorly and superiorly than expected, explaining the failure of the previous unsuccessful biopsies. Adequate cores of liver 1-2.5 cm in length were easily obtained with radiologic guidance. This technique is especially useful in patients with chronic active hepatitis complicated by cirrhosis.
