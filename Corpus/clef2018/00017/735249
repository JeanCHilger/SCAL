Experiences with ultrasound hepatography in the A picture method in the diagnosis of liver metastases. In 600 patients by means of the A-picture method ultra-sound investigations of the liver were performed in order to find metastases of the liver. After an intermediate evaluation of 120 patients anatomical control findings by laparoscopy, operation and section are present. In 88% the result of the ultra-sound investigation proved as correct. False positive findings were provoked above all by the coarse-nodular liver cirrhosis. Despite certain restrictions the ultra-sound investigation of the liver is an important diagnostic remedy to find liver metastases, since it is painless, simple and harmless.
