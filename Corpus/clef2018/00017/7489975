Paraumbilical vein patency in cirrhosis: effects on hepatic hemodynamics evaluated by Doppler sonography. Doppler sonographic portal vein parameters are used for the noninvasive evaluation of portal hypertension in cirrhosis. The patency of a paraumbilical vein is a rather frequent finding in cirrhosis, which may affect hepatic hemodynamics and function. We evaluated portal and hepatic arterial parameters in 184 cirrhotic patients with and without a patent paraumbilical vein and the relationships with paraumbilical blood flow. A patent paraumbilical vein was found in 33.7% of patients. The prevalence was higher (56.8%) in Child C patients. Portal blood flow velocity (PBV) (10.8 +/- 2.2 vs. 9.8 +/- 2.4 cm/sec P < .01) and volume (PBF) (995.0 +/- 383.8 vs. 811.6 +/- 318.7 mL/min
