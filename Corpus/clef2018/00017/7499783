Functional hepatic flow and Doppler-assessed total hepatic flow in control subjects and in patients with cirrhosis. Functional hepatic flow and total hepatic flow were determined by non-invasive techniques in 32 patients with cirrhosis and in 32 paired control subjects. Functional hepatic flow was measured by the hepatic clearance of D-sorbitol, while total hepatic flow was determined by pulsed echo-Doppler, as the sum of portal and hepatic arterial blood flow. Functional hepatic flow was significantly reduced in patients with cirrhosis (927 +/- 314 vs. 1287 +/- 315 p < 0.0001), while total hepatic flow was slightly increased (1511 +/- 540 vs. 1261 +/- 321 in controls
