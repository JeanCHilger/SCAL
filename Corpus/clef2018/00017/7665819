Synchronous multicentric development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Recently, the multicentric origin of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been recognized, but its clinical importance has still not yet been clarified. The histological characteristics of small hyperechoic HCCs coexisting in 44 consecutively resected Japanese patients whose main HCCs were < 5.0 cm in size were studied. Twelve small hyperechoic HCCs were found and classified into the following two groups: eight nodules in seven patients (15.9%) were early-stage HCC, and four nodules in four patients (9.1%) were more advanced HCC. Thus, early-stage HCC comprised 66.7% of the small echogenic HCCs. Eight HCCs detected as small hyperechoic lesions (found in 15.9% of the patients) showed varying degrees of fatty change yet proved to be well differentiated and retained the preexisting liver structure of either associated liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis. Moreover, the histologic characteristics of the eight early-stage HCCs were different from those of the main HCCs. In conclusion, approximately 15% of HCCs in Japanese patients may have a synchronous multicentric origin, and small hyperechoic lesions should be carefully evaluated. However, in the United States or other areas where the occurrence of fatty liver is common, that advice for small hyperechoic lesions may be overly cautious.
