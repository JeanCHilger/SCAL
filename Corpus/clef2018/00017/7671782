Hemorrhage caused by duodenal varices. A 53-year-old man had been passing tarry stools and bright red blood per rectum for 6 days. He had a history of pyloroplasty for duodenal ulcers, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, stage B in Child's classification, a Le Veen shunt for ascites, grade I oesophageal varices and several episodes of intestinal bleeding of uncertain cause on repeated endoscopies. Haemoglobin levels was now 4.4 g/dl. Neither oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy nor colposcopy, radiological examination of the small intestine nor scintigraphy discovered the source of bleeding. Computed tomography revealed varices in the horizontal part of the duodenum, confirmed by arteriography.At a second endoscopy, this time with a long scope, acute bleedings were seen in the venous convolutions and stopped with 4 ml Polidocanol. Bleeding recurred after 10 days, thought to be due to persisting portal hypertension. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) was inserted to lower the pressure. Colour-coded Doppler examination at the time of another bleeding 10 weeks later demonstrated occlusion of the TIPSS. It was re-opened by balloon catheter dilatation, since when there have been no further episodes of bleeding.The implantation of a TIPSS is a new causative treatment for recurrent bleeding from ectopic varices due to portal hypertension that cannot be treated by endoscopy.
