Portal hemodynamic changes from TIPS--evaluation with pulse Doppler method. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was applied in three patients with Child C liver cirrhosis. Portal venous pressure was reduced by an average of 10.7 mmHg, and results such as the disappearance of esophageal varices and reduction in ascites were obtained. The portal hemodynamics of these three patients was observed before and after TIPS using the pulse Doppler method. When portal hemodynamics in the main portal vein was examined before TIPS, it was found that the mean blood flow velocity had decreased, the blood flow volume was reduced and the cross-sectional area of the vein had increased. The congestion index was high and there was definite congestion of the portal venous system. After TIPS, the blood flow velocity and volume increased, the cross-sectional area of the vein was reduced and the congestion index was lower. Congestion of the portal venous system was improved in these three patients and the clinical efficacy of TIPS was proven by these results. If the stent can be detected sonographically, stent patency is easily confirmed with the pulse Doppler method which is usefull examination technique for follow-up of patients undergoing TIPS.
