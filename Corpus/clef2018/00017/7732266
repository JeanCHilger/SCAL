Sonographic features of portal hypertension in schistosomiasis mansoni. The diagnostic value of real-time sonography in the study of portal hypertension was assessed in 66 patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis mansoni, all with Symmers's fibrosis and esophageal varices. Seventy-one individuals without schistosomiasis were selected as controls. The inner diameters of the portal vessels were measured by sonography in all patients and controls: splenoportography was also performed in the schistosomal group. Intra-splenic pressure was over 30 cm of water in 44 of 60 patients with schistosomiasis. The upper limit of normality for portal vessel diameters was set through receiver operating characteristic curve at 12 mm for portal vein, 9 mm for splenic vein at splenic hilus, and 9 mm for superior mesenteric vein. The best discriminative vein for the diagnosis of portal hypertension was the splenic vein followed by the portal vein. A direct correlation was observed between the diameter of the splenic vein, measured by sonography, and the intra-splenic pressure. Except for the paraumbilical and mesenteric veins, more frequently identified by sonography, there was no statistical difference in the frequency of visualization of splanchnic vessels by sonography or splenoportography.
