Relationship between peripheral portal blood flow and liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis. Pulsed Doppler ultrasonographic study. The relationship between portal hemodynamics and liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis remains unclear.Using pulsed Doppler ultrasonography, we investigated portal hemodynamics in the trunk and the intrahepatic peripheral vessels and its relation to liver function in cirrhotic patients.The portal blood flow in the right anterior branch (RAB) in cirrhotic patients (n = 40) was significantly lower (p < 0.01) than that in normal subjects (n = 40). In the cirrhotic patients the portal blood flow in the RAB was significantly correlated with the values of serum albumin, total bilirubin, cholesterol, cholinesterase, prothrombin time, and ICG R-15, and that in group C (Child's grading) was significantly decreased (p < 0.01) compared with that in group A. No such difference was found in the main portal vein, the right posterior branch, or the umbilical portion of the left portal vein.The decrease in blood flow in the RAB is closely related to the impairment of liver function in cirrhotic patients.
