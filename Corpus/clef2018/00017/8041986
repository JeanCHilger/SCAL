Right to left shunts in the adult. Right to left shunts in the adult in their usual location are either intraarticular or intrapulmonary, and are often congenital. The acquired intrapulmonary shunt of the cirrhotic is now well defined by the hepatopulmonary syndrome. The major complication of right to left shunts are paradoxical pulmonary emboli which are often more severe than haemoptysis or chronic hypoxia. The diagnosis of intracardiac shunts as well as intrapulmonary shunts is now easier, thanks to transoesophageal ultrasound associated with contrast. Pulmonary angiography enables the treatment of arteriovenous fistula to be carried out by embolisation, and also avoids any surgery.
