Transesophageal echocardiography of right atrial metastasis of a hepatocellular carcinoma. Antemortem diagnosis of cardiac metastases of a hepatocellular carcinoma is rarely observed. In a 52-year-old female patient with a history of posthepatitic cirrhosis and partial hepatectomy, transthoracic echocardiography brought to light a mass in the right atrium. After location and characterization of the tumor by transesophageal echocardiography, a transvenous biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of metastasis of a hepatocellular carcinoma.
