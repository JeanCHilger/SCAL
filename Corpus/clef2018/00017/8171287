Portal venous flow and follow-up in patients with liver disease and healthy subjects. Assessment with duplex Doppler. The evolution of portal venous flow in non-end-stage chronic liver disease with portal hypertension was assessed in 59 patients and compared with that in 55 control subjects and by means of duplex Doppler measurements by a single observer. All patients were prospectively followed up, and a repeated measurement was performed in a subgroup of 23 patients. The mean (+/- SD) portal venous diameter and velocity of patients versus controls were 11.2 (+/- 2.0) mm versus 10.1 (+/- 1.4) mm (p < 0.0005) and 11.0 (+/- 4.2) cm/sec versus 13.9 (+/- 4.1) cm/sec (p < 0.0005). The portal venous flow did not differ: 671 (+/- 291) ml/min versus 652 (+/- 203) ml/min. Diagnosis, Child class, and grade of varices did not influence the portal flow. Patients were followed up during a median (+/- SD) time of 47 (+/- 17) months. Nineteen (32%) patients died, and 14 (23%) had a variceal hemorrhage. Survival and hemorrhage were not correlated with the portal venous flow. Subsequent measurements in 23 patients showed a significant decrease in portal venous flow in 5 patients who died during follow-up. This was not found in the patients who survived. It is concluded that portal venous flow in chronic liver disease with portal hypertension is stable for a long time in the evolution of chronic liver disease. The existence of a 'portostat' is postulated. Only in the terminal stage of liver disease can a reduction of the portal venous flow be detected.
