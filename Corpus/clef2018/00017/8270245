Echo-guided percutaneous ethanol injection in small hepatocellular carcinoma: personal experience. We performed echo-guided percutaneous ethanol injection of the lesion in 26 cirrhotic patients with 33 hepatocellular carcinomas measuring 3 cm in diameter or less. Post-treatment lesions had disappeared in 4 patients, while in the remaining 22 patients the echo pattern of the lesion had changed and biopsies were negative. Fifteen patients (follow-up 11-30 months) remain disease-free, while recurrence occurred between 3 and 36 months in 7 cases. Percutaneous ethanol injection was successfully repeated in 4 cases 5 patients died, 1 of HCC, 2 of esophageal variceal bleeding, and 2 of liver failure
