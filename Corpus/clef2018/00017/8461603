Management of gallstones in cirrhotic patients. 34 cirrhotic patients who underwent either cholecystectomy alone or in conjunction with common duct exploration were retrospectively reviewed. In Child A and B patients morbidity was low and there were no postoperative deaths. However, all patients who underwent additional cholecystectomy during the non-shunting operation for esophageal varices required blood transfusion. Cholecystectomy in Child C patients is frequently associated with considerable intraoperative bleeding and subsequent postoperative complications. In the 23 patients who were not operated upon for gallstones, no patients developed symptomatic biliary disease. Ultrasonographically, most of these gallstones were strongly suspected to be black stones. Elective surgical intervention for symptomatic Child A and B patients would normally be warranted, but hemorrhage and resulting complications due to additional cholecystectomy for asymptomatic gallstones during the non-shunting operation should be minimized. An additional cholecystectomy should be considered, provided such a cholecystectomy is thought to be easily performed judging from the degree of development of collateral circulation around the hepatoduodenal ligament and unless black stones are suspected ultrasonographically. For symptomatic gallstones in Child C patients every type of medical treatment should be attempted. After considering the bleeding tendency or ascites, percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage is considered to be one of the safest treatments.
