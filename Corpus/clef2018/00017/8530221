Ultrasonic dissection in resection of hepatocellular carcinoma. An ultrasonic dissector has been used in the resection of liver tumors and was found to be safe and efficient in noncirrhotic patients. Thirty-one (cirrhosis, 61%) liver resections for hepatoma treated with ultrasonic dissector were compared to 39 (cirrhosis, 74%) resections treated with finger fracture. We found that patients treated with an ultrasonic dissector versus those treated by finger fracture, had less blood loss (especially in cirrhotic liver), 836 +/- 593 cc vs 1348 +/- 1226 cc, more operative time, 337.6 +/- 100.5 min vs 197 +/- 92.8 min, more days of hospital stay 19.1 +/- 12.8 days vs 11.5 +/- 5.6 days and more days of removal of drains, 14.9 +/- 11.7 days vs 10.2 +/- 6.4 days. The morbidity, mortality, amount of blood transfusion and amount of drainage were quite similar between two groups.
