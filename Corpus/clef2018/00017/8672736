A comparison of Doppler flowmetry with conventional assessment of acute changes in hepatic blood flow. The validity and clinical relevance of Doppler flowmetry in measuring changes in regional blood flow are uncertain. In the present study we compared changes induced ketanserin in regional splanchnic blood flow as measured by Doppler flowmetry with changes in conventionally measured systemic and in hepatic haemodynamic indices estimated pharmacokinetically using indocyanine green. Fourteen patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and portal hypertension were evaluated. On multivariate analyses, significant associations were noted for only three indices: changes in estimated hepatic blood flow were predicted jointly by changes in flow in the main and right portal veins and hepatic artery (R2 = 0.80) changes in intrahepatic shunting (indocyanine green extraction) were predicted by changes in flow in the main and right portal veins (R2 = 0.55)
