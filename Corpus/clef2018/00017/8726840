Ciliated foregut cyst in cirrhotic liver. We encountered a patient with a ciliated hepatic foregut cyst with accompanying liver cirrhosis, which was hard to distinguish from well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. A lesion 2 cm in diameter was found in the subcapsular region of the medial segment of the liver. It was slightly hypoechoic on ultrasonography, of high attenuation on nonenhanced computed tomography (CT), of high intensity on T1-weighted spin echo images of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and of isointensity on T2-weighted spin echo images. It was not enhanced in the arterial phase images of MRI, and was shown as a complete perfusion defect on CT arterial portography. The cyst was enucleated and found to be filled with bloody mucinous fluid.
