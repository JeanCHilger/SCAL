Portal duplex sonography in liver cirrhosis. A useful supplement to endoscopic evaluation of bleeding risk of esophageal varices? In a prospective study we investigated whether the endoscopic assessment of the bleeding risk of esophageal varices could be supported by portal duplex sonography.Over the time span of 2.5 years (range, 13 +/- 5 months) we observed 41 patients with liver cirrhosis. During that time 17 patients had acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage and constituted the bleeding group, and the remaining 24 patients without a hemorrhage constituted the non-bleeding group.Within the bleeding group the mean portal blood flow velocity (Vm) was 0.093 +/- 0.033 m/sec, and the mean flow volume (Fm) was 0.371 +/- 0.173 l/min. Both results were significantly lower than the corresponding results of the nonbleeding group (p < 0.017 p < 0.05). By assuming cut-offs for Vm of 0.12 m/sec and for Fm of 0.420 l/min, we obtained a diagnostic sensitivity for hemorrhage of 0.88 and 0.65.Our results show that portal duplex sonography may improve the evaluation of endoscopically ascertained bleeding risk of esophageal varices.
