Pulmonary hypertension associated with portal hypertension. Apropos of 2 cases. The authors report the cases of two patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with portal hypertension. This is a rare association with a reported prevalence ranging from 0.25 to 0.73%. The diagnosis of portal hypertension preceded that of pulmonary hypertension by several years. The physiopathological mechanism of the latter is not well known although several hypotheses have been proposed. Treatment is only symptomatic. The prognosis is usually poor, the causes of death being related to complications of liver failure and/or portal hypertension or to those of pulmonary hypertension.
