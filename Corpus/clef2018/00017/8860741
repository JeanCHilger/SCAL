Color-coded Doppler sonography in the diagnosis of abdominal masses. A man in his forties was operated on for testicular cancer on the right-side with subsequent radiotherapy. Two years later, another tumor was found on the opposite side and surgically removed, followed by polychemotherapy. In the follow-up period, CT scanning and ultrasound showed large abdominal masses which were suspected to be metastases. Before initiating four cycles of chemotherapy, we checked their nature by Doppler sonography and found them to be recently developed abdominal varices due to an alcoholic liver cirrhosis. We were able to demonstrate that Doppler sonography can provide further information and is easy to use.
