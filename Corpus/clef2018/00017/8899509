Gallbladder varices: diagnosis in children with portal hypertension on duplex sonography. We established the prevalence of gallbladder varices (GBVs) as seen on duplex sonogram of children with portal hypertension. Fifty-five consecutive children with portal hypertension underwent duplex sonographic examination by an experienced sonologist who was blinded to clinical presentation. Forty children had extrahepatic portovenous obstruction (EHPVO), 12 had cirrhosis, and three had noncirrhotic portal hypertension. GBVs were seen on sonography in 10 of 40 children with EHPVO (25%), two of 12 children with cirrhosis (16.6%), and no children with noncirrhotic portal hypertension. Sonographic findings of GBVs were confirmed on duplex sonographic imaging. Among patients with EHPVO, GBVs did not correlate with size of esophageal varices, number of sessions of sclerotherapy, presence or absence of gastric varices, portal gastropathy, or splenorenal shunt placement. In cirrhotic patients, GBVs did not correlate with Child Pugh grade. Children with EHPVO have a higher incidence of developing GBVs. The clinical significance of GBVs is their propensity to bleed during biliary surgery thus, the operating surgeon should be made aware of them.
