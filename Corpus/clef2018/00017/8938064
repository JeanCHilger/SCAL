Early prenatal diagnosis of choledochal cyst. Unrecognized biliary tract obstruction due to choledochal cysts or biliary atresia can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis in utero of choledochal cyst allows prompt postnatal diagnostic evaluation and appropriate surgical therapy to be instituted early in life. This may minimize the potential complications of cholangitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure in infants with choledochal cysts.
