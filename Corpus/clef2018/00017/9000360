Portal hypertension in children and young adults: sonographic and color Doppler findings. Portal hypertension is a relatively uncommon pathologic condition in children and young adults in contrast with older adults. The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of sonography and color Doppler sonography in the diagnosis of portal hypertension in children and young patients and to evaluate the sonographic pattern of each disease. We reviewed 25 such patients who were younger than 30 years old and obtained the following sonographic findings: (1) liver cirrhosis: (a) multiple intrahepatic venovenous shunts in patients with primary Budd-Chiari syndrome and (b) intrahepatic vascular narrowing and nodular coarse parenchymal texture, with multiple very-high-echo spots along the portal vein in patients with Wilson disease (2) congenital hepatic fibrosis: marked and developed collaterals, wide periportal echogenic band, and a heterogeneous parenchymal texture comprised of multiple high echoes but without portal thrombus
