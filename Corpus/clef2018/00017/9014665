Surgery for biliary obstruction by tumour thrombus in primary liver cancer. Five patients with primary liver cancer presented with obstructive jaundice due to extension of tumour thrombus into the biliary ducts. Three patients had hepatocellular carcinoma, two of whom had alcoholic cirrhosis, and the other two had a peripheral cholangiocarcinoma. Preoperative diagnosis of biliary thrombus was best achieved by ultrasonography and computed tomography which showed peripheral hepatic tumour with dilated bile ducts containing dense material. All patients underwent liver resection associated with biliary exploration, clearance and T-tube drainage. Major hepatectomy was required in four cases. There were no postoperative deaths one patient developed a subphrenic collection of bile which was drained percutaneously. All patients survived more than a year
