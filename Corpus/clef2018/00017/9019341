Disorders of hepatic circulation and imaging with color doppler ultrasonography. The authors analyse disturbances of hepatic circulation and the possibilities of their imaging by colour Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) in combination with standard B two-dimensional imaging. The predominance of arterial perfusion in liver cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis, malign diseases of the liver, or extraluminal obstruction of portal vein are changes which can be imaged by means of high-quality colour Doppler imaging. CDU is a non-invasive method of evaluation of portal hypertension, namely of prehepatic, hepatic and posthepatic type. It is a method of investigation of the viability of the hepatic artery after transplantation of the liver, including that of surgical portocaval anastomoses and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts.
