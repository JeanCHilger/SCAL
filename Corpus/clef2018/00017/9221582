Treatment of liver tumors with ethanol injection. Ethanol injection into the focus by means of a thin needle under ultrasonographic guidance has become part of treatment of primary carcinoma of the liver-hepatocellular carcinoma. It is a palliative method suitable for the treatment of small foci of hepatocellular carcinoma in a uniocular or oligolocular form. The limiting factor are in particular the number of foci, their size, depth and stage of hepatic cirrhosis in the remainder of the live parenchyma. Treatment is well tolerated and the survival of patients, if they are properly selected, is similar as in surgical resection.
