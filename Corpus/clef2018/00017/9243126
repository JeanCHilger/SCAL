Prevalence and incidence of cholecystolithiasis in cirrhosis and relation to the etiology of liver disease. To assess prevalence and incidence of cholecystolithiasis in cirrhosis, 356 consecutive cirrhotics and 247 consecutive cases of chronic hepatitis without cirrhosis were studied by ultrasonography. Cholecystolithiasis was significantly more frequent in cirrhotics than in patients with chronic hepatitis (p < 0.001) after stratification for age and for alcohol abuse, and its prevalence in the former was affected by Child's class (p < 0.001) and duration (p < 0.001) of cirrhosis and was higher in HBsAg-negative as compared with HBsAg-positive cases (36.2 vs. 11.9%) and in patients with previous alcohol abuse (41.5 vs. 28.3%), while no difference was noted in relation to sex. By multivariate analysis, duration and Child's class of cirrhosis and HBsAg-negative status were statistically associated with cholecystolithiasis. One hundred and eighty-two of the 356 cirrhotic patients without gallstones at inclusion were followed prospectively, and 21 (11.5%) of them developed cholecystolithiasis, and duration of cirrhosis and past alcohol abuse were found to be independent risk factors for gallstone development by multivariate analysis. Cirrhosis is a significant risk factor for cholecystolithiasis, except for HBsAg-positive patients who have prevalence and incidence similar to noncirrhotics. Severity and duration of cirrhosis and previous alcohol abuse are associated with an increased risk of gallstone formation.
