Doppler ultrasound in the evaluation of cirrhotic patients: the prevalence of intrahepatic arteriovenous shunting, and implications for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. To establish the prevalence and significance of Doppler-detected hepatic arteriovenous shunting (AVS) in patients with compensated cirrhosis, 115 patients (mean age 55.4 +/- 12.47 SD y) were prospectively screened using real-time ultrasound with pulsed Doppler at 2.5 MHz to detect focal liver lesions and quantify AVS. Focal masses were biopsied and correlated with the US findings. All other patients had clinical follow-up and imaging for at least 12 months. AVS occurred in 28 of 115 (24.3%), and in 18 of 20 proven malignancies (90%) including 11 of 13 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (85%). However, 9 of 28 (32%) AVS (mean Doppler shift 2.73 +/- 1.51 [SD] kHz [range 0.6-5.41 kHz], n = 9) were in regions of fatty infiltration (4) or isolated (5), unassociated with malignancy. At a prevalence of 17.9% malignancy (11.3% due to hepatocellular carcinoma), specificity for malignancy increased with shunt velocity, from 76% (for mass alone), to 94.8% for mass with AVS, 96.8% for a mass with AVS of 1.75-2.4 kHz, and 100% for a mass with AVS > 2.4 kHz. Doppler US is useful in characterizing liver lesions in cirrhotic patients: the majority of malignant hepatic lesions are associated with AVS and specificity for malignancy increases with shunt velocity. However, isolated AVS or AVS associated with focal fat may be detected in 7.8% of compensated cirrhotics.
