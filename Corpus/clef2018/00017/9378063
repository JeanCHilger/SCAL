Refractory hydrothorax in primary biliary cirrhosis: successful treatment with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt. A 55-year-old woman with known primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) was hospitalized because of increasing dyspnoea. A year before she had for the first time experienced a right-sided pleural effusion which had to be drained every 4 weeks. Physical examination revealed dullness on percussion and greatly decreased breath sounds on auscultation over the entire right thorax. In addition there were signs of moderate ascites and leg oedema.Chest radiograph showed a homogeneous shadowing of the right thorax without mediastinal shift. Diagnostic thoracocentesis produced a serous effusion, a transudate on chemical analysis, comparable to the composition of the ascitic fluid. Bacteriological and cytological tests on both fluids were unremarkable.The right pleural effusion was presumed to be due to a hydrothorax from the ascites caused by portal hypertension associated with the PBC. Despite continuous diuretic treatment and thoracocentesis with albumin substitution every 3 days there was no improvement and implantation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) was performed. This effectively lowered portal pressure and markedly improved the patient's condition so that further thoracocentesis were no longer necessary. 3 weeks after TIPSS implantation she was discharged in good condition. Radiography 3 weeks later demonstrated continued reduction in the hydrothorax.Hydrothorax is a rare complication of liver cirrhosis. TIPSS implantation can provide lasting resolution and corresponding clinical improvement of a hydrothorax, especially in those conditions which are refractory to diuretic treatment and thoracocentesis.
