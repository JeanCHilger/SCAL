Long-term evaluation of interferon therapy in hepatitis C virus-associated cirrhosis: does IFN prevent development of hepatocellular carcinoma? During the course of long-term follow-up, we examined the efficacy of interferon (IFN) in the improvement of liver function and prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) associated cirrhosis patients. Fifty-five cirrhotic patients, in whom HCC nodules in the liver were not detected by ultrasonography (US) or computed tomography (CT), received 3 or 6 million units of human lymphoblastoid IFN daily for two weeks and 3 times a week for 22 weeks. Complete response (CR) was defined as normalization of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) together with negative HCV RNA at 6 months after IFN therapy completion. Any other pattern of response was defined as non-response (NR). After IFN therapy the patients were followed up every 1-3 months for at least 1 year (average follow-up period, about 40 months) with serological tests and US or CT. In the 8 CR patients, the serum ALT levels remained normal and HCV RNA remained negative. Platelet count, white blood cell count, serum albumin and zinc turbidity test have recovered to the normal range at final follow-up. Ten of the 47 patients with NR have developed HCC, whereas no patients with CR has developed HCC during follow-up. We conclude that IFN improves the liver function and may prevent the development of HCC even in cirrhotic patients who show CR to IFN therapy.
