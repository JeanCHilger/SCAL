An image analyzing system using an artificial neural network for evaluating the parenchymal echo pattern of cirrhotic liver and chronic hepatitis. To objectively evaluate the parenchymal echo pattern of cirrhotic liver and chronic hepatitis, we applied an image analyzing system (IAS) using a neural network. Autopsy specimens in a water tank (n = 13) were used to examine the relationship between the diameter of the regenerative nodule and the coarse score (CS) calculated by IAS. CS was significantly correlated with the diameter of the regenerative nodule (p < 0.0001, r = 0.966). CS is considered to be useful for evaluating the coarseness of the parenchymal echo pattern.
