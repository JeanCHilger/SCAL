Sonographic measurements of the portal vein and its intrahepatic branches in children. Dilatation of the portal vein is a leading sonographic sign in portal hypertension. Enlargement of its intrahepatic branches is found in various liver diseases such as cystic fibrosis and hepatic schistosomiasis. However, body height dependent values for pathological portal vein diameters on ultrasound have been published for adults only and reference values for intrahepatic portal vein branches have to be established. Diameters of the portal vein and of peripheral portal vein branches were investigated in 130 healthy European children and adolescents by ultrasound. The findings correlated significantly with age and body height. Thus, height related diameter values should be used to define pathological enlargement of the portal vein and its intrahepatic branches in children. Our reference data may contribute to improve sonographical investigation of portal hypertension and periportal fibrosis.
