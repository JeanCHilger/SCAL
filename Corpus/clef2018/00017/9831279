Splenic infarct as a late complication of liver transplantation. Splenic infarct is a rare complication of portal hypertension. It has been reported as an early complication after successful liver transplantation when portal pressure returns to normal and the splenic size progressively declines. It has not been reported as a late complication of liver transplantation. We describe the case of a 19-year-old patient with a splenic infarct which occurred 11 months after successful orthotopic liver transplantation for decompensated cryptogenic liver cirrhosis. Following transplantation, the patient was in excellent general health, liver function tests were normal, there was no clinical evidence of portal hypertension and the splenic size had decreased significantly compared to the pre-transplantation period, although it remained increased. The patient presented with high fever, left pleuritic pain and vomiting. The splenic size had not changed and left pleuritic exudate fluid collection was detected. A hypoechoic region of the spleen was demonstrated in the ultrasound examination corresponding to a hypodense lesion in the computerized tomography scanning. The patient recovered completely, with the disappearance of the infarct in the imaging studies in 2 months time. This case report indicates that a symptomatic splenic infarct can occur late following successful liver transplantation for liver cirrhosis despite lack of any evidence of residual portal hypertension at a time that splenomegaly has not yet regressed. The differential diagnosis from a splenic abscess in transplanted patients can be difficult but the final prognosis seems to be good.
