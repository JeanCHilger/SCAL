Characterization of visually similar diffuse diseases from B-scan liver images using nonseparable wavelet transform. This paper describes a new approach for texture characterization, based on nonseparable wavelet decomposition, and its application for the discrimination of visually similar diffuse diseases of liver. The proposed feature-extraction algorithm applies nonseparable quincunx wavelet transform and uses energies of the transformed regions to characterize textures. Classification experiments on a set of three different tissue types show that the scale/frequency approach, particularly one based on the nonseparable wavelet transform, could be a reliable method for a texture characterization and analysis of B-scan liver images. Comparison between the quincunx and the traditional wavelet decomposition suggests that the quincunx transform is more appropriate for characterization of noisy data, and practical applications, requiring description with lower rotational sensitivity.
