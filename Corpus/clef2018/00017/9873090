Liver transplantation in patients with splenorenal shunts: intraoperative flow measurements to indicate shunt occlusion. Two patients with previous distal splenorenal shunts (DSRSs) performed 6 years earlier underwent liver transplantation (LT). A preoperative selective mesenteric artery angiogram showed collateral veins draining mesenteric venous flow into the shunt. Intraoperative flow measurements were performed to assess the steal of portal venous flow by the shunt and determine the need for shunt occlusion. Portal vein, hepatic artery, and shunt flows were measured by ultrasound transit-time flow probes in the native liver and after graft implantation with and without temporary shunt occlusion. Hemodynamic studies showed that long-standing DSRSs are high-flow shunts that steal portal flow. After graft implantation, DSRS flows remained high. Occlusion of the shunts produced an increase in portal vein flow at an amount similar to those of splenorenal shunt. Thus, the flow measurements showed persistent steal by the shunts after graft implantation and, therefore, the DSRSs were occluded but splenectomy was not performed. We conclude that the decision to occlude a DSRS should be based on the demonstration of steal of portal flow by the shunt and reversibility once the shunt is occluded. Splenectomy is not required when the DSRS is occluded.
