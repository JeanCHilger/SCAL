Portohepatic gradient and portal hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus infection. We evaluated the agreement between wedged hepatic vein pressure (WHVP), portal vein pressure (PVP), and its relationship with portal hemodynamics in 21 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis with esophageal varices. Direct measurements of the portohepatic gradient (HVPG) were obtained by ultrasound-guided fine needle puncture of the right hepatic and the portal veins. In five cases PVP was 6.4-10.4 mm Hg higher than WHVP. In 12 cases measurements were similar (WHVP - PVP < or = 3 mm Hg). In the remaining four cases WHVP was 3.6-9.6 mm Hg higher than PVP. WHVP and PVP agreement was not related to HVPG mean value, Child-Pugh score, or grading of esophageal varices. By contrast, the difference between WHVP and PVP was inversely related to the portal flow velocity (P = 0.053) and directly related to the portal vascular resistance (P = 0.02). Whereas the portal branches were visualized in patients with WHVP lower or similar to PVP, a predominant left portosystemic collateral flow was observed in patients with WHVP > PVP. Our data point out that, in patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus infection, discrepant HVPG values reflect true hemodynamic differences.
