Portal hemodynamics, collateral venous circulation and encephalopathy in patients with esophageal and gastric varices in liver cirrhosis. Complex hemodynamic investigations were conducted in 166 patients with liver cirrhosis and syndrome of portal hypertension. It was established that gastric varicose veins (VV) in 40% of observations are connected with v. renalis sin. by means of gastrorenal shunts (GRS), esophageal VV in 16.9% of observations--with v. renalis sin. Gastric VV frequently are connected with large GRS. More the GRS diameter, the more pronounced lowering of volemic blood flow in portal vein occurs. While gastric VV presence the volemic blood flow value in portal vein significantly lesser than while isolated esophageal VV. Encephalopathy occurs more frequently in patients with GRS, flowing into v. renalis sin. than in patients while other collateral blood flow ways present. Reverse dependence was revealed between GRS diameter and the degree of portal vein pressure lowering.
