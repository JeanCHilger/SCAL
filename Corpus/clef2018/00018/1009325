Diagnosis of gross vesico-ureteric reflux using ultrasonography. A simple non-invasive ultrasonic technique which identifies gross vesico-ureteric  reflux (VUR) in adults is described. It is based on the time position (TP)-mode (or M-mode) of ultrasound imaging. This method warrants assessment as a possible screening procedure for gross VUR in newborn children.
