Urodynamic studies on the untethering of spinal lipoma in the children. We performed conus untethering on 44 children with spinal lipoma. In this retrospective study, we studied urological examinations obtained in 36 consecutive patients. Urological examinations were ultrasonography of bladder and kidney, voiding cystourethrography (VCG), and urodynamic cystometry. In those of them, 6 patients had already had urinary dysfunction at preoperative stage, but 4 patients' spinal lipoma was one complication of cloaca exstrophy and 2 patients' spinal lipoma after repairment of their myelomeningocele. In the remaining 30 cases, 18 patients (60.0%) as the group 1 did not have urinary dysfunction and abnormality in any urological examinations. Another 7 patients (23.3%) as group 2 also did not have urinary dysfunction, but abnormal vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was found out in their VCG examination. At postoperative stage, abnormal VUR resolved or improved in all these 7 cases, but one of them showed transient urinary retention. Two patients of 18 in the group 1 had to require clean intermittent self-catheterization at postoperative stage. These observations confirmed that children with spinal lipoma were more likely to present with urological findings, and so it was imperative that a diagnosis be made and treatment be instituted as early as possible.
