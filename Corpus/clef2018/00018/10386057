Long-term follow-up of a bladder exstrophy case after successful repair. We present a female case of bladder exstrophy where the patient was followed up for 15 years. In 1982 primary closure of the bladder and urethra with bilateral iliotomy by the posterior approach was performed at the age of 4 months. However, realignment was necessary, since the wound split open postoperatively. We used a corset specially prepared for this patient to prevent wound dehiscence during the subsequent postoperative course. Four years later, VUR was surgically eradicated. At the age of 9 years old, her bladder function was satisfactory, demonstrating a normal CM pattern with synergia and Pmax 128 cm H2O on UPP. She had no urge or stress incontinence. The most recent IVP and DMSA renal scan revealed almost normal findings. VCUG showed no VUR and renal function tests (PSP, Ccr 24) also confirmed no interval deterioration. We believe that the approximation of the intersymphyseal band at the time of bladder neck closure is the single most important factor for ensuring urinary continence.
