Vesico-ureteral reflux: diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The vesico ureteral reflux (VUR) is the most common uropathy associated to urinary tract infections (UTI). The identification of V.U.R. is very important to avoid reflux nephropathy and it's complications. To avoid the exposure to unnecessary and injurious x-rays, the authors propose patient selection based on the presence or absence of distal ureteral dilatation and on the time elapsed between typical or atypical symptoms of u.t.i. and fever. First of all, it is essential to diagnose pielonephritis. After ultrasound and radionuclide scintigram with DMSA they select the infants who need cystourethrography. The infants with V.U.R. undergo antibiotic prophylaxis until spontaneous or surgical recovery. The duration of prophylaxis depends on the degree of V.U.R. and the age of the infant at diagnosis.
