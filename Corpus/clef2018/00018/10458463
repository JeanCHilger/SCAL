No further development of renal scarring after antireflux surgery in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux: review of the results of 99mtechnetium dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan. Reports of previous studies using excretory urography indicate that significant numbers of new scars developed in 5 to 31% of cases and scarring progressed in 11 to 16% after antireflux surgery. We evaluated renal scarring after surgery using a more accurate method, that is dimercapto-succinic acid renal scintigraphy.Between 1985 and 1997 antireflux surgery was performed for primary vesicoureteral reflux in 223 children at our hospital. Of these patients 45 boys and 29 girls with a median age of 74 months at surgery in whom preoperative and postoperative renal scans were available form the basis of our retrospective study. Renal scan was performed 0.3 to 58 months (median 2) preoperatively and 5.3 to 44 months (median 18.7) postoperatively. A total of 24 children (39 renal units) were followed further by additional scanning for as long as 25 to 120 months (median 43.2) postoperatively. Each scan was blindly reviewed for the size, number and zone location of cortical defects based on morphology. Interval changes were grouped into categories as improved, no change, progressed and new scar formation.Postoperatively there was no ureteral obstruction. Pyelonephritis developed in 2 patients (2.7%) and asymptomatic bacteriuria was noted in 35 (47.3%) postoperatively. Of the renal units 110 (86.6%) showed no change, while 15 (11.8%) were improved and 2 (1.6%) had progression. In no case was new renal scar formation observed.Contrary to most previous reports involving excretory urography, our results indicate no significant progression of renal scarring after antireflux surgery. In most cases postoperative followup renal scans demonstrated no significant morphological change. When there was change, it mostly involved the disappearance or decrease of renal scars.
