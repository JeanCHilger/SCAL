Quantitative nuclear cystography does not predict outcome in patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux. Quantitative nuclear cystography has been advocated as a tool for determining the prognosis in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux. We reviewed our data on this technique to assess its usefulness for predicting the outcome in this population.We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients with primary reflux in whom findings were positive on at least 2 nuclear cystograms at our institution between 1992 and 1997. Patients followed at least 3 years were stratified according to outcome. Unfavorable prognostic criteria included bladder volume at reflux onset 60% or less of total bladder capacity and calculated volume of reflux 2% or greater of bladder capacity.Of the 107 patients in our study 63 were followed for 3 years or longer, and reflux resolved in 17, was repaired in 24 and persisted in 22. Mean patient age at latest followup, duration of followup and number of cystograms did not significantly differ among groups. Intermittent reflux in 33% of the patients followed 3 years or longer was not associated with outcome or detrusor instability. Bladder and reflux volume varied and was nonpredictive in individuals.Quantitative nuclear cystography did not predict the outcome in patients followed for primary vesicoureteral reflux at a single institution for 3 years or longer. Intermittent reflux was common. These data suggest that nuclear cystography cannot be used to assess reliably the prognosis in individuals. Strong consideration should be given to using negative findings on 2 cystograms to confirm reflux resolution in patients at high risk.
