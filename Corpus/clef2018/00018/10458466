Cystography after the Cohen ureterovesical reimplantation: is it necessary at a training center? Reimplantation by the Cohen procedure has a low rate of recurrent reflux, although postoperative cystography is done routinely at most centers. According to the French training program for pediatric surgery and urology residents, reimplantation is the main pediatric urology procedure performed during residency. We determine whether it is necessary to perform postoperative cystography routinely and whether the fact that the procedure is done by a junior surgeon modifies management.A total of 268 children with primary vesicoureteral reflux underwent ureteral reimplantation by the Cohen transtrigonal technique. Bilateral reimplantation was done in 97% of the cases. Reimplantation was performed by a surgery resident assisted by a clinical fellow or senior consultant surgeon in 37% of the cases. Routine cystography and renal ultrasound were done in all patients postoperatively. Followup ranged from 6 months to 5 years (mean 10 months).In 2 children (0.7%) with recurrent reflux surgery was not performed by a resident. One of the 2 children had asymptomatic persistent reflux and no further surgery was done. In the other child postoperative cystography was normal at 6 months. One year later she had acute pyelonephritis with recurrent unilateral reflux and underwent repeat reimplantation.Routine cystography is not necessary after bilateral Cohen reimplantation. Reflux recurrence is low even at a training center where surgery may be performed by junior surgeons.
