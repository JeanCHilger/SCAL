The value of Ga-67 renal SPECT in diagnosing and monitoring complete and incomplete treatment in children with acute pyelonephritis. This study evaluated the utility of Ga-67 renal SPECT for diagnosing acute pyelonephritis (APN) in children and monitoring them.Seventy-one children (ages 1 week to 12 years) who were thought clinically to have APN were included in the study. The disease was considered present if the patients had all of the following: fever (38.5 degrees C), pyuria (leukocyte counts/per high-power field > or = 10), and a positive result of a urinary culture or blood culture. Tc-99m DMSA, Ga-67 renal SPECT, and voiding cystourethrography were performed, with informed consent from the patients' parents, within 3 days after hospitalization. Three months after treatment, Tc-99m DMSA and Ga-67 renal SPECT were repeated in those patients who had abnormal results of the initial Ga-67 renal SPECT.In the diagnostic study, Ga-67 renal SPECT was superior to DMSA renal SPECT in detecting lesions (97% vs. 79%). Three children had false-negative results with Ga-67 renal SPECT. Seventeen kidneys were negative with Tc-99m DMSA but positive with Ga-67 renal SPECT. No patients had any Ga-67 uptake on post-therapy imaging. However, 32 of 107 kidneys (30%) had permanent renal scars. In these 107 kidneys, 78 (73%) were associated with high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR VUR grade > or = 3) and 29 (27%) with low-grade or no VUR.High-grade VUR tends to be associated more with APN than has been reported by others, probably because of an underestimation of APN by ultrasonography or DMSA. Ga-67 renal SPECT is sensitive and useful not only in diagnosis but also for monitoring and follow-up of children with clinical suspicion of APN, especially in those with equivocal results after DMSA renal SPECT studies.
