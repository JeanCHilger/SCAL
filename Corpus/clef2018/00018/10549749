A modified technique to correct primary vesicoureteral reflux in children. The authors describe the experience of a modified technique to correct primary vesicoureteral reflux in children.Twenty children (28 renal units) with primary vesicoureteral reflux (grade III to grade IV) were treated with this technique. The authors incised the bladder mucosa and muscle along the direction of the ureter using a right-angled probe as a guide. About 2 to 3 cm of extravesical ureter was freed and pulled into the bladder via the incision. The bladder muscle was closed under the ureter, and the mucosa was repaired over the ureter.One patient had residual reflux. All other patients, who underwent follow-up with sonogram and voiding cystourethrogram from 14 to 42 months after the operation, had neither recurrent reflux nor urinary tract obstruction.The advantages of this technique are (1) anastomosis of the ureteral orifice to the urinary bladder is not needed, so that the risk of orifice stenosis is minimized (2) the ureteral orifice remains unchanged after the procedure, so that ureteroscopic procedures are easier to perform in future if required
