Diagnosis of vesico-ureteric reflux. The demonstration and grading of reflux is crucial in examination and follow-up of any child with upper urinary tract infection. A variety of factors can influence the occurrence of reflux, e.g. race, genetics, state of maturation of the ureterovesical valve, diuresis, infection and bladder dysfunction, including obstruction and neurogenic disorders. Even when reflux is investigated under strictly standardized conditions, two consecutive bladder fillings frequently show different grades of reflux. Voiding cystourethrography is, to date, the only method with a generally accepted, well-defined grading of reflux. It also allows detection of intrarenal reflux and anatomical and functional information about the bladder and urethra that is unobtainable by other methods. It is therefore usually considered the method of choice. Radionuclide cystography and, possibly, contrast enhanced ultrasonography can be complementary to voiding cystourethrography, but mainly for postoperative follow-up and screening of siblings.
