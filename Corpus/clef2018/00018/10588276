Guidelines for management of children with urinary tract infection and vesico-ureteric reflux. Recommendations from a Swedish state-of-the-art conference. Swedish Medical Research Council. There are considerable variations in the management of children with urinary tract infection and reflux. These new guidelines were written after critical review of the literature, but are also based on clinical experience, since there are issues that have not been otherwise adequately studied. The aim is to limit renal damage and future complications, with minimal discomfort to the child, and to avoid unnecessary costs. The recommendations include increased attention to bladder dysfunction, shortening of the time of antibacterial prophylaxis and focus on renal development and function rather than on reflux.
