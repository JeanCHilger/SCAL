The outcome of stopping prophylactic antibiotics in older children with vesicoureteral reflux. Accepted management of vesicoureteral reflux includes surgical correction or prophylactic antibiotics with the hope for resolution as the child grows. The physician must consider surgery when reflux does not resolve despite uneventful years on prophylactic antibiotics. An alternative is cessation of the antibiotics. We report on the outcome of children taken off antibiotics with persistent reflux.During a 14-year period 51 children with documented reflux were taken off antibiotic prophylaxis. Selection criteria included children who were old enough to verbalize the symptoms of a urinary tract infection, and had normal voiding patterns, a minor history of infections and minimal or no renal scarring. Routine followup included nuclear cystography and renal sonography.A total of 40 girls and 11 boys maintained on antibiotics for a mean of 4.8 years were taken off prophylaxis and followed for an average of 3.7 years. Mean patient age when prophylactic antibiotics were stopped was 8.6 years. Reflux resolved in 10 children (19.6%). A urinary tract infection developed in 5 girls and 1 boy (11.8%) (mean age 11) an average of 2.3 years (range 4 months to 9.4 years) after antibiotic discontinuation. One child had symptoms consistent with cystitis and 5 had febrile urinary tract infections. All were treated with oral antibiotics and 5 had subsequent operations. No new renal scars developed.The majority of children did well following cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis despite persistent vesicoureteral reflux. Cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis is a reasonable option in a highly select patient population with reflux.
