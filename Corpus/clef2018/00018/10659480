Non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis in children. Non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF) is an infrequent cause of portal hypertension in children. We report 11 children with NCPF, from among 338 with portal hypertension, seen over 6.5 years.The diagnosis was based on patent splenoportal axis on ultrasonography and/or splenoportal venography and liver biopsy showing no evidence of cirrhosis or other diagnosis, in children with portal hypertension. Those with variceal bleed were managed with endoscopic sclerotherapy and/or shunt surgery.The median age was 11 years (range 5 to 14), and 8 were boys. Presentation was with variceal bleed in 6, lump in left upper abdomen in 5 (though all children had splenomegaly) and esophageal varices on endoscopy. The median spleen enlargement was 8.5 cm 8 also had hepatomegaly. Hypersplenism was present in 7, and two had developed ascites after bleed. Of 6 children presenting with bleed, variceal obliteration was achieved on sclerotherapy (average 5.6 sessions) in 4 while two underwent shunt surgery for associated hypersplenism. After median follow up of 57.5 months (range 12-78) all are alive and well.NCPF is an uncommon cause of portal hypertension in Indian children. Presentation with variceal bleed is less common than in adults sclerotherapy is effective.
