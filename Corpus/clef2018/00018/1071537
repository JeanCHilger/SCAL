Detection of vesicoureteric reflux using radionuclide micturating cystography. Radionuclide micturating cystography (RMC) has been compared with the standard micturating cystourethrogram for detecting vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Of 16 renal tracts with VUR radiologically classified as gross all had reflux demonstrated on RMC and in 15 of these the reflux reached the renal pelvis. Eight of the 12 renal tracts with moderate VUR and three of four with slight VUR were shown to reflux on RMC. RMC should prove valuable for following the course of patients with VUR treated surgically or conservatively because of the lower gonadal radiation dose resulting from this technique compared with the conventional radiological method.
