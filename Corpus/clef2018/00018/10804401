Comparison between scintigraphy, B-mode, and power Doppler sonography in acute pyelonephritis in children. Comparing Power Doppler imaging versus technetium-dimercapto-succinic-acid (Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy in acute pyelonephritis of childhood.First episode of urinary tract infection, clinical and biological findings suggesting an upper lesion, absence of urological malformation or obstruction, absence of reflux (or vesico-ureteral reflux inferior to grade 3). Number of patients: 49, length of the study: 26 months (from November 95 to January 98).Tc99m-DMSA scintigraphy (after five days), B mode and Power Doppler imaging (on the day of admission or the following day). Systematic cystography (day 5 to day 30).In terms of positive diagnosis, scintigraphy was superior to Power Doppler, and the latter was superior to B mode ultrasonography. Sensitivity (scintigraphy being the gold standard) was equal for both B mode and Power DopplerUS imaging, but combined Power Doppler and B mode US provided improved results.Currently, the results with Power Doppler imaging are insufficient to replace DMSA scintigraphy. However, Power Doppler is a good complement to B mode US.
