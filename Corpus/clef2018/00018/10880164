Measurement and significance of oblique occipital frontal diameter and superior inferior diameter of hepatic left lobulus in patients with hepatic fibrosis. To study the changes and significance of oblique occipital frontal diameter (OFD) and superior inferior diameter (SID) of the hepatic left lobulus in different stages of hepatic fibrosis, and to evaluate the value of corresponding serological examination in the non-invasive diagnosis to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.Seventy-two patients with chronic hepatitis were confirmed by biopsy. OFD and SID of the hepatic left lobulus were measured by type B ultrasonic flaw detector. Serum levels of hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), type IV collagen (CIV) and type III procollagen (PCIII) were measured by radioimmunoassay.SID of the hepatic left lobulus in S(4) stage was 5.7cmA1.5cm, significantly shorter than the values of 7.7cmA1.4 cm in S(0) stage. OFD of the hepatic left lobulus was longer in S(4) stage than S(0) stage, but the difference didn't reach statistical significance. Serum levels of HA, LN,CIV, and PCIII elevated as the increase of fibrosis. HA and PCIII increased to 273.4mug/LA131.3mug/L and 167. 4mug/LA48.1mug/L in S3 stage from 66.2mug/LA35.0mug/L and 103. 4mug/LA23.8mug/L in S(0) stage.Changes in of SID and OFD of the hepatic left lobulus and serum levels of HA and PCIII may indicate indirectly mid-late hepatic fibrosis or early cirrhosis.
