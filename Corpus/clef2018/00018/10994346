Incidence and natural history of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. To report the natural history of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and hepatocarcinoma (HCC) and to define clinico-biological variables with prognostic and predictive value of this complication.A total of 543 patients consecutively diagnosed of chronic infection with HCV were included and followed prospectively and observationally regarding the development of HCC by means of semestral abdominal ultrasonography and measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). To determine variables with predictive value of HCC, the parameters determined at the start were compared, and all subjects diagnosed of hepatoma during the first twelve months after admission were excluded from the analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate both survival and accumulated probability of HCC.During a mean follow-up period of 28.9 months, an incidence density of HCC of 2.6 per 100 inhabitants-year was obtained (n = 35). 52.6% of those with HCC in the first year were asymptomatic. The only initial variables associated with further development of HCC were age (64.6 vs 58.4 years p = 0.0039) and alkaline phosphatase (373.5 vs 259 U/la) In the chronic infection with HCV, HCC showed to be an oligosymptomatic complication affecting almost exclusively patients with long-lasting cirrhosis. b) Survival in patients in the stage C of the Child-Pugh classification is independently associated with the coexistence of hepatoma therefore, the early diagnosis of this complication should be restricted to those with a better liver functional reserve.
