Postnatal followup of fetal pyelectasis: an unresolved problem. Postnatal followup of fetal pyelectasis is a controversial topic in recent literature. Questions such as the definition of pyelectasis, whether these neonates should be selected for postnatal study in an attempt to prevent reflux nephropathy and urinary tract infections, which complementary investigations (postnatal ultrasonography, cystourethrography, isotopic studies) should be performed and when, and whether these neonates should be administered antibiotic prophylaxis are unresolved issues. In addition, the relationship between prenatal pyelectasis, vesicoureteral reflux and infections is not at present clear. In this article, we try to review and order the present controversies, and briefly introduce the role of genetic aspects in the origin of different forms of nephropathy and renal malformations.
