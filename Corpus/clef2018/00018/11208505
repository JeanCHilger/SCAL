Incidence of vesicoureteral reflux in siblings of children with reflux--our own observations. The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of primary vesicoureteral reflux in siblings of children with reflux.Ninety-four subjects aged 2-6, the siblings of children with reflux were examined. Our methods included: urinalysis, urine cultures, ultrasound examination of abdominal cavity in all the examined subjects. Voiding cystography was conducted in selected cases.Primary vesicoureteral reflux was found in the total of 10% of the siblings of children with reflux. The incidence of reflux was the highest in the youngest age group.The incidence of primary vesicoureteral reflux in the siblings of affected children being at least ten times higher than population risk supports the necessity of screening in this group.
