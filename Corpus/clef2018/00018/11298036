A noninvasive test for vesico-ureteric reflux in children. To report the development and testing of a device for the noninvasive diagnosis of vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) which avoids the need for urethral catheterization (currently required to reliably determine the presence of VUR), and which thus avoids the anxiety of parents and patients that causes many families to refuse such evaluation.Fifty-four children (49 girls and five boys, mean age 7.2 years, range 4-14) previously evaluated as having VUR volunteered to participate no child was symptomatic at the time of the study. Refluxing units were known to be present by voiding cysto-urethrography (within 1 year, mean 7 months) in 45 and absent in 16. The device developed acquires electronically processed acoustic signals from the child during an observed urination. The signals are then analysed 'off-line' to determine the presence or absence of VUR. The initial preparation for the test included: (i) a full bladder [at least 0.80 x ((2 + age) x 30 mL)] measured by ultrasonographySixty-one renal units were assessed and interpretable signals were obtained from 54 (89%). There were seven episodes of 'system failure' when no interpretable data were obtained. One unit with no VUR had a 'reflux' signal in four kidneys, spontaneous (two) and postsurgical (two) resolution of reflux was predicted by the testing and subsequently verified by cyclic radionuclide cystography.This noninvasive diagnostic technique detected VUR in 35 of 37 refluxing units and verified no reflux in 16 of 17 units without VUR. Further refinements may allow this technology to be used in all children with suspected VUR.
