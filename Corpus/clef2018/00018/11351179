Small nodule detection in cirrhotic livers: evaluation with US, spiral CT, and MRI and correlation with pathologic examination of explanted liver. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the detection and characterization of nodules > or = 8 mm and small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in liver cirrhosis.Pathologic examination and results of US, helical CT, and dynamic MRI with gadolinium were compared after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) of 43 cirrhotic patients. Nodules were classified as macroregenerative nodules (MRNs), borderline nodules (BNs), and HCC.Pathologic examination classified 69 nodules: 50 MRNs, 6 BNs, and 13 HCCs. Sensitivities of MRN, BN, and HCC detection were, respectively, for US imaging 2% (1/50), 33.3% (2/6), and 46.2% (6/13) for helical CT 2% (1/50), 50% (3/6), and 53.8% (7/13)Contrast-enhanced MRI is the most sensitive technique for detecting liver nodules. No MR signal intensity pattern characteristic of small HCCs enables differentiation from benign nodules, however. Gadolinium enhancement is the most sensitive and specific characteristic of HCC.
