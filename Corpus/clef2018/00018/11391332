Unilateral vesicoureteric reflux: Low prevalence of contralateral renal damage. We assessed the risk for the occurrence of renal damage in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR).We reviewed the records of 187 consecutive children, aged 3.8 +/- (SD) 2.8 years, with unilateral primary VUR diagnosed after urinary tract infection (UTI). Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy was performed 4 to 6 months after the last UTI. Three patterns of renal damage were identified: global reduction (GR) of renal radionuclide uptake (20% to 40% of relative uptake), focal defects (FD) in uptake, and shrunken (relative uptake <20%) kidney (SK). We assumed that in these subjects FD indicated postpyelonephritic damage and that GR indicated congenital renal damage.Scintigraphic renal damage of any type was present in 36.9% of the refluxing and in 3.2% of the nonrefluxing kidneys (odds ratio [OR], 17.6 95% CI, 7.4 to 41.9). FD were present in 15.5% and 2.7% (OR, 6.7In children with UTI and VUR, the refluxing kidney is most at risk of both congenital and acquired renal damage, and this risk increases with severity of reflux.
