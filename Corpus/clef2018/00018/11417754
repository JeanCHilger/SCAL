Renal scars masquerading as complex masses in a patient with vesicoureteral reflux nephropathy. Vesicoureteral reflux can lead to chronic pyelonephritis, renal scarring, and renal failure. We present a case of renal scarring masquerading as bilateral, complex renal masses. A 35-year old woman who was diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux as a child presented for evaluation of recently developed hypertension and an abnormal renal ultrasound. Her serum creatinine level was 2.5 mg/dL and she had subnephrotic-range proteinuria. A renal sonogram showed small, echogenic kidneys and bilateral complex renal masses of 3.8 (right) and 4.4 (left) cm in greatest dimensions. CT scan of the kidneys revealed slightly contrast-enhancing masses with irregular walls. Renal angiogram showed decreased blood supply to the areas coinciding with the masses consistent with renal scarring. There was no increased vascularity. This case demonstrates that renal scarring may masquerade as renal masses. A step-wise, comprehensive approach is necessary to rule out potentially malignant lesions in these patients.
