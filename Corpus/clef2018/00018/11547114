Cessation of prophylactic antibiotics for managing persistent vesicoureteral reflux. We reviewed our experience with patients with vesicoureteral reflux treated off prophylactic antibiotics.We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with vesicoureteral reflux treated off prophylactic antibiotics, noting the intervals on and off antibiotics, urinary tract infection, signs and symptoms associated with urinary tract infection, and renal ultrasound and dimercapto-succinic acid scan findings.We identified 196 patients with vesicoureteral reflux treated off prophylactic antibiotics, including 122 who were infection-free while on and 124 who had no urinary tract infection while off prophylactic antibiotics. The infection rate on and off prophylactics was 0.29 and 0.24 urinary tract infections per patient per year, respectively. New scars were identified in 5 patients while on prophylactics and in 7 after antibiotics were discontinued. Comparing different subgroups off prophylactic antibiotics showed that children who presented with scarring had statistically fewer new scars than those with normal initial dimercapto-succinic acid imaging (p <0.043). Girls had significantly more urinary tract infections than boys while off prophylactics (p <0.01) despite the older age at antibiotic cessation. However, after infection occurred while off prophylactic antibiotics, new renal scars developed at about the same rate in boys and girls. Because most patients did not have a urinary tract infection while off prophylactic antibiotics, new renal scars developed in only 2.2% of all boys and 4% of all girls.Our findings imply that discontinuing antibiotics is reasonable and safe in patients in whom vesicoureteral reflux fails to resolve.
