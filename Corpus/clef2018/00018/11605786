Prognostic value of the acute DMSA scan in children with first urinary tract infection. We attempted to verify in a group of 101 children with first urinary tract infection whether it was possible to identify groups of patients with different risks of developing renal scarring by taking into account both the extent of kidney involvement documented in the acute phase of infection using a dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, and the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The frequency of persistent lesions in kidneys with mild-moderate lesions (less than 50% of kidney involvement) in the presence of VUR or in non-refluxing kidneys was similar (P=0.1447), while the frequency of persistent lesions in kidneys with severe lesions in the presence of VUR was significantly higher than the frequency of persistent lesions in non-refluxing kidneys (P=0.0089). The extent of kidney involvement and the presence of VUR make possible the identification of different categories of risk of scarring: in the "low risk group" (normal kidney with/without VUR) the risk of scarring is 0% in the "intermediate risk group" (mild lesions with/without VUR
