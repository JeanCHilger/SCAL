Vesicoureteral reflux: diagnosis and grading with echo-enhanced cystosonography versus voiding cystourethrography. To evaluate the usefulness of echo-enhanced cystosonography compared with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) for detecting and grading vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).Two hundred sixteen pediatric patients underwent cystosonography enhanced with SH U 508A, a galactose-based echo-enhancing agent. Sonograms of the kidneys and bladder were obtained before filling, during bladder filling, and during voiding. This examination was followed immediately with VCUG. Each kidney or portion of a kidney with its own complete collecting system was considered separately, for a total of 440 kidney units.VUR was detected in 123 kidney units at cystosonography and in 104 at VCUG. In 401 kidney units, there was concordance between results at cystosonography and at VCUG regarding the presence or absence of VUR. Ninety-four kidney units showed VUR with both methods. Seventy-seven of the 94 refluxing units were depicted with the same grade of VUR with both modalities, and in 17 the VUR grade was greater at cystosonography than at VCUG. Twenty-nine of the 94 units showed VUR at only cystosonography, and 10 units at only VCUG. The McNemar test showed that cystosonography depicted a significantly (P = .003) higher number of units with VUR. By patient, VUR was depicted with both studies in 67 and with only one study in 25. VUR was seen at only cystosonography in 16 patients and at only VCUG in nine. The McNemar test for patients showed no significant difference between the two tests in detection of VUR.Cystosonography with SH U 508A appears comparable to VCUG in the depiction of VUR.
