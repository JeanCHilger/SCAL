Anemia, eosinophilia and generalized weakness in a 20-year old African. A 20-year-old African man was admitted to hospital with anemia, eosinophilia, raised liver enzymes and hepatosplenomegaly. Previously, on arrival in Germany, he had undergone a routine medical check-up where simple microscopy of a feces sample as well as serology for lues, AIDS and hepatitis B had all been negative. In our hospital a stool specimen was examined for ova and parasites and revealed ova of Schistosoma mansoni and confirmed the diagnosis of bilharziosis. For the detection of helmintic ova repeated stool examinations with use of concentration techniques are required. Staging by endoscopies, ultrasonography revealed colon pseudopolyposis and periportal fibrosis complicated by portal hypertension and esophageal varices.Chemotherapy with Praziquantel was effective in eliminating the parasites but in advanced stages chronic fibrotic changes are usually irreversible. Further monitoring will therefore be necessary in our patient.Due to increasing migration and international travel, also doctors working in industrialized countries should be aware of tropical diseases.
