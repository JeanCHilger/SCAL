Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis mimicking gallbladder cancer: report of a case. A 61-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with abnormal findings of abdominal computed tomography. Whereas she had neither fever nor abdominal pain, a cholecystitis was suspected. Ultrasonography showed a mass in the gallbladder with several stones, and an unclear border between the gallbladder and liver. Computed tomography showed a large-mass in the gallbladder with findings that seemed to indicate hepatic invasion and para-aortic lymph node metastasis. On the basis of these findings, we made a diagnosis of gallbladder cancer associated with hepatic invasion and lymph node metastasis. We treated this gallbladder tumor by hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy via catheter with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. Four weeks after administration of the anti-cancer drugs, the tumorous lesion of the gallbladder could not be detected by abdominal imagings, and the gallbladder wall revealed no irregular findings. During laparotomy, the gallbladder showed signs of chronic cholecystitis, and a cholecystectomy was performed. Findings of the resected specimens showed severe inflammation, fibrosis, and bleeding in the gallbladder wall with infiltration by many foamy cells. Histopathological diagnosis was xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. We report here a case of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis mimicking gallbladder cancer and review the literature.
