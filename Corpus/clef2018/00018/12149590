Prenatally detected multicystic renal dysplasia and associated anomalies of the genito-urinary tract. To analyze the prevalence of genitourinary malformations associated with multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK).and method: A retrospective analysis of medical and imaging records of 54 neonates who had the prenatal diagnosis of MCDK was carried out. All infants had the following examinations during their first month of life: ultrasound, voiding cystourethrography and intravenous urography. Genital and urinary abnormalities were recorded.Vesicoureteric reflux was present ipsilaterally in 17% cases, on the opposite side in 31% cases. Ureteropelvic junction obstruction was found on the opposite side in 7% cases. Four cases of megaureters, one child with ureteric duplication, 3 boys with posterior urethral valves, 1 with reflux into the ejaculatory duct, one case of megacystis with reflux and one child with ureterocele were identified. Genital anomalies were: 2 cases of seminal vesicle cysts, one case of absent testis, 5 children with inguinal hernia, one boy with incomplete foreskin and one with hypospadias.Embryology may explain the highest prevalence of genito-urinary abnormalities on both sides in neonates with MCDK. Hence, a prompt clinical and uroradiological evaluation in these patients with a single functional kidney should be performed.
