Evolution of differential renal function after acute pyelonephritis. (99m)Tc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans can provide accurate diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, its sequelae (renal scars) and differential renal function (DRF). The purposes of this retrospective study were (1) to assess the relationship between DRF obtained during acute pyelonephritis and at follow-up, and (2) to elucidate the value of initial DRF in predicting subsequent renal scars. A total of 47 children were enrolled. All had both unilateral acute pyelonephritis diagnosed by initial DMSA renal scans, and follow-up DMSA renal scans. We found the correlation between initial and follow-up DRF poor (adjusted R2 = 0.396). Whether or not renal scars developed determined the follow-up DRF. Vesicoureteral reflux was significantly more common in children who developed renal scars. In addition, the higher the grade of vesicoureteral reflux, the lower the follow-up DRF and the improvement in DRF. When using a DRF of 46% as the cut-off value to predict subsequent renal scars, the sensitivity and specificity were 47.8% and 83.3%, respectively. Owing to the low sensitivity, initial DRF is not suitable for predicting the occurrence of renal scars.
