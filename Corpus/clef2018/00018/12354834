Imaging evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common causes of cancer death worldwide. Numerous surgical and nonsurgical treatment options are available for treating patients with HCC. Successful long-term outcome is dependent on early detection and accurate delineation of the number and location of tumor nodules. Noninvasive imaging modalities, including ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography, are commonly used in the initial evaluation of these patients. Herein, the authors present the different manifestations of HCC with these imaging modalities and the role of imaging in the follow-up of patients after nonsurgical treatment.
