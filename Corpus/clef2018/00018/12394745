The renal length nomogram: multivariable approach. We built a multivariate renal length nomogram based on ultrasound measurements in pediatric patients with normal renal anatomy.Included in the study were 707 children 1 week to 18 years old without vesicoureteral reflux, urinary obstruction or other known anatomical anomalies. Renal length was compared among subgroups of children. Multivariate regression approach was used to model renal length, incorporating important demographic variables.Subgroup comparisons of renal lengths showed diverse patterns of renal length differences in children with various demographic characteristics. In addition to age, factors significant in the multivariate nomogram model of renal length included gender, race, weight and height.These results show that renal length is not only age dependent, but also significantly correlates with other important demographic variables. Variability in renal length can be better described by multivariate analysis. The multivariate approach provides clinically useful information regarding renal outcomes in individuals. The ability to compare renal length among patient subgroups receiving different interventions adds additional usefulness to this approach.
