Contrast-medium enhanced reflux ultrasound in children. A comparison with radiologic imaging up to now. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) has long been the method of choice for the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Especially in the course of conservative treatment, the radiation dose involved might become quite high over the years. Since the development of such ultrasound echo-enhancing agents as Levovist (Schering, Germany), we now have the ability to assess the diagnostic efficacy of this agent in the evaluation of VUR with a view to replacing VCUG with the radiation-free ultrasound methodology. A total of 104 children with a mean age of 5.4 years were examined using echo-enhancing ultrasound after informed consent had been obtained from their parents. For control purposes, all children were examined by standard VCUG as well. The diagnosis of VUR was judged to be positive when microbubbles appeared in the ureter or renal pelvis. Correlations were sought between the sonographic findings and those obtained by standard VCUG. In 76 (37%) of the 208 ureter-kidney units investigated, VUR was detected by both technologies. VUR was diagnosed by ultrasonography only in 5 units and by VCUG only only in 3 units. All reflux grades (I-V) were identified. The specificity and sensitivity of the contrast reflux ultrasound were significantly high. The long contrast time of up to 30 min combined with the high contrast effect resulted in convincing images with high levels of diagnostic confidence. Our results clearly demonstrate that the safety and accuracy of the diagnosis of VUR by means of contrast-enhanced ultrasound is statistically comparable to those of standard radiologic VCUG. Therefore, this methodology is an exceptional approach to reducing the number of children being exposed to ionising radiation especially during conservative follow-up of children with reflux.
