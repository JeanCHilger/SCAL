Occurrence, diagnostics and therapeutic management of hydronephrosis in pediatric patients in Germany. As urinary tract obstruction in children may impair renal function, the early detection and evaluation of the degree of obstruction using adequate diagnostic tools is necessary for the choice of the optimal therapeutic procedure. This study describes diagnostic and therapeutic standards in relation to the quality of management of pediatric hydronephrosis in Germany in the first 6 months of the year 2000. In our study 407 of 711 (57.2%) children with a hydronephrotic condition were detected by routine ultrasound. This, and the fact that 25% of the patients, who were prenatally detected, had a diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux, underlines the importance of this routine procedure. Our study illustrates the panel of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures used in the management of pediatric hydronephrosis in Germany.
