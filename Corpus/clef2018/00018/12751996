Simultaneous voiding cystourethrography and voiding urosonography. To compare the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography (VUS) and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) during simultaneous performance of both examinations.A total of 24 children, 16 girls and 8 boys, with a mean age of 3.5 years referred for reflux examination were recruited for the study. After transurethral bladder catheterization, radiographic contrast medium, followed directly by the US contrast medium, were administered. Fluoroscopic VCUG and VUS were carried out concurrently in the same patient. When 1 kidney was scanned by ultrasound, fluoroscopy was performed on the contralateral side.In 19 of the 47 kidney-ureter-units (KUU) vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was detected. In 16 units the reflux was detected by both VCUG and VUS. In 3 KUUs the reflux was detected only at VCUG. All 3 cases were grade 1. Taking the VCUG as the reference standard, VUS had 84% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% and 90% positive and negative predictive values, respectively.A dependable comparison could be achieved by performing VCUG and VUS at the same time and under the same conditions. It reconfirmed that VUS is reliable in the exclusion or verification of reflux.
