Intrarenal reflux: diagnosis with contrast-enhanced harmonic US. The objective of this case report is to demonstrate the possibility of visualizing intrarenal reflux (IRR) in children using contrast-enhanced harmonic voiding urosonography (VUS). A 10-month-old girl underwent VUS as part of the work-up of acute pyelonephritis of the right kidney. Before and after intravesical administration of US contrast medium (Levovist) the urinary tract was scanned in harmonic imaging mode. Bilateral vesicoureteric reflux was detected (right grade IV, left grade III). Moreover, at the height of the reflux the right kidney parenchyma turned markedly echogenic, corresponding to massive IRR. The voiding cystourethrography that followed confirmed the results of the VUS.
