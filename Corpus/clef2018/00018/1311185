Vesico-ureteric reflux in the damaged non-scarred kidney. Renal damage without scarring is a rare manifestation of reflux nephropathy, and is infrequently reported in the literature. A retrospective review of a large series of patients with urinary tract disorders at the hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, identified 12 patients with vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) with no evidence of scarring but with renal damage as assessed using technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scan. There were 9 simplex kidneys, the differential function was between 33% and 43% (mean 38%). On follow-up to date (mean 6.7 years) all kidneys show stable differential function with neither improvement nor deterioration. Only 8 children had a urinary tract infection. Renal damage without evidence of a focal scar associated with VUR may be a manifestation of growth arrest possibly due to glomerular damage. The sensitivity of 99mTc-DMSA may reveal the permanent nature of the renal damage.
