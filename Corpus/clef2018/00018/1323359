Hepatic resection for minute hepatocellular carcinoma. Twenty-three patients with minute hepatocellular carcinoma, defined as a solitary lesion less than or equal to 2 cm, underwent hepatectomy at our institute during the 10 years between January, 1979 and December, 1988. Hepatitis B surface antigen was positive in 4 patients and the preoperative serum alpha-fetoprotein level was within the normal range in 7 patients and slightly elevated (20-200 ng/mL) in 14 patients. Liver cirrhosis was present in 16 patients and chronic hepatitis in 6 patients. The diagnosis was first suspected from the results of periodic examinations, including echography and the measurement of alpha-fetoprotein, in all except one patient. Minor hepatic resection was performed in 22 patients, and lobectomy in one patient in whom the tumor was located centrally in the liver. Three patients died of hepatic failure in hospital following surgery, and the survival rates of the other 20 patients at 1, 3, and 5 years were 90, 79, and 61 percent, respectively. The prognostic factors that influenced long-term survival were investigated by comparing the survival curves. The only factor associated with a significant difference in survival was the severity of concomitant liver disease. Thus, severe cirrhosis is the main obstacle against the long-term survival of patients with minute hepatocellular carcinoma.
