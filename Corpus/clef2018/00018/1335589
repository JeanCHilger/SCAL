The magnetic resonance of small hepatocarcinoma. A comparison with echography, computed tomography, digital angiography and computed tomography with lipiodol. Diagnostic techniques as a whole and periodic ultrasonography (US) in particular frequently allows tumors < 3 cm (small hepatocellular carcinomas) to be detected in patients suffering from liver cirrhosis. Multifocal diseases are a major limitation to surgery. Recently, MR imaging has shown its capabilities in the diagnosis of small hepatocellular carcinomas. In our study the diagnostic value of MR imaging was compared with that of US, of pre- and post-contrast CT, of digital angiography and of CT after lipiodol injection (Lipiodol CT). The morphologic and signal intensity MR features of small hepatocellular carcinomas were investigated. Fifteen cirrhotic patients with 31 nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma < 3 cm were examined. All patients were studied with US, MR imaging, angiography and Lipiodol CT 12/15 patients underwent CT. Histologic confirmation was obtained in 12 nodules (2 at surgery and 10 by means of percutaneous biopsy)
