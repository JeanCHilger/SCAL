Prenatal diagnosis of the megacystis-megaureter association. A total of 11 male neonates with hydronephrosis and a large bladder in utero had the megacystis-megaureter association. Prenatal ultrasound findings included bilateral hydroureteronephrosis a large, smooth, thin-walled bladder, and normal volume of amniotic fluid. Postnatal studies demonstrated grades 4 to 5 bilateral reflux, a large bladder without obstruction and in 2 infants nonfunction of a kidney or renal moiety. Of 7 infants initially managed nonoperatively 5 have undergone surgery due to persistent reflux or breakthrough urinary infections. The prenatal diagnosis of the megacystis-megaureter association can be suspected with reasonable accuracy. Prompt postnatal continuous antibiotic prophylaxis and uroradiological confirmation allow for nonemergency management of this condition with excellent results.
