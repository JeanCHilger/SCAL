Medical management of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract. Renal damage in children has been found to be more congenital in origin than was previously thought. Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) involve renal dysplasia, renal hypoplasia, urinary tract obstruction and vesicoureteral reflux. CAKUT are sometimes bilateral and different types often coexist. Depending on their types and severity, children with CAKUT often have varying degrees of a reduced number of nephrons at birth. CAKUTare now the leading cause of renal failure in children. Children with renal dysplasia or obstructive uropathy may have abnormal renal tubules, and tend to lose essential water and sodium in urine. This can lead to poor body growth unless they are supplemented with water and sodium. Children with severe ureteric reflux often develop urinary infection and renal scarring. Renal scarring can further increase the risk of renal failure in children who already have other CAKUTand fewer nephrons than normal. Hypertension and proteinuria may develop in children with renal dysplasia and further aggravate renal function unless they are treated. Recent advances in the understanding and management of CAKUT make it possible for children with CAKUT to grow normally, have fewer complications such as urinary infection, have longer renal survival, and survive even with end-stage renal diseases through renal replacement therapy.
