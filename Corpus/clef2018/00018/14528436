Sonographic evaluation of the anterior liver surface in chronic liver diseases using a 7.5-MHz annular-array transducer: correlation with laparoscopic and histopathologic findings. We studied the sonographic appearance of the anterior liver surface using an ultrasound scanner equipped with a 7.5-MHz annular-array transducer to determine the accuracy of this imaging modality in monitoring the course of chronic liver diseases.We prospectively evaluated patterns of the liver surface in the sonograms of 77 consecutive patients with chronic liver diseases who had undergone sonographic examination with a 7.5-MHz annular-array transducer and a 3.75-MHz convex-array transducer over a 2-year period and compared these findings with those of laparoscopy (using previously described categories) and histopathology.Histopathologically confirmed disease prevalences for inactive chronic hepatitis, active chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and others were 10% (8/77), 56% (43/77), 29% (22/77), and 5% (4/77), respectively. The sonographic appearance of the liver surface with the 3.75-MHz transducer was classified as either a regular or an irregular pattern. The regular pattern corresponded to 69% (34/50) of the cases in laparoscopic category 200 or 300 and the irregular pattern with 85% (23/27) of the cases in category 400 or 500. The sonographic appearance of the liver surface with the 7.5-MHz transducer was classified as regular, unevenly irregular, diffusely irregular, or nodular. These 4 patterns detected 75% (24/32), 78% (14/18), 52% (12/23), and 75% (3/4) of the cases of laparoscopic categories 200, 300, 400, and 500, respectively. In a comparison of the sonographic patterns of the liver surface with the differential histopathologic findings, the regular sonographic pattern corresponded to 88% (7/8) of the cases of inactive chronic hepatitis, the unevenly irregular pattern with 35% (15/43) of the cases of active chronic hepatitis, and the diffusely irregular and nodular patterns (considered as 1 group) with 68% (15/22) of the cases of liver cirrhosis.Our results suggest that sonographic evaluation of the liver surface with a 7.5-MHz annular-array transducer using this classification provides detailed information on the evolution of chronic liver diseases that correlates with the laparoscopic and histopathologic findings and thus is a useful noninvasive method for monitoring the disease course to cirrhosis.
