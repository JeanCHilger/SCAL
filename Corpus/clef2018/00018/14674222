Renal abscess in children: a clinical retrospective study. A renal abscess is rare in children and diagnosis is not readily apparent before hospitalization, because symptoms are often insidious and nonspecific. To evaluate the diagnostics and therapy of renal abscess in the pediatric group, we will report eight cases of renal abscess in children to illustrate the variable features of this condition. Eight patients, 6 to 156 (mean, 45.9) months old, with renal abscesses in 9 kidneys were identified. Ultrasound and computed tomography proved to be the most valuable diagnostic tool, revealing a hypoechoic or hypodense mass. Fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis were common presenting features, but no child presented symptoms of loin pain. Escherichia coli was identified in the urine culture among the 6 cases and blood culture in one case. Three children were associated with mild to moderate vesicoureteral reflux. All patients had an intensive antibiotic treatment, which led to resolution of the abscess in eight of the nine kidneys. In one case, the abscess had to be drained using the CT-guided percutaneous drainage. During follow-up, seven children received 99mTc DMSA renal SPECT and only two of them had complete remission without sequelae of renal scar. We concluded that the renal abscesses must be assumed, especially, in children with prolonged fever, abdominal pain, and a high value of CRP. Ultrasonography is just a screening test to detect renal swelling, bulging, and enlargement however, a CT scan is more sensitive and can detect abscess formation, as well as define the extent of the disease for planning conservative antibiotic treatment or additional drainage. Finally, DMSA renal SPECT is the best and the most sensitive examination for detecting the extension area of renal inflammation and correlated with the renal outcome.
