Sonocystography: a new method for the diagnosis and follow-up of vesico-ureteric reflux in children. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a common finding in children presenting with acute urinary infection, with a frequency ranging from 20 to 50%. If radiological retrograde cystography still remains the standard technique, sonocystography now appears as a valuable alternative method, due to the properties of recent ultrasound contrast agents and the wide use of harmonic imaging. The analysis of the literature and the experience acquired by the authors during a clinical trial allow summarizing the current data on this new technique. Because of its accuracy, it may replace radiological cystography in the detection of VUR in girls, the follow-up in both boys and kids, and the management of recurrent infection in children presenting with normal radiological cystography.
