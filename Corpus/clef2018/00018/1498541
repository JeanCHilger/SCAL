Diagnosis on blood stasis in viral hepatitis by computer multi-criteria analysis--an analysis of 63 cases. This study is based on the criteria for diagnosis of Blood Stasis formulated by the international conference held in Beijing in 1988. The patient that has one, two, three, and over four items could be diagnosed as I-, II-, III-, IV-degree hepatic Blood Stasis respectively. The data of pathologic findings from liver biopsy, nail-fold microcirculation, blood rheology, hepatogram, B-ultrasonography and blood biochemical examination were stored in computer to carry on single and multiple factor analysis in order to evaluate these indexes in the diagnostic value of hepatic Blood Stasis. Stepwise regression analysis formula was used to determine the severity of Blood Stasis. By substitute related data into the formula, mathematical model of hepatic Blood Stasis was compared with clinical Syndrome Differentiation, it revealed that 59 cases were coincided with each other (93.6%). According to numerical value, the increase and decrease of the pre-and posttherapy, the curative effect of promoting blood circulation to remove Blood Stasis could be determined to provide some references for diagnosis and treatment of hepatic Blood Stasis and prevention and treatment of hepatic fibrosis.
