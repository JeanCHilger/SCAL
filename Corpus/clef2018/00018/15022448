Vesicoureteral reflux in children with hypoplastic kidney. Reconstructive plastic operations were conducted in 54 children aged 1 to 14 years. The children were followed up for 1 to 17 years. In 40 patients reflux into the hypoplastic kidney combined with anomaly or another disease of the contralateral kidney, in 10 patients--with infravesical obstruction. The examination included clinical and laboratory tests, ultrasound diagnosis, x-ray, radionuclide investigation, uroflowmetry, on demand cystoscopy. Assessment of surgery results was made by function of the hypoplastic kidney and growth of its parenchyme, urodynamics, clinical symptoms of pyelonephritis. A good result was achieved in 41%, satisfactory--in 39 and unsatisfactory--in 20% patients. Thus, timely surgical elimination of vesicoureteral reflux enables effective treatment of chronic pyelonephritis, produces a positive action on urodynamics and renal parenchyma growth.
