Easy and accurate targeting of deep-seated hepatic tumors under laparoscopy with a forward-viewing convex-array transducer. It is technically difficult to puncture deep-seated hepatic tumors by conventional laparoscopic ultrasonography with a linear-array probe. We have developed a laparoscopic ultrasonography system with a convex-array probe.The laparoscopic system used had a fixed forward-viewing convex-array transducer, and a guide groove for puncture was added to the back of the unit. These characteristics enabled us to continuously monitor the position of the needle tip on the ultrasonographic image immediately after puncturing on the liver surface. We attempted tumor puncture in 11 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma under a new probe guidance.The mean puncturing distance up to the tumors was 38.7 mm. All punctures were successful on the first pass and the tumors were treated with radiofrequency ablation.Using this new equipment, puncturing hepatic tumors for treatment is relatively easy, irrespective of the position of the tumor.
