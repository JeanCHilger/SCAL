Functional voiding disorders: actual aspects in diagnosis and treatment. This is a review of the recent advances in the diagnosis and therapy of dysfunctional voiding. We aim to point out the fact that there are many modalities which are effective in the treatment of dysfunctional voiding but that the standard therapy is still not agreed upon.Fifteen recent articles are reviewed. The two most interesting reviews are (1) the diagnosis of dysfunctional voiding and vesicoureteral reflux with contrast-enhanced ultrasonography and (2) the use of a scoring system to monitor the outcome of therapy and family compliance to the therapy.Periodic, critical, and objective reviews on this subject should help the attending physicians arrive at sound management plans.
