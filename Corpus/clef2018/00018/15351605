Incomplete bladder duplication presenting antenatally. We report a case of an incomplete bladder duplication diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography at 35 weeks of gestation. The patient was followed until bladder neck obstruction and high-grade vesicoureteral reflux of a solitary kidney prompted definitive repair at 6 months of age. Bladder duplication is a rare anomaly. To our knowledge this is the first documented case of an incomplete bladder duplication discovered antenatally.
