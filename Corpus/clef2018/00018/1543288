Evaluation of vesico-ureteral reflux in infants under 6 months of age. Forty-five infants less than 6 months old with vesicoureteral reflux have been evaluated in the Neonatology Unit of Ni√±o Jesus Hospital. All of them have received medical treatment. We found bilateral vesicoureteral reflux in 55.6%, predominantly degree II (70%). Clinical symptoms were not specific, but it was evident that urine cultures were negative in 31.12%. After a mean follow-up of 31.5 months, kidney status was evaluated with echographic procedures. We found good growth in all but one case which was initially hypoplastic. New lesions were not demonstrated in the kidneys. We report a good prognosis for vesicoureteral reflux in infants of less than 6 months of age that have received only medical treatments. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of recognizing this pathology in infants, including those with negative urine cultures.
