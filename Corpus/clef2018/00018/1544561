Cirrhosis: diagnosis by liver surface analysis with high-frequency ultrasound. To determine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the sonographic analysis of liver surface irregularities for the diagnosis of cirrhosis, the authors conducted a prospective and blinded study in 70 subjects with abnormal liver function tests. All patients included underwent liver biopsy within 15 days of the sonographic study. Twenty-three subjects with no signs or symptoms of liver disease were examined to assess the sonographic appearance of normal liver surface. Studies were performed with a small-parts probe, high-frequency transducer (7.5 MHz). Three basic patterns of liver surface were found: type I, normal type II, focal abnormality
