Surgical treatment of vesico-ureteral reflux in complete doubling of the ureters. Eleven patients aged 1 to 12 years were examined after operation of creation of intravesical ureter fissus (IVUF) from urinary bladder mucosa. The IVUF acts as a valve preventing vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) in complete doubling of the ureters. One of the patients has undergone one-stage antireflux operation on double ureters on the right and triple ureters on the left. The operations were performed in VUR of the third-fourth degrees. Examination of the patients included excretory urography, ultrasonic investigation of the kidneys and urinary bladder, cystography, cystoscopy. Stenosis of the artificial ureteral ostium was not observed. The kidney functioned in all the patients. Urine retention, VUR were absent. This technique does not destruct natural ureterovesical anastomosis, helps reestablish an adequate valvular mechanism irrespective of ureteral dilatation.
