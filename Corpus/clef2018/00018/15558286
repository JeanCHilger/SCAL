Initial and long-term management of posterior urethral valves. Posterior urethral valves are the most common cause of congenital obstructive uropathy, resulting in renal failure in childhood. Nowadays, in most cases, diagnosis is suggested by antenatal ultrasound. However, antenatal intervention has not resulted in a significantly improved outcome. Endoscopic valve ablation is the initial treatment in most of these neonates, but others procedures, like vesicostomy or ureterostomy, can also be justified in some particular cases in order to improve renal function prognosis. Different factors like bladder dysfunction, VUR, polyuria and proteinuria, can be responsible for the slow and progressive deterioration in renal function that some of these patients show over the years. By treating them all, we may prevent or delay the onset of end stage renal disease.
