Feasibility study of ultrasonic fatty liver biopsy: texture vs. attenuation and backscatter. The objective of this study was to compare textural to attenuation/backscatter indices of fatty liver correlated to histology to suggest the better approach for an objective noninvasive ultrasonic "biopsy". Forty-four patients with severe steatosis by histopathology were selected for this study. Ten patients had "pure" fatty liver and 34 had in addition fibrosis and/or inflammation. Ultrasonic images were acquired before needle insertion. The ROI used for biopsy was marked on the ultrasonic image and characterized by three attenuation/backscatter and 18 textural related indices. Statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression. Twenty-one healthy subjects served as control. The attenuation/backscatter indices were superior to textural indices in differentiating between the categories studied. Pure fatty livers could be reliably identified (AUC = 1, SE = 0). Among the 18 textural indices, "co-occurrences sum entropy" and "co-occurrences entropy" presented the best results. Attenuation/backscatter based indices appear to have better potential than the textural based indices.
