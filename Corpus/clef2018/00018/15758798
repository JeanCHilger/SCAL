Post-pyelonephritic renal scars are not associated with vesicoureteral reflux in children. Children with pyelonephritis are at risk for renal damage. We assess the value of clinical signs and urological abnormalities in predicting renal scars in children following pyelonephritis.A total of 64 hospitalized children (29 females and 35 males, median age 2.9 years) underwent ultrasonography and technetium labeled dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy imaging within 1 week following the diagnosis of the first pyelonephritis. Voiding cystourethrography was performed 8 weeks after the diagnosis. Followup DMSA scintigraphy was performed in 58 patients after 2 years of followup.Urological abnormalities observed were vesicoureteral reflux (VUR, grade 2 or higher) in 11 patients (19%), nonrefluxing and nonobstructed megaureter in 2 (4%) and pyeloureteral obstruction in 1 (2%). The first DMSA scintigraphy showed parenchymal defects in 48% of patients. VUR did not increase the risk of renal defects. At 2 years after the infection 12 of the 58 patients (21%) had renal scars. Nine of these patients did not have VUR. However, 2 patients with high grade VUR and repeat infections demonstrated deterioration of kidney function during followup. The patients with renal scars were older than those without scars (3.1 vs 0.8 years, p = 0.0291) at the time of infection.Renal scars after first pyelonephritis are in most cases not associated with abnormalities of the urinary tract, but are caused by the infection itself. However, structural abnormalities may predispose to recurrent infections. Following pyelonephritis new renal scars may develop in all age groups in both sexes.
