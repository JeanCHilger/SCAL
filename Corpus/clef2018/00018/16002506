Radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of liver tumors in the caudate lobe. To evaluate the effectiveness of radiofrequency (RF) ablation for liver tumors located in the caudate lobe.Ten patients (46-79 years of age median, 70 y), eight with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis and two with colorectal metastases in the caudate lobe, were treated with 5.8% NaCl tissue-perfused monopolar (n=7) or bipolar (n=3) RF ablation. The median tumor diameter was 41 mm (range, 25-70 mm). Procedures were performed under ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) guidance in eight and two patients, respectively. One month later, the treatment response was assessed by CT.Transhepatic right intercostal and transomental anterior epigastric routes were used for tumor puncture in eight and two patients, respectively. The entire RF ablation treatment required one or two procedures (median, 1.5), including two to 15 electrode repositionings (median, 6). After RF ablation procedure, one patient experienced jaundice that resolved spontaneously. In one patient, CT follow-up showed asymptomatic segmental biliary duct dilations. Median total hospital stay was 3 days (range, 2-9 d). Complete ablation was achieved in nine of 10 tumors. In one patient, ethanol ablation was necessary to complete RF ablation treatment. After a median follow up of 9.5 months (range, 5-25 mo), three patients remained tumor-free and seven had tumor relapse: two local, four distant, and one mixed. Repeat RF ablation was successfully performed in four cases.RF ablation of liver tumors located in the caudate lobe is effective despite the deep location of tumors and the vicinity of major vessels.
