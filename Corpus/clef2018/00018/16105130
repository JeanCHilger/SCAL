Hepatitis C virus infection facilitates gallstone formation. Bile duct damage and hepatic steatosis are two characteristic histological findings in hepatitis C virus infection and high prevalence of hepatitis C antibody is noted in patients with cholangiocarcinoma. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between biliary diseases and hepatitis C virus infection.Persons who received a general checkup in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between 2000 and 2002 were included. All of them had hemogram, serum biochemistry, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody and ultrasonography studies. The prevalence of gallbladder stone, bile duct stone and gallbladder polyp/cholesterolosis were compared in different viral infection groups.Of the 28 486 persons, 22 967 were negative for both hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody (group NBNC), 4152 were hepatitis B surface antigen carriers (broup B), 1195 were positive for hepatitis C antibody (group C), and 172 were positive for both markers. The 379 persons (1.3%) having had cholecystectomy were considered to have gallbladder stone at the time when cholecystectomy was done. Gallbladder stone was found in 6.0% persons of group NBNC, 5.4% in group B and 11.7% in group C. The prevalence of gallbladder stone in group C was found especially high for age groups 31-40 years and 61-70 years. The prevalence of bile duct stone was higher in group C (0.4%) than in group NBNC or B (both 0.1%). Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that age, liver cirrhosis, body mass index, hepatitis C virus infection and gender were independent factors associated with gallbladder stone.Hepatitis C virus infection facilitates gallstone formation.
