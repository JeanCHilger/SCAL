Polymorphisms of the angiotensin converting enzyme and angiotensin II type 1 receptor genes and renal scarring in non-uropathic children with recurrent urinary tract infection. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (A1166C) gene polymorphisms were associated with the renal scar formation secondary to recurrent urinary tract infection in children without uropathy.The polymorphisms were investigated by polymerase chain reaction in 97 children (81 females, 16 males age, 2.5-13 years) with recurrent urinary tract infection and 100 healthy controls as a single centre study. Children with vesicoureteral reflux, bladder dysfunction and other uropathies were excluded. The dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan performed at least 3 months after a proven urinary tract infection and the result of the last DMSA was taken into consideration.Renal scarring was found in 30 patients (30.9%) using DMSA scan. The number of urinary tract infection attacks was significantly higher in patients with renal scarring compared with children without scarring (P<0.05). The follow-up period and male/female ratio of patients with or without renal scarring was similar (P>0.05). Age at the first urinary tract infection was lower in the group with scarring. The ACE insertion/deletion genotype distribution and D allele frequency were similar between patients and controls (P>0.05), and in patients with renal scarring and those without renal scarring. Also, the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene polymorphism was not associated with renal parenchymal damage (P>0.05).The results indicated that the ACE insertion/deletion and angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene polymorphisms were not independent risk factors for renal scar formation in recurrent urinary tract infection of paediatric patients without uropathy.
