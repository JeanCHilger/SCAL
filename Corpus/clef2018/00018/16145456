Is long-term sonographic followup necessary after uncomplicated ureteral reimplantation in children? We examined the necessity of postoperative ultrasound following surgical correction of vesicoureteral reflux beyond initial postoperative assessment. The followup among children who have undergone correction of vesicoureteral reflux has varied, and currently there are no standards to document how long postoperative monitoring for hydronephrosis, renal scarring or renal growth should continue.The study population included 128 children who underwent surgical correction of primary vesicoureteral reflux between 1992 and 2002. Data were collected as part of a retrospective chart review and included age at surgery, preoperative grade of reflux, indications for surgery, type of surgical correction, postoperative voiding cystourethrogram and ultrasound results, and postoperative course relative to urinary tract infections, incontinence and other symptoms.Of 128 patients 4 had postoperative reflux on voiding cystourethrogram. In each of these cases reflux either resolved completely or remained stable during postoperative followup. A total of 17 patients had grade 2 or 3 hydronephrosis on the initial 3-month postoperative ultrasound. In all of these cases hydronephrosis remained stable or improved during followup. In no case was there evidence of development of new hydronephrosis or worsening of previously established hydronephrosis beyond the 1-year postoperative ultrasound.Our data indicate that followup of uncomplicated ureteral reimplantation in children more than 1 year postoperatively is not warranted. The elimination of studies beyond 1 year following surgery would result in a significant cost savings.
