Renal scarring is associated with nonsecretion of blood type antigen in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux. Nonsecretor status of blood type antigen has been associated with higher risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. However its implication in the modern management for pediatric UTI remains unclear. We evaluate the impact of secretor status on clinical course in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).From 1998 to 2002, 382 cases of primary VUR presented to our institute and were treated either surgically or nonoperatively in accordance with the American Urological Association guideline. Of these potential candidates 128 patients and their guardians volunteered to be entered into the study. Antiseptic swabs to collect saliva were sent to them. The secretor status was determined using the hemagglutination inhibition assay from the eluted saliva on the swabs and medical records of responders were evaluated retrospectively.Secretor status was not associated with gender, VUR grade, presentation, history of breakthrough UTI, laterality of VUR and conservative vs surgical treatment. However, nonsecretor status weakly correlated with decreased split renal function and significantly correlated with the presence of focal renal scarring (40.9% vs 21.7% for children with and without scarring, respectively) as determined by technetium dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan.These results demonstrate that secretor status represents unrecognized host disposition that affects the clinical course of primary VUR. Further study is needed to determine the significance of secretor status for clinical management and pathophysiology of VUR.
