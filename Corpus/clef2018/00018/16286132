Voiding dysfunction: outcome in infants with congenital vesicoureteral reflux. To assess the rate of development of voiding dysfunction as an outcome in patients with congenital vesicoureteral reflux.A computerized database was used to review the medical records of all patients with congenital reflux diagnosed before 6 months of age from 1988 to 2002. Only those infants with reflux who were followed up for at least 6 months past the age of toilet training were included. The parameters tabulated in this group included the presence of frequency, daytime wetting, urge incontinence, and infrequent voiding. The variables were summarized using contingency tables, and associations were evaluated using chi-square analysis and Fisher's exact test.Of 342 patients (145 boys and 197 girls) with reflux, 67 (19.6%) developed voiding dysfunction (17.9% boys and 20.8% girls). No statistically significant difference was found between high grade (IV and V) and low grade (I and II) or grade III reflux, or between unilateral and bilateral reflux for the development of voiding dysfunction. Of the patients with reflux who had renal damage on dimercaptosuccinic acid scan, 24.3% of girls and 30.4% of boys developed voiding dysfunction, which was not significantly different from those without renal damage.Approximately 20% of patients with vesicoureteral reflux diagnosed before 6 months of age demonstrated dysfunctional voiding after the age of toilet training. Voiding dysfunction occurred independent of sex, laterality, or severity of vesicoureteral reflux. Infants with renal damage on dimercaptosuccinic acid scan developed dysfunctional voiding only at a slightly greater, but not significantly different, rate than those with normal kidneys.
