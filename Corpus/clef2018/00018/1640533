Postnatal ultrasound screening of urinary malformations. We performed routine neonatal ultrasound screening on 3,454 neonates in the first week of life to establish the real incidence of congenital uropathy. Pronounced anomalies were found in 36 cases (1.04%) and mild renal pelvis dilatation in 159 (4.60%). In the population study prenatal ultrasonography showed evidence of severe anomalies in only 7 fetuses (0.2%). Surgical correction was required in 14 cases. Our results indicate that neonatal ultrasound screening has sufficient sensitivity and specificity for the early detection of the vast majority of urinary tract malformations. In 2 cases mild vesicoureteral reflux was not detected until a urinary tract infection was noted. Thus, neonatal sonography appears to be of limited value in detecting mild reflux.
