Hypercholesterolaemia is not associated with early atherosclerotic lesions in primary biliary cirrhosis. Hypercholesterolaemia often occurs in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) as a result of chronic cholestasis, but whether these patients are exposed to greater cardiovascular risk is unknown.To establish whether hypercholesterolaemia is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in PBC.103 consecutive patients with PBC (37 with total cholesterol > or =6.21 mmol/l) and 37 controls with hypercholesterolaemia, and 141 matched controls with normocholesterolaemia.Ultrasound imaging of carotid artery to determine intima-media thickness (IMT) and stenosis.Controls with hypercholesterolaemia had higher IMT and prevalence of carotid stenosis compared with patients with hypercholesterolaemic PBC (mean (SD) 0.850 (0.292) mm v 0.616 (0.137) mm, p(c)<0.001 43% v 19%, p(c) = 0.129) who, in turn, were similar to the 66 patients with normocholesterolaemic PBC (0.600 (0.136) mmHypercholesterolaemia is not consistently associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in PBC, but should be treated if other risk factors for cardiovascular disease are also present. The search for factors that may protect patients with hypercholesterolaemic PBC against atherosclerosis should be encouraged.
