Vesicoureteric reflux endoscopic treatment complications in childhood. Nowadays, around 1% of children suffer from vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), which represents a risk factor for long-term kidney damage. In the last decade, development in this field has shown that subureteric endoscopic injection of bulking agents for childhood VUR is an acceptable alternative unlike long-term antibiotic prophylaxis and open surgery.To establish the complications of childhood VUR endoscopic treatment.A retrospective analysis was carried out for every patient treated endoscopically in our department from January 1999 to September 2003, with a total amount of 516 implants of submucous bulking agents. All patients were assessed with an ultrasound as a first diagnostic technique so as to establish the complications associated with it, especially ureteral obstruction and injected agent migration.Out of 516 cases, Macroplastique was used in 455, Deflux in 44 and Polytef in 17. 10 patients (1.9%) (5 girls/ 5 boys), with ages ranging from 15 months to 11,4 years, presented some kind of complications (Macroplastique was used in 8cases and Deflux in 2). Among them, 5 were remarkable due to an ureterohydronefrosis, 2 of which needed a nephrostomy. 3 patients presented an implant migration, 1 epididymitis and 1 bladder edema.Endoscopic bulking agent injection has become a safe alternative to open surgery in childhood VUR management.
