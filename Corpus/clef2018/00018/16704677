The characteristics and outcome of primary vesicoureteric reflux diagnosed in the first year of life. A retrospective trial was performed to study presentation, evaluation, management, complications and outcome of 186 infants with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Medical records of 103 male and 83 female infants with mean age at entry 5.97 months were reviewed. Diagnosis was established using radiographic voiding cystourethrogram. At diagnosis, a renal ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy were performed in all children. The follow-up included blood pressure measurements, serial urine cultures, haematological and biochemical tests, radionuclide cystography, renal ultrasounds and renal scintigraphy. The majority of infants with reflux, 176/186, presented with one or more episodes of urinary tract infections. In 113 children, reflux resolved spontaneously, 27 underwent surgical or endoscopic correction and 46 are being followed-up to date. Spontaneous resolution after prophylaxis was more frequent in boys (p < 0.0001), in children with grade I or II (p < 0.0001) and unilateral reflux at diagnosis (p = 0.0215). No significant difference could be established with respect to the presence of scars (p = 0.1680) and the number of breakthrough urinary tract infections (p = 0.1078). The data of the present study indicate that spontaneous resolution rate is high in infants, and therefore, early antireflux
