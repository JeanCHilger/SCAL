Rapid-growing left intraventricular cardiac hemangioma. A 62 years old man with Child B liver cirrhosis, prostate cancer and a recent colon carcinoma resection was referred to our cardiology department for trans-thoracic-echocardiography (TTE) in order to establish left ventricular function before starting chemotherapy. TTE revealed a mobile mass (16 x 8 mm) attached to the anterior-medial left ventricular wall, protruding and swinging within the left ventricle cavity. At follow-up TTE showed growing of the intra-cardiac tumor up to 27 x 10 mm, corresponding to a size increase of 1 mm/month. Among different pathologies a rapid growing benign tumor with a high risk of systemic embolisation or an endocardial blood cyst were retained as possible diagnoses. Given the progression of the cardiac finding and the patient's improved general condition, surgical resection of the cardiac mass was performed. Histological examination revealed a mixed capillary/cavernous hemangioma. This case shows the unusual concomitant appearance of a rapid growing cavernous hemangioma which rarely located at ventricular level and the feasibility of cardiac resection without further sequelae in a poly-morbid patient.
