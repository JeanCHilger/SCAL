Voiding dysfunction in children with vesicoureteral reflux. The aim of the study was to assess the rate of development of voiding dysfunction (VD) in patients with reflux nephropathy. We investigated 150 pts with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR): 33 boys and 117 girls in mean age 9 +/- 3.3 years with normal renal function. In all pts we performed renal scintigraphy (DMSA) and ABPM. Renal scarring by DMSA scan was categorized into grades 1-4. In all pts we assessed high and laterality of VUR, renal function (clearance creatinine--Ccr) and occurency of hypertension (HT).Of 150 pts, 80 (53.3%) developed VD (54.5% boys and 52% girls). DMSA grade: 1--27 pts, 2--85 pts 3--31 ptsApproximately 50% of patients with VUR demonstrated VD. VD occurred independent of age. IV-V degrees VUR and more severe changes in DMSA scan were seen in pts with bladder/sphincter dysfunction.
