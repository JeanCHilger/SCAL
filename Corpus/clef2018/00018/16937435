Efficacy of ultrasonography and alpha-fetoprotein on early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma. To evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasonographic screening for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The data of 14968 patients who had ultrasonography (US) for chronic liver diseases were collected into a database program from June 1995 to June 2005. The risk factors for HCC were also studied. A total of 6089 patients who had repeated US were enrolled, 264 patients were diagnosed with HCC during follow-up (mean, 39 mo).The detection rate of small HCC (<= 3 cm in diameter) was 67.7%. The tumor size detected by screening at the intervals of 6 mo was significantly smaller than that at longer intervals. Only 29.3% of HCC patients had an elevated serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level above 400 ng/mL. The risk of HCC development during follow-up was higher in patients with liver cirrhosis (10.9%) and hepatitis C (9.0%) than in patients with chronic hepatitis (4.2%), hepatitis B (4.9%) and non-B, non-C hepatitis (NBNC, 3.9%).US screening at a interval of 6 mo is beneficial to high-risk patients over 40 years old and the early detection of HCC prolongs survival.
