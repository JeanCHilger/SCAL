Review of 86 patients with myelodysplasia and neurogenic bladder who underwent sigmoidocolocystoplasty and were followed more than 10 years. We reviewed the long-term outcome of sigmoidocolocystoplasty.The records of 86 patients who underwent sigmoidocolocystoplasty with a followup of more than 10 years were reviewed, focusing on histopathology, renal function, vesicoureteral reflux, bladder stones and urinary continence. We developed a urinary continence evaluation score, calculated as the postoperative minus the preoperative urinary continence score, including 0-incontinence, 1-severe leakage, 2-moderate leakage, 3-mild leakage, 4-almost dry and 5-dry, for patient self-assessment of urinary continence. A score of 2 or more meant improvement and a score of less than 2 meant no improvement.Mean followup was 13.1 years (range 10 to 21). Histopathology showed inflammation in all cases, hyperplasia in 9 and metaplasia in 4. In 80 of 86 cases creatinine clearance was normal. Ureteral reimplantation had been performed before sigmoidocolocystoplasty in 9 cases (13 kidneys) for grades III to V vesicoureteral reflux, which recurred as grade I in 1 (1 kidney). Ureteral reimplantation was performed during sigmoidocolocystoplasty in 31 cases (58 kidneys) and grades I to II vesicoureteral recurred in 5 (6 kidneys). Of the remaining 44 sigmoidocolocystoplasty cases there were 2 (2 kidneys) of grade I vesicoureteral reflux. On (99m)technetium-dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy there was increased renal scarring in 8 cases. Bladder stones were identified in 18 of 86 cases during followup but they were absent at review. The urinary continence evaluation score showed improvement in 61 cases and no improvement in 25.Our results suggest that sigmoidocolocystoplasty is safe and effective in the long term.
