Noninvasive tests for the prediction of significant hepatic fibrosis in hepatitis C virus carriers with persistently normal alanine aminotransferases. The diagnostic value of Doppler and various noninvasive indices in predicting significant hepatic fibrosis in hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers with persistently normal alanine aminotransferases (PNALT) is unknown.Seventy-nine treatment-na√Øve HCV carriers with PNALT, who received Doppler ultrasonography and percutaneous liver biopsies, were enrolled in the study. Doppler indices, including portal vein velocity (PVV), hepatic arterial resistive index (HARI), hepatic arterial pulsatility index (HAPI), splenic arterial resistive index (SARI), and splenic arterial pulsatility index (SAPI), were compared with known biochemical indices used in HCV carriers with elevated ALT levels, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI), age-platelet index (API), and AST to ALT ratio (AAR), for the diagnostic accuracy of significant hepatic fibrosis.SAPI was the most discriminatory index among the Doppler indices (P<0.001). By comparing areas under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) of SAPI with various biochemical indices, SAPI was superior to APRI, API, and AAR for predicting significant fibrosis (> or =F2) (0.862 vs. 0.673, 0.639, 0.504). SAPI set at 0.85 and 1.10 had a sensitivity of 96.7% and 66.7%, a specificity of 44.6% and 96.0%, a positive predictive value of 41.4% and 87.1%, and an negative predictive value of 97% and 87.7% in predicting significant fibrosis.This study indicates that SAPI is the most useful index among Doppler and biochemical indices for the detection of significant hepatic fibrosis in HCV carriers with PNALT levels.
