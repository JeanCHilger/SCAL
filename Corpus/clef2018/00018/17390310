Vesico-ureteral reflux in children with prenatally detected hydronephrosis: a systematic review. To investigate the value of prenatally detected hydronephrosis (PNH) as a prognostic factor for vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR).The MEDLINE database was searched for articles on PNH and VUR published between 1980 and 2004. A total of 18 studies were identified and reviewed for various aspects. Results were separated for primary and/or secondary VUR whenever possible, because of the different underlying pathogenic mechanisms.There was considerable variation between the different studies with respect to methodology and study design. One of the main discrepancies was the way in which postnatal abnormalities were ascertained: by postnatal ultrasound, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) alone, or combined or sequential ultrasound and VCUG. Taking these limitations into account, the published data showed there to be a mean prevalence of 15% for postnatal primary VUR after PNH. Of all patients with PNH, 53% had no postnatal anomalies, whereas 29% had other anomalies, such as duplex collecting systems.Of all infants with PNH, 15% had primary VUR proven postnatally and 53% had no other anomalies detected. We suggest a standardized protocol for future studies, to enable better comparison of follow-up protocols. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
