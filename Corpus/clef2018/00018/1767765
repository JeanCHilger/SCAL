Urinary tract anomalies detected in prenatal diagnosis. Advances and spread in ultrasonography in obstetrics have resulted in the increase in the number of reports of congenital anatomical anomalies that have been diagnosed prenatally. We present 56 patients with congenital urinary tract anomalies, which were found by prenatal USG. These anomalies included pelvi-ureteric junction stenosis in 19, multicystic kidney in 12, primary megaureter in 6, ureterocele in 4, posterior urethral valve in 3, polycystic kidney in 2, vesicoureteral reflux in 2, urogenital sinus anomaly in 2 and others in 4. There were 9 oligohydramnios: posterior urethral valve in 2, polycystic kidney in 2, bilateral multicystic kidney in 2, urogenital sinus anomaly in 2 and vesicoureteral reflux in 1. In the neonatal period, urological treatment was performed on 13 patients indwelling catheter on 4, vesicostomy on 2, ureterocutaneostomy on 2, TUR cele on 2 and others on 3. Among the cases, 25 have been operated on after the various intervals of follow-up periods. Pyeloplasty was performed on 9 patients with pelvi-ureteric junction stenosis, total reconstriction on 4 with ureterocele, ureterocystoneostomy on 3 with megaureter and others on 9. There were 7 lethal cases
