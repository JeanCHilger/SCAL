Vesicoureteric reflux in the adult. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is a well-recognized entity in the paediatric population, but is not well described or understood in the adult population. This is partly explained by the fact that its incidence declines with advancing age. Its diagnosis is, however, still important, with VUR accounting for at least 10% of adult patients with end-stage renal disease. With early detection and careful management, the secondary complications of VUR such as renal failure can be prevented. Imaging plays a major role in the detection and evaluation of VUR in the adult patient. Conventional techniques such as micturating cystourethrograms have now been supplemented by cross-sectional imaging with CT and MRI. In this review article, we comprehensively review the up to date status of imaging the adult patient with VUR and discuss important subgroups of patients such as pregnant and transplant patients.
