The common ileal ureter: a new technique for compliant ureterocystoplasty. Ureterocystoplasty is an effective technique for bladder reconstruction in patients with megaureter. Initial reports were encouraging but later repeat augmentation with bowel was necessary in many patients. We evaluated whether repeat augmentation after ureterocystoplasty could be avoided using two-thirds of each megaureter.Ureterocystoplasty was performed in 6 patients using the distal two-thirds of the 2 ureters. Continuity was reestablished by anastomosis of the remaining proximal ureters to a tubularized and tapered piece of ileum, which was reimplanted in an antireflux manner into the reconstructed bladder. All patients underwent preoperative and postoperative evaluation with ultrasound, creatinine, voiding cystourethrogram, nuclear renal scan and videourodynamic testing.Patient age at ureterocystoplasty was between 7 and 15 years with a median followup of 45.3 months. Preoperative videourodynamics demonstrated low capacity bladders with grade 5 vesicoureteral reflux and a poor mean bladder compliance of 7.4 ml/cm H2O. Bladder capacity increased up to 12-fold postoperatively with a mean compliance rate of 58 ml/cm H2O and vesicoureteral reflux resolved in all patients. One patient required endoscopic incision of the reimplanted common ileal ureter but no other complications occurred.The common ileal ureter provided a long-term compliant reservoir without the need for future repeat augmentation in all patients. Using standard urological techniques the complication rates remained low and recovery time was similar to that of standard ureterocystoplasty.
