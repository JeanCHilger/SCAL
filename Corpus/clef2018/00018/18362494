Extravesical seromuscular ureteroneocystostomy: an effective and simple operation for treatment of vesicoureteral reflux. To evaluate the success rate of extravesical seromuscular ureteroneocystostomy in the treatment of children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).In a prospective study from August 2005 to January of 2006, 15 patients (11 girls, 4 boys), median age of 9.5 years (range: 1-24 years), with high-grade VUR underwent operation. Urinary tract ultrasonography and voiding cystoureterography (VCUG) were the main diagnostic tools to detect VUR before the operation and at 3 months after the operation.No VUR was detected at evaluation of 3-month postoperative VCUGs (14 cases, 93%). However, one child (7%) still had persistent VUR. This patient underwent reoperation and the length of the seromuscular tunnel was increased more with a favorable result. The overall success rate of this technique was about 93%.Extravesical seromuscular ureteroneocystostomy is simple and effective method for the treatment of VUR in children.
