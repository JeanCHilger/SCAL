Vesicoureteric reflux deterioration in monozygotic twins. Primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is the most common inherited structural urinary tract disorder, conforming closely to autosomal dominant transmission. A pair of monozygotic siblings is described exhibiting a remarkably parallel clinical course. VUR grade II was diagnosed in girl A during urinary tract infection at the age of 2 yr screening of her asymptomatic sister (girl B) revealed the same. Renal cortical scintigraphy unveiled unilateral hypo-dysplasia in both the twins. Despite trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, infection recurred in girl A after 7 months, while girl B had a first episode 2 months later that prompted regimen switch to nitrofurantoin. Follow-up at the age of 4 depicted bilateral reflux deterioration
