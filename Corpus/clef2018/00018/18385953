The long-term effects of lamivudine treatment in patients with HBeAg-negative liver cirrhosis. In hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cirrhosis, patients with HBV replication show a higher mortality rate than those without. We aimed to investigate the long-term effects of lamivudine on HBV DNA suppression, Child-Pugh score, and survival in patients with hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg)-negative liver cirrhosis.Sixty-eight patients (51 male, 17 female) diagnosed with HBV-positive liver cirrhosis, who were monitored by the hepatology and liver transplantation outpatient clinics of our hospital between June 1999 and May 2007, were included in the study. Lamivudine (100 mg/day) was administered orally. Follow-up visits were scheduled monthly during the first 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. Complete blood count, haemostasis, biochemistry (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], amylase, urea, creatinine, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin), and alpha-foetoprotein were recorded every 3 months. HBV DNA levels, abdominal ultrasound and the Child-Pugh score were evaluated every 6 months.Sixty-eight patients (mean age, 52.05+/-12.6 years) were monitored for 49.51+/-18.51 months. Basal ALT, HBV DNA levels and Child-Pugh scores were 103.9+/-73.9 IU/ml, 4133+/-121,94 IU/ml, and 7.6+/-2.4, respectively. The ALT normalisation was 59.7% during the first year, 68.2% during the second year and 44.4% during the fifth year. There was a significant decrease in Child-Pugh scores in the first 3 follow-up years when compared with the baseline score (P<0.05). During the treatment, HBV DNA positivity and YMDD mutations were determined in 20 of 68 (29.4%) patients at 46+/-17.9 months. Nine patients (13.2%) developed hepatocellular carcinoma at 44.8+/-21.5 months. Thirteen patients (19.1%) died during the treatment due to liver failure or variceal bleeding.Lamivudine is beneficial in patients with HBeAg-negative liver cirrhosis in terms of improvement in liver function and enhancement of survival and quality of life. An HBV DNA suppressive effect and improvement in Child-Pugh score were seen especially in the first years. It is important to be aware of YMDD mutation early, as addition of new antivirals is necessary to overcome unwanted results of the mutation.
