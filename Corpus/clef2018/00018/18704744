Diagnosis and management of congenital bladder diverticulum in infancy and childhood: experience with nine cases at a tertiary health center in a developing country. The purpose of the study is to present the authors' clinical and surgical experience with congenital bladder diverticula in nine pediatric patients at a developing world tertiary care center.Records of nine patients diagnosed and treated as congenital bladder diverticula from 2000 to 2007 were retrospectively reviewed for age, sex, chief complaints, associated anomalies, investigative work-up, operative notes, and postoperative follow-up.All were males. Age at presentation ranged from six months to eight years (mean three years). All were diagnosed postnatally by ultrasound and/or voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and confirmed on urethrocystoscopy. Open surgical excision of diverticulum was done in all the patients. Ureteral reimplantation was simultaneously done only in three patients with VCUG-documented high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). With an average follow-up of four years, gradual resolution of symptoms was seen in seven of nine patients whose postoperative follow up records were available. There was no diverticulum recurrence at the defined mean follow-up.Pediatric patients with recurrent urinary tract infections and voiding dysfunction should always be evaluated for congenital bladder diverticulum. Although investigations such as intravenous urography (IVU), urodynamic studies, nuclear renal scanning, and, sometimes, CT scan and MRI, form an important part of preoperative diagnostic work-up and postoperative follow up, USG and VCUG may be enough when availability and cost are the constraints. Diverticulectomy, with ureteral reimplantation for high-grade reflux, provides good results without recurrence.
