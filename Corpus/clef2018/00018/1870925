Renal obstructive dysplasia: ultrasound diagnosis and therapeutic implications. 57 cases of renal obstructive dysplasia (defined as the abnormal development of nephronic and ductal structures due to in utero obstruction of the urinary tract) were evaluated in terms of sonographic findings, renal and other associated anomalies, and current status of the child. More than one-third of the cases had bilateral disease and although not uniformly fatal bilateral involvement was associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In 12 of the 33 cases with unilateral dysplasia there was an association with contralateral renal problems including uretero-pelvic junction obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux and aplasia. Almost one-half of the cases had congenital anomalies, these included VACTERL association, congenital heart disease, cranial abnormalities and gastrointestinal malformations. Fifteen stillborns and 12 of the patients with bilateral involvement and four with unilateral involvement have died. Four patients are on dialysis (two with bilateral involvement and two with unilateral renal obstructive dysplasia). Only one-quarter are otherwise normal. More serious problems are reported in this mixed age population of patients with obstructive renal dysplasia than has been identified in previous studies. Management decisions of the fetus and child must be based on this new age-expanded population.
