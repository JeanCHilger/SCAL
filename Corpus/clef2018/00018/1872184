Diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness (DIDMOAD syndrome). A clinical study in two Sudanese families. Four Sudanese children with DIDMOAD syndrome (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness) are reported. They were two boys (aged 15 and 16 years) in one family and a boy and a girl (aged 16 and 6 years, respectively) in another family. Diabetes mellitus was first to appear (at 3-8 years) followed by deafness and visual failure and the disease ended fatally in one patient (aged 20 years). In the other three, diabetes insipidus was confirmed using water deprivation test for 8 hours. The maximum urine osmolality ranged between 131-523 mOsm/kg, whereas the corresponding plasma osmolality ranged between 315-332 mOsm/kg. Slight further improvement in urine concentration was observed in 2 of the patients following the use of desmopressin (DDAVP, 20 micrograms intranasally). Intravenous pyelography, voiding cystourethrography and ultrasound revealed severe bilateral hydronephrosis, dilated ureters and distended bladder without vesicoureteral reflux in the three patients. With the high rate of consanguinity prevalent in North Africa and the Middle East, we recommend examining children who present with diabetes mellitus in this region for features of DIDMOAD syndrome.
