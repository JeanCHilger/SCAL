Is serum procalcitonin able to predict long-term kidney morbidity from urinary tract infections in children? A new diagnostic strategy for children with febrile urinary tract infections could be the routine use of procalcitonin assessment to identify children requiring closer follow-up since being at risk for kidney damage. A total of 11 studies were published between 1998 and 2007. Children with very high procalcitonin levels during urinary tract infections are likely to be at risk of renal damage and vesico-ureteral reflux. Therefore, the prediction of long-term renal damage showed contradictory results. However, high procalcitonin values at diagnosis and positive scintigraphic scans may suggest the need to investigate for vesico-ureteral reflux. Consequently, procalcitonin levels should be included in follow-up protocols for urinary tract infections to aid in decision making concerning scintigraphic scans and voiding cystourethrograms.
