Long-term results of treatment of vesicoureteral refluxes. To estimate the results of treatment of vesicoureteral refluxes (VUR) in children. 156 children were involved into the study. 68 children aged 10 years and above (mean age 13.1 +/- 2.4 years) were analysed in detail. The patients were divided into groups depending on method of treatment: surgical (26 children), transurethral injection of teflon/collagen (11 children), conservative (31 children). The results of treatment were evaluated on basis of subsidence of VUR, kidney function, renal scarring on DMSA scan and arterial hypertension.Persistence of VUR was observed in 6 patients treated conservatively (19.4%), 5 of them had voiding disturbances, in 1 patient treated with injections (9.1%) and in no operated patients. There was no significant difference between groups in kidney function and in presence of hypertension. Operated patients had significantly higher grade of VUR and grade of renal scarring on DMSA scan.Method of treatment of vesicoureteral refluxes does not influence kidney function or occurence of hypertension.
