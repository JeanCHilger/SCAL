Imaging studies in the first urinary infection with fever in infants: is voiding cystourethrography necessary?. The presence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in an infant with urinary tract infection (UTI), does not necessarily lead to an acquired renal injury. Only serious reflux can be a factor in fostering its appearance.To assess whether in infants diagnosed for the first time with a UTI with a fever, a routine initial DMSA can be used as a screening method for detecting severe reflux and replace voiding cystourethrography (VCUG).We retrospectively studied 162 infants under 2 years old admitted to our hospital due to having a ITU with fever for the first time (92 males and 70 females). In all cases, a renal ultrasound, DMSA and VCUG had been performed a few days after the diagnosis.Of the 162 patients, 62 (38 %) had VUR, of which 56 (90 %) were mild and 6 (10 %) were severe. The DMSA was abnormal in 26/100 patients without VUR (26 %), 12/56 with mild VUR (21 %) and 6/6 of those with severe VUR (100 %). DMSA sensitivity for detecting severe reflux was 100 % and specificity was 76 %. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value was 14 % and 100 % respectively. The positive likelihood ratio was 4.17 and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.It is unnecessary to carry out VCUG in an infant with an initial UTI, and a negative DMSA.
