Radiofrequency ablation of malignant liver tumours. Both primary and secondary liver tumors are common problems. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a tumor with rapid progression and poor prognosis. The standard in the treatment of liver tumors is surgical resection. The majority of patients with primary or metastatic hepatic tumors are not candidates for resection because of tumor size, location near major intrahepatic blood vessels precluding a margin-negative resection, multifocality, or inadequate hepatic function due to coexistent cirrhosis. Only 20-30% of patients undergoing potentially curative liver resection will not suffer from tumor recurrence. Radiofrequency ablation (ARF) is an evolving technology used to treat patients with non-removable primary and metastatic hepatic cancers. ARF produces coagulative necrosis of tumor through local tissue heating. Liver tumors are treated percutaneously, laparoscopically, or during laparotomy using ultrasonography to identify their position and guide the ARF needle electrode. The indications, treatmentplanning, and limitations of hepatic ARF must be defined. ARF of hepatic malignancies is a safe and promising technique to produce coagulative necrosis of non-removable hepatic malignancies. Experience with this treatment is not yet rich enough to establish long-term outcomes.
