Investigation of histopathologic changes in the ureter walls in vesicoureteral reflux. This study aimed to determine the histopathologic changes in ureteral walls (UWs) in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).Twenty ureteral specimens taken from children were divided into 2 groups, refluxing (R) and control (C) groups, each containing 10 specimens. Wall thickness of the ureter, tunica muscularis of the ureter, mucosal thickness of the ureter (uroepithelium), collagen thickness of the ureter, mucosal change, and inflammation were evaluated in resected distal UWs in children with VUR.The mean wall thickness of the ureter, mean tunica muscularis of the ureter, and mean uroepithelium values of the UWs in the R group were not significantly lower compared to those in the C group. Collagen thickness values in the R group were significantly lower than those in the C group.Our data suggest that wall thickness (tunica muscularis and uroepithelium) was not significantly decreased, but collagen thickness of the ureter was decreased in the UWs of children with VUR.
