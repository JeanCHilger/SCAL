Outcome and management of isolated moderate renal pelvis dilatation detected at postnatal screening. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and outcome of isolated moderate renal pelvis dilatation (RPD) [anterior-posterior diameter (APD) 10-15 mm] in an unselected population of 2-month-old infants prospectively followed for up to 12-14 months of life. Isolated moderate renal pelvis dilatation was detected in 282 of the 11,801 (2.4%), infants screened 240 infants with normal renal ultrasound were enrolled as the control group. Resolution of RPD was considered when an APD <or= 5 mm was found on two consecutive sonograms. Urological investigations were initiated if the RPD persisted or if urinary tract infection (UTI) occurred during follow-up, and antibiotic therapy was administered only when UTI occurred. The events of interest were resolution of the RPD, presence of uropathy and UTI. At follow-up, RPD persisted only in 18 infants
