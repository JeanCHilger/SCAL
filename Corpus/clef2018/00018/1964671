Studies of clinically latent cirrhosis. Nine cases of latent cirrhosis showing normal hepatic functions (eight males and one female with an average age of 49.3 +/- 12.7) were studied clinicopathologically. They accounted for 1.8% of all cirrhotic patients and many of them were positive for HBs antigen and HBe antibody. Of the nine cases, two were complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma. Imaging diagnostic examinations, such as ultrasonography or RI scintigraphy, revealed uneven echo levels and RI distribution in the liver, including both of the two cases associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Histopathological examination showed inactive or early-stage cirrhosis. These results indicated the importance of non-invasive imaging by abdominal ultrasonography and radioisotope, as screening tests for cirrhosis, especially for middle- and old-aged HBs antigen carriers, even if their liver function tests show normal findings.
