Predicting early recurrent urinary tract infection in pretoilet trained children with vesicoureteral reflux. We identified independent factors predicting recurrent urinary tract infection within 1 year after the first urinary tract infection in pretoilet trained children with vesicoureteral reflux.We retrospectively reviewed the records of infants younger than 2 years with primary vesicoureteral reflux and a history of febrile urinary tract infection. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of recurrent febrile urinary tract infection. Analysis included age, gender, reflux laterality and grade, abnormalities on dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan and prophylactic antibiotic type. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for recurrent febrile urinary tract infection.From 2004 to 2007, 78 children met study inclusion criteria. Mean age at the first urinary tract infection was 4 months (range 1 week to 16 months). None of the males were circumcised. Of 78 children 25 (32%) had a recurrent febrile urinary tract infection during 1 year of followup. Univariate analysis showed that bilateral reflux, high grade reflux (IV-V) and abnormal dimercapto-succinic acid scan were statistically significant predictors of early recurrent urinary tract infection (p <0.05). However, on multivariate analysis only an abnormal dimercapto-succinic acid scan showed a significant association with early recurrent urinary tract infection (OR 8.01, 95% CI 2.10-30.51, p = 0.002).Abnormal dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan is an important predictor of early recurrent urinary tract infection in pretoilet trained children with vesicoureteral reflux. Whether the explanation lies in congenital or infection related damage, in this patient subgroup careful clinical followup or early surgical management for reflux should be considered.
