The efficacy of digital fluoroscopic image capture in the evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux in children. In accordance with ALARA, minimizing radiation exposure associated with voiding cystourethrograms (VCUG) is of critical importance. Advances in fluoroscopic technology might help achieve this goal.To determine the efficacy of fluoroscopic image capture compared to conventional digital radiographic spot (DRS) images in voiding cystourethrograms (VCUG) for the evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children.The study was a retrospective review of 65 VCUG examinations (130 kidney/ureter units). Each examination consisted of fluoroscopically captured spot (FCS) images and the corresponding DRS images. Each set of images was evaluated by three pediatric radiologists for the diagnosis of VUR for a total of 390 kidney/ureter units reviewed. Using the DRS image set as the reference standard, the efficacy of the FCS images for diagnosing reflux was determined.The diagnostic accuracy of the FCS images in terms of the binary characterization of reflux as negative or positive was 97.2% (379/390). The sensitivity of the FCS images was 92.6% (88/95) the specificity of the FCS images was 98.6% (291/295).Fluoroscopically captured images are adequate in documenting absence of VUR on VCUG examinations, obviating the need for radiographic spot images and resulting in reduction in radiation exposure.
