Lich-Gregoir ureteral reimplantation with fixation of ureter during detrusorraphy as a reliable outpatient anti-reflux procedure. We report our experience with a Lich-Gregoir reimplantation (LGR) technique that included fixation of the ureter during detrusorraphy to preserve the integrity of the newly created submucosal tunnel, performed as an outpatient anti-reflux procedure.Ninety-seven children (mean age: 7.9 years) with primary VUR underwent LGR between 1995 and 2008. Twenty-one had bilateral VUR, 8 had ureteral duplication, 9 had megaureter, and 13 had previous subureteric injections. Through a Pfannenstiel incision the ipsilateral ureter was mobilized up to the ureterovesical junction without disturbing ureterotrigonal integrity. A 3-5 cm detrusorotomy was extended from the ureterovesical junction towards the umbilicus, the ureter was placed on the mucosa, and detrusorraphy was performed with a loosely running 3/4-0 polyglactin suture that passed through the detrusor on one side of the incision, taking a 1-2 mm "bite" of the ureteral adventitia, and detrusor on the other side. Postoperative ultrasonograms and voiding cystograms (VCUG) were obtained at 1 and 3 months, respectively. Children were then followed up for clinical symptoms of urinary tract infection with annual ultrasonograms.The mean operative time was 56 min. Eighty-one percent of the children were treated as outpatients. Transient voiding difficulties occurred in 2 children with a bilateral procedure. Reflux was cured in 116 ureters (98%) with a mean follow-up of 58 months (range: 6-128). Ipsilateral obstruction was not evident during ultrasound surveillance.LGR is an outpatient procedure with a high success rate and a low morbidity. Integrity of the newly created submucosal tunnel is important for long-term success, which may be facilitated by our modified detrusorraphy technique.
