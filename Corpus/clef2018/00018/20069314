Catheter-free methods for vesicoureteric reflux detection: our experience and a critical appraisal of existing data. In recent years, the exact role of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in general has become controversial, though in some groups of children the knowledge of the existence or non-existence of VUR is still a very important issue. The number of techniques available for the assessment of VUR is increasing, and a new classification taking into account their real characteristics (direct/indirect, catheter-using/catheter-free, radiation-giving/radiation-free) has been proposed. The purpose of the following review is to evaluate the currently available evidence supporting the use of various catheter-free methods for VUR detection. We believe that as the clinical role of VUR has been questioned, it is even more important for the method of its detection to be user-friendly as regards catheterisation, radiation and availability. There is still no evidence supporting the assertion that any of the catheter-free methods of VUR detection might be the optimal one for any child. However, there are some groups of children who would benefit from using them. New studies using new, catheter-free methods of VUR detection or a combination of two or more of the methods described may prove useful in improving sensitivity and providing additional data on this important issue.
