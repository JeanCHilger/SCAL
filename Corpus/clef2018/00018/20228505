Frequency of occurrence of vesico-ureteral reflux in kidney transplanted patients with the new technique of uretero-neo- cystostomy (Barry-Taguchi). There are several ways of performing vesico-ureteral anastomosis in kidney trans-plantation (Tx) they are broadly classified into two categories: extra-vesical and intra-vesical. Extra-vesical methods are preferred in kidney transplantation. In this study, we attempt to integrate two extra-vesical techniques of Barry and Taguchi and to evaluate the frequency of occurrence of vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) with this technique. Also, an attempt is made to compare the results with other techniques reported in the literature. Fifty consecutive transplant recipients, who underwent uretero-neo-cystostomy (uretero-vesical anastomosis) by the new technique of Barry-Taguchi were evaluated for VUR by sonography and cystoureterography, six months after Tx. The mean age of the study subjects was 34.8 years
