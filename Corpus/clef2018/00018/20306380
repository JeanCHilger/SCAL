Measurement of liver elasticity with acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) technology: an alternative noninvasive method for staging liver fibrosis in viral hepatitis. The acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) technology is a novel ultrasound method that provides information about the local elasticity of tissue in real-time. ARFI is integrated in a conventional ultrasound system. The aim of this exploratory study was to evaluate this new technique in the assessment of liver fibrosis in a cohort with chronic viral hepatitis B and C and to ascertain the most reliable hepatic segment for measurements.57 patients (27 female, 30 male, mean age 54 years) with chronic viral hepatitis B and C underwent ARFI imaging and consecutively liver biopsy. The results were compared to the histological fibrosis degree (F), which served as the reference. 20 healthy volunteers received ARFI quantification of different segments of the liver.The best ARFI assessments with the lowest rate of invalid measurements were carried out by an intercostal approach to segment VII/VIII of the liver. The ARFI velocities of the healthy group had a mean of 1.09 m/s (range 0.79 - 1.32 m/s), the means of the patient group ranged from 0.83 to 4.19 m/s. ARFI quantification correlated significantly with the histological fibrosis stage (p < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the accuracy of ARFI imaging was 85 %, 92 % and 87 % for the diagnosis of moderate fibrosis (>or= F2), severe fibrosis (>or= F3) and cirrhosis ( = F 4), respectively.This study underscores the usefulness of ARFI as a quick method for assessing liver fibrosis or cirrhosis in patients with HBV or HCV. ARFI measurements of the liver should be performed via an intercostal access. Increasing ARFI velocities correlate with higher degree of hepatic fibrosis.
