Feasibility of liver transient elastography with FibroScan using a new probe for obese patients. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) failure when using transient elastography occurs in 2-10% of patients, and is generally related to obesity. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the feasibility of LSM when using a new XL probe on patients with a body mass index (BMI) > or =30 kg/m(2).For each patient, LSM was performed using both M probe (currently available and dedicated to patients with standard morphology) and XL probe (dedicated to overweighed patients). A blood sample was taken to assess usual biological variables and simple readily available fibrosis blood tests.Ninety-nine patients were included (27 men, mean age 52 years, mean BMI 40.5 kg/m(2)). LSM was successful (10 valid measurements) in 45% of the cases with the M probe, vs 76% of the cases with the XL probe (P<0.001). Fifty-nine percent of those who could not be measured (<10 valid measurements) using the M probe could successfully be measured using the XL probe. In the 44 patients successfully measured with both probes, LSM was correlated with the platelet count, prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyltransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, fasting glucose, AST platelet ratio index, Forns score and FIB-4.The new XL probe allows providing a higher rate of LSM than the M probe in patients with an increased BMI and shows promising results for the evaluation of liver fibrosis.
