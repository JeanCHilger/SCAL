Evaluation of renal function in children undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. The effect of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy on the growing kidneys of young children has always been a concern. We determined whether shock wave lithotripsy causes renal parenchymal scarring or affects glomerular filtration rate in children.This prospective study included 100 children with renal stones who presented to the shock wave lithotripsy unit at our institution between March 2005 and March 2008. A total of 28 children had multiple stones in the same kidney. All children with bilateral renal stones had 1 kidney cleared of stones by percutaneous nephrolithotomy before undergoing shock wave lithotripsy. A total of 138 stones were subjected to shock wave lithotripsy. All children underwent radionuclide scan of the renal parenchyma using dimercapto-succinic acid, and glomerular filtration rate was estimated using diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and 6 months afterward. Children with renal scarring due to previous surgery or vesicoureteral reflux were excluded from the study. The number of shock wave lithotripsy sessions to achieve stone-free status and the dose of shock waves used were recorded for each patient.No patient demonstrated renal parenchymal scarring on dimercapto-succinic acid scan or any statistically significant change in glomerular filtration rate on diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan up to 6 months after shock wave lithotripsy.Shock wave lithotripsy is a safe modality for treating renal calculous disease in children up to 16 years old, with no impact on long-term kidney function.
