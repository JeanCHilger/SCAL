Imaging techniques and histology in the evaluation of liver fibrosis in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis mansoni in Brazil: a comparative study. Few publications have compared ultrasound (US) to histology in diagnosing schistosomiasis-induced liver fibrosis (LF) none has used magnetic resonance (MR). The aim of this study was to evaluate schistosomal LF using these three methods. Fourteen patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis admitted to hospital for surgical treatment of variceal bleeding were investigated. They were submitted to upper digestive endoscopy, US, MR and wedge liver biopsy. The World Health Organization protocol for US in schistosomiasis was used. Hepatic fibrosis was classified as absent, slight, moderate or intense. Histology and MR confirmed Symmers' fibrosis in all cases. US failed to detect it in one patient. Moderate agreement was found comparing US to MR
