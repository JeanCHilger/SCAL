Effect of carvedilol on portal pressure estimated by hepatic vein Doppler ultrasound waveform and damping index in cirrhotic patients. To assess the effect of Carvedilol in reducing portal pressure estimated non-invasively by studying Doppler ultrasound waveforms (DUS) and hepatic vein Damping Index (DI).Quasi-experimental study.Department of Medical ICU in collaboration with Department of Radiology, JPMC, over a period of 6 months (June 1st to 30th November, 2008).Of the enrolled 65 patients, 47 patients (33 males and 14 females) completed the study. The mean age was 47.4 years. Cirrhotic patients of Hepatitis B, C, D (delta), B and C combined, B and D combined with varying degrees of portal hypertension were included in the study. Cirrhotic patients with bronchial asthma, congestive heart failure, Insulin dependent Diabetes, portal vein thrombosis and hepatorenal syndrome were excluded from the study. The patients were examined by color flow Doppler of the right hepatic vein before and after administration of Carvedilol. Their waveforms and Damping Index (DI) were recorded and compared by Wilcoxon signed ranks test through SPSS version 12.0. Responders were described as those showing a positive change in wave forms or a decrese of 0.10 or more in DI.Of the 47 patients, 30 (63%) showed a positive response and 10 (21%) showed no favorable response to Carvedilol, while 7 (14%) patients showed deterioration. The mean DI on DUS dropped from 0.62 to 0.41 in responders after treatment, while in the non-responders it ranged between 0.42 and 0.57.Ultrasonography Carvedilol reduced portal pressure of cirrhotic patients, as measured indirectly by the damping index of hepatic waveform by Doppler.
