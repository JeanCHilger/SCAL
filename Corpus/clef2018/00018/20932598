Reliability of transient elastography for the detection of fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic viral hepatitis. Transient elastography (TE) is validated in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) to evaluate hepatic fibrosis however, limited data are available in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This prospective study is aimed to assess the accuracy and the efficacy of TE for the detection of fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease of different etiology and to evaluate the effect of steatosis on the liver stiffness measurement (LSM).TE was performed in 219 consecutive patients with chronic liver disease (35% CHC, 32% CHB, and 33% NAFLD) within 6 months of the liver biopsy.LSM was related to the fibrosis stage in each group (CHC: p = 0.596, p < 0.001 CHB: p = 0.418, p < 0.001This study confirms that TE can be considered a valid support to detect fibrosis in chronic liver disease related to HCV but it should be interpreted cautiously in CHB and NAFLD patients, where host or disease-related factors may modify its accuracy.
