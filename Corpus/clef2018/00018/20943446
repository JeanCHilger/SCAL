Elevated plasma levels of urotensin II do not correlate with systemic haemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis. The hyperdynamic circulation of hepatic cirrhosis is related to decreased systemic vascular resistance due to arterial vasodilation. Urotensin II plasma levels are increased in cirrhotic patients, and have been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of systemic haemodynamic alterations.To evaluate the relationships between systemic haemodynamics and urotensin II plasma levels.Thirty-six consecutive in-patients with cirrhosis and no alteration of plasma creatinine, and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers underwent noninvasive assessment of systemic haemodynamics and measurement of urotensin II plasma levels.In comparison to healthy controls, cirrhotic patients had signs of hyperdynamic circulation and higher plasma urotensin II levels. Plasma urotensin II was neither significantly different amongst patients with different severity of cirrhosis nor between patients with or without ascites. Both in controls and cirrhotic patients no significant correlations were found between parameters of systemic haemodynamics and plasma urotensin II levels.In patients with cirrhosis and hyperdynamic circulation, but with normal serum creatinine, urotensin II is higher than in healthy subjects. However, no correlation with cardiac index or other haemodynamic parameters was observed, indicating that other mechanisms prevail.
