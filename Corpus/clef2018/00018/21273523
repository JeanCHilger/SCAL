Liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C: noninvasive diagnosis by means of real-time tissue elastography--establishment of the method for measurement. To prospectively measure liver stiffness with real-time tissue elastography in patients with chronic hepatitis C and to compare the results with those of clinical assessment of fibrosis by using histologic stage as the reference standard.All subjects gave informed consent, and the study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Seventy hospitalized patients (46 men, 24 women mean age, 65.5 years ± 11.7 [standard deviation]Real-time tissue elastography cutoff values were 2.73 for F of 2 or greater, 3.25 for F of 3 or greater, and 3.93 for F of 4. No site differences were observed (κ = 0.835, ICC = 0.966), and the elastic ratio measurement was correlated between the two examiners (r(2) = 0.869, P < .0001). The areas under the ROC curves for elastic ratio, hyaluronic acid, type IV collagen, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, FibroIndex, Forns score, and Hepascore were 0.95, 0.32, 0.73, 0.76, 0.76, 0.87, and 0.70, respectively the elastic ratio performed better than the serum fibrosis markers and other scores.Real-time tissue elastography is not invasive and could be used to evaluate liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.10100319/-/DC1.
