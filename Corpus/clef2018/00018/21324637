Gas embolism: another story related to a central venous catheter withdraw. Paradoxical gas embolism is rare but life threatening complication of central venous access. In this observation, we report a paradoxical gas embolism accompanied by an acute respiratory failure and a coma following a jugular central venous access withdrawal in a liver transplanted patient. Following this observation, we discuss the prevention of gas embolism accidents and the hyperbaric oxygen therapy for its management.
