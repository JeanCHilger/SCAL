Anatomical right posterior sectionectomy: a further expansion of the ultrasound-guided compression technique. Dissection or encirclement of the sectional pedicles for resection area demarcation is generally required for anatomical right posterior sectionectomy (RPS). These maneuvers are sometime unfeasible and potentially dangerous. A new technique for performing an RPS is herein described. Among the last 289 consecutive patients who underwent hepatic resection, 15 met the eligibility criteria for anatomical RPS by ultrasound-guided finger compression. This technique consists in demarcating the resection area by ultrasound-guided finger compression of the right posterior portal pedicle at the level closest to the tumor but oncologically suitable. Five patients had HCC 11 had colorectal liver metastases. Median tumor number was 2 (range 1-46)
