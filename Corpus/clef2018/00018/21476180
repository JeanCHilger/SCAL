Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography inÂ acute liver failure: necrosis mimics cirrhosis. Acoustic radiation force Impulse (ARFI) technology correlates shear-wave velocity with fibrosis. It can differentiate between advanced fibrosis and normal tissue in chronic liver disease. However, specificity is impaired by cholestasis, inflammation or oedema in acute hepatitis. In patients with acute liver failure (ALF) necessitating liver transplantation ARFI has not been evaluated yet. We investigated 3 patients with ALF and compared their ARFI results to those of healthy controls (n = 33) and cases with liver cirrhosis (n = 21). In the 3 ALF patients shear-wave velocities were 3.0, 2.5, and 2.7 m/s, respectively. These results were significantly increased compared to those of healthy controls (median: 1.13 m/s p < 0.001) and similar to those of cirrhotic individuals (median: 2.93 m/s). Two individuals underwent liver transplantation. Explants showed massive necrosis, but no signs of chronic liver disease. Patient 3 recovered spontaneously and showed decreasing ARFI results during follow-up. In conclusion, hepatic necrosis can mimic liver cirrhosis at ARFI evaluation in ALF patients and this impairs the specificity of ARFI.
