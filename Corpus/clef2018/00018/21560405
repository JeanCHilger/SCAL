Effects of Calorie Mate Jelly eating before abdominal ultrasonography on the diagnosis--an evaluation in healthy adults. In transabdominal ultrasonography, the production of gas in the gastro-intestinal tract and contraction of the gallbladder have to be prevented to obtain clear observation images of any lesions. Therefore, patients avoid food and drink for many hours from the night before the examination. However, long-term fasting exacerbates energy homeostasis in patients with cirrhosis. Thus, it is necessary to develop a method of transabdominal ultrasonography allowing the shortening of the fasting time. In this study, subjects ingested Calorie Mate Jelly three hours before transabdominal ultrasonography. Then, we studied the effect of the Jelly on ultrasonographic images. Three hours after its consumption, imaging diagnosis involving the liver, in liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and kidney could be successfully carried out in all healthy adults. Thus, our observations indicated that the abdominal organs can be effectively observed by transabdominal ultrasonography if Calorie Mate Jelly is consumed up to three hours before the examination. Calorie Mate Jelly may help to prevent worsening energy homeostasis in patients who are required to fast for a prolonged period.
