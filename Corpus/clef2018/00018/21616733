Management of chronic liver disease by general practitioners in southern Italy: unmet educational needs. Despite chronic liver diseases represent an important cause of illness in Italy, data from family practice are poor.To assess the management of chronic liver diseases by general practitioners in a large area of Southern Italy.This was a 5-year retrospective analysis from 104 physicians in charge of a population of 143,159 adult subjects.Amongst 6550 patients with chronic liver disease (4.7%, 3400 M, median age 57 years), 1330 (20.3%) had HCV infection, 226 (3.4%) HBV infection, and 293 (4.5%) liver cirrhosis (25 alcohol-related). The prevalence of alcohol consumption, recorded by 90% of physicians, was 20.4%. Hypertransaminasemia and liver steatosis had a prevalence of 6.7% and 2.4%, respectively. Although transaminases were checked 3 times over 5 years in 80% of cases, few patients were investigated for viral infection, and less than 50% underwent ultrasonography and consultation, leaving undefined a consistent number of cases. Alcohol consumption, body mass index and ultrasonography were poorly checked even in hypertransaminasemic patients.This study shows that data recording by general practitioners in chronic liver disease patients lacks homogeneity and can miss important information. One unmet need is therefore the integration between theoretical knowledge and practice to share similar behaviours and improve the management of these patients.
