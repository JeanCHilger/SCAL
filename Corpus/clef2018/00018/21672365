The necessity of voiding cystourethrography in children with prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis. The postnatal persistence of fetal hydronephrosis requires further evaluation to establish whether pathological abnormalities are present. This study determined the necessity for voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) to identify vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children (n = 195) with prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis. Among the study population, the prevalence of VUR was 17.4% (24 males, 10 females). There was a poor correlation between the severity of hydronephrosis, ureteral dilatation, presence of bilateral hydronephrosis and presence of VUR. Except for the frequency of urinary tract infections and the presence of renal damage on (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans, VCUG was the only reliable method for confirming VUR in this study. The diagnosis of VUR is important for the early detection of renal damage. Further information is needed to develop the optimal approach to the evaluation of prenatal hydronephrosis, with reliable parameters that avoid invasive procedures such as VCUG.
