Endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux in children. Although vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a relatively common disease, in present there are different opinions regarding its approach by paediatric urologist, nephrologist and paediatrician. European Society for Paediatric Urology, European Association of Perinatal Medicine in collaboration with paediatric nephrologists developed--based on multicentric studies--a consensus approach for this disease. An efficient alternative is represented by endoscopic treatment.From January 2002 to December 2008 a number of 58 children, confirmed after mictional cistography with the diagnosis of VUR grade II - V, went endoscopic subureteral injection of dextranomer/ hyaluronic acid (Deflux). The reflux was unilateral in 21 cases and bilateral for the rest of 37. From 95 ureters, VUR was considered grade II - V in 15(15,79%), 45(47,37%), 28(29,47%) and 7(7,37%) cases. Follow-up and evaluation were based on mictional cistography and ultrasound examination.Reflux remitted after the first, the second or the third injection in 63(66,31%), 13(13,68%) and 1(1,05%) of the ureters. These results confirm the fact that endoscopic subureteral injection of an adequate material confers semnificative advantages. High rate of success, absence of postoperative complications, reduced period of hospitalization sustain this kind of treatment that is indicated in all grades of reflux.
