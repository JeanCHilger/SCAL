No complaints, but constantly elevated cholestatic serum liver tests. A 75 year old woman presented with long-lasting pruritus and elevation of serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Potentially hepatotoxic drugs were stopped an abdominal ultra-sonography was normal. Antimitochondrial antibodies were elevated and are the serologic hallmark of primary biliary cirrhosis. The disease can progress from an asymptomatic inflammation to a cirrhosis. The disease-modifying treatment consists in ursodeoxycholic acid 13-15 mg/kg per day. Concomitant to the primary biliary cirrhosis hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, malabsorption and dyslipidemia can occur.
