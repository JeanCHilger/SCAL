Emergency treatment and long-term follow-up of posterior urethral valves. Posterior urethral valves have a broad spectrum of clinical severity determined by the degree and reversibility of the long stepwise sequence of secondary pathology. Neonatal azotemia and severe bilateral reflux are particularly important negative prognostic factors. In the mild cases, valve ablation with or without delayed reconstruction is good therapy. In the very severe cases, our interpretation of all the clinical and experimental information now available suggests that the time interval and the level of decompression are extremely important. Achievement of consistent low caliceal pressure without stasis and infections should be achieved as soon as possible. We do not agree with the philosophy of "valve ablation and wait and see" for secondary reconstruction as applied to the severe cases. An analogous philosophy would be treating all respiratory infections as upper respiratory infections and applying aggressive appropriate therapy for pneumonia only if the patient does not respond clinically. However, all controversy aside, the management of neonatal infants with posterior urethral valves remains a difficult and challenging problem for us all. The real challenge will be to improve published management results to the point that the family faced with decisions regarding an in utero diagnosis of posterior urethral valves will have enough hope to continue the pregnancy.
