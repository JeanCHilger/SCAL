Fetal vesicoureteric reflux. We present an analysis of 30 patients with fetal vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) from a series of 107 patients with prenatally diagnosed urinary tract anomalies. In 13 patients (Group 1) the fetal VUR was the only urinary tract abnormality. In 17 patients (Group 2) the fetal VUR was combined with other urinary tract problems. In 14 of 46 refluxing renal units there was no evidence of upper tract dilatation on a pre- and post-natal ultrasound examination. Any infant with postnatal urinary tract dilatation needs full urological investigations, including a micturating cystogram. A normal postnatal ultrasound examination does not exclude fetal VUR.
