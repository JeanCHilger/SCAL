Prenatally diagnosed reflux: a follow-up study. This report analyses the characteristics and outcome of 25 infants with vesicoureteric reflux detected prenatally on the basis of dilatation of the fetal urinary tract. Sixteen infants had bilateral reflux--a total of 41 refluxing units. The high proportion of males (84%) contrasts with clinically presenting reflux, which is dominated by females. Prenatally diagnosed reflux is generally of a higher grade--usually grade IV. Eight children (32%) had coexistent congenital abnormalities. Chemoprophylaxis was completely effective in 17 children (68%), who remained infection-free 3 children (12%) had a single urinary infection and were managed conservatively whilst 5 (20%) experienced 2 or more infections and required reimplantation or vesicostomy. Spontaneous cessation of reflux was observed in 6 (35%) of 17 refluxing ureters reassessed after a mean interval of 2.1 years. The significance of isotope findings was sometimes difficult to assess but results in 30 refluxing units support the concept that focal renal scarring is usually a consequence of infected reflux in postnatal life.
