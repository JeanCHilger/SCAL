Diagnostic value of renal echography in children. Echography was employed to examine 94 children with different renal pathology. 45 children had chronic secondary pyelonephritis in the presence of the vesicoureteral reflux, 18 hydronephrosis, 14 ureterohydronephrosis, 6 chronic non-obstructive pyelonephritis, 5 acute glomerulonephritis, and 6 chronic glomerulonephritis. The data obtained by ultrasonography and x-ray data were studied and compared. The results thus derived supplement and make it possible to review the former ultrasonic criteria for normal and pathological conditions with unmarked morphological alterations in the kidneys. Novel criteria for the size of the lumen of the collecting systems are presented.
