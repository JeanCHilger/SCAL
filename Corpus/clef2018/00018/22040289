Is a routine voiding cystourethrogram necessary in children after the first febrile urinary tract infection? The aim of this study was to estimate the value of identifying vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) on a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and the benefit of VUR management according to imaging strategies at the first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI).Children aged 1-144 months (n = 618) with the first febrile UTI admitted at our hospital from 2000 to 2009 were enrolled. In all patients, renal sonogram (US), (99m) Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scanning and VCUG were performed. Retrospective analyses per patient and per renal unit were performed.Abnormal US or DMSA scans had a sensitivity of 100% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% to detect high-grade reflux. In hydronephrotic kidneys, DMSA scanning had a sensitivity of 88.2% and a NPV of 97.1% to detect high-grade reflux.Routine VCUG is not required after the first febrile UTI in patients with normal US or normal DMSA scan. Even if the US reveals hydronephrosis, routine VCUG is not necessary if the DMSA findings are normal. It is recommended that children who did not receive both a DMSA scan and VCUG after the first febrile UTI should be followed up over the long term.
