The value of ultrasound in diagnosing vesicoureteral reflux in young children with urinary tract infection. Urinary tract infection is a common pediatric problem and vesicoureteral reflux is its most common complication. Detection of this reflux has classically been achieved by voiding cystouretrography (VCUG). Ultrasonography for evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux is shown to be feasible but is not widely accepted. Our aim was to assess the value of routine sonography in detecting vesicoureteral reflux is young children with urinary tract infection. This study was carried out in 105 patients suffering from urinary tract infection admitted to Shahid Sadughi Hospital in Yazd, Iran. These patients were evaluated by two methods (sonography and VCUG). Overall sensitivity and specificity value of sonography in suggesting vesicoureteral reflux were 63% and 95% respectively. The most accurate results were obtained with high grades reflux (75% and 955). The results reconfirmed that sonography is reliable in the exclusion or verification of high grade reflux and it has a low sensitivity in low grade vesicoureteral reflux.
