The safety and efficacy of endoscopic incision of orthotopic ureterocele in adult. Endoscopic incision is a good management option for orthotopic ureterocele. But most of the literature has shown its efficacy only in children. We have done this retrospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of endoscopic incision of orthotopic ureterocele in adults. From March 2004 to January 2008, at our center, 26 adults underwent transurethral, transverse incision of an ureterocele. The perioperative data of these patients were retrospectively analyzed. The literature was reviewed to identify all the reported options for management of this relatively rare condition in adults. Unilateral ureterocele was present in 24 patients and two patients had bilateral ureterocele. One patient had associated upper tract stones. Three patients had associated stones in ureterocele. Transurethral, transverse incision of ureterocele was given in all patients. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 50.5 h. Twenty-three patients were available for follow-up at three, six and 12 months. All patients were symptom free. At three months ultrasound and intravenous urography revealed no residual ureterocele but four patients showed residual hydronephrosis, but with a decrease in the grade indicating decompression. Micturating cystourethrography revealed vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) in two patients and the reflux persisted in one patient even at 6 months. We conclude that in adults, management with endoscopic incision of orthotopic ureterocele is safe and effective. VUR may occur in a few cases.
