Primary liver cancer is more aggressive in HIV-HCV coinfection than in HCV infection. A prospective study (ANRS CO13 Hepavih and CO12 Cirvir). Since HAART, primary liver cancer has emerged as an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV infection. Our aim was to compare characteristics and outcome of primary liver cancer according to HIV status in HCV cirrhotic patients submitted to periodic ultrasonographic surveillance.All patients with primary liver cancer and cirrhosis were selected from two prospective cohorts (ANRS CO12 Cirvir, viral cirrhosis, n=1081 ANRS CO13 Hepavih, HIV-HCV coinfection, n=1175). Cirrhosis was diagnosed by liver biopsy in monoHCV group and biopsy and/or non-invasive tests in HIV-HCV group. Ultrasonographic surveillance was performed every 6 months. Diagnosis of primary liver cancer was established according to EASL-AASLD guidelines.Primary liver cancer was diagnosed in 32 patients, 16 in each group, and corresponded to hepatocellular carcinoma in all except for two cholangiocarcinomas in HIV-HCV patients. Ultrasonographic follow-up was similar (median time since last ultrasonographic without focal lesion: 237 days in HIV-HCV group (n=12) versus 208 days in HCV group, NS). At primary liver cancer diagnosis HIV-HCV patients were markedly younger (48 vs. 60 yrs, P<0.001), primary liver cancer was more advanced in HIV-HCV patients (single nodule: 43% vs. 75%, P=0.07 mean diameter of main nodule: 24 vs. 16 mm, P=0.006This result suggests more aggressiveness for tumors in HIV infected patients and, if confirmed, could result in shortening the length between ultrasonographic examinations.
