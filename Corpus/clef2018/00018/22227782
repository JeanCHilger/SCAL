Evaluation and management of urinary tract infections in the neonate. The prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) among full-term neonates has been reported to be up to 1.1%, increasing up to 7% among those with fever. UTI in neonates may be the first indicator of underlying abnormalities of kidneys and the urinary tract.Early recognition and therapy of UTI and detection of risk factors offer chances for applying strategies to avoid renal damage and recurrences. However, established diagnostic strategies and prophylactic concepts today are under debate. Currently, the main focus has been on renal changes as indicators for underlying risk factors like vesicoureteral reflux, attaching much importance to dimercaptosuccinyl acid scans. Serum and urine markers will probably allow more restrictive diagnostic imaging. Prenatal and postnatal ultrasound screenings provide additional opportunities for prophylactic measures.Main objectives in the management of neonatal UTIs are the prevention of acute infection-related complications and renal damage. Neonates and very young infants with suspicious pyelonephritis should obligatorily be treated with a combination of parenterally administered antibiotics. As far as possible, diagnostic imaging should be risk-oriented and restricted to noninvasive, nonstressful procedures. The strategies of antibacterial prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrent UTIs are changing. In infants at risk, its benefits have not yet been proven by evident data.
