Quantitation of vesico-ureteral reflux by radionuclide cystography and urodynamics. A method is described for the quantitation of vesico-ureteral reflux by synchronous combined direct radionuclide cystography and urodynamics. Intravesical pressures and volumes are co-ordinated with volumes of reflux. Peak reflux volumes in 11 children diagnosed as having severe (grades 3-4) reflux on conventional contrast cystography ranged from 1 to 50 ml/kidney. A number of different patterns of reflux were observed. Reflux may occur progressively throughout low pressure filling or incrementally with unstable bladder contractions. Reflux during voiding may be maximal as detrusor pressure falls. The method requires wider application to explore the potential for a functional classification of the reflux problem.
