High pressure balloon dilation of the ureterovesical junction--first line approach to treat primary obstructive megaureter? We describe the efficacy of dilation of the ureterovesical junction to treat primary obstructive megaureter.A total of 13 patients with primary obstructive megaureter were treated from May 2008 to December 2010. Of these patients 8 were diagnosed prenatally and the others were diagnosed after a urinary tract infection. Preoperative studies included ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography despite vesicoureteral reflux and diuretic isotopic renogram (mercaptoacetyltriglycine). With the patient under general anesthesia, high pressure balloon dilation of the ureterovesical junction was performed under direct and fluoroscopic vision until the disappearance of the narrowed ring. A Double-J(Â®) catheter was positioned, and 2 months later it was withdrawn and the ureterovesical junction was reviewed. A secondary treatment was performed in those in whom the ureterovesical junction was still narrow. Followup was performed with ultrasonography, cystourethrography and isotopic diuretic renography.A total of 18 procedures were performed in 13 patients (median age 7 months, range 4 to 24). Median diameter of the distal ureter was 14 mm (range 10 to 26), and median diameter of the renal pelvis and calyx was 27 mm (range 10 to 47) and 12 mm (range 9 to 26), respectively. Significant postoperative improvement of hydroureteronephrosis was observed in 11 of 13 patients and vesicoureteral reflux was found in 2. Only 3 patients needed ureteral reimplantation after endoscopic treatment due to hydroureteronephrosis in 2 and high grade vesicoureteral reflux in 1.High pressure balloon dilation of the ureterovesical junction is effective in treating primary obstructive megaureter, but long-term followup is needed.
