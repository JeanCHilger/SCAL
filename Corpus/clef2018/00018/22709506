The incidence of urinary tract infection after open anti-reflux surgery for primary vesicoureteral reflux: early and long-term follow up. Controversy exists regarding the benefit of open anti-reflux surgery (OS) in reducing the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI). We, therefore, reviewed our short and long term data in children who have undergone OS.153 children (131F, 22M ages 2-16 yrs, mean 8 yrs) underwent OS from 1990 to 2008. Reasons for presentation were UTI-13123 (15% of 153 followed short term, 40% of 56 followed long term)-20F, 3M-had non-febrile UTI's (nfUTI's) and one girl (0.6%) had a febrile UTI (fUTI). Of those who had nfUTI's 7 (30%) had high grade reflux and 16 (70%) had pre-op breakthrough UTI's. 11 (48%) had DMSA scans with defects. 2 had UTI's within 1 year after a negative VCUG and 21 had UTI's later (1-8 yrs). 1 girl had a fUTI 1 month after a negative VCUG.Successful OS effectively eliminates fUTI. Families should be counseled that nfUTI may occur many years after surgery, especially in girls with a history of breakthrough UTI and renal scarring.
