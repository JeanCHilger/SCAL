Renal function and growth after antireflux surgery in children. The outcome of antireflux surgery for vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) was studied in 39 children (65 renal units). The T max of the renogram improved significantly after operations in 51 (78.5%) of the 65 renal units due to a reduction of the back pressure. Improvements in scarring were observed in only 3 (7.3%) of 41 scarred kidneys. The growth of 38 kidneys was examined using the renal ratio, more than 2 years (mean, 3 years and 1 month) after the operation. The normal renal ratio was restored in 1 of 12 small kidneys with a preoperative size of less than the mean -2SD. The other 11 kidneys remained small, but 6 of these grew with a normal growth curve. The growth of the remaining 5 kidneys was unremarkable. Of the 26 kidneys with a normal renal ratio, 4 became small after the operation, but all the others had growth within the normal range.
