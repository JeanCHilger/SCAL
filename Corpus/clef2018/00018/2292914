Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with semilunar forms and massive deposits of IgA associated with HBsAg. The association of HBV infection and glomerular damage was first reported by Combes et al in 1971, in a patient with nephrotic syndrome due to membranous glomerulopathy and chronic hepatitis B. Since, then, other glomerular diseases have been reported such as a) minimal changes nephropathy, b) IgA nephropathy, c) membranous-proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), d) membranous, e) mesangial proliferative and f) lupus nephritis. All of them are associated with chronic hepatic disease and some of the following antigens: 1) HBsAg 2) HBeAg
