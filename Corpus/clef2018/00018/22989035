Intraureteral injection of NASHA/Dx gel under direct ureteroscopic visualization for the treatment of primary high-grade vesicoureteral reflux. To present a preliminary experience with the modified technique of extravesical intraureteral injection of non-animal-stabilized hyaluronic acid/dextranomer (NASHA/Dx) gel under direct ureteroscopic visualization for the treatment of primary high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).The medical records of all pediatric patients (age range, 0-14 years) who underwent intraureteral injection of NASHA/Dx gel under direct ureteroscopic visualization for the treatment of primary high-grade VUR during the period June 2006-June 2010 were reviewed.Eighty-nine children (61 boys, 28 girls M:F ratio, 2.1) underwent intraureteral injection of NASHA/Dx gel under direct ureteroscopic visualization for the treatment of primary high-grade VUR during the study period. VUR completely disappeared after the injection of NASHA/Dx gel into 105 (73%) of 144 ureters, with no further treatment required. Thirty-five (24.3%) required a second injection, and 2 (1.4%) required a third injection for resolution of their VUR. No intraoperative complications were observed. No ureteral obstruction during follow-up was observed using ultrasound or micturition studies.Intraureteral injection of NASHA/Dx gel under direct ureteroscopic visualization is safe and effective in the treatment of primary high-grade VUR, including cases with ureteral duplication, if the ureteral meatus is easy to pass through without mechanical dilation. This approach represents an effective and safe alternative to antibiotic prophylaxis alone and open surgery.
