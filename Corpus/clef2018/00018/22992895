Immunomodulatory effect of R848 on cytokine production associated with Schistosoma mansoni infection. This work aimed to determine the effect of resiquimod (R848), a low molecular weight imidazoquinolinamine compound with properties as immune response modifiers, on cytokine production in patients infected with Schistosoma mansoni with various degrees of hepatic fibrosis. Schistosoma-infected patients were classified into four groups according to the degree of hepatic fibrosis as examined by ultrasonography group 0 (no fibrosis), group I (incipient fibrosis), group II (moderate fibrosis), and group III (severe fibrosis). Levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-10, and IL-13 were measured by ELISA in the supernatants of cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in response to schistosoma egg soluble antigen (SEA) in the presence and absence of R848. R848 induced a significantly higher level of IL-10 in supernatants of SEA-stimulated PBMC of patients in all groups of hepatic fibrosis except group III. Moreover, we significantly found higher levels of IFN-γ in group 0 and group I and significantly lower level of IL-4 in group 0 after R848 stimulation. However, R848 had no effect on IL-13. Taken together, these results suggest that R848 might be used as an immunopotentiating agent in view of novel therapy or vaccine for S. mansoni infection.
