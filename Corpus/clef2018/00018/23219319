Positioning irrigation of contrast cystography for diagnosis of occult vesicoureteric reflux: association with technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scans. Positioning irrigation of contrast (PIC) cystography identifies occult or PIC vesicoureteral reflux (PIC-VUR) in children with recurrent febrile urinary tract infections (UTI) but no vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) on standard voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). We sought to identify the relationship between PIC-VUR and renal scarring in technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans.We retrospectively analysed PIC cystograms and DMSA scans for 154 kidneys in 81 children (65 girls 16 boysPIC-VUR was bilateral in 63, unilateral in 12, and absent in 6 children. Statistically significant associations between PIC-VUR grade and severity of renal scarring were identified in inter-individual (n = 77, p = 0.017) and intra-individual (refluxing vs. nonrefluxing kidney n = 12, p = 0.008) analyses. After excluding patients with history of VUR, statistical significance was maintained in inter-individual analysis (n = 49The data suggest an association between PIC-VUR and severity of renal scarring, and legitimise the use of PIC cystography in children with renal scarring due to recurrent febrile UTI but negative findings on VCUG.
