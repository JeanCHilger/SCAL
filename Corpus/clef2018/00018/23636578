Does the ureteric jet Doppler waveform have a role in detecting vesicoureteric reflux? Data reported in this issue of Pediatric Nephrology suggest that the ureteric jet Doppler waveform can predict the occurrence of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Many different methods are currently used to detect VUR, including traditional X-ray micturating cystourethrogram, indirect and direct nuclear imaging and contrast enhanced ultrasonography. These methods are invasive, do have some radiation burden and are also quite uncomfortable to paediatric patients. This relatively new non-invasive method is therefore of interest, but its efficacy needs to be confirmed in further studies and, in particular, in babies and infants before it can possibly be considered as a good method to provide clinical information on VUR. Once such studies have been performed, this method may also prove to be a useful approach to obtain modern knowledge on the occurrence of VUR in healthy children.
