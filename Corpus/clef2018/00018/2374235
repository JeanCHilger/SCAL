Endoscopic correction of vesicoureteral reflux: our experience with 115 ureters. Endoscopic subureteral injection of polytetrafluoroethylene was performed in 115 ureters to correct vesicoureteral reflux. We treated primary reflux in 84 single ureters, 16 duplex ureters and 4 megaureters (grade V), and secondary reflux in 11 ureters associated with neurogenic bladder, uncapped ureteroceles and failed ureteroneocystostomy. Followup evaluation consisted of a voiding cystourethrogram, which was done in the operating room immediately after the endoscopic procedure, ultrasound 1 month postoperatively, and a diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renal isotope scan and repeat voiding cystourethrogram 6 months after injection. Grades II to IV primary reflux involving single as well as duplex ureters resolved in 94% and 82%, respectively, of the cases after 1 injection and in 98% and 93% of the cases after 2 or more injections. The severely and chronically dilated ureters did not respond to the treatment.
