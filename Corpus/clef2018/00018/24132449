Umbilical paracentesis for acute hernia reduction in cirrhotic patients. Emergent repair of umbilical hernias in cirrhotic patients is associated with a high risk for morbidity and mortality. We propose a new technique, umbilical paracentesis, for reduction of incarcerated hernias in the patient with ascites. Under ultrasound guidance, removal of ascitic fluid from the umbilical hernia sac can reduce the local pressure and thereby allow for easy hernia reduction, thus avoiding the need for an emergent operation.
