Voiding urosonography with SonoVue and fluoroscopic voiding cystourethrography in evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux: a comparative study. To assess the value of voiding urosonography (VUS) with SonoVue in evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux.Thirty-six pediatric patients (72 pyeloureter units [PUUs]) suspected of vesicoureteral reflux underwent both VUS and fluoroscopic voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). The sensitivity of VUS and VCUG and their consistency in detecting vesicoureteral reflux as well as in grading vesicoureteral reflux were compared.Vesicoureteral reflux was detected in 26 of the 72 PUUs (36.1%) by VUS while in 21 PUUs (29.2%) by VCUG (P=0.347). The two modalities yielded the same results for 65 PUUs (Îº=0.843), showing a very good consistency between them. VUS also detected post-urethral valve in 2 patients via transperineal scans.VUS with Sonovue has at least comparable, if not better, sensitivity in detecting vesicoureteral reflux with VCUG, and therefore should serve as the primary screening and follow-up modality for vesicoureteral reflux. In addition, transperineal VUS can be helpful in evaluation of post-urethral lesions.
