Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging of kidneys in children with vesicoureteral reflux. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) which obtain from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), is a quantitative parameter representing the renal function and parenchymal damage in some renal disorders. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether renal tissue alterations associated with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) can be displayed by DWI. The secondary aim was to assess how ADC values change with age in kidneys with and without VUR.This prospective study included 46 patients (8 boys, 38 girls mean age 7.3 ± 4.2The mean ADC values were (1.93 ± 0.36)×10(-3)mm(2)/s, (1.97 ± 0.24)× 10(-3)mm(2)/s, (1.83 ± 0.37)× 10(-3)mm(2)/s, (1.98 ± 0.20)×10(-3)mm(2)/s and (2.08 ± 0.42)× 10(-3)mm(2)/s in normal kidneys, and in those with grade 1, grade 2, grade 3 and grade 4 VUR, respectively. There was no significant difference in ADC values between kidneys with and without VUR. There was a significant positive correlation between the age and ADC values both in kidneys with and without VUR (r=0.79, p<0.001 and r=0.82 p<0.001, respectively).DWI does not reveal probable parenchymal alterations in reflux nephropathy. ADC values increase with age during childhood not only in normal kidneys but also in kidneys with VUR.
