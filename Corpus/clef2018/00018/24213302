Influence of paraumbilical vein patency on the portal hemodynamics of patients with cirrhosis. The aim was to determine the influence of the paraumbilical vein (PUV) patency and its effect on the portal hemodynamics and clinical presentations in cirrhotic patients.In this prospective study of 181 cirrhotic patients (101 males, 80 females aged 62.6±11.8 y), the portal hemodynamics were assessed using Doppler ultrasonography.The incidence of patent PUV was 26.0% (47/181). The mean flow volume in the portal trunk, the incidence of a left gastric vein with hepatofugal flow, and the grade of the esophageal varices were significantly higher in the patients with a patent PUV (908.2 mL/min, 70.2%, 9 with none to small, and 27 with medium to large, respectively) than in those without (771.7 mL/min, 48.5%, 57 with none to small, and 48 with medium to large, respectively). The hepatic venous pressure gradient and the wedged hepatic venous pressure (mm H2O) were significantly higher in the former group (268.0±89.7 and 389.5±99.9, respectively) than in the latter (203.5±63.2 and 317.7±67.7, respectively). The deterioration of ascites during the 2-year follow-up period was significantly more often in the patients with a patent PUV (4/12, 33.3%) than in those without. The cumulative survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were similar between the 2 groups: 92.5%, 92.5%, and 82.4%, respectively, in the former and 90.7%, 83.8%, and 76.3%, respectively, in the latter.A patent PUV seems to signify pressure-loaded portal hemodynamics in cirrhotic patients. However, it seems to have little effect on their prognoses.
