Clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy for occult vesicoureteral reflux in females: preliminary results of a retrospective case series. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy by injection of bulking agent in the treatment of occult vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) [no VUR on standard voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), but positive (99m)Tc-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan] in females who have recurrent febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs).A case series was retrospectively identified of 24 females (mean age 15.5 years) with negative VCUG, but renal scars in one (n = 4) or both (n = 20) kidneys on DMSA scan. Endoscopic injection was performed bilaterally in 20 (83.3%) and unilaterally in four patients (16.7%). The incidence of postoperative UTIs was documented with a mean follow-up of 2.5 years (range 1-6 years).The mean renal part function (DMSA scan) on the left and right sides was 53.5% (15-74%) and 47.3% (26-85%), respectively. Twenty-one out of 24 patients (87.5%) showed no evidence of any febrile UTIs postoperatively. One patient (4.2%) experienced a further febrile UTI 6 months after treatment. Two other patients (8.3%) had one questionable afebrile UTI, 4 and 3 years after therapy. Pressure-flow electromyography confirmed a dysfunctional voiding pattern in 12 patients (50%) treated with pelvic floor therapy and behavioural interventions before endoscopic therapy.Injection of bulking agent seems to be a suitable treatment for occult VUR in females to prevent further febrile UTIs. Patients with occult VUR should undergo a careful evaluation of possible urodynamic disorders such as dysfunctional voiding. These findings should be studied in prospective trials before drawing any conclusions.
