Multicystic dysplastic kidney: Impact of imaging modality selection on the initial management and prognosis. To evaluate the impact of imaging modalities on the evaluation and prognosis of children with multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) disease.A retrospective analysis of all children with MCDK diagnosed from 2004 until 2012 was performed. The study included 63 patients for whom all postnatal imaging modalities were available: renal bladder ultrasound (RBUS), dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA) and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). Cases with major congenital abnormalities or incomplete data were excluded. Abnormalities in the contralateral kidney and the fate of MCDK were also addressed.At diagnosis, the average age was four-and-a-half months. The majority of cases were detected antenatally (87%). Postnatal RBUS and DMSA scans established the diagnosis of MCDK in 92% and 98% of patients, respectively. DMSA showed photopenic areas in the contralateral kidneys in 10% of patients all of them had hydronephrosis and were confirmed to have vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Contralateral VUR was detected in 16 patientsThe classical appearance of MCDK on RBUS was sufficient to establish the diagnosis in most patients. DMSA scan was more accurate in confirming the diagnosis and evaluating the contralateral kidney. Selective screening for VUR in patients with contralateral hydronephrotic kidney should be considered.
