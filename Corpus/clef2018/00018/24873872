Single center experience in patients with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney. To determine the clinical features, long-term outcomes, and additional urological anomalies of patients treated for multicystic dysplastic kidney (MDK).Patients with MDK who were followed between January 2004 and October 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were evaluated.A total of 68 patients with MDK were followed for a mean period of 46.8 Â± 32.4 months. MDK was detected by antenatal ultrasound in 64 (94.1%) of the patients. Ten patients had (14.7%) additional urological anomalies in contralateral kidney. Vesicoureteral reflux was found in five patients (7.3%). Other urological anomalies were megaureter (two), cortical renal cyst (two), ureteropelvic junction obstruction (one), and renal ectopy (one). Urinary tract infection was detected in 14 (20.5%) patients. Four (5.9%) patients had hypertension. Compensatory hypertrophy was detected in 29 (42.6%) patients. Eight (11.8%) of these 29 patients had glomerular hyperfiltration and three (4.4%) of these eight patients also had proteinuria. Follow-up ultrasound revealed complete involution in 19 (35.8%) patients. Nephrectomy was performed in 15 (22.0%) patients. Indications of nephrectomy were, recurrent urinary infection (four), hypertension (three), ureterocele (two), renal calculi (one), flank pain (one), hematuria (one), persistent large cystic kidney (three), and atypical US findings (two).In patients with MDK, depending on the clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings, appropriate timing of operation by multidisciplinary approach is important for early detection and treatment of any possible complications.
