Relationship of generalized joint hypermobility with vesicoureteral reflux and urinary tract infection. Generalized joint hypermobility is deemed to be an underlying risk factor for many clinical conditions. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of generalized joint hypermobility in patients with vesicoureteral reflux.This was a cross-sectional study on 313 children, 3 to 15 years old, with a history of urinary tract infection. Generalized joint hypermobility was evaluated according to the Beighton scores. Urinary tract ultrasonography and cystography were done if indicated. Participants were divided into 2 groups, group 1 without urinary tract abnormality and group 2 with primary vesicoureteral reflux, which were compared with the control group.Generalized joint hypermobility was documented in 37.2% of the children in the control group and 45.7% of those in group 1. This rate was 62.3% in group 2 (odds ratio, 2.79 95% confidence interval, 1.61 to 4.82). Generalized joint hypermobility was seen in 44.1% of the children with mild vesicoureteral reflux, 60.5% of those with moderate vesicoureteral reflux, and 86.2% of those with severe vesicoureteral reflux. There was a significant relationship between the hypermobility incidence and the urinary reflux severity (P = .003).This study showed the prevalence of generalized joint hypermobility in children with vesicoureteral reflux was more than that in the general population, and the prevalence of hypermobility syndrome increased with the reflux severity.
