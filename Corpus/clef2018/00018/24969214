Primary vesicoureteral reflux in Sudanese children. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a common congenital renal tract anomaly in children. Reports from Sudan are scanty. We report the characteristics, presentation and outcome of primary VUR in a tertiary care hospital. The records of 30 patients (16 males 53%) followed-up between January 2004 and December 2010 were reviewed. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 4 Â± 3.9 years and 47% were <2 years of age. Renal ultrasound scan (USS) failed to predict VUR in 17% of the patients. On voiding cysturethrogram (VCUG), VUR was bilateral in 57% and severe grade in 64%. Grades were not significantly associated with age, gender or site of VUR. Initial dimercaptosuccinic acid radionuclide scan showed renal damage in 61.5% of the patients. Renal damage was significantly associated with female gender and severe VUR, but not with age of onset or history of urinary tract infection (UTI). Thirteen patients (43.3%) presented with acute UTI, eight (26.6%) with non-specific urinary tract symptoms and nine (30%) with persistently elevated serum creatinine. Urine cultures were positive in 73% of patients, and E. coli was the most common pathogen. Renal impairment at presentation was significantly associated with bilateral severe VUR and history of UTI but not age or gender. After a mean follow-up period of 1.78 years (6 months to 5 years), 70% of patients remained with normal renal function and 30% progressed to chronic kidney disease
