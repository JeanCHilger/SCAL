Long-term results of organo-safe operation in obstructive ureterohydronephrosis of terminal stage. A comparative analysis of efficacy of two methods was the purpose of the research. Politano-Leadbetter technique was applied in 41 cases and nipple way was used in 13 cases. The investigation included 45 patients aged from 2 months till 17 years with congenital obstructive ureterohydronephrosis of terminal stage (the pathology was diagnosed from both sides in 15 children). A follow-up period was from 1 till 6 years. Recurrent intervention was required in 31 cases. An analysis of overall results allowed determining the outcome as positive in 26 cases after Politano-Leadbetter operation. There were a vesicoureteral reflux in 6 cases and signs of obstruction appeared in 9 cases. The application of nipple operation had positive results in 9 cases, at the same time, the complication such as vesicoureteral reflux was noted in 2 cases, the signs of obstruction were in 2 cases. The authors prefer using the nipple method of reimplantation in spite of identical results of two different methods.
