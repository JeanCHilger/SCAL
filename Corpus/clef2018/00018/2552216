Evaluation of renal scarring in children with primary VUR by 99mTc-DMSA renoscintigraphy. Renal scarring in 271 kidneys of 172 children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was evaluated by 99mTc-DMSA renoscintigraphy. 58% of refluxing kidneys were with renal scar by the initial DMSA renoscintigraphy. Only 52% of these kidneys showed good correlation between the findings on IVP and DMSA renoscintigram. Of the 144 refluxing kidneys with normal IVP, 41% had renal scarring on DMSA renoscintigram. DMSA renoscintigram revealed widespread renal scarring in 28% of kidneys with only calyceal clubbing and in 60% of those with segmental cortical thinning on IVP. It is realized that IVP was an in-sensitive method to evaluate renal scarring of refluxing kidneys and such kidneys with segmental renal scar on IVP accompanies more widespread scar on DMSA renoscintigram. These cases were allocated to 2 age groups, younger than 3 years and older than 4 years. In the former group less than 10% of kidneys with low grade VUR and about 40% with high grade UVR had widespread renal scarring. On the contrary, in the latter group severe renal scar was recognized in more than 20% of kidneys with low grade VUR and in about 60% with high grade UVR.
