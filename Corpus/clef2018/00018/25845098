Endoscopic incision of intravesical ureteroceles in patients with duplex system. To evaluate the clinical status and renal function of pa- tients with duplex system and intravesical ureterocele after drainage by cystoscopy.In 9 patients with duplex system and intravesical ureterocele drainage was performed to present recurrent urinary tract infections (7 children with episodes of pyelonephritis and sepsis) or obstruction of the urinary drainage. The mean age was 33 months (range 8-108 months). The thecnique was done under general anesthesia in the operating room and puncture of the ureterocele was performed using cystourethroscopy with loop electrode. The minimum follow-up was 12 months (range 12-48 months) and includes renal ultrasound, renal isotopic study (Mag3 with furosemide) and-echocystography study in patients with preoperative vesicoureteral reflux or postoperative urinary tract infection.The average operative time was 60 minutes. Mean hospital stay was 48 hours. There were no complications during the procedure. In five patients urinary infection episodes disappeared. Ultrasound demonstrated decreased hydronephrosis and megaureter. In two patients the differential renal function following the technique improved. One patient with preoperative split renal function of 14% required nephrectomy. One patient had postoperative vesicoureteral reflux.The drainage of intravesical ureterocele in patients with duplex system reduces episodes of urinary tract infection and urinary tract dilation.
