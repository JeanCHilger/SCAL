Clinical Course and Effective Factors of Primary Vesicoureteral Reflux. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is one of the most important causes of urinary tract infection and renal failure in children. It is a potentially self-limited disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical course and significant factors in children with primary VUR. The medical charts of 125 infants and children (27.2 % males, 72.8% females) with all grades of primary VUR were retrospectively reviewed. Mean age at diagnosis was 22.3 ± 22.9 months. 52% of patients had bilateral VUR. Mild reflux (Grade I, II) was the most common initial grade. 53.6% of patients achieved spontaneous resolution. 30.1% of patients had decreased renal function on initial DMSA renal scan, significantly in males and severe VUR. Reflux nephropathy occurred in 17.6% of patients, especially in renal damage and male sex. No significant association was observed between recurrent urinary tract infection with the severity of VUR, and the presence of renal damage at admission. Age at diagnosis, gender, grade, laterality, the absence of recurrent urinary tract infection and renal damage had a significant correlation between spontaneous VUR resolution. Spontaneous resolution of primary VUR occurred significantly in female patients, age ≤ 30 months at diagnosis, mild-to-moderate VUR, unilateral reflux, the absence of recurrent urinary tract infection, and renal damage.
