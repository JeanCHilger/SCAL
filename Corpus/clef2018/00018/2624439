Treatment of vesico-renal reflux in children with endoscopic injection of polytetrafluoroethylene (teflon). Apropos of a series of 100 cases of reflux in 72 children. The endoscopic subureteral injection of teflon is a new alternative to correct vesicorenal reflux in children. We report the use of this procedure in 72 children presenting with 100 refluxing ureters. In 98 refluxing units the disappearance of reflux was noted on a cystogram performed immediately (success rate: 98%). Followup after 6 months, the reflux recurred in 6 ureters of 52 controlled units (success rate 88.5%). Obstruction was not observed in any cases by repeated ultrasonography. The procedure is simple and reliable. In a failure that required an open operation, surgical reimplantation was not difficult. An endoscopic technique to cure reflux, of various grades would be a valuable alternative. The procedure certainly has advantages for difficult surgical reimplantations (neurogenic bladder, failed reimplant ureters). However, many years follow up are needed to demonstrate lasting success and absence of complications.
