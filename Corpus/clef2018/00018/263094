Distal splenorenal shunts (Warren's operation) B-mode and real time ultrasonographic assessment. B mode and real time ultrasonography have been used in a trial to demonstrate the patency of distal splenorenal shunt done in Warren's operation. Thirty seven patients with portal hypertension, and bleeding oesophageal varices were the subject of this study. Using B-mode ultrasonography in 70% of cases (26 patients), the splenic, left renal vein and the site of anastomosis were demonstrated. In 8% (3 patients), both splenic and left renal veins were seen patent, but the site of anastomosis was not detected. In the remaining 22% (8 patients), neither the left renal vein nor the site of anastomosis could be demonstrated. Using the Real-time two dimensional ultrasound, 9 of the 37 patients were examined. The patency of both veins and the site of the shunt was demonstrated in 90% (8 patients).
