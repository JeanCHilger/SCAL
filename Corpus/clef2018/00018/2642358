Radiographic evaluation of subureteric injection of teflon to correct vesicoureteral reflux. The imaging studies of 83 children (115 ureters) with vesicoureteral reflux who were treated by subureteric injection of Teflon (STING) were reviewed. On plain films, the Teflon rarely may be seen as faintly radiodense. On sonography, it is echogenic and has variable acoustic shadowing. On CT it is dense (160-466 H). Postsurgical cystography showed cessation of reflux in 83 ureters (72%). Complications of STING were uncommon. No granulomatous masses were identified in the region adjacent to the STING. Transient, free peritoneal fluid developed in three children and ureteral dilatation in six, three of whom required intervention. In one child, most of the Teflon disappeared from the original site of injection, as noted on a follow-up CT scan possibly it had been extruded into the bladder. The STING procedure probably will become more popular. Knowledge of its radiologic appearance is important for the radiologist in order to effectively evaluate these children postoperatively.
