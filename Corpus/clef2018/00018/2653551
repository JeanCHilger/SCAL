Endoscopic correction of vesico-ureteric reflux by subureteric Teflon injection: follow-up ultrasound and voiding cystography. The technique of subureteric Teflon injection for the correction of vesico-ureteric reflux was first described by Puri and O'Donnell in 1984. The Teflon granuloma that occurs after the injection anchors the submucosal ureter, thereby preventing reflux. This paper reviews the ultrasound and cystographic findings in 88 patients with 115 refluxing ureters followed-up for periods ranging from 3 months to 3 years. Reflux disappeared in 91 ureters (79.1%) and the degree of reflux improved in 22 ureters (19.1%). In this follow-up study, the size of the granuloma on ultrasound was assessed in relation to the number of injections, the total volume of Polytef paste used and the outcome of the procedure. A well circumscribed granuloma was seen at the orifices of 92 ureters. There was no ureteric granuloma evident in 23 ureters and Teflon plaques were found at the trigone in six patients. Complications were rare. One large granuloma caused severe obstruction requiring re-implantation. The size of the granuloma appears to depend on individual tissue reaction rather than on the other factors. The presence or the size of the granuloma bears no direct relationship to the success of the procedure.
