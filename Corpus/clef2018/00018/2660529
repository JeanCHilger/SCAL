Nuclear cystography and renal sonography: findings in girls with urinary tract infection. This retrospective study documents the findings on nuclear cystography and renal sonography of 455 girls who had urologic imaging for a proved urinary tract infection (UTI). Nuclear cystograms were normal in 313 (69%) of 455 patients. Vesicoureteral reflux was seen in 142 patients (31%): six with grade I, 90 with grade II, 43 with grade III, and three with grade IV. Twelve percent of patients with vesicoureteral reflux had renal parenchymal scars. Increasing grades of reflux were associated with an increase in the severity and number of parenchymal scars. Normal renal sonograms were seen in 83% of patients. Abnormalities noted on sonograms included parenchymal scarring in 31 (7%) of the 455 patients, anomalies in 19 patients (4%), mild to moderate dilatation of the renal pelvis and or ureters in 45 patients (10%), and bladder wall thickening in 45 patients (10%).
