Nonintubated Anderson-Hynes repair of ureteropelvic junction obstruction in 60 patients. We reviewed our experience with 68 consecutive Anderson-Hynes ureteropyeloplasties. The 64 infants, children and young adults ranged from 2 days to 28 years old (median age 2 years), and 28 were less than 1 year old. Intubation was used in only 4 patients: 2 who also underwent ureteral reimplantation for vesicoureteral reflux, 1 with stones in the renal pelvis and 1 with pyonephrosis. We successfully repaired 60 of 64 nonintubated renal units (93.4 per cent). Temporary postoperative ureteral stenting was required for extravasation from 8 renal units (12.5 per cent). Two patients later underwent repeat ureteropyeloplasty for recurrent obstruction. Nephrectomy was performed for pyonephrosis in 1 patient and for a nonfunctioning kidney that had exhibited poor function preoperatively in 1. Prolonged ileus necessitated extended hospitalization in 3 patients (4.6 per cent). We conclude that nonintubated dismembered ureteropyeloplasty for uncomplicated, primary ureteropelvic junction obstruction can be performed safely and successfully, and should be considered the standard treatment. Positioning of the Penrose drain is critical to avoid urinoma formation. When persistent urinary leakage occurs temporary diversion is easy and well tolerated. Hospital stay averaged 12.1 days for patients with extravasation compared to 4.3 days when no extravasation occurred. Immediate preoperative retrograde pyelography did not seem to contribute to postoperative urinary extravasation by causing edema of the ureteral orifice.
