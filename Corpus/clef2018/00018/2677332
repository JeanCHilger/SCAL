Imaging and the first urinary infection in children. Respective role of each test during the initial evaluation apropos of 122 cases. 122 pediatric patients with a first urinary tract infection underwent renal ultrasonography (US) and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) to evaluate the usefulness of this association. The US was always the first examination undertaken, its sensitivity seems to be very good in detecting renal abnormalities. The major finding on the VCUG was the vesico-ureteral reflux: 25% of cases. When the sonogram and the VCUG are normal, 60% of cases, excretory urography is not considered necessary.
