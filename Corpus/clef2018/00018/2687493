Correlation of Fourier spectral shift-determined hepatic acoustic attenuation coefficients with liver biopsy findings. We calculated hepatic acoustic attenuation coefficients (ACs) in 13 patients who had liver biopsies and in 3 normal subjects by means of Fourier spectral analysis of reflected ultrasound signals from increasing depths in the liver. The ACs were correlated with estimated percentage area occupied by fat in the liver biopsies linear regression analysis revealed a correlation coefficient of r = .78 (p less than .001). The presence of fibrosis did not correlate with AC.
