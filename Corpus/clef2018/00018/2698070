Neonatal pelvic ectasia. 54 neonates found to have pelvic dilatation on sonography are reported. They were studied by IVP, voiding cystography and renal function tests. Periodic sonography, urine cultures and DPTA furosemide in severe cases were performed during the follow-up (3-32 months). The ectasias were classified in 4 grades, found a good correlation with urography in grades I, III and IV. Neonatal pelvic dilatation is associated with: 1) urinary tract infection (17.4%) 2) vesicoureteric reflux (25.5%)
