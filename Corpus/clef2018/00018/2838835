Quantitative renal scintigraphy with technetium-labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid in children. Separate measurement of renal function is essential in children with urinary tract disease. This can be done satisfactorily by means of kidney scintigraphy with technetium 99m-labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid. A retrospective study of the records of 415 children, which comprised renal function tests, radiology and scintigraphy, confirmed the value of the radioisotope technique. Graphs of height, kidney uptake and kidney uptake density in relation to age were established, showing highly significant correlations with renal function tests and intravenous urography results, but many dissociations were encountered. Separate renal function evaluation by radioisotope scintigraphy seems to be more reliable than evaluation extrapolated from measurement of the cortical areas at intravenous urography. In vesico-ureteral reflux scintigraphy makes it possible to detect reflux nephropathy at an earlier stage than with other methods.
