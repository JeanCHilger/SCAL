The detection of vesicoureteral reflux in the child. Reflux is often an important phenomenon in the urinary tract of a child, and many methods have been advocated to detect it. The single most sensitive, accurate, and efficient way currently available to detect and characterize reflux is direct VCUG under fluoroscopic control with the contrast material instilled through a urethral catheter. Nuclear cystography is the most efficient method for screening for reflux in appropriate situations, for making sure the reflux has disappeared after corrective surgery, and for following reflux that is likely to subside spontaneously.
