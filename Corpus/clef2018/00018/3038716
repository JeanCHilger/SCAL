Small hepatocellular carcinoma: an Italian experience. Recent reports have demonstrated the possibility of using ultrasound to detect hepatocellular carcinomas under 3 cm (small HCC). Our aim was to assess the incidence of small HCC in an Italian ultrasonographic series. Among 17,133 scans of unselected patients, we detected 85 HCC, 9 of which were under 3 cm. All patients had cirrhosis and 6 were HBsAg positive. An echo-guided biopsy was performed in all cases, and the diagnosis was always correct. We conclude that echographic follow-up is warranted in Italy for cases at risk for HCC such as HBsAg+ cirrhotics and patients with chronic aggressive HBsAg+ hepatitis older than 35, in agreement with the reports of Far Eastern authors.
