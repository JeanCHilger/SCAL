Comparison of 51Cr-EDTA and 99mTc-DTPA slope clearances in children with vesicoureteric reflux. The plasma clearances of 51Cr-EDTA and 99mTc-DTPA have been compared in a series of 154 children with reflux nephropathy. The study has shown that DTPA can replace EDTA with the advantage that it can also be used for dynamic renal imaging and calculation of individual kidney function. However, the source of the DTPA is important, as it has been shown to affect the comparison with EDTA clearance.
