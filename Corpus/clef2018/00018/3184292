Optimal use of 99mtechnetium-glucoheptonate scintigraphy in the detection of pyelonephritic scarring in children: a preliminary report. Renal scintigraphy represents the optimal modality for the detection of renal scars. 99mTechnetium-glucoheptonate is rapidly accumulated by the kidney through glomerular filtration and active transport by renal tubular cells. This permits rapid visualization of the renal parenchyma in the early phase (1 to 3-minute images) and subsequent imaging of the collecting system and ureters. About 10 to 15 per cent of the injected activity remains in the kidney, labeling the cells of the proximal convoluted tubules (late phase or 1 to 2-hour images). The late phase has been used more commonly to assess renal parenchymal damage. Early and late phase glucoheptonate scanning was performed in 42 children as part of the evaluation of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections with or without a history of vesicoureteral reflux. Inter-observer reliability to interpret glucoheptonate scans was good (early, 83 per cent agreement and late, 93 per cent agreement). The ability of glucoheptonate scanning to detect renal scarring in children with febrile urinary tract infections was equivalent with the early or late phase of the study. In 6 patients renal scarring was detected on only the early phase scan and in 7 scarring was detected only in the late phase. Although the detection rates are equivalent the over-all detection of scarring is improved by using both phases. Therefore, the early phase of the glucoheptonate scan may be a valuable adjunct to conventional glucoheptonate scan methodology used for the detection of renal scarring in children with recurrent urinary tract infections.
