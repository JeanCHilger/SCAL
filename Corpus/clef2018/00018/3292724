Nuclear medicine in pediatric urology and nephrology. Renal scintigraphy is a diagnostic procedure of choice or a complementary imaging modality in the work up of infants and children with urologic or nephrologic problems. New radiopharmaceuticals and techniques and expert interpretation provide unique renal parenchymal and collecting system functional and anatomical information, which helps in the diagnosis and follow up of congenital or acquired kidney disorders and the quantitation of renal function. Education of the user and the referring physician, further clinical experience, and comparative studies should help increase utilization of renal scintigraphy in the neonatal and pediatric age for the benefit of the patient and the better understanding of urologic and nephrologic disorders.
