Effect of vesicoureteral reflux on kidney density in children. In 59 children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) renal echogenicity was analyzed. The density of the kidneys increase with the intensity of the VUR. The children with VUR grade 1 and 2 mainly showed a normal report. In 50% of the cases with VUR grade 3, a normal report was also found, whereas in the other 50% echogenicity was increased to 1 and 2. Highly significant increases in renal density were seen in ultrasound in children with VUR grade 4-5.
