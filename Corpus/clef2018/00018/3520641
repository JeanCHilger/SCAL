Pre- and postnatal diagnostic imaging of congenital urinary tract disorders. The prenatal diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction was made in 10 neonates. These findings were confirmed postnatally by sonography, urography, voiding cystourethrography, and scintigraphy. There were 8 neonates with unilateral obstruction of the ureter, and 2 with urethral valves and reflux. Nephrectomy because of hydronephrosis was necessary in 2 instances. The prenatal diagnosis of a urinary tract obstruction is of great importance, because the neonate may be operated upon without delay. Thus the diseased kidney can be saved. Diuretic radionuclide urography is helpful in differentiating between dilated obstructed and dilated nonobstructed kidneys.
