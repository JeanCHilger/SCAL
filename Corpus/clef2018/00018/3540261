Portal vein measurement by ultrasonography in patients with long-standing cystic fibrosis: preliminary observations. Adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are increasingly diagnosed with hepatic cirrhosis, cholecystitis, and cholelithiasis. A continuing diagnostic problem is the early detection of cirrhosis prior to diffuse liver involvement. Sonography has been used in evaluating the pancreas, gallbladder, liver, and spleen in cystic fibrosis patients. We used a real-time mechanical sector scanner to study the portal veins in adult CF patients randomly selected from our CF population and correlated the portal vein diameters with liver function studies. A measurement greater than 12 mm was interpreted as a probable sign of portal hypertension. Of 21 patients studied, 14 had portal veins that measured greater than 12 mm, and 12 patients had (although not necessarily at the time of the exam) elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels. Three patients had associated splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia, and 10 patients also exhibited cholelithiasis and abnormal gallbladders on sonography. Initial results indicate that portal vein measurement may be a sensitive indicator of early portal hypertension. Sonography may, thus, isolate patients at high risk for possible future complications. Serial sonograms can be performed easily in evaluating the progress of liver disease.
