Portal venous hemodynamics in chronic liver disease: effects of posture change and exercise. Changes of portal hemodynamics with the progression of chronic liver disease and changes caused by body posture and physical exercise were investigated using an ultrasonic pulsed Doppler flowmeter in healthy adults and in patients with chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Portal venous velocity was significantly reduced in patients with chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis without a large splenorenal shunt, and cirrhosis with a large splenorenal shunt, compared with normal subjects and patients with chronic persistent hepatitis. Portal venous flow, by contrast, was significantly reduced only in patients with cirrhosis and a large splenorenal shunt compared with normal subjects and with the other three groups there was no significant difference in portal venous flow among the latter four groups. Both portal venous velocity and flow showed a tendency toward further reduction in patients with cirrhosis who had hepatofugal flow of part of the superior mesenteric venous blood into the splenic vein and a large splenorenal shunt. Both exercise and posture change from supine to sitting significantly reduced portal venous velocity and portal venous flow in normal subjects, as well as in the patients with chronic liver disease.
