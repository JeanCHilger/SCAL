Diagnostic value of sonography in vesico-ureteral reflux in infancy and childhood. The direct demonstration of reflux by filling of the urinary bladder using real time sonography is a new method avoiding radiation exposure. Since 1979 we use this technique (Miktions-Cysto-Sonographie, MCS) as routine procedure. In 117 cases with 163 radiologically diagnosed refluxes we could demonstrate, that refluxes of grad II or higher gave a positive sonogram. As a consequence it is proposed, that for children with urinary tract infections the first examinations should be the sonography of kidneys and the sonographic evaluation of reflux. In the cases of conservatively treated refluxes the check-up of the reflux is carried out only sonographically. The same is valid for the control after antireflux surgery. Thus radiological examinations are necessary only for sonographically suspicious findings. The urinary tract obstruction after antireflux operations is detected sonographically, too. In 99 cases of antireflux operations it could be shown, that the urinary flow came back to the normal state within 3 months post operation.
