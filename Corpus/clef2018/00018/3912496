Value of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of cirrhoses. Prospective study of 128 patients. This prospective study was carried out in order to assess the accuracy of ultrasound in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. One hundred and twenty eight alcoholic patients were included. A careful ultrasonographic examination of the liver was performed before liver biopsy (100 patients). In 15 cases, liver histology was normal, steatosis and/or fibrosis, cirrhosis were diagnosed in 13 and 72 cases respectively. Ultrasonic patterns were classified by the same examiner, according to several criteria: volume, irregular outline, coarse and fine bright echo pattern, attenuation of the ultrasound beam, splenomegaly, ascite, portal hypertension. Cirrhosis was diagnosed in 58 out of 72 patients (80.5%). Specificity was 78.5%, positive and negative predictive values were 90.6% and 61% respectively, and global efficacy was 80%. Irregular outline (0.66), hepatomegaly (0.66) and attenuation of the ultrasound beam (0.64) were the best signs. In case of fine bright echo pattern, the diagnosis of cirrhosis would be missed. The results suggest that ultrasonography is a good test for screening alcoholics for cirrhosis. Therefore, it is useful when liver biopsy is contra indicated or refused or when liver is not detected at the clinical examination.
