Investigations for vesicoureteric reflux in children: ultrasound vs. radionuclide voiding cystography. In this study, 53 children suffering from recurrent urinary tract infections were investigated both by ultrasound and direct radionuclide voiding cystography (RNVC). The findings were: Most high-grade vesicopelvic refluxes were detected by both methods consistently. Discrepant results of high-grade vesicopelvic refluxes were seen in 6 kidneys from 4 children. Main advantages of RNVC are the quick results and the ease of interpretation of these results. In RNVC the whole urinary tract can be observed during the filling phase as well as during the voiding and postvoiding phase. In sonography, the different parts of the urinary tract must be explored one after another during the filling, voiding, and postvoiding phase. The investigation by sonography is time consuming and a strongly investigator-dependent procedure.
