A comparison of two techniques of detecting vesico-ureteric reflux. Indirect voiding radionuclide cystourethrography has been compared with micturating cystourethrography in 57 children with urinary tract infections. A quasi-quantitative technique utilizing a mini-computer to optimize the images from the gamma camera has been shown to be at least as sensitive as conventional radiological techniques but to give these results without catheterization, at a lower radiation dose and at lower cost.
