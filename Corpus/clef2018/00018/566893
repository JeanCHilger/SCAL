A gamma camera method for quantitation of split renal function in children followed for vesicoureteric reflux. A method for quantitative estimation of split renal function using a computerized gamma camera system is described. 42 children and adolescents with existing or preexisting vesicoureteric reflux and recurrent urinary tract infection were investigated. Total renal clearance of DTPA was calculated with a disappearance curve derived from the largest extrarenal area in the field of view of a gamma camera with diverging collimator. Split renal function was estimated with the slopes of second phase renograms. The plasma disappearance clearance of DTPA, calculated using one compartment model with two late blood samples, gave similar results with the clearance estimated from the body disappearance curves. The proportional planimetric renal parenchymal areas had good correlation with the split clearance estimated from renogram slopes. The method offers data on renal function and urinary tract dynamics which is very valuable in the follow-up of children with recurrent urinary tract infection and vesicoureteric reflux.
