Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the liver. A study of 102 consecutive cases. One hundred five CT-guided or ultrasound-guided fine needle aspirations of liver in 102 consecutive patients were reviewed. Adequate histologic confirmation or clinical follow-up of the final diagnosis was available for 86 of the 105 aspirations. A definite diagnosis of malignancy was made in 53 of the 61 aspirations performed on patients with malignant hepatic disease (86.9%). There were no false positives. The most common tumors detected were metastatic adenocarcinomas from an unknown primary or from the colon and rectum. The tumors were typed correctly in nearly all cases. Benign lesions encountered included cysts, abscesses, hemangiomas, cirrhosis and fatty metamorphosis. No serious complications were encountered as a result of aspiration. Guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of focal liver lesions appears to be an accurate, safe and relatively inexpensive method of diagnosis.
