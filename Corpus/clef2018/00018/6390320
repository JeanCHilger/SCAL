Screening for vesicoureteral reflux in children using real-time sonography. One hundred and ten children, ages 6 days to 14 years, were investigated for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) using ultrasound before voiding cystourethrography (VCU). Sonographically a VUR was assumed if a retrovesical dilated ureter and/or an increase of the separation of the central renal echo complex (CRC) could be detected. By means of sonography VUR grades III and IV were seen in 100%, grade II in 84% of all cases. There was a false positive rate of 10%. Sonographic reflux study is a sensitive and specific screening and follow-up procedure for VUR.
