Ultrasonographic findings in portal hypertension: correlation with the presence and size of oesophageal varices. This study assesses the usefulness of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of portal hypertension. Several ultrasonographic signs were correlated with the presence and size of oesophageal varices detected by endoscopy in 32 patients suffering from alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Ultrasonography is proposed as a simpler and earlier method for screening of portal hypertension than endoscopy.
