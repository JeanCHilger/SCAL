Primary vesico-ureteral reflux in adults. 1977-1982. Department experience of 6-years. The study of a series of 182 ureters (in 102 patients) treated in the Tripode Hospital, Bordeaux, highlights the following facts: as a diagnostic tool, cystography, if performed only once, is not reliable on the other hand, isotopic cystography and endoscopic data are important adjuncts. As regards the management of these cases, 109 vesico-ureteric reimplantations were performed, 83 using Cohen's technique and 26 using Leadbetter's associated in some cases with a unicornous bladder. The results were excellent except in patients presenting with a severe renal insufficiency. Radical surgery was required in twenty cases. Fifty three patients were not treated surgically, but, when renal function is satisfactory, this attitude seems to offer more drawbacks than benefits.
