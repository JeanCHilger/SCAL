The direct isotopic cystography in the study of the vesico-ureteral reflux (author's transl). A technique of direct isotopic cystography is presented. It uses 99mTc-DTPA and scintillation camera connected to a computer. The study included a group of children affected of vesico-ureteral reflux the results are discussed and compared to those of the classical radiological method of voiding cystography. Both techniques seem to complete each other. The radiological method allows a high quality in the definition of the morphological disturbances which causes the reflux. The radioisotope method has a lower radiotoxicity--about 100 times less than voiding cystograph--and high diagnostic sensitivity. The direct isotopic cystography has, in this sense, a broad interest in the periodic control of the vesico-ureteral refluxes treated with conservative procedures.
