Micturition cystourethrography using X-ray or scintigraphy in children with reflux. Thirty children with first time urinary tract infection were investigated for vesicoureteral reflux after bladder catheterization. Micturition cystourethrography with X-ray was compared to scintigraphy because scintigraphy gives less than 10% radiation dose by fluoroscopy. Reflux to the renal pelvis was observed more frequently with scintigraphy, otherwise the nosographic sensitivity and the predictive value of a negative test were about the same (0.90). Scintigraphy is therefore recommended for routine control of reflux in children.
