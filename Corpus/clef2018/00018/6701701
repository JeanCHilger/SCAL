Posterior urethral valve. A review of 120 cases. One hundred and twenty infants and children with a posterior urethral valve treated at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, Cape Town, during the period 1961 - 1982 are reviewed. Advances in diagnosis and management, particularly of the sick infant, have led to a dramatic reduction in the early mortality--from over 40% before 1977 to zero. However, the long-term follow-up of survivors suggests that many will require renal transplantation when they reach early adulthood.
