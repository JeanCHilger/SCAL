Decreased thyroid gland volume in alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. Thyroid function and thyroid gland volume were studied in 40 consecutive alcoholic patients with histologically proven cirrhosis of the liver, and compared with data obtained from 40 sex-, age-, and weight-matched normal subjects. Thyroid volume, measured ultrasonically, was significantly decreased in the patients with cirrhosis: median, 11 ml (range, 6-16 ml) compared to normal subjects: median, 20 ml (range, 10-31 ml) (P less than 0.001). Serum T3 concentrations were significantly reduced: median, 1.5 nmol/liter (range, 0.1-2.5 nmol/liter)
