Ureteral multiplicity. Review of case records. We present distribution by age, sex, clinical picture and clinical examination of 86 cases of renoureteral duplication and one of triplication of which 47 underwent surgical treatment. Intravenous urography provided direct evidence of the existence of duplication in 94%, indirect evidence in 100%, and it disclosed ipsi-or contralateral complications in 23%. Cystography demonstrated vesico ureteral reflux in 62%. Injection of contrast into the ectopic ureteral meatus, echography and gammagraphy provided data of interest in some cases. Accounts are given of indication for operation, approach, surgical procedures, direct of indirect complications, the association of this entity with other pathological conditions and of other procedures which have been described in the treatment of this anomaly.
