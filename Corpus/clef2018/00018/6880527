Anomalies of the urogenital system associated with anorectal malformations. Urinary anomalies associated with anorectal malformations were found in more than one half of 61 consecutive cases treated during the last ten years. This well known high frequency stresses the necessity of systematic investigations in order to diagnose these associated anomalies early in the life. The high incidence of associated anomalies (40%) found in the group of translevator deformities makes careful clinical examination and complete radiological investigation mandatory in all cases. Vesico-ureteral reflux (14 cases), renal agenesis (6 cases), multicystic kidneys (2 cases), urogenital sinus (3 cases) and hypospadias (6 cases) were the most significant findings. A normal aspect of renal ultrasonography at birth should allow to postpone intravenous pyelography which can be tricky in the neonatal period.
