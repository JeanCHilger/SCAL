Value and indication for isotope reflux cystography in children. 65 children with recurrent urinary infections were investigated by a reflux-cystography method, using 99mTc labelled millimicrospheres. Our results show that this method allows a clinically sufficient diagnosis of reflux. The radiation exposure of the patient is 50-200 times less than the established reference method (X-ray refluxcystography). However, the amount of reflux, i.e. the stage of disease can only be determined by the radiologic method. On the basis of our results it is therefore recommended to use the radionuclide reflux-cystography method as basic investigation and for follow-up. If the basic investigation shows a reflux classification of the reflux has to be evaluated by X-ray reflux-cystography.
