Real-time sonographic detection of vesicoureteral reflux in children. Real-time sonography and the principle of contrast sonography were used for evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux in children. Fifty-five kidneys were examined during the filling phase of cystourethrography. Of 15 positive cystograms, with grade II or greater reflux, 13 sonograms were positive. A positive sonogram was defined as visualization of moving microbubbles within the renal collecting system and/or dilatation of the collecting system during the course of bladder filling. This method may prove to be of value in the management of children with vesicoureteral reflux, particularly because sonography provides good visualization of renal size and parenchymal scarring while simultaneously demonstrating reflux.
