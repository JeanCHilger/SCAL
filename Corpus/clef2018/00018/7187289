The sonographic visualization of the vesico-ureteral junction. The anatomical relationship between the terminal ureter, the trigone and the vesico-ureteral junction was studied in vivo by ultrasound. In healthy test persons successful visualization and differentiation of the submucosal, transmural and retrovesical segments of the terminal ureter could be obtained. Some potential clinical applications of the method are discussed.
