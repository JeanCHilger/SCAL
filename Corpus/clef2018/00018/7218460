Early postoperative assessment of the functional patency of ureterovesical junction following ureteroneocystostomy. We studied 37 children soon after ureteroneocystostomy using diuretic radionuclide urography to assess the patency of the ureterovesical junction. Postoperative obstruction was excluded correctly in 90 per cent of the patients. Transient ureterovesical obstruction occurred in 5 patients, identification of which was useful in assigning risk and in guiding followup studies. Because it is a safe, noninvasive and relatively low radiation test the diuretic radionuclide urogram proves to be an attractive alternative to the excretory urogram in the early and late followup of patients undergoing a ureterovesical junction operation.
