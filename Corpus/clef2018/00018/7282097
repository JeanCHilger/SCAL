The use of split and regional renal clearance for indication for surgery in pediatric urology (author's transl). The differential and ipsilateral clearance of Hippuran allows for a quantitative assessment of the function of both kidneys, a single kidney and a part of one kidney. We have performed this investigation 179 times in 156 children in relation to dysplastic kidneys, obstructive lesions in the upper urinary tract, duplex kidneys and in follow-up situations. In many of these patients this investigation produced an indication for an organ-preserving operative procedure. The radiological findings are compared with the clinical picture.
