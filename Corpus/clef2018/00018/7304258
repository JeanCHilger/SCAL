Ultrasound examination of the kidney after Politano-Leadbetter ureteroneocystostomy. Ultrasound was used in infants and children operated upon with together 62 ureteroneocystostomies to detect complicating obstructive uropathy in the early postoperative period. It was compared with isotope examination and urography. Ultrasound was reliable and accurate in appreciating urinary stasis and should thus be preferred as examination method.
