A case of congenital hepatic fibrosis: usefulness of hepatobiliary scintigraphy. A case of operatively proven congenital hepatic fibrosis was studied by scintigraphy with Tc-99m-phytate and Tc-99m-Pl (a hepatobiliary radiopharmaceutical). Two focal defects were recognized in the liver on the colloid liver scintigram. Ultrasound and contrast angiography suggested that the two focal defects were cystic lesions. Radionuclide hepatobiliary imaging was performed with Tc-99m-Pl, since intravenous cholangiography was unsatisfactory. One focal defect was proved to be a dilated intrahepatic bile duct and another was found to be cyst. Radionuclide hepatobiliary imaging with Tc-99m-Pl proved to be very useful in identifying dilated intrahepatic bile ducts in this patient as well as in following the progress of this disease.
