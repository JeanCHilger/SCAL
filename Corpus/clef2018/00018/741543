Quantitative nuclear cystogram. Aid in determining spontaneous resolution of vesicoureteral reflux. The quantatitative data derived from serial nuclear cystograms over a five-year period in 37 children were compared with the clinical course. A direct correlation (92 per cent) between an increasing bladder volume at which reflux occurs was observed in the clinically stable group. In the clinically unstable group, there was a 75-per cent correlation of an unchanged or decreasing bladder volume at which reflux occurs. The quantitative nuclear cystogram provides an objective as opposed to subjective data base for management of patients with vesicoureteral reflux.
