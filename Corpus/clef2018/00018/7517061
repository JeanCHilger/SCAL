Hemoperitoneum supporting difficult diagnosis of diffuse hepatocarcinoma in liver cirrhosis. The cases of two patients with liver cirrhosis HCV-related, admitted in our Department in consequence of the development of ascites, anemia and clinical deterioration, are reported. Both patients had all major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma and anamnestic and physical findings suggesting this diagnosis nevertheless, the alpha-1-fetoprotein serum levels and the ultrasonographic findings were not diagnostic for primary hepatic neoplasm. Explorative paracentesis was diagnostic, demonstrating the presence of hemoperitoneum (the hematocrit ratio in the ascitic fluid was 12 and 10, respectively). Magnetic resonance revealed extensive diffuse hepatocellular carcinoma on both cases. Hemoperitoneum, in patients with liver cirrhosis, in face of non diagnostic levels of alpha-1-fetoprotein and ultrasonographic findings, can be indicative of the spontaneous rupture of a diffuse type of hepatocellular carcinoma.
