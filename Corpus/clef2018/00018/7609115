Management of spinal cord injured patients by indwelling suprapubic catheterization. We review the urological complications in spinal cord injury patients treated with suprapubic catheterization.Suprapubic catheterization was used in 44 spinal cord injury patients. Followup ranged from 12 to 150 months (mean 58). The catheters were irrigated weekly and changed every 2 weeks. Patients were followed annually with urodynamic studies and ultrasound.No patient had renal deterioration, vesicoureteral reflux or bladder carcinoma. The incidences of incontinence, urinary tract infections and calculi were acceptable.Suprapubic catheterization is an effective and safe alternative form of bladder management in select patients with spinal cord injury.
