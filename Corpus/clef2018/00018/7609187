Regional renal blood flow measurements using radioactive microspheres in a chronic porcine model with unilateral vesicoureteral reflux. 95Niobium labeled radioactive microspheres were used to determine regional renal blood flows in a porcine model of chronic sterile vesicoureteral reflux. Unilateral vesicoureteral reflux was surgically created in 5 mini-pigs and regional renal blood flows were determined by microsphere injection 6 months later. The contralateral nonrefluxing kidney acted as a control. There was a significant reduction of flow in the inner cortical regions of the middle (78% of control, p < or = 0.0437) and lower poles (69% of control, p < or = 0.0274), and the juxta-medullary cortical region of the lower pole (67% of control, p < or = 0.0124). There was no difference in flow in the other regions or when comparing whole kidneys. There were no differences between refluxing and nonrefluxing kidneys when comparing ratios of inner to outer cortical flow level by level. These observations are in contrast to those in acutely created vesicoureteral reflux in a porcine model, which had no significant differences in flow in any region using the microsphere technique. Decreases of blood flow in certain cortical regions may help explain some of the physiological changes in vesicoureteral reflux in children and experimental models of reflux.
