Hepatocellular carcinoma: is spontaneous regression possible?. We present the case of a patient with liver cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C who developed a large (6 cms) hepatocellular carcinoma, diagnosed by raised alphafetoprotein (AFP) levels (> 10000 ng/ml) and imaging techniques (ultrasonography and abdominal CT with and without contrast). During follow-up there was normalization of the AFP levels and disappearance of the lesion on U.S. and CT. Spontaneous regression is exceptional in hepatocellular carcinoma. We describe the characteristics of our case and of the 10 patients described in the literature.
