Outcome analysis of bilateral Cohen cross-trigonal ureteroneocystostomy. The perioperative and long-term outcomes of children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) treated by cross-trigonal ureteroneocystostomy were ascertained.One hundred ten consecutive children with VUR who underwent bilateral cross-trigonal ureteroneocystostomy were studied retrospectively. Nineteen children with neurovesical dysfunction or megaureters requiring tapered reimplants were excluded. Outcome parameters of the remaining 91 children consisted of operative time, length of hospitalization, days of Foley catheter drainage perioperative complications, correction of reflux, subsequent morbidity, and parental satisfaction.Of 182 renal units, 11 (6%) had grade 0 VUR, 18 (10%) had grade I, 43 (24%) had grade II, 59 (32%) had grade III, 36 (20%) had grade IV, and 15 (8%) had grade V reflux. The mean operative and hospitalization times were 180 minutes and 5.6 days, respectively. No postoperative complications occurred. Three children were lost to follow-up, and the remaining 88 children had an extended mean follow-up in excess of 3 years. Voiding cystourethrogram documented a 98.3% (173 of 176 renal units) success rate. Sixteen children (18%) experienced nonfebrile clinically symptomatic cystitis episodes and 3 children (3%) experienced one febrile episode each. Telephone parental survey of overall surgical experience revealed a 94% very satisfied, 2% satisfied, and 3% dissatisified rate.Cross-trigonal ureteroneocystostomy is a safe and effective technique that is virtually complication free and has high parental satisfaction. The results of this study provide a baseline for comparison of non-operative treatment of reflux as well as laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques.
