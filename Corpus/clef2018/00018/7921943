Mild dilatation of the fetal kidney: a follow-up study. To assess morbidity in children with mild prenatally detected pelvicalyceal dilatation and to document the natural history of this ultrasound finding in post-natal life.A retrospective (on-going) study was carried out in 29 children (39 kidneys) with mild dilatation confined to the pelvis and/or calices confirmed on initial post-natal ultrasound scan. Re-evaluation was carried out at a mean age of 4.2 years (range 1.5-7.8). Clinically, each patient's history, height, weight and blood pressure were recorded. On ultrasound examination the renal length, collecting system appearances and dimensions were recorded.Vesico-ureteric reflux was demonstrated in 1 of 14 infants who underwent neonatal micturating cystourethrography. During cumulative follow-up totaling 122 years, there were only two documented episodes of urological morbidity, i.e. one episode of unexplained haematuria and one of urinary tract infection. By a mean age of 4.2 years the ultrasound appearances had reverted to normal in 69% of kidneys. In 31% dilatation persisted and was unchanged or diminished in severity. No case of increasing dilatation was seen. Renal growth was normal in 97% of kidneys.Mild dilatation of the fetal urinary tract is a common prenatal ultrasound finding. When confined to the renal pelvis and/or calices it is of doubtful clinical significance and is associated with a low level of morbidity in infancy and early childhood. Invasive investigation in post-natal life is not justified.
