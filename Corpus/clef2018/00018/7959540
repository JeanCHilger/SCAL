Bisegmentectomy 5-8 for the removal of tumors of the 8th hepatic segment--a technical note. Isolated resection of the 8th segment is a technical challenge. The deep location of the afferent portal pedicle mandates the performance of a wedge resection that leaves a deep and narrow wound in which hemostasis is difficult to achieve. Furthermore the relationships with the middle and right hepatic veins jeopardize the transparenchymal approach. For the removal of tumors located in the 8th segment, we propose a combined resection of the 8th and 5th segments, whose pedicles arise from the anterior right pedicle of the portal vein. The technique permits a safe liver resection and ensures a satisfactory surgical margin.
