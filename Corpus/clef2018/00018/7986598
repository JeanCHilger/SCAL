The usefulness of abdominal echography in the diagnosis of portal hypertension in cirrhotic patients. The differences in sonographic measurements of the splanchnic vessels, their modifications during respiration, the spleen size and the presence of collaterals of the portal system among 110 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension and 30 control subjects are analyzed to verify the usefulness of conventional sonography in the diagnosis of portal hypertension. We achieved a sensitivity above 70% and a specificity of at least 90% with the following signs: 1) dilation of portal, splenic and superior mesenteric veins, 2) limited variations of the latter two during respiration, and 3) splenomegaly. A higher sensitivity was achieved considering variations in splenic caliber during respiration under 33% (91%) or superior mesenteric vein during forced expiration above or equal than 7 mm (88%). These measurements could be found in 71.8% and 57.2% respectively. On the other hand, values of portal vein and spleen size were easily obtained. The usefulness of all measurements persists if we take into account only patients with Child-Pugh score < 7. Collateral circulation was demonstrated in 18%. Portal vein above 14 mm, variations in splenic caliber under 13% or superior mesenteric vein during forced expiration above or equal than 9 mm were obtained in any of control subjects but respectively in 33%, 46% and 69% of patients in portal hypertension group. We conclude that ultrasonography is a reliable and noninvasive tool in the diagnosis of portal hypertension in cirrhotic patients.
