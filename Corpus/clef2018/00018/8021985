The selective use of dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans in children with vesicoureteral reflux. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans were performed on 75 children (115 refluxing renal units) to determine the efficacy of routine scanning in patients with various grades of vesicoureteral reflux. Cystourethrography demonstrated grades I and II reflux in 75 renal units and grades III to V in 40. Of the patients 51 presented with febrile urinary tract infection and 24 were asymptomatic (patients presenting with nonfebrile urinary tract infections or those undergoing sibling screening). Renal ultrasounds were performed in 60 patients. All patients were initially managed with medical therapy and 19 (25%) ultimately underwent antireflux surgery. DMSA scans demonstrated scarring in 17 of 40 renal units (43%) of patients with high grade vesicoureteral reflux and 6 of 75 renal units (8%) of those with low grade reflux. Renal ultrasounds that were interpreted as normal always correlated to a normal DMSA scan in asymptomatic patients. In patients presenting with febrile urinary tract infections the correlation between ultrasound and DMSA scan was inconsistent. We advocate a tailored approach in the evaluation of patients with vesicoureteral reflux. Renal sonography may be sufficient in the assessment of renal scarring in asymptomatic patients with reflux and those with low grade reflux. Conversely, in patients with high grade vesicoureteral reflux, a history of febrile urinary tract infections and abnormal renal ultrasound DMSA renal scans appear to be most useful.
