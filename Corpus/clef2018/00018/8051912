Ultrasound screening of vesico-uretero-renal reflux. A prospective study of detecting vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) by ultrasound is to be presented. In case of reflux, gas bubbles can be seen in the renal pelvis during the filling phase of a gas cystogram and during micturition, utilizing ultrasound as the imaging modality. In children under two years 52 sonographic reflux studies were performed and compared with radiographic voiding cystourethrograms (VCUG). All higher grade VUR (grades II-IV) have been detected by our method.
