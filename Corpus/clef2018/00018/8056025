Value of dimercaptosuccinic acid single photon emission computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in detecting renal injury in pediatric patients with vesicoureteral reflux. Comparison with dimercaptosuccinic acid planar scintigraphy and intravenous pyelography. The value of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) planar renal scintigraphy, DMSA single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the assessment of renal injury related to vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was examined in 60 kidneys of 32 pediatric patients (28 bilateral, 4 unilateral) with primary VUR. The results were: (1) detection of minor renal lesions was best with MRI, then DMSA-planar and DMSA-SPECT, and (2) in comparing the positive rate, DMSA-SPECT (85%) and MRI (83.3%) were superior to intravenous pyelography (55%) and DMSA-planar scintigraphy (65%). These results suggest that DMSA-SPECT or MRI may be more sensitive than DMSA-planar scintigraphy and intravenous pyelography in detecting renal injury related to VUR in pediatric patients.
