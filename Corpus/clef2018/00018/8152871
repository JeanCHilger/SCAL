The low frequency of reflux in Jamaican children. Fifty consecutive micturating cystourethrograms (MCUG) performed at the UHWI between June 1989 and December 1991 were reviewed. There were forty boys and ten girls. Infants under the age of one year accounted for 58%. Urinary tract infection was the commonest presenting feature (72%), voiding difficulties (10%) and associated malformations (14%) were the other reasons for doing the MCUG. Only 10% of the children revealed vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) which supports the view that reflux is less common in the noncaucasian population. In our population, the yield from MCUG is low. However, when detected, the reflux was of significant degree as to warrant active therapy. All but one of the VU refluxes diagnosed by MCUG had ultrasonographic abnormalities. Black children with single urinary infections have a low likelihood of VUR. A clear history of pyelonephritis and abnormalities on ultrasound or radionuclide cystogram may be used as criteria to select those in whom MCUG will be useful.
