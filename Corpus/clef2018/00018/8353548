Echography in the follow-up of patients receiving an endoscopic injection of teflon for vesico-renal reflux. The surgical treatment of vesicorenal reflux implies open surgery and consequently an hospitalization. The sub-ureteric injection of poly-tetra-fluoro ethylene (Teflon) for correction of vesicorenal reflux was first utilized in 1981 by Matouschek. We have reviewed our personal experience with endoscopic correction of vesicorenal reflux from 1985 to 1990 and evaluated the importance of ultrasonography especially in the follow up.
