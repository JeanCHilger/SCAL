Detection of fetal urinary obstructions requiring therapy in routine prenatal ultrasound. Routine ultrasound during pregnancy is also performed for the detection of fetal malformations. This retrospective study comprises 31 children treated for urinary tract infection within 19 months postnatally. The charts of the young patients were evaluated how often a dilatation of the upper urinary tract (more than 3 cm in diameter) was observed already during pregnancy. In 18 patients (58%) the dilatation was detected antenatally and was missed in 13 (42%). Reasons of the low sensitivity may include low technical standard of the sonographic equipment and limited skill of the investigators.
