Silent renal damage in symptom-free siblings of children with vesicoureteral reflux: assessment with technetium Tc 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy. Sixteen symptom-free siblings of children with vesicoureteral reflux were found to have the condition and underwent renal scintigraphy with technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid. Of these 16 children, 6 had scintigraphic evidence of renal damage. Screening for vesicoureteral reflux in siblings of children known to have the condition should therefore be carried out early in life when reflux is present, an immediate assessment of the renal parenchyma should be made.
