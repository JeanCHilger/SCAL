Unusual presentation of bilateral ureterocele in an adult Black male. Clinical case. Ureterocele is a congenital urinary abnormality characterized by the presence of an intra-bladder hernia or cystic ballooning of the lower end of a ureter between the mucosa and muscle of the bladder. The abnormality leads to urinary retention and recurrent urinary tract infection which can cause irreversible damage to the kidney. Antenatal ultrasound diagnosis of ureterocele is possible but remains difficult. The disease is confirmed during radiologic examination after birth, and renal function is assessed by 99mTc-DMSA. Ureterocele, while not an uncommon pediatric urologic problem, has been reported only rarely in adults. It is bilateral in 10% of cases, is rare in black people, and requires thoughtful management decisions. A relatively uncommon case of bilateral ureterocele with single ureter, associated with left vesicoureteral reflux, in African black man is reported. The patient was investigated by ultrasonography and intravenous urography. Surgical transvesical right "osteoplasty" and excision of the left ureterocele plus ureteric reimplantation, using Politano-Leadbetter technique, were performed. The surgical approach to ureterocele is discussed and we underlined the difficulty of therapeutic decisions, especially if surgery is considered.
