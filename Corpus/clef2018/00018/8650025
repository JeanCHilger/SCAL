Results of conservative treatment for regressive vesicoureteral reflux in childhood. The study involved 112 children with 169 confirmed vesicoureteric reflux grades I, II, III. During anti-bacterial treatment which lasted at last two years, spontaneous regression occurred in 82% of the vesicoureteral reflux. Renal scars were observed in 8% of the cases. Initially urinary tract infection was diagnosed in 84% of the children. This figure was reduced to 8% after anti-bacterial treatment. 54% of the observed children had associated diseases (anaemia, chronic enteropathy, bronchitis and pneumonia). The results confirmed the efficiency of anti-bacterial treatment in children with vesicoureteral reflux grades I, II, III.
