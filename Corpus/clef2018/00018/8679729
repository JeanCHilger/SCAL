Use of digital luminescence radiography in voiding cystourethrography. Optimization of image quality by use of digital luminescence radiography (DLR) in voiding cystoureterography (VCU) instead of a conventional screen film system.53 patients with a suspected vesicouretral reflux were examined with a VCU in analogous and digital technique. The X-rays were taken in a sitting position while simultaneously measuring the bladder pressure. An intraindividual comparison was omitted for X-ray saving reasons. In the follow-up 3 patients were examined with the other system. Two radiologists and two urologists compared 60 VCU of 53 patients--30 VCU in conventional screen film and 30 in DLR technique presented in standard and edge-enhanced images--with regard to image quality according to 3-step score (A--good image quality, B--sufficient image quality, C--insufficient image quality).The 59 conventional films were scored 72 times with an A, 76 times with a B, and 72 times with a C, whereas the DLR films were scored 116 times with an A, 72 times with a B, and only 8 times with a C. Hereby the edge-enhanced images were the most useful for distinguishing the bladder shadow from the soft tissue of the thigh and for detecting reflux. Furthermore, the exposure dose when applying DLR could be decreased to 75% in grown-ups and to 57% in children without any significant loss of information.The DLR is highly superior to the conventional film screen system because of its relatively high tolerance towards wrong exposures, especially with respect of the sitting position during MCU. With the DLR we obtained 96% and with the conventional system only 63% films usable for diagnosis.
