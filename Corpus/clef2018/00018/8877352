One-stage reconstruction of bladder exstrophy. From 1984 to 1990 a primary one-stage reconstruction of bladder exstrophy was performed at our hospital on 15 consecutive infants. Reconstruction included Cohen's ureteral reimplantation, bladder neck reconstruction according to Young-Dees, bladder closure, symphyseal bone approximation, abdominal wall closure, and repair of epispadias in females. Postoperatively, all patients were immobilized by overhead extension. Iliac osteotomy was done in 9 children, but was abandoned in recent years for infants less than one month old Follow-up examinations included an interview with the parents, clinical examinations, blood and urine analyses, uroflowmetry, and ultrasound scan of the abdomen. Nuclear renal scan, i.v. pyelography, and cystography were carried out as indicated. At the time of last evaluation the children were between 3 and 9 years of age. The cosmetic results were satisfactory in all cases. Eight of 15 children were dry day and night with micturition intervals more than 3 hours during day time (complete continence). Five children were dry during day time with micturition intervals up to 3 hours, but occasionally wet their beds (partial continence). Two children were incontinent. Eleven of 15 children had a bladder capacity of more than 100 ml. Renal function was normal in all patients. Two children showed a mild VUR, and no other abnormalities of the upper urinary tracts were found. Iliac osteotomy did not influence the functional or cosmetic results, but in two patients asymmetry of pelvic bones with consecutive lumbar scoliosis was found. Comparing these results with reports on staged reconstructive procedures, we conclude that by primary complete one-stage reconstruction a well acceptable success rate is achieved, and that by this method possibly some advantages are offered to patients with bladder exstrophy.
