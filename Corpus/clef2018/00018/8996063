Vesico-ureteric reflux and surgically treated pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction in infants under the age of 12 months. Pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction has been increasingly diagnosed in infants, mostly as a consequence of antenatal ultrasound examinations.Of 55 infants below the age of 12 months who underwent dismembered pyeloplasty over a 7-year period, we aimed to determine the patterns and outcome of associated vesico-ureteric reflux that was present in 15 (28%) of the 53 infants in whom follow-up was available.A total of eight infants had resolution of their reflux with conservative management and the median time to resolution was 15 months. Five infants proceeded to ureteroneocystotomy.Given the association of vesico-ureteric reflux and pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction, routine cystography is recommended when the diagnosis of pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction is made.
