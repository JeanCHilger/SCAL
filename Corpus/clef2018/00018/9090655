Catch-up growth in children with vesico-ureteric reflux. A longitudinal retrospective study of height Z score (HZ score) and weight-for-height index (WHI) was performed on 94 pre-pubertal children with vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) and normal creatinine clearance followed for 1-6.8 years (mean 3.1 years). Thirty patients had bilateral VUR with scintigraphic signs of renal scarring (B+), 17 had bilateral VUR without renal scarring (B-), 27 had unilateral VUR with (U+) and 20 unilateral VUR without (U-) renal scarring. Thirty-three patients received only antimicrobial medication and 61 underwent successful antireflux operation. The increase in HZ score and WHI during the 1st year of follow-up was significantly (P = 0.001 and 0.00003, respectively) higher than during the 2nd year. At first visit, B+ subjects had an average WHI and HZ score that were significantly (P = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively) lower than the other groups of patients together. At last visit this difference was not significant. In B+ subjects, the WHI and HZ score at last visit were significantly (P = 0.04 for both) higher than at the first visit. B+ patients fully recover their body growth deficit compared with other groups of VUR subjects after medical and/or surgical therapy.
