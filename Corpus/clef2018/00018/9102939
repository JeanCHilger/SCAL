Detection of vesicoureteral reflux with radionuclide cystography. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) an be detected by both X-ray and radionuclide cystography. The principal advantage of radionuclide method is considerably lower radiation dose used. 201 girls with urinary tract infection were evaluated for vesicoureteral reflux by direct radionuclide cystography (DRCG). VUR was detected in 60 children (30%). Comparative study between DRCG and voiding uretrocystography (VCUG) performed in 54 girls demonstrated no significant difference in sensitivity between these methods. Thus, DRCG could be recommended as alternative and complementary method to the conventional VCUG, for evaluation of VUR. Indications for application of radionuclide method are discussed.
