Sjögren's syndrome associated with autoimmune hepatitis. A case report. Liver involvement in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome is rare, usually without clinical significance and histologically characterized by a feature like stage 1 primary biliary cirrhosis. We describe herein a case of acute and severe autoimmune hepatitis in a patient suffering from primary Sjögren's syndrome. The diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome was performed in 1989. In June 1995 the patient presented severe weakness, jaundice and elevation of transaminases moreover IgG raised to 5560 mg/dl and ANA titre increased to 1:20480. The patient denied alcohol and drug use and a viral hepatitis was excluded. Antimitochondrial antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibodies and antibodies against liver kidney microsomes were negative. An abdomen ultrasound examination revealed hepatomegaly, with irregular echogenic structure and lymphoadenomegaly near the celiac tripod. Liver biopsy demonstrated a picture of autoimmune hepatitis. The patient was treated with prednisone 50 mg/day and azathioprine 50 mg/day, with improvement in clinical and liver function indices. At present, the patient is given only 10 mg/day of prednisone. The association of Sjögren's syndrome with autoimmune hepatitis is very rare: in the literature only one other similar case has been reported.
