Vesicoureteral reflux in older children: concordance of US and voiding cystourethrographic findings. To determine if a negative renal sonogram is reliably predictive of the absence of vesicoureteral reflux at voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in children aged 5 years or older.Imaging studies in 70 children aged 5 years or older who underwent renal ultrasound (US) and VCUG on the same day were reviewed. These children had initially undergone evaluation because of a urinary tract infection.Five of 70 children had abnormal sonograms two (40%) of the five had reflux at VCUG. One had mild pelvicalyceal dilatation, and one had a small kidney. The other three (without reflux) had a pelvic kidney, a calyceal diverticulum, or a renal stone. Of 65 children with a negative sonogram, 19 (29%) had reflux at VCUGChildren with abnormal screening renal sonograms often have vesicoureteral reflux, but a normal sonogram does not reliably exclude the condition even in children aged 5 years or older. Therefore, VCUG must be performed even in older children, regardless of US findings, if clinical decisions are influenced by documentation of the presence of VUR.
