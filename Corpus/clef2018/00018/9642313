Changes of ultrasonography and two serum biochemical indices for hepatic fibrosis in schistosomiasis japonica patients one year after praziquantel treatment. To observe the changes of abdominal sonography and 2 biochemical indicators for hepatic fibrosis before and after treatment with praziquantel in schistosomiasis japonica patients.Fifty-five persons infected with Schistosoma japonicum and treated with praziquantel were examined with ultrasonography and serum hyaluronic acid (HA) and type III procollagen (PC III) before and 1 year after treatment, and their data were compared with those in 55 normal controls.With comparison of the data before praziquantel treatment, the length of the left liver lobe and the spleen in 55 patients all decreased (P < 0.01) 1 year after treatment. No significant change was seen in interior diameter (d) of the portal vein, while a decrease in the ratio of the exterior diameter (D) and interior diameter of the second branch of the portal vein was very significant (P < 0.01). Compared with the data in normal control, significantly higher levels in the thickness of the left lobe, the maximum oblique diameter of the right lobe, the length of the spleen, spleen index, the interior diameter of the portal vein and D/d ratio were seen in the patients both before and after treatment. The abnormal rate of the 2 serum parameters for hepatic fibrosis decreased significantly after treatment.Parameters of hepatic fibrosis either by ultrasonography or by the 2 biochemical tests showed a significant improvement in 55 patients 1 year after treatment, although some of the indices did not yet return to normal levels.
