Comparison of screening of vesicoureteral reflux with renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography. To suggest a different method for diagnosing vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in lieu of voiding cystourethrography (VCU), in order to prevent radiation exposure.Fifty-two ureterorenal units of 26 patients were evaluated ultrasonographically for visualizing the renal collecting systems, both before and after filling up the bladder with saline infusion. Every patient also underwent evaluation with VCU.All patients with Grade 2 or higher degrees of VUR on VCU can be identified by ultrasound (USG). Overall sensitivity and specificity of this technique were 66.7% and 93.48%, respectively, in our patient group.After being diagnosed with VCU initially a VUR patient can be effectively followed up by USG in order to prevent radiation exposure. Considering the clinical management of a patient with Grade 1 VUR which could not be detected with USG, it is concluded that failure to detect Grade 1 VUR will not be a handicap.
