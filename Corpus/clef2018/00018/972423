Socalled "primary" megaureter in the child and adult. Comparative study of 46 megaureters (author's transl). This analysis covering 46 MU in 36 patients, of which 16 were adults, shows the greater gravity in the child, with regards to the renal lesions as well as the degree of ureteric dilatation. The advantage of quantitative renal scintigraphic scanning in the evaluation of renal involvement is stressed. On the other hand, with regards to the results of conservative surgery (21 Leedbetter-Politano antireflux uretero-vesical re-implantations of which 5 were complemented by Hendren type modeling ureteroplasty) there seems to be no difference between the children and adults: 18 good results, 2 of which after reintervention for stenosis and uretero-vesical reimplantation.
