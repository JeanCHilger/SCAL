Clinical features of unilateral multicystic renal dysplasia in children. A clinical study of 204 patients with unilateral multicystic renal dysplasia referred to 30 nephrology departments was undertaken to assess the frequency of complications in children who underwent nephrectomy (n = 40) versus those who were treated conservatively (n = 164). Six patients required antihypertensive treatment, 30 (13% of girls, 17% of boys) had at least one episode of urinary tract infection. The number of clinical complications did not differ in patients who underwent nephrectomy in comparison to those who did not. The dysplastic kidney decreased in size in 65% of kidneys with repeated ultrasound values no change occurred in 16%, while an increase in maximal diameter was observed in 19%. Contralateral kidney length of more than 2 standard deviation scores (SDS) was seen in 30% of patients. There is evidence for a slight impairment of renal function in the whole study group given by a median of serum creatinine level of 0.63 SDS in all patients available for analysis. Among those 35 patients with contralateral anomalies (mainly obstructive changes and vesico-ureteral reflux), all 3 patients with contralateral changes suggestive of hypoplasia and 22% with obstruction, but only 1/7 (14%) with reflux showed elevated serum creatinine level >2 SDS.Renal function seems to be slightly impaired in patients with unilateral multicystic renal dysplasia. The apparent tendency to regression of the dysplastic kidney and no difference in the number of complications justify a conservative management rather than operative intervention.
