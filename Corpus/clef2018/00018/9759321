Parenchymatous cicatrix and urinary tract infection: physiopathology and clinical implications. Renal scarring is the main long term complication of acute pyelonephritis in children. The prevalence rate is hazardous since data from the literature are confusing with respect to reflux nephropathy, chronic pyelonephritis and renal hypoplasia. The pathology of such lesions consists in focal interstitial fibrosis. When the first pyelonephritic attack occurs during infancy, renal growth may be compromised. The current approach of renal scar assessment is based on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Bilateral extensive lesions may be responsible for altered glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and/or arterial hypertension. The management of overt scarring is conservative and careful prevention must be based on early and aggressive treatment of acute pyelonephritis.
