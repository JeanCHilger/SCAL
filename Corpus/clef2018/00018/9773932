Blood digestion-induced splanchnic hyperemia and portal blood flow in portal hypertensive rats and the role of octreotide. We aimed to investigate whether the presence of blood within the intestinal lumen after variceal bleeding would lead to reactive intestinal hyperemia, which in turn could result in the worsening of portal hemodynamics, and thus bleeding recurrence. Two models of portal hypertensive Wistar rats were used: 32 CCl4-cirrhotics with a low index of portal-systemic shunting and 32 that had been previously subjected to portal vein stenosis, with a high index of portal-systemic shunting 32 Wistar rats served as controls. The rats were divided into four groups, each comprising 8 cirrhotics, 8 portal vein stenosis rats, and 8 controls. Intestinal microcirculation and portal blood flow were assessed by laser-Doppler and transit-time ultrasonic flow probes, respectively, before and 60 min after the injection of 2 ml of blood (groups 1 and 2) or an equal volume of NaCl 0.9% (placebo
