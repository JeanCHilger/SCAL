Urology and nuclear medicine in children. Experience from a series of 1200 renal scintigraphies. During the last 4 years, we have performed 1200 renal scintigraphies in children under the age of 6 years: 57% of dynamic renal scintigraphies using MAG3 for antenatally diagnosed uropathies (mainly pelvic dilatations and megaureters), 36% of static renal scintigraphies using DMSA for renal sequelae of pyelonephritis with or without vesicoureteric reflux, and 6% of direct isotope cystography for follow-up of vesicoureteric reflux. Renal scintigraphy, which provides low radiation hazards (1 mSv), is now a major imaging modality for paediatric urinary tract disease.
