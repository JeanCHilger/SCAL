Endoscopic treatment of vesicorenal reflux in children. Five-year assessment of the use of Macroplastique. To compare the results of endoscopic treatment of vesicorenal reflux by Macroplastique implantation versus Teflon implantation.297 children with 454 refluxing vesicorenal units were treated by endoscopic implantation of Macroplastique (Rplasty)-A.B.S.: 385 cases of primary reflux and 69 cases of secondary or associated reflux. All children were reviewed by ultrasound and cystography 6 weeks and 1 year after implantation.Regardless of the aetiology and the grade, reflux resolved in 91.2% of children (93.3% of ureters). Complications such as ureteric stasis were rare (3 cases). 161 children (253 ureters) were reviewed 1 year after treatment: reflux had recurred in 8.7% of patients.Although the mean quantity implanted was lower with Macroplastique, the results appeared to be better than those obtained with Teflon (bases on a previous series of 402 children: cure for 87.1% of ureters and 85.7% of children). The advantages of Macroplastique compared to Teflon include the less liquid consistency, the absence of retraction of the product and the presence of larger microparticles without any local or distant inflammatory reaction.
