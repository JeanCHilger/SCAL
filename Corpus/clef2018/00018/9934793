Features of primary vesicoureteric reflux detected by investigation of foetal hydronephrosis. Primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) diagnosed on investigation of foetal hydronephrosis accounts for many antenatally detected uropathies. In order to study foetal VUR and its consequences, newborns with foetal hydronephrosis were investigated by ultrasound, micturating cystourethrogram and 99mTechnetium-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA), after beginning of chemoprophylaxis. Twenty-eight infants with VUR (bilateral in 15 cases) were identified giving a total 43 renal units for study. There was a predominance of males (86%), moderate/severe reflux (84%) and renal damage (51%). Presence of renal damage was correlated with the severity of reflux. VUR should be investigated in cases of foetal hydronephrosis and our results support that renal damage is frequently congenital and not secondary to urinary tract infection.
