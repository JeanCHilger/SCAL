Segmental renal hypoplasia in childhood. Radiological findings of segmental renal hypoplasia are reported, based on the observation of 6 children aged between 8 and 14. The leading clinical symptom is arterial hypertension. Urinary tract infection and proteinuria are additional common findings. Cases with bilateral disease often have renal failure. The intravenous urogram shows unilateral or bilateral small kidneys with segmental renal scarring and transverse lobulation. In the pathological areas the calyces are ectatic or clubbed and their infundibulum is elongated. Vesico-ureteral reflux is frequent. In angiography the lobulated segments appear hypovascular. Diagnosis was verified by histological examination.
