Utility of SPECT DMSA renal scanning in the evaluation of children with primary vesicoureteral reflux. DMSA renal scanning is more sensitive than ultrasound in detecting renal parenchymal scars. We proposed to determine the utility of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scanning in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).During a 24-month period, we evaluated the charts of 368 patients who had undergone SPECT DMSA renal scanning for primary VUR. Patients were divided into three age groups: (a) less than 1 year, (b) between 1 and 5 years, and (c) older than 6 years. Renal scars were deemed severe or focal. The data were analyzed to evaluate the utility of SPECT DMSA scanning in children with primary VUR and to determine the indications for performing SPECT DMSA. We also evaluated the sensitivity of recent renal ultrasound technology in detecting focal and diffuse scars.One hundred twenty-eight patients were younger than 1 year at presentation. These included 24 cases that were detected prenatally. One hundred eighty-five were between the ages of 1 and 5 years, and 55 were 6 years or older. Reflux nephropathy at presentation was found in 99 (26.9%) of 368 patients. DMSA scanning changed the treatment in only 13 patients (3.5%). When scarring was diffuse, ultrasound examination correlated 100% with DMSA scanning when focal scarring was present, the correlation was poor.Our results suggest that DMSA scans should be tailored to children who have ultrasound abnormalities, high-grade reflux, or recurrent breakthrough urinary tract infections. These guidelines will result in a substantial cost savings and a significant decrease in radiation exposure.
