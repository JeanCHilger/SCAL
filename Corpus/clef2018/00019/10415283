The role of minimal surgery with renal preservation in abnormal complete duplex systems. Among 36 children, mostly less than 1 year of age, referred for a complete duplex-system anomaly, 18 were diagnosed before birth by obstetrical ultrasonography where a diagnosis of dilated upper urinary tract was the most frequent report in the remaining cases urinary tract infection was the main presenting symptom. Five children had bilateral anomalies. Principal diagnoses associated with the complete duplex system were: 18 ureteroceles (UC) (11 extravesical [EUC] with bladder-neck or urethral extension, 7 intravesical [IUC]), 5 ectopic ureters without UC and 28 lower-polar vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) associated in 6 with upper polar VUR. The initial assessment was based on a voiding cystogram and radionuclide scan. Renal-polar function was severely impaired when major ureteral ectopia or severe primary reflux was present. Primary surgery was performed in 8 patients, demolitive in 4 (3 upper-polar nephrectomies, 1 nephrectomy) and reconstructive in 4 (duplex en-bloc reimplantation)
