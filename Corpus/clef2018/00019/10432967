Retrograde echocystography: a new ultrasonographic technique for the diagnosis and staging of vesicoureteral reflux. We investigated the accuracy of a new US investigation technique, called retrograde cystography US, in the early diagnosis and staging of vesicoureteral reflux.We examined 5 patients, aged 3 months to 10 years, suffering from hydronephrosis and/or pyelonephritis. Retrograde cystography US was followed by conventional retrograde cystography. Retrograde cystography US consists in the transcatheter introduction of a contrast agent (Levovist, Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) into the bladder and a subsequent color Doppler examination to show or exclude the presence of reflux. Superpubic scanning of bladder, ureters and pyelocaliceal cavity was performed after echocontrast agent introduction to assess the reflux grade. US was performed with an Esaote AU 590 asynchronous scanner (Esaote Biomedica, Genova, Italy) with a 3.5 MHz convex probe.After the transcatheter introduction of Levovist, vesicoureteral reflux was seen in 5/5 patients. Reflux grade was also measured with US and then confirmed at retrograde cystography. In a patient with pyelonephritis and no reflux at follow-up cystography, retrograde cystography US identified a unilateral reflux (grade 1).Retrograde cystography US showed the echocontrast agent in the urinary tract and assessed the reflux grade in all 5 patients, which was then confirmed at cystography. In a patient with grade 1 unilateral reflux at cystography US, follow-up conventional cystography showed no reflux, which seems to confirm a higher sensitivity of the US technique. The total agreement of conventional and US findings seems to confirm the importance of the US method for the diagnosis and staging of vesicoureteral reflux.
