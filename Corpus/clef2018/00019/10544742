Management of ureteroceles with pyelo-ureteral duplication in children. Report of 64 cases. Sixty four cases of ureteroceles in a context of pyeloureteric duplication were reviewed. They were detected antenatally in 69% of cases. Upper pole nephroureterectomy was performed as first-line procedure in 32 cases. In 37.5% of cases, this procedure was followed by lower tract reconstruction, essentially because of symptomatic reflux in the inferior renal pelvis. Complete renal and vesical reconstruction was performed as the first-line procedure in 6 cases. An ureteropelvic anastomosis allowed preservation of the superior renal pelvis in 4 cases, including one case with secondary lower tract reconstruction. Intravesical reimplantation of the two ureters was performed in 8 cases. Primary endoscopic opening of the ureterocele was performed in 10 cases and complementary surgery was required in 7 cases. Other procedures were used more rarely: temporary ureterostomy, nephrostomy, resection of the protruding dome of a cecoureterocele. Current management is usually neonatal. The first step consists of prevention of infection. The therapeutic approach depends on the quality of the superior renal pelvis assessed by DMSA renal scintigraphy. Immediate complete reconstruction of the kidney and bladder is now rarely indicated. When the superior renal pelvis is not functional, resection should be considered with aspiration of the ureterocele. A complementary bladder procedure is required in some cases (40% in our series) to treat symptomatic reflux in the inferior renal pelvis. When the superior renal pelvis is functional, ureteropelvic anastomosis is a good solution, especially when the superior ureter is very large and poorly functional, but endoscopic opening of the ureterocele can also be proposed, which may need to be followed be intravesical reconstruction.
