Bladder with non-coordinated voiding: urodynamics and clinical correlations. 25 children (female) with urodynamically proven non-coordinated voiding were followed prospectively. The objective was to study the changes of urodynamic pattern and its clinical correlation after voiding reeducation and pharmacological treatment. All patients presented with urinary tract infections and voiding disfunction symptoms. 5 children had vesicoureteral reflux on voiding cystography and 10 patients had established scars on DMSA scan at initial presentation. Urodynamic study showed constriction of the urinary sphincter during voiding and increase of post-voiding residual urine volume in all children, with bladder instability 20 (80%). Treatment consisted of voiding reeducation, anticholinergics, antibiotic prophylaxis and muscle relaxants. The mean of follow-up was 22 months. Clinical remission occurred prior to urodynamic remission in all girls. Clinical recurrence was observed in 2 girls after cessation of treatment prior to normalization of urodynamic pattern. Non-coordinated voiding should be diagnosed and treated at pediatric age to avoid its possible progression to renal failure in other period of life.
