The cause of recurrent ureteral obstruction. A clinical analysis was performed in 88 patients with ureteral obstruction. Causes having made the origination of recurrent ureteral obstruction occur were stricture (n = 59) and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Origination of the stricture of the ureter was caused by scar and sclerotic changes in its wall and neoimplanted ostium. Causes of VUR origination included surgical techniques that do not envisage creation of antireflux defence for the ureter and insufficiently complete removal of the pathology at the supra- and infravesical levels. Causes of unsatisfactory results of treatment of megaureter after ileoplastics of the ureter included neglect of creation of antireflux mechanisms of defence for the upper urinary tract, ischemia of distal segments of transplants and of the ureter.
