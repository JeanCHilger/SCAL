Extensive surgery on the trigone for complete ureteral duplication does not cause incontinence or voiding problems. To evaluate whether extensive trigonal surgery for duplicated kidneys is harmful for later bladder and urethral function.Of 201 surgically treated children with kidney and ureteral duplication, 145 were followed up for at least 1 year. The mean follow-up was 5 years (range 1 to 15), and all patients were at least 7 years old at the date of their last follow-up visit. Trigone surgery was performed in 105 children bilateral trigonal surgery in 26, unroofing in 25, and total excision in 5. On all later consultations, the presence of infection, voiding habits, continence pattern, and ultrasound findings for residual urine volume and kidney function were noted. Children with recurrent urinary tract infection or dysfunctional voiding for more than 2 years underwent a urodynamic examination.Nine children, of whom five were boys, had nocturnal enuresis only. Eight patients had day and nighttime wetting. Seven of the 8 patients had recurrent urinary infections urodynamic evaluation revealed a high compliance (with residual urine) in three of these children and four had detrusor instability. One girl had an irregular bladder neck, with stress incontinence. All reflux, whether surgically or conservatively treated and also three of four occurring de novo, disappeared within 1 year after surgery. In the group without voiding dysfunctions, seven cystitis and five pyelonephritis attacks occurred.Neither extensive trigonal surgery nor pre-existing trigonal deformation by ureteroceles provokes later bladder dysfunction.
