Echo-enhanced ultrasound voiding cystography in children: a new approach. The development of echo-enhancing agents has significantly improved the detection of the movement of fluid within the urinary tract by ultrasonography (US). The purpose of our study was to compare ultrasound voiding cystography (USVC) for the detection of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in children with direct radionuclide voiding cystography (DRVC). Ninety-nine children, aged 1.1-12.3 years, with 198 potentially refluxing units, were investigated simultaneously by DRVC and USVC. The indications for cystography were urinary tract infection, follow-up of a previously detected VUR, and screening of siblings of children with VUR. During the investigation an echo-enhancing agent (Levovist) was administered intravesically through a catheter already in place for the DRVC. The movement of both agents, radiotracer and Levovist, was registered simultaneously by a computerized gamma camera and US, respectively. The results were analyzed with DRVC representing the reference diagnostic test. The overall sensitivity and specificity of USVC for the detection of VUR were 79% and 92%, respectively. USVC may represent a reliable diagnostic tool for the detection and follow-up of VUR in children.
