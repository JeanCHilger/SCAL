Paediatric urinary tract infection and the necessity of complete urological imaging. To evaluate voiding cysto-urethrography (VCUG) in assessing children with urinary tract infection (UTI) when renal/bladder ultrasonography and renal scintigraphy show no abnormality.A total of 468 renal scintigrams taken in children for an indication of UTI between January 1996 and December 1998 were reviewed. The renal and bladder ultrasonograms of those children with a normal renal scan were then reviewed. Children with both normal renal scans and normal ultrasonography were then evaluated for the frequency and grade of vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) on VCUG.Of the 468 patients, 453 (97%) had complete imaging studies 152 of the children evaluated had normal renal scans, of whom 101 had a normal renal ultrasonogram. Twenty-three (23%) children with both a normal renal scan and renal/bladder ultrasonogram showed VUR on VCUG, of whom 14 had bilateral VUR and 13 grade III or higher VUR.This study indicates that about 23% of patients may have significant VUR despite both a normal renal scan and ultrasonogram. Therefore, VCUG remains important in evaluating and managing children with UTI.
