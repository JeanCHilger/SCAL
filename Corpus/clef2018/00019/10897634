Renoscintigraphy applied with etylenedicysteine labeled with technetium 99m and SPECT technique as a method of examining kidneys in children with vesicoureteric reflux. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) can lead to renal parenchymal damage. Renal scarring is an important cause of chronic renal failure and hypertension in children. The significance of possible effects determines the necessity of early diagnosis of urinary tract pathology. The aim of the paper was to evaluate the morphology and function of kidneys with VUR using selected radioisotope techniques, and to compare the sensitivity of planar technique and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) technique in detection of renal scarring. In 45 children with VUR the following test were performed: ultrasonography, renoscintigraphy with technetium-99m-ethylenedicysteine (EC-Tc-99m) and technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA-Tc-99m) scintigraphy with planar and SPECT mode. Stage of VUR correlates with stage of cortical lesions estimated as a value of effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) in kidney, as well as scarring intensity in static scintigraphy. The use of SPECT increases sensitivity of examination for detection small, single scars. It seems that SPECT should be used more frequently in children in the group of scarring risk. That would allow for earlier diagnosis of renal scarring, enabling efficient treatment. Due to the correlation between ERPF and parameters obtained in DMSA scintigraphy, renoscintigraphy with EC-Tc-99m may be applied to monitor the progress of renal scarring.
