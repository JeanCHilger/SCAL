Laparoscopic excision of a rare type II choledochal cyst: case report and review of the literature. Although once considered rare, choledochal cysts now are extensively reported on and have an official anatomic classification. The authors report a case of a 4-year-old girl whom on routine abdominal ultrasound as follow-up for vesicoureteral reflux was found to have a choledochal cyst. Follow-up hepatobiliary scan together with the ultrasound findings was consistent with a rare type II choledochal cyst. On laparoscopy, a type II choledochal cyst was confirmed on dissection and amenable to laparoscopic excision. Intraoperative cholangiogram after excision showed normal remaining biliary anatomy. The patient was discharged the following day without delayed complications on follow-up visits. This report suggests a role for laparoscopic surgery in the definitive management of selected cases of choledochal cystic disease.
