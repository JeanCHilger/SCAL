Prediction of vesico-ureteric reflux in childhood urinary tract infection: a multivariate approach. In this study, independent predictors obtained from patient history, physical examination and laboratory results for vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) in children of 0-5 y with a first urinary tract infection (UTI) were assessed and the added value of renal ultrasound (US) investigated. Information was collected from children visiting the paediatric outpatient department with a first proven UTI, defined as a urine monoculture with > or = 10(5) organism/ml, with clinical symptoms and possible white cell count > or = 20 per high-power field of spun fresh urine. Children with neurologic bladder dysfunction were excluded. VUR was determined by voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and graded from I to V. The diagnostic value of predictors was judged using multivariate logistic modelling with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC area). A risk score was derived based on the regression coefficients of the independent predictors in the logistic model. In 140 children (51 boys and 89 girls) VUR was diagnosed in 37. Independent predictors for VUR were male gender, age, family history for uropathology, serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) and dilatation of the urinary tract on US. The ROC area of this model was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69-0.87). This prediction model identified 12% (95% CI: 7-18) of the patients without VUR without missing one case of VUR. If we used VUR > or = grade 3 as a threshold, the model assessed VUR to be absent in 34% (95% CI: 26-42).A prediction rule based on age, gender, family history, CRP and US results is useful in assessing the probability of VUR in the individual child with a first UTI and may help the physician to make decisions about performing additional imaging techniques. Prospective validation of the model in future patients, however, will be necessary before applying the rule in practice.
