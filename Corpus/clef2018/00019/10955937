Enhanced detection of vesicoureteric reflux with isotopic cystography. We compared the accuracy of isotope cystography (IC) and fluoroscopic cystourethrography (FC) in detecting vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in children. FC and IC were performed in 124 children, 56 boys and 68 girls, aged 1 month to 9.2 years (mean 2.1 years), admitted consecutively for suspected VUR over a 10-month period. VUR was diagnosed by one or both studies in 51 of 124 (41%) patients. The two methods were concordant for the detection of VUR in 84% of kidney-ureter units and in 93% for the detection or exclusion of severe VUR. IC detected VUR more accurately than FC, both when all grades of VUR were considered together (P=0.00001) and when only severe reflux was considered (P=0.004). VUR was missed by FC in 23 of 51 (45%) subjects. Of those 23, 12 had severe VUR detected on one side at least by IC. VUR was missed by IC in 3 subjects. IC is significantly more accurate than FC in the initial diagnosis of VUR, even of severe grade. IC is the method of choice for the first diagnosis of VUR. Boys with VUR diagnosed by IC also need FC to investigate for posterior urethral valves.
