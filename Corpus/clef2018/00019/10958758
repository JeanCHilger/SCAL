Are postoperative studies justified after extravescial ureteral reimplantation? We evaluated the usefulness of postoperative imaging studies after extravesical ureteroneocystostomy and identified patient subsets in which these studies are necessary.Records of 438 patients who had undergone extravesical ureteroneocystostomy from 1991 to 1997 were reviewed retrospectively. Study inclusion criterion was primary reflux with at least 1 year of postoperative followup. Grades I to III reflux were defined as low, and grades IV and V were defined as high. All patients were on prophylactic antibiotics. Evaluation included ultrasound and a voiding cystourethrogram 3 months postoperatively, and if reflux persisted the studies were repeated at 12 months.A total of 438 patients (723 renal units) underwent extravesical ureteral reimplantation. At 3 months the procedure was successful in 93.2% of ureters (91.3% patients), and at 12 months the success rate increased to 97.9% of ureters (95.4% patients). There were 49 renal units in 38 cases that were refluxing at 3 months, 11 of which were contralateral. At 12 months reflux resolved spontaneously in 20 of 38 ipsilateral and 8 of 11 contralateral ureters. Of the remaining 18 ipsilateral units reflux was high grade preoperatively in 12 and persisted postoperatively in 4. There was a statistically significant difference in the success rate at 1 year between high (94%) versus low (99%) grade reflux (p = 0.007). Age and preoperative bladder function did not significantly affect the success rates but males had a lower success rate. Hydronephrosis was noted in 7.2% of ureters at 6 weeks and in only 0.005% at 12 months.Extravesical reimplantation is successful in treating vesicoureteral reflux. Postoperative voiding cystourethrogram should be reserved for high grade reflux. Limiting these studies will help reduce patient discomfort and the cost of treatment.
