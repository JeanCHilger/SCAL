Association of angiotensin I converting enzyme gene polymorphism with reflux nephropathy in children. Deletion polymorphism of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been studied as a risk factor in various cardiovascular diseases and chronic nephropathies. Perturbation of local and systemic renin-angiotensin systems is one of the possible mechanisms of the progression of reflux nephropathy. In this study, the implication of ACE gene polymorphism in renal scarring and deterioration of renal function was analyzed in 66 children with vesicoureteral reflux. The genotype for the polymorphism was determined by PCR, and renal scar was identified by (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scan. The allelic frequency of the deletion polymorphism showed no significant difference either between patients with normal renal function and those with decreased renal function or between patients with renal scar and those without. We conclude that deletion polymorphism of ACE gene, as an independent variable, is not associated with reflux nephropathy in children with vesicoureteral reflux.
