Clinical experience with 99mTc-DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid), a new renal-imaging agent. Results are reported from the clinical evaluation of a new radiopharmaceutical for renal imaging, 99mTc-DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid). Sixty-five patients were studied and six of these patients' scintiphotos are illustrated. The physical characteristics of 99mTc and the mercurial-like kinetics of the chelate produced high-resolution scintiphotos of the renal parenchyma in patients of all ages and with a variety of disease entities. The commercial availability of the material in kit form permits its usage in all nuclear medicine facilities.
