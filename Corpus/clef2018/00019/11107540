Long-term follow-up of children with surgically treated primary vesicouretral reflux. We reviewed the symptoms of hypertension and proteinuria and evaluated the renal function in patients aged 15 and over with surgically treated primary vesicoureteral reflux. Twenty-two patients were enrolled in this study. There were no patients with hypertension except one patient with proteinuria. The extraction factor by Heyman's method in these patients tended to increase with age at operation and decrease with the grade of reflux at operation. There findings suggest that long-term follow-up is particularly essential to patients who had severe reflux and underwent anti-reflux surgery in the early stage of life.
