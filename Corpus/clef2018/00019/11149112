Primary vesicoureteric reflux and renal damage in the first year of life. We retrospectively examined 93 children (47M/46F) with primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) followed for a mean period of 3.5 years. They were divided into two groups. Group A included 34 babies (25M/9F) with a prenatal diagnosis of pelvic dilatation. Mean age at presentation was 12 days and no urinary tract infection (UTI) occurred before our first examination. VUR was unilateral in 21 (62%) patients and bilateral in 13 (38%). It was mild (grades I-III) in 12 (25%) refluxing renal units (RRU) and severe (grades IV-V) in 35 (75%). Renal damage (RD) was present, at diagnosis, in 40 (85%) RRU. There was a greater prevalence of abnormal kidneys in male units (88%) than in female units (75%). Group B included 59 infants (22M/37F) less than 1 year old with UTI. The mean age at first examination was 7.6 months. VUR was unilateral in 32 (54%) infants and bilateral in 27 (46%), mild in 60 (70%) RRU and severe in 26 (30%). At diagnosis, 54 (63%) RRU presented RD, which was more common in females (66%) than in males (44%). Our study confirms that primary VUR associated with prenatal hydronephrosis usually affects males and is severe. VUR diagnosed after UTI, instead, is more common in females and is frequently mild. Although in the first type of reflux RD is often present at diagnosis, then probably congenital, it may always progress after UTI hence the importance of early diagnosis and careful follow-up in each infant with primary VUR.
