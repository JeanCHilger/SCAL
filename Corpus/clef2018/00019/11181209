Endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux. We report our experience of the endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteric reflux in children by submucosal injection of polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon).From April 1995 to September 1999 we treated 30 cases of vesicoureteric reflux in 22 children aged 19 months to 8 years. All the children underwent general anesthesia and subureteric injection of polytetrafluoroethylene paste with a pediatric cystoscope. Patients were discharged the day of the operation and were followed-up 15 days, six months and one year postoperatively with ultrasound and radionuclide cystography. When reflux persisted, the treatment was repeated.Open surgery was performed in one patient with reflux after two repeat injections. Another patient underwent a second, successful, injection. The overall success rate with endoscopic treatment was 96.5% and only one injection was required in 93.1%. None of the patients required hospitalization because of complications due to the operation or the endoscopic technique.We consider submucosal injection of Teflon to be a first-line technique in the treatment of vesicoureteric reflux in children. The success rate is similar to that of open surgery but with endoscopic treatment morbidity and costs are lower and hospital stay is shorter.
