Prognosis in vesicoureteral reflux. To emphasise the importance of early diagnosis of Vesicoureteric Reflux (VUR) in prevention of renal failure.General testing of children was followed by micturating cystourethrography (MCGU) for those with the diagnosis of urinary-tract infection. In cases where high level of VUR was determined, satic nuclear medicine scanning was performed using an isotope-labeled substance (e.g. DMSA).31 nephrology department patients were followed: 29 girls, 2 boys ages 0-15. MCGU showed 33 kidneys with reflux. 13 of the patients had reflux in the first or second degree. 7 patients showed reflux of the 2-3 degree while 13 had a high degree of reflux. Among the children under 7 years of age, total of 16 kidneys, DMSA showed various degrees of damage to the paranhaim and the development of scars.After the VUR has been diagnosed, it is difficult to predict whether scarring will take place. The possibility of scarring is higher among younger children when appropriate therapeutic modalities are not identified.
