Outcome of patients with prenatally detected duplex system ureterocele natural history of those managed expectantly. We assessed the outcome of patients treated for prenatally detected duplex system ureterocele with particular reference to those treated expectantly.We reviewed the records of 52 consecutive patients treated between 1984 and 1999 with a median followup of 8 years (range 1 to 16.2).Of the 38 patients who underwent surgical treatment 13 subsequently required unplanned secondary procedures. A total of 14 cases satisfying currently defined criteria, including less than 10% upper renal pole function, an unobstructed lower pole (absent nonrefluxing hydroureteronephrosis), lower pole vesicoureteral reflux not exceeding grade III and unobstructed bladder outflow, were managed expectantly with a median followup of 8 years (range 1.6 to 12.8). In this group of patients prophylactic antibiotics were routinely prescribed until the completion of toilet training or age 5 years in those with persistent reflux on repeat cystography. None has required surgery or had symptoms or urinary infection. In 6 cases followup ultrasonography showed substantial resolution of upper pole hydronephrosis with a collapsed ureterocele. Furthermore, 7 of the 38 patients who underwent surgical treatment early in our series would have been treated expectantly had the current criteria been applied.In 14 of the 52 patients (approximately 27%) with prenatally detected duplex system ureterocele the natural history of the complaint is essentially benign within the currently available followup.
