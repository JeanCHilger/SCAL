The application of appendiceal Mitrofanoff principle to Stanford pouch. The present paper reports the functional aspects of a novel continent cutaneous reservoir.A continent cutaneous reservoir was constructed by the application of appendiceal Mitrofanoff principle to Stanford pouch in four male and three female patients between 1995-1998 in our clinic. The mean age of the patients was 45.6 years (7-67 years) and the etiological factor was carcinoma of the bladder in four, interstitial cystitis in one and extrophy-epispadias complex in two cases. Patients were followed with arterial blood gas determination, serum biochemistry, urinalysis and urine culture at postoperative 3 weeks and by 3-month intervals thereafter. Additionally, pouch graphy, abdominal ultrasonography and urodynamic tests were performed every 6 months.After the operation all the patients were continent. Stoma was transferred from the umbilicus to the right lower quadrant in one case (14.3%) because of difficulty in catheterisation. Pouch graphy at postoperative 6 months revealed low-grade vesicoureteral reflux in two (28.6%) patients and one (14.3%) of them required suppressive antibiotic therapy because of pyelonephritis episodes. Another patient developed hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and needed oral alkaline supplementation. The mean pouch capacity measured at postoperative 6 months was 423 (350-550) ml and the mean end-filling pressure was found as 21 (18-25) cmH2O. After a mean follow-up period of 37 (18-45) months all the patients remained continent and stable.The continent cutaneous reservoir presented herein is our alternative to orthotopic neobladder in female patients undergoing radical cystectomy. It also provided continence as well as good quality of life in patients with extrophy-epispadias complex and male patients after radical cystectomy and urethrectomy.
