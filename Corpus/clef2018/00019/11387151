Vesicoureteric reflux and renal scarring in Chinese children. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and renal scarring are commonly found in children with urinary tract infection (UTI). The prevalence of VUR and scarring may vary between racial groups. There are no published data on the prevalence of VUR and scarring in Chinese children with UTI. A retrospective, single-institution study was made of Hong Kong Chinese children aged less than 5 years with a documented UTI investigated by both micturating cystourethrography and dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy. VUR was identified in 39% of 93 Chinese children with UTI. Renal scarring was present in 28% of boys, which is comparable with published data on Western children. Scarring appears to be less common in Chinese girls with UTI (11%) than in Western girls (30-38% from published data), and its severity is poorly related to VUR grade. There is a significant dependency relationship between grade of VUR and degree of scarring in Chinese boys (p < 0.05). In conclusion, renal scarring appears to be relatively uncommon in Chinese girls. The correlation between grade of VUR and degree of scarring in Chinese boys suggests a relationship, but provides no evidence about the direction of causation.
