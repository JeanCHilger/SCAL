Angiotensin converting enzyme gene polymorphism in primary vesicoureteral reflux. We studied the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene in 78 patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), and examined renal function by dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) renoscintigraphy and diethylenetriamine-penta-acetic acid (DTPA) renogram in each genotype. Patients were classified into three genotypes according to the ACE gene I/D polymorphisms: 32 in II genotype, 36 in ID, and 10 in DD. The incidence of presumably congenital unilateral small kidneys was high in DD patients (70%). Glomerular filtration rate obtained from DTPA renogram was 120.7+/-35.7 ml/min (expressed as mean+/-SD) in II genotype, 111.7+/-33.3 in ID, and 88.0+/-18.0 in DD. The total quantitative DMSA tracer uptake of both kidneys was also low in patients with the D allele. This study shows that the D allele of ACE gene is closely related to small congenital kidneys with refluxing ureters in patients with primary VUR, and in accordance with previous reports, this allele is also related to the progression of reflux nephropathy.
