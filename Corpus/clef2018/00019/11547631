Current aspects in the treatment of vesicoureteral reflux. Analysis of our experience. We have evaluated 465 patients diagnosed as having vesicoureteral reflux between 1975 and 2000 in our Department. Three hundred cases were treated surgically and 165 received submucosal injection of Teflon as endoscopic procedure. Since 1991, when we introduced the endoscopic technique in our Department, 31 patients required open surgery. The work includes the study of the diagnostic procedures performed in the patients, such as ultrasonography, voiding cystouretrography and renal isotopic gammagraphy. We focused on these patients treated endoscopically. The overall success rate was 97.6% with surgical techniques. Reflux was resolved using the endoscopic procedure in 76% after first injection, 93% after second and 96% after third. We conclude that the submucosal injection of Teflon is an appropriate treatment for most cases of vesicoureteral reflux. The non-invasive procedure requirement, lack of adverse effects and minimal morbidity make it an alternative to medical treatment and open surgery. The future is the search for new biocompatible materials with tissue-augmenting properties as Teflon.
