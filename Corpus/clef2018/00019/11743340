Outcome of sibling vesicoureteral reflux. We determine the efficacy of a prospective screening analysis of an asymptomatic sibling of patients with reflux.A total of 78 siblings of patients with reflux were evaluated and 40 (51%) had reflux. The resolution rate and necessity for surgical intervention were evaluated.A total of 40 patients had vesicoureteral reflux, including grade I in 12, II in 33, III in 19 and IV in 1. No patient had gross renal scar on ultrasound or renal pelvis dysmorphism on voiding cystourethrogram. Treatment consisted of prophylactic antibiotics in all. One patient required surgical correction for breakthrough urinary tract infection. Followup was available in 31 patients, of whom reflux resolved completely with medical management in 26. Reflux was downgraded in 4 patients. Of the patients in whom reflux resolved completely grades I to II vesicoureteral reflux were in 18, and II to IV in 8. Mean time to resolution was 15.6 months.The incidence of sibling reflux is significant. However, grade specific time to resolution appears to be decreased compared to primary reflux diagnosed after urinary tract infection. Furthermore, the incidence of renal damage appears to be decreased compared to "traditional" reflux. Although it is reasonable to recommend screening, we suggest that sibling reflux may follow a more benign course.
