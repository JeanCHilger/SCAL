Extravesical common sheath detrusorrhaphy (ureteroneocystotomy) and reflux in duplicated collecting systems. Various surgical approaches have been used for treatment of vesicoureteral reflux in uncomplicated duplicated collecting systems. We retrospectively evaluated our success with extravesical common sheath detrusorrhaphy in such a setting.Between 1990 and 1997, unilateral and bilateral extravesical nondismembered detrusorrhaphy was performed in 24 and 19 patients, respectively, with 51 duplicated collecting systems, including 8 bilateral, for management of vesicoureteral reflux. Vesicoureteral reflux was present in the moieties of ipsilateral duplicated kidney in 2 patients, and bilateral reimplantation was performed in 2 who had a history of contralateral vesicoureteral reflux that resolved. Patient age ranged from 1 to 16 years (median 3.67). Followup ranged from 36 to 114 months (median 86), and included cystourethrography and renal ultrasound.Vesicoureteral reflux resolved in all but 1 duplicated renal moiety, which was a success rate of 98%. In this patient the persistent reflux resolved by 16 months postoperatively on conservative treatment. There were no intraoperative complications and all patients resumed spontaneous voiding before discharge home. No postoperative obstruction of the involved kidney or de novo contralateral reflux developed in any patient.Common sheath ureteral reimplantation with extravesical detrusorrhaphy can be successfully used to treat vesicoureteral reflux in uncomplicated duplicated collecting systems. This approach demonstrates excellent long-term surgical outcome with minimal perioperative morbidity.
