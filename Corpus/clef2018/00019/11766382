A pediatric case of acute focal bacterial nephritis comparison with the reports in Japanese child cases. We report an 8-year-old boy with acute focal bacterial nephritis (AFBN). At the age of 3 months, he had a history of urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux. He was admitted to our hospital because of high fever and costovertebral angle pain. Although acute pyelonephritis was suspected, neither pyuria nor cultures of blood and urine were positive. An initial ultrasonogram (US) of his kidneys was normal except for bilateral hydronephrosis. Two days later, however, a computed tomography (CT) revealed a poorly enhanced mass in the upper pole of the right kidney. Similar findings were also observed by US. Under the diagnosis of AFBN, he received antibiotics for 3 weeks. Voiding cystourethrogram showed both-sided vesicoureteral reflux and he underwent an operation. At present the mass of the kidney still remains, albeit its size tends to decrease. We suggest that an early examination of US or enhanced CT is necessary in cases with fever of unknown origin, considering the possibility of AFBN even if neither pyuria nor cultures of urine are positive.
