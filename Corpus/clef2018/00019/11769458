Hydronephrosis: comparison of conservative and surgical treatment. Early diagnosis and identification of adequate treatment of children with hydronephrosis.Routine ultrasound testing was followed by standard urography and micturacion cystouretrogam among those identified with hydronephrosis.We showed 48 children among whom the ultrasound detected hydronephrosis of various degrees. First group consists of patients with non-obstructive hydronephrosis 18 patients (37.5%) the highest percentage among girls (88.3%), ages 1-5. The cause of hydronephrosis is the vesicoureteral reflux. The second group with obstructive hydronephrosis consists of 30 patients (62.5%), only one of them had obstruction ureterovesical junction. Neonatal boys dominate in this group. 50% of patients from both groups were surgically treated.Wide use of ultrasound provided for a significant improvement in diagnosis of urinary-tract anomalies.
