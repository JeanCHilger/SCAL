Dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer implantation for vesico-ureteral reflux: a randomized comparison with antibiotic prophylaxis. Dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (Dx/HA) copolymer has favorable properties for endoscopic treatment of vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR). This open, randomized study was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of Dx/HA copolymer with antibiotic prophylaxis in children with VUR.Children >1 year of age with VUR grade II to IV (confirmed by voiding cysto-urethrogram) received endoscopic treatment with Dx/HA copolymer (n = 40) or 12 months of antibiotic prophylaxis (n = 21). Patients in the latter group with reflux grade >or=II at month 3 received a second implantation. All patients were reassessed by voiding cysto-urethrogram at month 12. Scintigraphy and ultrasound were performed to investigate renal status.At month 12, 69% of patients in the Dx/HA copolymer group had reflux grade <or=I bilaterally, compared with 38% in the antibiotic group (P =.029). Of patients with reflux grade <or=I at month 3, 89% showed a sustained response at month 12. One serious adverse event was reported in the antibiotic prophylaxis group, but this was not attributed to study treatment. No other adverse events occurred.Endoscopic treatment with Dx/HA copolymer was more effective than antibiotic prophylaxis in alleviating childhood VUR, and there were no safety concerns with either treatment.
