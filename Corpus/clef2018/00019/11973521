Isolated antenatal pyelic dilatation: postnatal follow-up and care for vesico-ureteral reflux. To assess the risk of aneuploidia in case of isolated antenatal pyelic dilatation and to detail urological care for these children.Prenatal and postnatal follow-up was analyzed in 350 cases.The overall rate of chromosome anomalies was 1.3%. Trisomy 21 was found alone in one case (0.3%). The sex ratio was 26% girls and 74% boys. Vesico-ureteral reflux was similar in both sexes (13%).The question of proposing karyotyping in case of isolated pyelic dilatation remains unsolved because minimal subjective signs such as slightly excessive amniotic fluid can completely change the assessment of the risk of aneuploidia. The frequency of postnatal vesico-ureteral reflux associated with prenatal pyelic dilatation warrants complete prenatal ultrasound screening.
