Feasibility of MR urography in neonates and infants with anomalies of the upper urinary tract. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic potential of dynamic MR urography (MRU) in neonates and infants with sonographically detected abnormalities of the upper urinary tract. Thirty infants (age range 5 days to 3 years, mean age 7.9 months male:female: 22:8) underwent MRU using T2 and contrast-enhanced dynamic T1-weighted sequences. The results were compared with the findings of ultrasound ( n=30), intravenous urography (IVU, n=19) and/or scintigraphy ( n=25) based on the criteria suggestive of obstructive uropathy. Oral sedation was sufficient to perform MRU with diagnostic quality in 20 of 21 patients younger than 1 year
