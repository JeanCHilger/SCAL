Future expectations--what paediatric nephrologists and urologists await from paediatric uroradiology. Cooperation between paediatric nephrology/urology and paediatric radiology is essential for timely and correct diagnosis and therapy of kidney and urinary tract disorders. We need the direct contact between doctors before or after investigations, interdisciplinary discussions, and rapid access to the images. This should lead to optimal settings for investigations, a reduction of radiation burden and the number of investigations, and further improvement in the management of patients. Modern sonography including colour Doppler sonography, amplitude-coded Doppler sonography, and eventually 3D-ultrasound is and will be the method of choice as the basic, non-invasive investigation. These investigations should become the routine in all institutions. Refinement and standardisation of already established investigations are needed. Recently introduced investigations, like MRI, will have to show their impact on future diagnostic imaging. Future introduction of new non-invasive methods is welcome, e.g. to correctly diagnose vesicoureteral reflux without catheterisation/puncture of the bladder.
