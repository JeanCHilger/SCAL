Potential of modern sonographic techniques in paediatric uroradiology. To describe the potential of modern sonographic techniques in paediatric uroradiology.Ultrasound (US)-now being the primary imaging tool-has revolutionised imaging diagnostic in the urinary tract. Constant developments and technical refinements have secured the role of US in uroradiology. Colour Doppler Sonography (CDS) and innovative applications such as the transperineal approach or application of m-mode US to the urinary tract have helped to develop US from just a basic tool to a sophisticated and respected method. The ongoing introduction of new and even more sophisticated methods further enhance the sonographic potential, which shall be demonstrated by a more detailed discussion of these methods.Harmonic imaging, extended field of view US, amplitude coded CDS, echo-enhanced US, and three-dimensional US as the most recent new sonographic techniques are successfully applicable to paediatric urinary tract disease. They improve sonographic diagnosis in many conditions, such as detection of vesico-ureteral reflux, renal parenchymal volume assessment, comprehensive visualisation of hydronephrosis and complex pathology, evaluation of renal perfusional disturbances or defects, superior documentation with improved comparability for follow-up, or simply by offering clearer tissue delineation and differentiation.Modern US techniques are successfully applicable to neonates, infants, and children, further boosting the value of US in the paediatric urinary tract. However, as handling became more sophisticated, and artefacts have to be considered, modern urosonography became not only a more powerful, but also a more demanding method, with the need for expert knowledge and dedicated training.
