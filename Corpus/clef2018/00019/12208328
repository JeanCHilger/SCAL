Immature ureteric jet doppler patterns and urinary tract infection and vesicoureteric reflux in children. The Doppler waveform of the ureteric jet is the result of modification of ureteric peristalsis by an active sphincteric mechanism of the vesicoureteric junction (VUJ). The monophasic pattern is associated with immaturity. This study set out to see the correlation between this immature pattern with urinary tract infection (UTI) and vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in children. Ureteric jets of 241 healthy children and 98 children with UTI were studied. The monophasic pattern was found in 29% of healthy children overall, but varied greatly according to age. The monophasic pattern was virtually universal in the first 6 months of life, dropping to below 15% in late childhood. This immature pattern was more commonly seen in the UTI (73.5%) and VUR (90.5%) groups than in the healthy controls. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0005 for both). The persistence of this immature pattern was highly associated with UTI and VUR.
