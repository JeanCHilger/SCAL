Outcome of endoscopic treatment for vesicoureteral reflux in children using polydimethylsiloxane. We reviewed the outcome of subureteral injection of polydimethylsiloxane as a bulking agent for endoscopic treatment for vesicoureteral reflux in patients younger than 12 years.A total of 40 children (59 ureters) with primary grades II to IV vesicoureteral reflux were treated with a single subureteral injection from 1997 to 2001 and followed an average of 26 months (range 4 to 45). Results in 38 patients (55 ureteral units) were available for review. Each child underwent preoperative voiding cystourethrography, renal ultrasound, dimercapto-succinic acid scan and urine culture. Treatment was done on an outpatient basis. With the patient general anesthesia polydimethylsiloxane implant was injected transurethrally below the ureteral opening of the affected renal unit. Renal ultrasound at 1 week and voiding cystourethrography at 2 months were done to rule out obstruction at the injection site and/or persistent reflux, respectively. Cure was defined as absent vesicoureteral reflux on voiding cystourethrography 2 months after injection.After a single injection polydimethylsiloxane cured vesicoureteral reflux in 45 ureteral units (81.8%), while in 5 (9.1%) the condition was improved. The remaining 5 ureteral units (9.1%) showed no change in reflux grade. In 1 patient (1.9%) with unilateral grade IV vesicoureteral reflux contralateral reflux developed. None of the cured patients had recurrent reflux during followup. In 1 patient ureteral obstruction was successfully treated with ureteral reimplantation.Endoscopic subureteral injection of polydimethylsiloxane implant in children with primary grades II to IV vesicoureteral reflux appears to be an effective, safe and minimally invasive technique.
