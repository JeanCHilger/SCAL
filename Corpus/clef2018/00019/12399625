Urinary concentrations of alpha-1-microglobulin and albumin in patients with reflux nephropathy before and after puberty. We determined urinary concentrations of alpha(1)-microglobulin and albumin in 155 patients with reflux nephropathy including 72 prepubertal (48 males and 24 females) and 83 postpubertal patients (43 males and 40 females) to elucidate the effect of age and gender in the progression of renal damage. Vesicoureteral reflux was resolved in all patients at least two years before enrollment into this study. Renal scarring was diagnosed with (99m)technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan. More severe renal scarring was found predominantly in male compared to female patients. Urinary alpha(1)-microglobulin levels were significantly lower in postpubertal female patients (mean +/- SD: 1.59 +/- 1.02 mg/g creatinine) than in prepubertal males and females (3.32 +/- 3.53 and 4.06 +/- 4, respectively p < 0.007 and p < 0.002, respectively), and in postpubertal males (3.69 +/- 2.6
