Risk factors for permanent kidney damage in children with urinary tract infection. In children, urinary tract infection (UTI) is a very common disease, and can cause permanent kidney damage.To determine risk factors for permanent kidney damage, in children with UTI.In 337 children with UTI (237 female, mean age 4.2 years) a static renal scintigraphy was performed to assess the presence of permanent kidney damage. The history of vesicoureteral reflux and number of episodes of UTI was obtained.One hundred three children had a history of one episode of infection and the rest had recurrent infections. Permanent kidney damage was observed in 161 children (48%). This damage was observed in 39% of children of less than one year of age, in 43% of children aged 1 to 5 years of age and in 58% of children older than 5 years (p = 0.02). Sixty three percent of 122 children with vesicoureteral reflux had permanent kidney damage, compared with 27% of children without this condition (p < 0.001). Likewise, damage was observed in 36% of children with one episode of infection and 47% of children with recurrent infections (p < 0.01). No gender differences were observed.Vesicoureteral reflux, recurrence of UTI and age are associated with permanent renal damage in children with UTI.
