Predicting factors of vesicoureteral evolution in children. Despite the large number of children with reflux, management among urologists is still controversial. One of the most debated aspects is the choice between observation treatment or surgical treatment.We assessed the natural course of children with vesico-ureteral reflux in the period 1990-1995, to correlate factors and identify patients with high risk of renal damage. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of 80 children with vesicoureteral reflux. Thirty-two were diagnosed during prenatal ultrasound scan. In the other cases urologic evaluation was requested because of urinary tract infections. The following data were analyzed: medical records, diagnostic and follow-up cystogram, renal imaging, medical therapy or surgical treatment carried out according to the reflux grade, diagnostic age, congenital reflux nephropathy or postnatal acquired scarring, voiding patterns, spontaneous resolution during medical management. Follow up ranged from 5 to 10 years.Vesicoureteral reflux resolved spontaneously in 29 patients: 25 were affected from moderate reflux, 4 from IV grade reflux. Surgical correction was carried out in 32 patients. Endoscopic treatment was performed in 25. Twenty-two children are still receiving prophylaxis and 12 were lost to follow-up. Congenital renal pathology correlate with poor outcome.The conclusion is drawn that there is a wide clinical variability in children with vescicoureteral reflux. The most important is host's susceptibility to urinary tract infection, but the severity of reflux, age of patients and congenital reflux nephropathy influence prognosis and long-term outcome.
