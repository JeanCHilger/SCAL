Laparoscopic correction of vesicoureteral reflux using the Lich-Gregoir technique: initial experience and technical aspects. We report two female cases with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) who underwent laparoscopic correction of VUR by the Lich-Gregoir technique. One patient was 10 years of age, with international grade III reflux of the left ureter the other was 27 years of age, with grade II reflux of the right ureter. The respective operating times were 6 h 40 min and 6 h 10 min. There were no complications during surgery. Although post-surgical ultrasonography revealed mild hydronephrosis in the adult patient, the condition resolved spontaneously 2 months after surgery. The disappearance of reflux was confirmed in both cases by voiding cystography 6 months after surgery.
