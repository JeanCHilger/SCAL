Renal parenchymal damage in sibling vesicoureteric reflux. To compare the incidence of renal damage in siblings of patients with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) who presented with a documented history of urinary tract infection (UTI) with asymptomatic siblings who were diagnosed with reflux during a screening programme for hereditary VUR.Medical and radiological records of the VUR patients (1990-2000) were examined for age, gender, mode of presentation, reflux grade and renal damage.VUR was noted in 226 siblings (352 ureters) in 107 families. Of the 119 siblings of index patients, 64 were investigated for a documented UTI and 55 with no history of UTI were detected during screening for sibling reflux. Dimercaptosuccinic acid scan revealed reflux nephropathy in 25 (26%) of the 97 renal refluxing units (RRU) of siblings who presented with a UTI and in 6 (7%) of the 89 RRU of asymptomatic siblings who underwent screening voiding cystourethrography (p=0.0006). Mild renal damage was present in 20 (21%) RRU of siblings with UTI and in 2 (2%) RRU of the screened siblings (p < 0.001). Moderate to severe renal damage was present in 5 (5%) RRU of siblings with UTI and in 4 (4%) RRU of the screened siblings (p > 0.05).This study demonstrated that the incidence of mild renal scarring was much higher in siblings who presented with UTI than in asymptomatic siblings. However, the incidence of moderate and severe renal scarring among asymptomatic siblings was comparable to that in siblings with VUR and UTI.
