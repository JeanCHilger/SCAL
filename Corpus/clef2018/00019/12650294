Risk factors in the development of early technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy lesions during first urinary tract infection in children. To establish the variables that correlate with uptake defects in dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy performed in the acute phase of a first episode of urinary tract infection (UTI).A prospective observational study was conducted in a cohort of 158 consecutive children with a first episode of symptomatic UTI. The therapeutic delay time (TDT) was recorded. DMSA scintigraphy was performed in all children and voiding cystourethrography in 150 of them.85% of the patients were younger than 2 y. Mean TDT was 33.5 h. The aetiological agent was Escherichia coli in 140 children. DMSA scintigraphy was normal in 81. Vesicoureteric reflux was detected in 33. After a multivariate logistic regression analysis the following variables were retained in the final model: TDT > or = 48 h, growth of bacteria other than E. coli, percentage of polymorphonuclear cells > or = 60% and C-reactive protein > or = 30 mg l(-1).TDT > or = 48 h, bacteria other than E. coli, percentage of polymorphonuclear cells > or = 60% and CRP > or = 30 mg l(-1) influence the findings detected in the DMSA scintigraphy performed in the acute phase of a first episode of UTI.
