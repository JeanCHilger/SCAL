Vesicoureteric reflux in Kuwaiti children with first febrile urinary tract infection. The prevalence of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in children with urinary tract infection (UTI) varies among different racial groups. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of VUR and associated renal changes in a group of Arab Kuwaiti children with their first documented febrile UTI and to compare our findings with those reported from other racial groups. One hundred and seventy-four children (38 males and 136 females) fulfilled the study criteria and were divided into three age groups (<1 year, 1-5 years, and >5 years). Patients in each group had both micturating cystourethrography (MCUG) and 99m-Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan after diagnosis. VUR was detected in 39 children (22%). Two-thirds of cases had mild reflux (grade I and II). Females ( n=32) had more reflux than males ( n=7) (24% vs. 18%). Sixty-three patients (36%) had abnormal (DMSA) renal scans (acute pyelonephritis [AP] or renal scars). Of these, 79% were children below 5 years. Abnormal DMSA scans were found in 4 of 38 males (11%) versus 59 of 136 females (43%). Abnormal scans in children with VUR were seen in 1 of 7 males (14%) versus 19 of 32 females (59%). In total, the combination of abnormal scan with VUR occurred in 1 of 38 males (3%) and in 19 of 136 females (14%), whereas abnormal scan without demonstrable VUR was seen in 3 of 38 males (8%) versus 40 of 136 females (29%). Our data showed that the frequency of VUR in Arab Kuwaiti children with febrile UTI is midway between Caucasian and other racial groups. In this study, males had a lower-risk profile than females, the latter having a higher rate of reflux as well as a higher rate of abnormal DMSA scans, irrespective of demonstrable VUR.
