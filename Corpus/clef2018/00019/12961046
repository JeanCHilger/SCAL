Giant prostatic utricle (utriculus masculinis): diagnostic imaging and surgical implications. The prostatic utricle is an embryological remnant of the Mullerian duct system. It is often revealed incidentally on voiding cystourethrography in young males undergoing evaluation for possible vesicoureteral reflux. We present the case of a very large prostatic utricle found incidentally on ultrasound evaluation in a 4-year-old boy with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections.
