Comparison of DMSA scintigraphy with intravenous urography for the detection of renal scarring and its correlation with vesicoureteric reflux. A series of 208 patients was prospectively assessed for reflux nephropathy by intravenous urography (IVU) and 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) scintigraphy. All patients were studied at least 3 months after their most recent urinary tract infection and micturating cystourethrography (MCU) was performed prior to the scintigraphic studies. DMSA scintigraphy detected significantly more cortical abnormalities than did IVU. There was also a correlation between cortical abnormalities in the DMSA studies and the degree of reflux on MCU. The validity of DMSA as a cortical imaging agent is evaluated and the histological evidence for its efficacy derived from the animal model is reviewed, lending weight to its establishment as the "gold standard" for renal cortical scarring.
