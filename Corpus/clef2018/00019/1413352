Vesicoureteral reflux in children with and without a history of urinary tract infection: a comparative analysis. Eighty-eight children who were discovered to have vesicoureteral reflux were prospectively studied over a two-year period. Two groups were compared: 49 who presented with a urinary tract infection and 39 who were identified through prospective screening. Based on the distribution of grade and the presence of parenchymal scarring, the severity of vesicoureteral reflux was comparable in the two groups. Of note, more males with reflux were identified in the noninfected group, whereas sex distribution was almost equal in the infected group. Ultrasound alone was found to be highly inaccurate in identifying reflux or parenchymal changes. In conclusion, screening of at-risk groups of children without a history of urinary tract infection may identify patients with clinically significant vesicoureteral reflux.
