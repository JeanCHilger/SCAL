Treatment of vesicoureteral reflux by endoscopic injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic Acid copolymer: preliminary results. Endoscopic subureteral injection of tissue augmenting substances has become an established alternative to long-term antibiotic prophylaxis and open surgery for the management of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children. Recently, dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (Deflux, Q-Med AB, Uppsala, Sweden) a biodegradable injectable material has been reported to be a promising alternative to other tissue augmenting substances. However, the experience with dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer is limited. We prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer in the endoscopic treatment of VUR.A total of 32 males and 81 females with a median age of 1 year (range 3 months to 10 years) underwent endoscopic correction of primary VUR with dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer. Reflux was unilateral in 58 cases and bilateral in 54, affecting 166 ureters. Reflux was grades II to V in 7 (4.2%) cases, 91 (54.8%), 63 (38%) and 5 (3%), respectively. All patients underwent endoscopic correction as a day procedure and have been followed for 3 months to 1 year.The reflux was corrected in 143 (86%) of the 166 ureters after a single injection, and resolved after a second and third injection in 22 (13%) and 1 (1%) ureter, respectively. No untoward effects were seen in any of these patients with the use of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer as an injectable material.Dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer is an effective tissue augmenting substance in the endoscopic treatment of all grades of VUR.
