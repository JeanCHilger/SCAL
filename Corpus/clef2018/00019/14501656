Is common sheath extravesical reimplantation an effective technique to correct reflux in duplicated collecting systems? We evaluate the outcome vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in duplicated collecting systems compared to single collecting systems corrected using an extravesical detrusorrhaphy approach.We reviewed the records of 266 patients (422 ureters) treated for VUR using an extravesical approach between 1991 and 2001. Inclusion criteria were primary reflux in single (201 patients, 125 bilateral) or duplicated collecting systems (65, 31 bilateral) in patients not undergoing other concomitant surgery with at least 1 year of postoperative followup. The indication for surgical intervention was unresolved reflux (greater than 4 years) in more than 70% of patients. Postoperative evaluation included a voiding cystourethrogram at 3 months and 12 months if reflux was unresolved at 3 months. Also ultrasound was performed at 6 weeks or earlier if clinically indicated and 12 months.Group 1 (duplicated collecting systems) and group 2 (single collecting systems) were comparable for age, sex distribution and reflux grade distribution. Overall success rate at 3 and 12 months was 94.7% and 98.9% for group 1, and 95.1% and 98.5% for group 2, respectively. The difference in success rate at 3 and 12 months was not statistically significant (p >0.05). Of note in both groups postoperative VUR was contralateral in more than 40% of cases. Postoperative hydronephrosis (Society for Fetal Urology grade 1, 2 or 1 increment in grade from preoperative status) was observed in 5.3% and 7.3% of ureteral units at 6 weeks in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p >0.05). At 12 months less than 1% of ureteral units exhibited low grade residual hydronephrosis. No high grade postoperative hydronephrosis was observed in either group, and there were no intraoperative complications. Postoperative urinary retention occurred in 4.7% and 4% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p >0.05).Common sheath extravesical reimplantation is highly effective in treating VUR. The common sheath extravesical reimplantation for duplicated collecting systems is as effective in nonduplicated systems and is associated with minimal perioperative morbidity.
