Advances in pediatric sonography. Advances in the field of ultrasound technology and ultrasound contrast media over the past few years have also brought major improvements to pediatric sonography. Accordingly, contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography has become a valuable alternative in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux. It is possible to achieve significant reduction in radiation exposure replacing the conventional radiologic methods used for reflux diagnosis with contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Through the introduction of harmonic imaging, an ultrasound scanning modality with high spatial and contrast resolution has become available. The modality was initially propagated as one to be applied in difficult-to-scan adults. However, initial experiences in pediatric applications are demonstrating the significant improvement it can bring in the ultrasound image quality, for example, in intestinal ultrasound. A further development is three-dimensional [3D] imaging using ultrasound. 3D-ultrasound not only offers an improvement in diagnosis but also in the acceptance of ultrasound in interdisciplinary work and teaching. The first applications of 3D-ultrasound in pediatrics are focusing on brain ultrasound and volume measurement of the kidneys.
