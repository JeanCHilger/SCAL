Isolated minimal renal pelvic dilatation detected antenatally in a non-tertiary setting is an uncommon predictor of significant vesicoureteric reflux. To study in a non-tertiary centre the prevalence and grade of vesicoureteric reflux detected postnatally in infants already identified antenatally with isolated minimal renal pelvic dilatation.Retrospective review over the years 1998-2000 inclusive of a central computerized database in the single paediatric practice within Albury Wodonga.Ninety-three (65 male) infants detected antenatally with isolated renal pelvic dilatation (>or=3 mm at 18 weeks gestation, >or=5 mm at 32 weeks gestation,<10 mm dilatation at any gestation) had a Micturating Cystourethrogram result. Thirteen infants (seven male) had vesicoureteric reflux detected, with a total of 18 refluxing renal units. Of these 13 infants five had bilateral vesicoureteric reflux (two male), and eight had unilateral vesicoureteric reflux. The median reflux grade was 2.0, with significant vesicoureteric reflux (greater than grade II) occurring in 5.4% (5/93).Significant vesicoureteric reflux (greater than grade II) occurred in only 5.4% (5/93) of infants. It is concluded that isolated minimal renal pelvic dilatation detected antenatally is a poor screening test for clinically significant vesicoureteric reflux.
