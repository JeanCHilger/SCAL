Advantages and limitations of single-channel urodynamics in childhood. The simultaneous recording of urodynamic parameters and x-ray imaging of the lower urinary tract is the ideal technique for a complex investigation of the lower urinary tract morphology and function. The urodynamic and micturating cystourethrography findings were reviewed in 57 children. The causes of the examinations were recurrent urinary tract infection, voiding dysfunction and urinary tract dilatation by ultrasound. 53/57 patients had a clear cystomanometry results. 4 did not cooperate. 15/53 had unstable bladder. 34/57 had vesico-ureteric reflux. Unilateral reflux was more frequently noted in children with an unstable bladder. In cases of a stable bladder, bilateral reflux occurred more frequently. The ureteric reflux in children with unstable bladder should resolve with therapy to decrease bladder activity. Urodynamics is complementary rather than competitive with radiologic investigations. It is necessary to make micturating cystourethrography with cystomanometry.
