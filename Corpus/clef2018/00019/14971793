Simultaneous voiding cystourethrography and voiding urosonography reveals utility of sonographic diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux in children. To evaluate the diagnostic potential of voiding urosonography (VUS) compared with fluoroscopic voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) under identical conditions and to evaluate potential reasons for false-negative VUS results, particularly regarding bladder concentrations of the US contrast agent, Levovist.Fifty-six paediatric patients (M/F 34/22, mean age 2.3 y, age range 1 mo-14 y) underwent simultaneous VUS and VCUG under identical conditions. The bladder was filled by simultaneous administration of Levovist and the X-ray contrast medium, DIP Conray. Levovist concentrations in bladders were calculated using amounts of Levovist injected and total DIP Conray infused when reflux was first observed in either procedure.Sensitivities of VUS and VCUG for detection of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) were both 86%, assuming that VUR detected by either method represented a true-positive, and no reflux by either method represented a true-negative. Patients under 24-mo of age displayed a better VUS sensitivity, of 94%. Levovist concentrations in bladders ranged from 1.8% to 23%, with older children tending to demonstrate increased bladder capacity and lower concentration. All VUS false-negative units displayed Levovist bladder concentrations of less than 5%.The present simultaneous study suggests that: 1) the two techniques demonstrate similar sensitivity for detection of reflux 2) sustained Levovist bladder concentrations of below 5% may not allow detection of reflux on VUS
