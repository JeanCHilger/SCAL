Utility of follow-up renal sonography in children with vesicoureteral reflux and normal initial sonogram. The purpose of this study was to determine the value of follow-up renal sonography in children who presented with urinary tract infection and were found to have a voiding cystogram diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux while having a normal initial renal sonogram.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 64 consecutive children who presented for follow-up renal sonography with a voiding cystogram diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux and a normal initial sonogram conducted as part of the routine evaluation after urinary tract infection. Data recorded included gender, age, initial grade of reflux, time to follow-up sonogram, and abnormalities on follow-up sonogram. Children with conditions that may predispose to vesicoureteral reflux were excluded.Children who were studied (7 boys, 57 girls) ranged in age from 1 month to 10 years, 10 months (mean: 35.6 months median: 24 months). Ninety-four (73.4%) of 128 renal units demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux on voiding cystogramRoutine performance of repeat sonography seems unnecessary among children, particularly girls, with low- to medium-grade vesicoureteral reflux, who have had a previous normal sonogram and no conditions that predispose to vesicoureteral reflux.
