The role of imaging in urinary tract infections. The aim of imaging in urinary tract infections (UTI) is to detect conditions that must be corrected to avoid imminent deterioration of kidney function, or to prevent recurrent infections and long-term kidney damage. The most threatening conditions are obstruction of an infected upper tract and abscesses of the genitourinary system. An image-guided percutaneous drainage can be lifesaving. The role of imaging in small children with UTI is controversial in terms of the importance of anatomical and functional disorders in relation to the preventive measures to be taken. In newborns identified with hydronephrosis during pregnancy or by neonatal screening, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and renal scarring are congenital and not caused by infection. Most of these patients are males and the VUR is of a higher grade than VUR detected in girls after the first UTI. Imaging in children with UTI should only be ordered after a thorough evaluation of the risk of renal damage and the benefits of preventive measures. In adult females, no imaging is necessary in cystitis, while ultrasonography and plain films are recommended in acute pyelonephritis. Since uncomplicated UTI in men is rare, diagnostic imaging should be started early to rule out complicating factors in the urinary tract. In prostatitis, vesiculitis, epididymitis and orchitis the role of imaging is to rule out abscess formation and testicular malignancies.
