Abnormal dimercapto-succinic acid scans predict an increased risk of breakthrough infection in children with vesicoureteral reflux. The management of high grade vesicoureteral reflux remains controversial, with breakthrough infections being an indication for surgical repair. We sought to determine if technetium dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scan could help predict which children are at risk for breakthrough urinary tract infection.A retrospective review was performed on children presenting with a febrile urinary tract infection and prenatal hydronephrosis who were found to have vesicoureteral reflux and underwent a DMSA scan. Reflux was tabulated according to the highest grade. DMSA results were graded as 0-normal, no parenchymal or size defects, grade 1-focal parenchymal defects or less than a quarter of a renal unit involved, or grade 2-severe defects to include at least half of a renal unit, bilateral defects or unilateral atrophy.A total of 120 consecutive patients were evaluated. An abnormal DMSA scan was documented in 57 (33 females and 24 males), and 35 with grade 1 and 22 with grade 2 defects. Of the patients 53 females and 10 males had a normal scan. Of the 57 children with an abnormal DMSA scan 6% presented with grades 1 and 2 vesicoureteral reflux, 24% with grade 3, 38% with grade 4 and 26% with grade 5. Of the children with grades 3 to 5 reflux 60% had a subsequent breakthrough infection. Of the 63 children with a normal DMSA scan 11% presented with grade 1 reflux, 28% with grade 2, 48% with grade 3, 11% with grade 4 and 2% with grade 5. Of these children 5 had a subsequent breakthrough infection.An abnormality on DMSA scan in the presence of grade 3 to 5 reflux correlates with a greater chance of having a breakthrough infection (60%). We conclude that children with grade 3 to 5 vesicoureteral reflux and an abnormal DMSA scan are at increased risk for breakthrough urinary tract infection.
