Vesicoureteral reflux in young patients: comparison of voiding color Doppler US with echo enhancement versus voiding cystourethrography for diagnosis or exclusion. We assessed the accuracy of voiding color Doppler ultrasonography (US) with echo enhancement for diagnosis or exclusion of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) versus voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and evaluated patient tolerance of the echo-enhancing agent. One hundred twenty-two patients (ages range, 1 month to 17 years) with 244 ureterorenal units underwent voiding color Doppler US with echo enhancement, which was followed by VCUG on the same day. After US of the urinary tract, the bladder was filled with saline solution via catheter. Then an echo-enhancing agent was instilled, and color Doppler US was performed. Reflux was diagnosed when microbubbles appeared in the ureter or the pelvicaliceal system. VUR was detected in 98 units. All grades of reflux were identified. In 13 units (13.3%), grade I reflux diagnosed at voiding color Doppler US was not observed at VCUG. No reflux was detected in 146 units by either method. In 231 (94.2%) of the 244 ureterorenal units, there was concordance between the two methods. The echo-enhancing agent was well tolerated by all patients. Voiding color Doppler US with echo enhancement is useful for the diagnosis or exclusion of VUR, being as good as VCUG. Therefore, it may reduce the number of patients exposed to ionizing radiation.
