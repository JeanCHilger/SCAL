Concomitant anomalies in 100 children with unilateral multicystic kidney. To determine the incidence and type of associated urogenital anomalies in children with a unilateral multicystic kidney and to assess in children with nephrectomy the additional diagnostic value of cystoscopy and, in girls, of colposcopy.This was a follow-up study of 100 fetuses with antenatally detected unilateral multicystic kidneys. After ultrasound confirmation of the diagnosis within a few days after birth voiding cystourethrography and isotope scan were performed in 83 of the surviving children to exclude vesicoureteral reflux and to establish renal function. Eighty-one children underwent nephrectomy and, prior to surgery, all underwent cystoscopy and girls also underwent colposcopy.Seventy-five children had one or more additional urogenital anomalies: 39 had anomalies of the contralateral kidney, 40 had anomalies of the ipsilateral kidney and 30 had one or more anomalies of the lower urogenital tract. With cystoscopy 54 anomalies of the genitourinary tract were detected in 48 children and with colposcopy three anomalies were detected in 35 girls. Eighty-one children had a nephrectomy or heminephrectomy and 33 of them needed other urological intervention. Thirteen fetuses died (mostly from agenesis of the contralateral kidney) and six infants had no surgery at all.Children with a unilateral multicystic kidney are at considerable risk of having other urogenital anomalies. When cystoscopy and colposcopy are added to routine investigations the rate of detection of anomalies is 75%, twice that reported in the literature.
