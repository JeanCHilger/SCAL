The sensitivity of antenatal ultrasound for predicting renal tract surgery in early childhood. To establish the sensitivity of antenatal ultrasound for identifying the need for renal tract surgery in infancy and early childhood.A retrospective analysis of the surgical records in children under 5 years of age undergoing renal tract surgery in a regional pediatric urological surgery referral unit was carried out. All records between May 1997 and July 2002 were examined to assess the relationship between prenatal ultrasound findings and postnatal surgical pathology.A total of 106 operations had been performed. The detection rate of multicystic renal dysplasia was 100% (17/17). The equivalent detection rates for pelviureteral junction obstruction, duplex renal system and vesicoureteral reflux were 82.8, 67 and 26.1%, respectively. None of the babies with renal tumors had abnormal antenatal ultrasound findings. The diagnosis of postnatal renal surgical pathology was made on the basis of prenatal scan findings in 59.6% of cases, while recurrent urinary tract infection led to the diagnosis in 26.0%.Approximately 40% of children requiring surgery for renal tract pathology will have a normal antenatal ultrasound examination. The prevalence of abnormal antenatal ultrasound findings varies depending on the type of renal tract pathology. Despite these findings, the commonest indicator for surgery remains abnormal prenatal scan findings, followed by recurrent urinary tract infections.
