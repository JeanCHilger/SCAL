Vesicoureteric reflux and renal scars in asymptomatic siblings of children with reflux. The purpose of the study was to determine the incidence of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR), renal scars and hypertension in asymptomatic siblings of children with VUR. The study comprised 105 siblings of patients with VUR. Their age ranged from 4 months to 6.3 years. All had a direct radionuclide voiding cystography (DRVC) performed, and VUR was detected in 47 of 105 (45%). High grade VUR in the first year of life had an incidence of 50% compared with a 9% incidence in siblings older than 2 years, while only one of the 27 siblings with a low VUR grade was younger than 1 year. In 43 of 47 siblings with VUR, a technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scan was performed and renal scars were found in 10, which presents 23% of siblings with VUR who were scanned and 10% of all siblings studied. One child had hypertension. Identifying VUR among asymptomatic siblings could possibly prevent renal damage and its consequences. Thus, the predictive value of positive family history alone in identifying VUR was 45% while 23% of siblings had renal scars. This incidence justifies the routine investigation of asymptomatic siblings, by using DRVC at an early stage.
