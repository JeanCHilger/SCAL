Natural history of vesicoureteral reflux associated with kidney anomalies. To evaluate the cystographic follow-up of patients with multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK), renal agenesis, and renal ectopia with associated primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).Patients with primary associated VUR (grade 2 or more) and with a minimal follow-up of 24 months were included in this study.Of the children with renal agenesis, 24% had VUR. The median grade of VUR was significantly greater in the boys than in the girls (4 versus 2, respectively P < 0.05). All girls and 34% of the boys experienced spontaneous resolution 1 year after diagnosisSpontaneous resolution of VUR can be anticipated in girls with MCDK or renal agenesis and in boys with renal ectopia. These data can be used in planning the proper follow-up schedule for babies with a kidney anomaly detected by ultrasonography.
