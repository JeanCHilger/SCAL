Bilateral single system ectopic ureters in a male infant. Bilateral single-system ureteral ectopia is a rare congenital malformation. We report a case of a male infant with bilateral single-system ectopic ureters without diffuse hydronephrosis, vesicoureteral reflux, or a history of recurrent urinary tract infections. The patient presented for an evaluation of hydronephrosis associated with the upper pole of an apparently duplex left kidney detected by prenatal and postnatal ultrasonography. Cystoscopy revealed two ureteral orifices distal to the bladder neck with a dilated left upper-pole calix and no duplex kidney. No surgical intervention has been planned until his continence status has been clarified.
