A new perspective on the natural history of vesicoureteric reflux. Vesicoureteric reflux is most commonly recognized in girls after urinary tract infection. Increasing recognition of vesicoureteric reflux in neonates, detected after an abnormal prenatal sonogram, shows a marked male predominance: 80% boys. Vesicoureteric reflux in children may be both a congenital abnormality, more common in boys, and an acquired abnormality, more common in girls with voiding dysfunction.
