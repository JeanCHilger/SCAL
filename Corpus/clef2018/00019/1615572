The dilated urinary tract in children. Dilatation of the urinary tract is detected in a number of settings throughout childhood. Children may be asymptomatic or present with urinary tract infection, hematuria, or voiding symptoms. Evaluation of the affected urinary tract may require standard radiographic techniques (VCUG, EU) complemented by ultrasound and nuclear medicine studies. The goal of imaging is to differentiate hydronephrosis (HN) from hydroureteronephrosis (HUN) and to provide the correct diagnosis so that appropriate treatment can be given. This article reviews and demonstrates the findings in some common and uncommon causes of HN and HUN.
