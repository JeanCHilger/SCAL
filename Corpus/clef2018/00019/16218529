Endoscopic injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid for vesico-ureteral reflux--preliminary results. Endoscopic injection is a minimal invasive treatment for vesico-ureteral reflux, an alternative for prophylactic antibiotics or open surgery. Concerns of safety were raised regarding traditional injectable materials used in the past. The recently introduced dextranomer/hyaluronic acid is a new biocompatable substance. Its safety and efficacy has been investigated and demonstrated.To report our preliminary results with the endoscopic injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid.Twenty nine pediatric patients of mean age 58 months (range 6-144) underwent endoscopic treatment. A total of 42 refluxing ureteral units were treated. Reflux grade was 2, 3, and 4 in 10, 24, and 8, respectively. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia, using a 9.5FR pediatric cystoscope and a semi-rigid needle. The substance was injected submucosally at the 6-o'clock position of the ureteral orifice. A mean of 0.87 ml of the substance was injected (range: 0.6-1.2). In the latter part of the series we injected a minimum of 1 ml for each ureter. During follow-up, ultrasonography and a voiding cystography were performed after 1 and 3 months respectively.Vesico-ureteral reflux resolved in 32/42 (76%) of the ureters. The rate of success was 10/10 (100%), 19/24 (79%) and 4/8 (50%) in reflux grades 2, 3, and 4, respectively. De-novo contralateral reflux was noted in 5 patients. A single complication occurred: acute venous bleeding originating in the injection site, which was managed endoscopically.Endoscopic injection of dextranomer/ hyaluronic acid is a safe and effective treatment. We recommend the injection of 1 ml, the entire volume available for each ureter.
