Functional imaging for determination of nephroblastoma: an obligatory diagnostic program. In Europe, 1.7 % of children with predicted nephroblastoma undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy without being correctly diagnosed. It is necessary to reduce the number of misdiagnoses. In a girl who was referred to our institute with the diagnosis of nephroblastoma of the right kidney, DMSA scan revealed a hypertrophic compensation of the contralateral nephropathy in the lower part. Functional imaging studies of the kidney should be performed in patients in whom the type of pathology of a suspect mass in the kidney region is unclear, including a careful scrutiny of the MRI scan.
