Extravesical nondismembered ureteroplasty with detrusorrhaphy: a renewed technique to correct vesicoureteral reflux in children. We performed an extravesical nondismembered reimplant to correct surgically primary vesicoureteral reflux in 45 patients (65 renal units) between April 1989 and September 1990. Of the units 6 had grade I reflux, 16 grade II, 23 grade III, 14 grade IV and 6 grade V. Only patients with primary reflux were included in this study. The success rate was 100% for grades I to III, 92.9% for grade IV and 66.7% for grade V. Overall, the reflux was cured in 62 of the 65 operated renal units (95.4%) or 95.6% of the patients (43 of 45). Postoperative morbidity and complications were minimal. No cases of postoperative obstruction were detected on excretory urography 6 weeks postoperatively. Seven children (16%) suffered from transient inadequate bladder emptying as assessed by post-void ultrasound residual evaluations. This problem resolved spontaneously after a maximum of 4 weeks of clean intermittent catheterization. Compared to conventional transvesical technique, the discomfort related to bladder spasms during the postoperative period was subjectively decreased and patients had no prolonged hematuria.
