Endoscopic subureteral urocol injection for the treatment of vesicoureteral reflux. We evaluated the effect of Urocol injection for the endoscopic treatment of VUR in children.A total of 208 children (62 boys and 146 girls, mean age 4.78 years) with 346 refluxing ureters underwent subureteral injection of Urocol between January 2000 and February 2002. VCUG was performed at 6 months, and ultrasound was performed at 1 week and 3 months postoperatively.Followup VCUG showed no evidence of reflux in 240 ureters (69%), significant decrease in reflux grade in 62 (18%) and no change in 44 (13%). Ultrasound revealed no obstruction or hydronephrosis.The results of this study demonstrate that subureteral injection of Urocol was effective for the treatment of VUR. We conclude that Urocol represents a new, safe, simple, less expensive and repeatable technique in treating VUR.
