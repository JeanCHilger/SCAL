Outcome analysis of retroperitoneal laparoscopic heminephrectomy in children. Retroperitoneal laparoscopic heminephrectomy is a relatively new, well tolerated, minimally invasive alternative to open surgery for children with a nonfunctioning moiety in a duplex kidney. We collected data to assess outcomes in our experience with this procedure.Data were retrospectively gathered on all patients operated on for retroperitoneal laparoscopic heminephrectomy at our institution between February 2001 and November 2004. Followup ultrasound was performed in all patients, and additional imaging was done only when clinically indicated.Retroperitoneal laparoscopic heminephrectomy was performed in 18 girls and 4 boys (18 upper and 5 lower pole moieties). Indications included ureterocele (12 patients), ectopic ureter (9) and vesicoureteral reflux (5). Mean age at surgery was 5 years (range 4 months to 18 years). Four patients required conversion to an open procedure due to inadequate exposure and were excluded from further review. Urine leaks developed postoperatively in 3 patients and were treated with Foley catheter drainage and/or stent placement. Two patients were noted to have large (more than 5 cm) asymptomatic retroperitoneal fluid collections on followup ultrasound. Functional loss of the remaining ipsilateral moiety was confirmed by DMSA scan in 2 children (ages 6 and 7 months). Doppler studies confirmed normal hilar blood flow in both cases. Clinical presentation for this subgroup included fever on postoperative day 3 in 1 patient and hypertension at 32 months postoperatively in 1. Mean followup was 33 months (range 3 to 56).Although retroperitoneal laparoscopic renal ablative surgery in children appears to be relatively safe and is associated with low morbidity, serious complications may occur with subtle or even late presentation.
