Role of positional instillation of contrast cystography in the algorithm for evaluating children with confirmed pyelonephritis. To assess the utility of positional instillation of contrast (PIC) cystography in detecting vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in patients with renal scarring from recurrent febrile urinary tract infections that standard voiding cystourethrography and nuclear cystogram imaging failed to reveal.Between June 2004 and November 2004, a total of 5 pediatric patients with recurrent febrile urinary tract infections and radiologic evidence of upper tract involvement were examined with PIC cystography. All patients had at least one previous negative standard reflux study (voiding cystourethrography or nuclear cystography).All 5 patients showed VUR on PIC cystography. Unilateral reflux was detected in 3 patients, and 2 patients had bilateral VUR.The PIC cystogram should be integrated into the algorithm for diagnosing patients with recurrent febrile urinary tract infection, who do not exhibit VUR on standard imaging modalities. The morbidity associated with undiagnosed VUR, as demonstrated by this group of patients, suggests that permanent renal damage may be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment.
