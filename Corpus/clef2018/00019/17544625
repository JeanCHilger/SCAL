Antenatally detected hydronephrosis. The strategy of management of children with hydronephrosis has considerably changed as a result of the development of ultrasound techniques, allowing a prenatal detection. Hydronephrosis is defined as a dilation of the renal collecting system, and several entirely different clinical entities can be considered this general heading, whereas early detection may have a different impact depending on the entity considered. The present work aims to describe a certain number of these clinical entities, to discuss the strategic options of management that are proposed, and to evaluate the role of medical imaging, in particular the radionuclide approach. Congenital ureteropelvic junction anomaly, vesicoureteral reflux, posterior urethral valves, and duplex kidney will be successively considered. Multicystic dysplastic kidney disease, although not classified as hydronephrosis, will be mentioned because it may be mistaken for hydronephrosis.
