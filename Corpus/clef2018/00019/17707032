Association of transforming growth factor-beta1 gene polymorphism with familial vesicoureteral reflux. Familial clustering of vesicoureteral reflux suggests that genetic factors have an important role in the pathogenesis of vesicoureteral reflux. Transforming growth factor-beta1 is a multifunctional peptide that controls proliferation and differentiation in many cell types. Recently an association between the transforming growth factor-beta1 -509 and +869 gene polymorphism, and renal parenchymal scarring was reported. We investigated the genetic contribution of transforming growth factor-beta1 in familial vesicoureteral reflux by examining the genotype frequencies of transforming growth factor-beta1 polymorphic variants.The study included 141 families in which 1 or more siblings had primary vesicoureteral reflux. Renal parenchymal scarring was assessed using dimercapto-succinic acid scans. Genotyping was performed in 280 patients with vesicoureteral reflux, including 133 index patients and 147 siblings, and in 74 controls for the position -509 and the coding region at position 10 (+869) of the transforming growth factor-beta1 gene polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction, gel analysis and appropriate restriction digest.The genotype frequency of -509CC was significantly increased in the familial vesicoureteral reflux group compared to controls (58% vs 33%, p <0.01), whereas -509TT genotype frequency was significantly lower in the familial vesicoureteral reflux group compared to controls (7.5% vs 28%, p <0.01). Similarly there was a significant increase in the +869TT genotype (52% vs 32%, p <0.05), while the +869CC genotype was significantly lower in patients with familial vesicoureteral reflux compared to controls (11% vs 24%, p <0.01). There were no significant differences in transforming growth factor-beta1 genotype distribution between patients with vesicoureteral reflux with and without renal parenchymal scarring.To our knowledge this study demonstrates for the first time the association of the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta1 gene polymorphism in patients with familial vesicoureteral reflux. Individuals with the transforming growth factor-beta1 -509CC and 869TT genotype may have increased susceptibility to vesicoureteral reflux.
