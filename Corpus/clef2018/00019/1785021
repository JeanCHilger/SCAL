Vesicoureteral reflux in adults studied by computerized radionuclide cystography. Direct radionuclide cystography in a computerized method as described by Willi and Treves was used in adults with recurrent pyelitis but without evidence of obstruction. Reflux was observed in 15 out of 38 patients. In patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction or megaureters, reflux began early during the bladder filling and attained higher volumes than in those with uncomplicated pyelitis, who had minor reflux appearing mainly during voiding. Bladder capacity and detrusor compliance were lower in patients with reflux than in those without reflux. The low radiation exposure in radionuclide cystography permits observation of the urodynamic course of urinary reflux and correlation to the intravesical volume and pressure. The method is sensitive, and minor refluxed volumes can be detected. Radionuclide cystography can therefore be recommended for checking of surgical results and for follow-up of patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction.
