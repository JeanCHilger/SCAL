Upper urinary tract dilatation: prenatal diagnosis, management and outcome. Upper urinary tract dilatation is one of the most common abnormalities detected on prenatal ultrasound scanning. It is commonly due to transient urine flow impairment (UFI) at the level of the pelvi-ureteric and vesico-ureteric junctions, which improves with time in most cases. It is usually in the neonatal period that the diagnosis is confirmed and during the first 18 months of life that the prognosis of the dilatation is defined.
