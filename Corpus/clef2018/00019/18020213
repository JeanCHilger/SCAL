Endoscopic treatment with Deflux for primary vesicoureteral reflux. Effectivety for endoscopic treatment for primary reflux has been under discussion as a single procedure. In the last 3 years our unit have been used Deflux, (dextranomer copolymer in hialuronic acid) for this pathology. The aim of this study is to analyze the results of our experience.Since 2002, a prospective protocol for VUR has been applied. We reviewed the last 25 cases treated with Deflux per thousand injection who had ultrasound and cistography.86% (n = 21) were females and with a mean age of 6.1 years (range 2-14) the success rate with a single injection was 73.6% (n = 28). The amount of deflux injected was irrelevant in the result. The results in the low grades reflux (I-II) reaching the 100% (n = 15). The worse result was in the double system cases with just one successful case out of 6 injected. The procedure was in outpatient bases. There were no peri-procedures complications.The endoscopic treatment for VUR with Deflux, is a good alternative to medical treatment especially in single ureter with low grade. Therefore the authors recommend this technique at the time of counseling parents.
