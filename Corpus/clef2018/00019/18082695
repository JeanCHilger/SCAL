The effectiveness of ureteric reimplantation during bladder augmentation for high-grade vesicoureteric reflux in patients with neurogenic bladder: long-term outcome. The outcome of ureteric reimplantation (UR) during bladder augmentation (BA) for high-grade vesicoureteric reflux (HVUR) in patients with neurogenic bladder was assessed to determine the effectiveness of UR. A literature review of HVUR and BA was also performed.Twenty-two consecutive sigmoidocolocystoplasty patients were reviewed retrospectively 10 had unilateral HVUR only, 3 had bilateral HVUR, and 9 had unilateral HVUR associated with low-grade VUR in the contralateral renal unit (RU). Preoperatively, VUR was grade V in 3 RU, grade IV in 22 RU, grade III in 5 RU, and grade II in 4 RU. Ureteric reimplantation was performed in the native bladder in 24 RU (16 patients) and in the colon cap in 10 RU (6 patients).Mean age at sigmoidocolocystoplasty/UR was 8.5 years (range, 2-15 years). Mean follow-up was 12.8 years (range, 2-22 years). Postoperatively, cystourethrography showed residual VUR (grade IV to grade III) in only 1 RU (3%) diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scintigraphy showed no obstruction in all RUUreteric reimplantation during BA is safe and effective for treating HVUR in patients with neurogenic bladder.
