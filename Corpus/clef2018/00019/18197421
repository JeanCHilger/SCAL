Role of the Teflon deposit in the recurrence of vesicoureteral reflux. A relationship between the Teflon deposit, visible with ultrasound, and long-term success of subureteric Teflon injection (STING) treatment was investigated. The study included only those patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), in whom the reflux had disappeared and the Teflon deposits were visible 6 weeks following STING treatment. Cessation of VUR was proven by voiding cysto-urethrography (VCUG) in 99 patients (143 ureters). Average follow-up time was 9 (4-12) years. Patients were divided into two groups: group I, deposits visible with ultrasound [deposit (+)], and group II, no visible deposits at the end of the follow-up period [deposit (-)]. Reflux recurrence, the occurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI), and pyelonephritis were investigated, and technetium scintigraphy scans were examined. The deposit (+) group included 43 patients (65 ureters), and the deposit (-) group contained 56 patients (78 ureters). In the deposit (+) group there were no recurrences of VUR however, 17 recurrences were found in the deposit (-) group (P < 0.05). Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy scans and occurrence of UTI showed significant difference between the groups (P < 0.05). A close relationship was found between the disappearance of the Teflon deposit and the recurrence of VUR. Disappearance of the Teflon deposit and repeated bacteriuria is a warning sign of the recurrence of VUR
