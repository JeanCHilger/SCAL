Postoperative cystography and endoscopic treatment of low-grade vesicoureteral reflux. The endoscopic subureteral injection of tissue-bulking agents has become an established alternative to long-term antibiotic prophylaxis and open surgery with a high success rate, especially for low-grade reflux (>90%). Though it is recognized that a routine postoperative voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is unnecessary following a ureteroneocystostomy, most teams perform one after an endoscopic treatment.In this paper, we report on our experience with the endoscopic correction of vesicoureteral reflux in 72 ureteral units, for whom no routine postoperative cystography was performed.Two children presented with postoperative recurrent febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs), which were not correlated with cystography findings. Postoperative VCUGs after a ureteroneocystostomy are invasive and expose the child to radiation, they are associated with a substantial cost, and most of all, they do not allow the identification of those patients at risk of recurrent febrile UTIs. Further, the endoscopic subureteral injection of tissue-bulking agents have been used for several years, and numerous studies, set in various clinical settings, have since been published, confirming excellent long-term results for low-grade reflux.We feel that postoperative cystograms should be reserved for children who present with recurrent UTIs, new sonographic abnormalities, or who were treated for high-grade reflux.
