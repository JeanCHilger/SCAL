Ureter triplex with non-functioning upper pole due to ectopic ureterocele and refluxive third ureter bud : case report and review of the literature. We present the case of an 8-month-old boy with ureter triplication on the left side with non-functional upper pole due to ectopic ureterocele and a refluxive third ureter bud. We performed an upper pole heminephroureterectomy with resection of the ureterocele and of the refluxive third ureter bud and reimplantation of the lower pole ureter using the psoas hitch technique.
