Can vesicoureteral reflux be predicted in infants with urinary infection?. To look forward for a formulae able to predict the presence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in the first urinary tract infection (UTI) in infants.We had studied all the diagnosticated first UTI in breast-fed babies in our hospital along 21/2 years. All had been subjects of a renal ultrasound scan, VCUG and CRP test. We have analyzed the result by diagnosis test and logistic regression.We have studied 267 infants aged between 2 days and 24 months old.17,33% manifested UTI caused by germs different than E Coli, 40 subjects presented anomalies in the ultrasound scan and 108 manifested VUR. Oostenbruck s score had been useless in detecting VUR subjects. In the multivariable analysis the two variables of anomalies in the ultrasonographic scan and non E Coli caused UIT were the only ones to presented statistical significance to sign the presence of VUR and of the likeness of VUR of grade > or = 3. The negative probability coefficients for infants with ultrasonographics anomalies and/or UTI non E Coli produced were of 0,78 (IC 0,67-0,90) for all degrees of VUR, 0,25 (IC 0,10-0,52) for VUR with degree > or = 3 and 0 (IC 0-0,67) for VUR with degree > or = 4.We deduced that in children younger of 24 months old that suffer their first UTI the indication to proceeded with a VCUG could be limited to the subjects with present anomalies in the renal ultrasound scan and/or UTI non E Coli, thought there will precised more studies to confirm this findings.
