Congenital urological anomalies diagnosed in adulthood - management considerations. Despite worldwide availability of prenatal ultrasound, many patients are diagnosed in adult life with congenital anomalies such as ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), undescended testicle (UDT), ureterocele, hypospadias, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and primary obstructing megaureter (POM). The aim of this review was to describe these clinical conditions and their suggested management based on the available medical literature.Adult UPJO is not a rare condition symptomatic patients should be treated rather than observed. Treatment options are nephrectomy for non-functioning kidneys and reconstructive surgery for functioning renal units. The adult UDT has low fertility potential and increased cancer riskCongenital urological anomalies identified in adulthood are not rare and pose a management challenge to the urologist. For most of the reviewed diseases, evidence-based management direction is difficult due to a lack of randomized trials and long-term follow up.
