Complete duplication of bladder and urethra in a sagittal plane in a male infant: case report and literature review. Complete duplication of the bladder and urethra is a rare entity. It may occur in the coronal and sagittal planes, and is often associated with other organ system anomalies, in particular of the gastrointestinal tract. We report an unusual variant of sagittal duplication of the bladder, in a male, associated with rudimentary hindgut duplication, and review the literature pertaining to this unusual anomaly.
