TGF-beta1 gene polymorphisms and primary vesicoureteral reflux in childhood. The aim of this study was to assess the association between the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) gene polymorphisms rs1800469 (commonly known as T-509C) and rs1982073 (commonly known as Leu (10)-->Pro) and primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and renal scarring. Using a case-control approach, we examined 121 children with primary VUR and 169 controls. Genotyping of the TGF-beta1 gene polymorphisms was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The (99m)Tc-DMSA- or (99m)Tc-unitiol-single photon emission computed tomography method was used to evaluate renal scars in 84 of 121 VUR children. Statistical analysis revealed differences in rs1800469 genotype frequencies between VUR patients and controls (p = 0.0021). Our data demonstrate that individuals homozygous for the TT genotype are at risk of primary VUR [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 2.7 (1.46-5.08)]. Distribution of the rs1982073 polymorphism was similar in VUR children and controls. In terms of renal scarring, patients were stratified into non-scar and scar subgroups, and no differences in the genotype frequencies of either polymorphism was found. Previous reports have shown that the TT genotype of the rs1800469 polymorphism is a risk factor for renal scarring in primary VUR, and the results of our study suggest that this same polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to this congenital uropathy.
