Ureteric jet Doppler waveform: is it a reliable predictor of vesicoureteric reflux in children? The purpose of our prospective study was to find out whether ureteric jet Doppler waveform (UJDW) could be a reliable predictor of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children, compared with echo-enhanced voiding ultrasonography (VUS). Echo-enhanced VUS was performed in 75 children, 57 girls and 18 boys, aged 3 years to 12 years, following the accepted indications for this procedure. During the same procedure the measurement of UJDW was also performed and was considered to be successful (in 70 children) when at least ten UJDWs were recorded per ureteric unit. Depending on the shape of the UJDWs, the sequences were classified into three groups: monophasic, suggestive of VUR complex, not suggestive of VUR
