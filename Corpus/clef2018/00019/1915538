Urinary Tamm-Horsfall protein excretion in patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux. The excretion of urinary Tamm-Horsefall protein (THP) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated with technetium-99m diethylenetriamine pentacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) renal scintigraphy in 26 consecutive patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) before and after antireflux surgery. Wide variations of urinary THP excretion and GFR were seen in all grades of VUR. On the basis of the relationship between urinary THP excretion and GFR before the surgery, patients were divided into three groups. The first group (group A, n = 8) had normal urinary THP values and normal values of GFR. The second group (group B, n = 11) had high THP excretion and moderately decreased GFR, the third group (group C, n = 7) had normal urinary THP excretion and severely decreased GFR. In group A, urinary THP values remained normal and GFR improved in all patients after surgery. In group B, GFR improved when urinary THP dropped immediately, but GFR did not improve when urinary THP remained high after surgery. In group C, GFR did not improve and urinary THP continued to be low or tended to drop again after the surgery. The results suggested that serial measurements of urinary THP excretion and GFR by 99mTc-DTPA renal scintigraphy before and after antireflux surgery are useful for the evaluation of renal function in patients with primary VUR.
