Choice of a method of temporary drainage of the upper urinary tract in plastic reconstruction surgery on the vesicoureteral segment in children. Among prevalent causes of abnormal urine outflow from the kidneys and urinary tract in children are neuromuscular ureteral dysplasia (NMUD) and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Many complications and unsatisfactory results of the treatment of the above conditions depend on the drain method. NMUD and VUR were surgically treated in 85 children (age from 6 months to 17 years, 39 boys and 46 girls). Treatment results were analysed with reference to the drainage method--catheter stent or intubation by findings of excretory urography, cystography, ultrasonography and morphological examination with evaluation of a morphological picture of ureteral muscular wall, stage of the disease and extention of the upper urinary tract. Criteria of drainage method choice were determined depending on age of the children, morphological data, NMUD stage and degree of VUR. In NMUD stage II and III and VUR degree 4 characterized by manifest changes of upper urinary tract contractility intubating drainage is more effective. In insignificant changes of ureteral contractility (NMUD stage I and VUR degree 1-3) internal stent is a method of choice. Thus, treatment outcomes in NMUD and VUR depend not only on surgical method but also on the method of drainage.
