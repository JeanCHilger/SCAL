Independent risk factors for renal damage in a series of primary vesicoureteral reflux: a multivariate analysis. The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors associated with different extents of renal parenchyma involvement in a paediatric series of primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).A total of 549 patients with VUR were analyzed. The variable of interest was renal scar, assessed by technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scan, and classified into three subtypes: focal scar, multiple cortical scarring and diffuse scars with a contracted renal unit. The multinomial regression model was applied to identify independent variables associated with each subtype of renal damage.After adjustment, four variables remained independently associated with a contracted renal unit: reflux grades III-V (odds ratio (OR)=9.7 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.1-21.0), age at diagnosis (OR=3Our findings suggest that the development of a contracted renal unit is probably due to congenital malformation, more commonly observed in male infants with high-grade reflux.
