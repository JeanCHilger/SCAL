Transforming growth factor-beta1 in congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction: diagnosis and follow-up. To assess the role of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction at diagnosis and during postoperative follow-up.We conducted a case-control study including 19 patients with a mean age of 6.7 years and 19 matched controls. All patients presented negative voiding cystourethrography, obstructive diuretic renogram and underwent dismembered pyeloplasty. Urinary TGF-beta1 and other markers were measured pre-, intra- and postoperatively.The mean bladder urine TGF-beta1 concentration in obstructed patients prior to pyeloplasty was higher than in controls (92.5 pg/mL +/- 16.8 vs. 35.8 pg/mL +/- 16.2 p = 0.0001). The mean renal pelvic urine TGF-beta1 concentration in the hydronephrotic kidney was higher than in the preoperative bladder urine sample (122.3 pg/mL +/- 43.9 vs. 92.5 pg/mL +/- 16.8TGF-beta1 is a cytokine leading to renal fibrosis. The measurement of urinary TGF-beta1 could become a useful tool for the diagnosis of obstructive hydronephrosis and the evaluation of the parenchyma function status, pre and postoperatively.
