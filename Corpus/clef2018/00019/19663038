Postnatal evaluation of infants with an abnormal antenatal  renal sonogram. Antenatally detected renal abnormalities are frequently encountered. Recommended postnatal evaluation of these infants has evolved to minimize invasive testing while maximizing detection of significant abnormalities.There is a low rate of detectable renal abnormalities in infants with a normal postnatal sonogram at 4-6 weeks of age. Routine prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated in infants with isolated antenatal hydronephrosis. Infants with a multicystic dysplastic kidney and a normal contralateral kidney on renal ultrasound do not require further evaluation. Parents of these children should be counseled on symptoms of urinary tract infections to allow prompt diagnosis.All infants with abnormalities on antenatal sonogram should undergo postnatal evaluation with a sonogram after birth and at 4-6 weeks of age. Further evaluation can be safely limited when the postnatal sonogram is normal at 6 weeks of age.
