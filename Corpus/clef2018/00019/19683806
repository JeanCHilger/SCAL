Dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer implant calcification mimicking distal ureteral calculi on ultrasound. We report 2 patients with a history of vesicoureteral reflux who were treated with intraureteral and/or subtrigonal injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer they later developed calcification within the region of injection, as seen on ultrasound, which mimicked ureterovesical junction calculi. The radiologist reporting the studies suggested the presence of a distal ureteric calculus in the first case and a distal ureteric calcification in the second case. The ultrasound findings were incidental with no hydronephrosis and both patients were asymptomatic without hematuria. Follow-up ultrasound studies remained unchanged. Calcification of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer implants may mimic distal ureteral calculi, and careful initial observation is recommended.
