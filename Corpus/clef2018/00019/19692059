Abnormal dimercapto-succinic acid scan is a predictive factor of breakthrough urinary tract infection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux. We investigated factors affecting the breakthrough urinary tract infection rate during prophylactic antibiotic treatment in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux.Medical charts were retrospectively reviewed in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux diagnosed at age 12 months or less who received prophylactic antibiotics and underwent (99m)Tc-dimercapto-succinic acid scan. Parameters assessed for their relation to breakthrough urinary tract infection were gender, presenting symptoms, age at presentation, prophylactic antibiotic type, reflux grade at presentation and scan findings.Enrolled in the study were 52 boys and 6 girls with a mean age at presentation of 3.7 months and a mean followup of 42.5 months. Urinary tract infection was a presenting symptom in 46 children. Low reflux grade (1-3) was identified in 18 children and 40 had high grade reflux (4-5). Abnormal (99m)Tc-dimercapto-succinic acid scan was documented in 36 children (62%). During followup breakthrough vesicoureteral reflux developed in 12 children, including 11 of 36 (31%) with an abnormal scan but only 1 of 22 (5%) with a normal scan (p = 0.021). The breakthrough urinary tract infection-free rate during followup was significantly lower in children with an abnormal scan (p = 0.033). Other factors were not significantly associated with the breakthrough urinary tract infection rate.Abnormal (99m)Tc-dimercapto-succinic acid scan may be a factor predicting breakthrough urinary tract infection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux. Prophylactic antibiotics may have a limited treatment role in children with an abnormal scan.
