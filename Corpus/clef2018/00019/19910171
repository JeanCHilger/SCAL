Stop of antibiotic prophylaxis in mild/moderate grade vesico-ureteral reflux. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is found in about 30 % of children with pyelonephritis (PN). It has been identified as a risk factor for the development of urinary tract infections, renal scars, hypertension and chronic renal failure but this risk is considerably smaller than previously assumed. Currently the therapeutic option was to use an antibiotic prophylaxis in order to keep the urinary tract sterile in order to prevent pyelonephritis and new renal scars. The review of the available data has shown that the antibiotic prophylaxis therapy is subject to discussion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the follow up of children with low-grade reflux before and after stopping the urinary antibiotic prophylaxis as soon as they became toilet-trained.Fifty-eight children with low-grade reflux (grade I, II, III) were enrolled in this study. The follow up ranged from October 2002 till February 2007. The children who have not attained bladder control received antibiotic prophylaxis. This treatment was stopped as soon as they became toilet-trained. The presence of urinary tract infection (UTI) was considered in case of unexplained fever and urinalysis and urine culture were performed.VUR, mainly grade II, was discovered at a median age of 16 months. The prophylaxis was stopped at a median age of 40 months. The follow up after stopping the antibacterial prophylaxis was 27 months. Under treatment 2 pyelonephritis occurred, without treatment 2 pyelonephritis and 3 cystitis were diagnosed. At the end of the follow up, the grade of reflux decreased in half of the cases and disappeared in 3 cases.By stopping the urinary antibiotic prophylaxis in children with mild/moderate grade VUR when they became toilet-trained, there is no increase of the incidence of UTI, pyelonephritis. This study does not support the role for urinary antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing the recurrence of pyelonephritis.
