Combination of vesicoureteric reflux and vesicoureteric junction obstruction. This study analysed the association of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and vesicoureteric junction obstruction (VUJO) requiring surgical interventions in infants and children.Over 30 years (1975-2004) 423 infants and children were operated on because of VUR, 163 owing to VUJO and 25 patients (33 ureters) with a combination of VUR and obstruction of the vesicoureteric junction on the same side. For both pathological entities ureteral reimplantation was performed along with excision of the narrowed and refluxing distal ureteric segment. The age of patients at surgery ranged from 3 months to 11 years (average 2.6 years). The female to male ratio was 1.4:1.Out of the 25 patients (33 ureters), both entities were diagnosed before surgery in 10 of them (15 ureters). In 15 cases (18 ureters), only the VUR was preoperatively diagnosed however, the VUJO was only suspected and confirmed during the operation. In one refluxing ureter, the obstruction was not diagnosed during subureteric endoscopic injection of the orifice. In five of the 33 ureters, redo reimplantation was necessary because of obstruction (four ureters) or reflux (one ureter).A combination of VUR and VUJO should be taken into consideration in a patient with proven reflux, where the ureter is dilated and tortuous and following urination the hydronephrosis and hydroureter persist or slowly decrease. In such cases long-term prophylaxis and endoscopic treatment are contraindicated but open surgery (reimplantation) is recommended.
