Metabolic factors associated with urinary calculi in children. We aimed to identify metabolic and anatomical abnormalities present in children with urinary calculi.Metabolic evaluation was done in 142 pediatric calculus formers. Evaluation included serum biochemistry measurement of daily excretion of urinary calcium, uric acid, oxalate, citrate, and magnesium (in older children)Sixty-one patients (42.7%) had metabolic abnormalities. Anatomical abnormalities were found in 12 patients (8.4%). Three children (2.1%) had infectious calculi, and 3(2.1%) had a combination of metabolic and anatomic abnormalities. In 66 children (46.2 %) we did not find any reasons for calculus formation (idiopathic). Urinalysis revealed hypercalciuria in 25 (17.6%), hyperuricosuria in 23 (16.1%), hyperoxaluria in 17 (11.9%), cystinuria in 9 (6.3%), hypocitraturia in 3 (2.1%), and low urinary magnesium level in 1 (0.7%) patients. Sixteen patients (11.2%) had mixed metabolic abnormalities.Metabolic abnormalities are common in pediatric patients with urinary calculi. In our study, calcium and uric acid abnormalities were the most common, and vesicoureteral reflux seemed to be the most common urological abnormality which led to urinary stasis and calculus formation.
