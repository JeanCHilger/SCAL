Bilateral ureteroceles with bilateral secondary hydronephrosis and pelvic ureteral calculi. Case report. Bilateral ureterocele is a rare congenital condition that is usually diagnosed antenatally or in childhood. We present the case of a 64 year-old woman who was admitted for incidentally discovered microscopic hematuria. A bilateral ureterocele and secondary pelvic ureteral calculi were diagnosed by clinical examination (vaginal touch), ultrasound, plain radiography and intravenous urography. A transurethral incision of the ureterocele and extraction of calculi was performed by endoscopic approach. The postoperative recovery was uneventfull. Considering the risk for development of vesicoureteral reflux or recurrence of obstruction at the ureterovesical junction, a close long-term follow-up is required.
