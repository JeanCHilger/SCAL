Radiologic features of implants after endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux in children. Implants after endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children will be more frequently detected on imaging studies and may lead to misinterpretation and unnecessary intervention. This article reviews the radiologic appearance of implants.Radiologic findings of implants depend on the imaging technique, bulking agent, and time after injection. A history of VUR or an antireflux procedure and the absence of hydronephrosis in cases of suspected urolithiasis are important clues to suggest implants.
