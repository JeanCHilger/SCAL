Indirect radionuclide cystography: a sensitive technique for the detection of vesico-ureteral reflux. The detection or exclusion of vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) has classically been by micturating cystourethrography (MCUG). Radionuclide cystography will detect VUR but fails to provide the same detailed anatomical informations as MCUG. This study allowed a comparison of indirect radionuclide cystography (IRC) and MCUG in 65 children. Renal reflux was detected by IRC in 32% of renal units, while VUR was seen in 36% by MCUG. When a comparison was made with MCUG, IRC had a sensitivity of 74.1% and a specificity of 90.5%. The markedly reduced radiation dose, avoidance of a bladder catheter plus the ability to monitor the urinary tract constantly during the entire procedure should ensure that IRC is the examination of choice in follow-up studies for VUR in all toilet-trained children.
