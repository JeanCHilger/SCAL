Importance of prenatal detection of hydronephrosis of the upper pole. To determine the impact of prenatal detection on neonates with hydronephrosis of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system, we reviewed 40 such cases seen between June 1982 and April 1989. This six-per-year rate contrasts with fewer than one case per year that was seen at our hospital from 1947 to 1977. Nineteen patients had an ectopic ureterocele, and 21 had an ectopic ureter without a ureterocele. Thirty-three (83%) were girls. Thirty-three cases were discovered because of abnormal findings on a prenatal sonogram, and 20 of those infants were asymptomatic. In the 33 patients whose prenatal sonographic findings were abnormal, the sonogram was diagnostically precise for hydronephrosis of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system in only 39%. This imprecision did not adversely affect management or outcome. Postnatal sonography modified the prenatal diagnosis in 75% of these 33 patients. Voiding cystourethrography was the most sensitive and precise imaging technique for detecting both ureterocele and reflux. Lower pole reflux was almost twice as common when an ectopic ureterocele was present (63%) than when one was not (33%). Prenatal sonographic detection of hydronephrosis of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system decreased the proportion of neonates presenting with urinary tract infection and urosepsis because of prophylactic antibiotics initiated at birth and continued until surgical correction. Precise prenatal diagnosis was not needed for effective surgical treatment.
