Effectiveness of primary endoscopic incision in treatment of ectopic ureterocele associated with duplex system. To report our experience with the endoscopic treatment of ectopic ureterocele to demonstrate its long-term effectiveness. Endoscopic treatment is often recommended as the initial and definitive treatment in patients with ureterocele.A total of 46 children with ectopic ureterocele in a duplex system underwent primary endoscopic incision from January 1998 to January 2006. The mean follow-up was 3.8 years. Of the 46 children, 35 had been diagnosed prenatally and 11 had been diagnosed after birth because of a urinary tract infection. Low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis was administered to all children and was maintained until voiding cystourethrography showed no reflux. The pre- and postoperative evaluation included clinical assessment, ultrasound evaluation, diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid renography, and cyclic voiding cystourethrography.Ureterocele decompression was achieved in 43 patients (93%). Three patients required additional surgery for persistent ureterocele (1 underwent ureteroureterostomy and 2 ureteropyelostomy). None of our patients showed deterioration of renal function after the procedures. Vesicoureteral reflux was seen in the lower moiety of the ipsilateral kidney in 14 patients (30%). Of the 14 patients with vesicoureteral reflux, 10 had spontaneous resolution. The remaining 4 underwent endoscopic correction. Five patients (10%) developed de novo vesicoureteral reflux in the ipsilateral ureterocele moiety. Of these 5 patients, 3 were treated with endoscopic injection and 2 had spontaneous resolution after 6 months of follow-up.Our data have shown that primary endoscopic puncture of a ureterocele is a simple, long-term, effective, and safe procedure, avoiding complete reconstruction in most patients.
