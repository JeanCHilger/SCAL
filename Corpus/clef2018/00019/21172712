Assessment of parental satisfaction in children undergoing voiding cystourethrography without sedation. Approximately 50,000 children undergo voiding cystourethrography annually. There is a recent trend toward using sedation or delaying voiding cystourethrography due to the anticipated distress to the patient. We hypothesized that with adequate preparation and proper techniques to minimize anxiety, voiding cystourethrography can be performed without sedation. We assessed parental satisfaction associated with patient and parent experience of voiding cystourethrography without sedation.We used a 33-question survey to evaluate parental satisfaction with patient and parent experience of voiding cystourethrography without sedation. Children were divided into 3 groups according to toilet training status. Statistical analysis was performed using StataÂ®.A total of 200 surveys were completed. Of the children 54% were not toilet trained. Of the parents 90% reported adequate preparation. More than half of parents classified the experience of voiding cystourethrography as equivalent to or better than a physical examination, immunization, ultrasound and prior catheterization. Most parents were satisfied with the ability of the child to tolerate the procedure and considered the experience better than expected. Children in the process of toilet training had the most difficulty with the procedure, correlating with lower levels of parental satisfaction.Voiding cystourethrography performed with adequate preparation and support can be tolerated without sedation. Children in the process of toilet training and females tolerate the procedure least.
