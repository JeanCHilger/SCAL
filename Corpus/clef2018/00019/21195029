Preliminary data on endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteric reflux with polyacrylate polyalcohol copolymer (Vantris®): surgical outcome following single injection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of single injection of a new non-biodegradable agent (Vantris(®)) Manufactured by Promedon, Cordoba, Argentina for treatment of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR).38 children (11 males and 27 females) with a mean age of 5.3 ± 3.8 years underwent endoscopic treatment of VUR using Vantris. VUR was unilateral in 17 and bilateral in 21 patients, comprising 59 renal refluxing units (RRU). The VUR was primary in 42 RRU and 17 comprised complex cases: 3 duplex systems, 1 with prune belly syndrome, and 13 after failed previous endoscopic correction with Deflux(®). VUR was Grade I in 5, II in 11, III in 23, IV in 15 and V in 5 RRU.All patients completed 3 months of follow up. The reflux was corrected in 56 (94.9%) of the 59 RRU (35/38 patients) after a single injection. Of the 38 patients, 21 completed 1 year of follow up, at which time ultrasound demonstrated no change compared with 1 month after injection. Eight of these 21 children underwent 1 year radionuclide cystography, and no reflux recurrence was shown.Our short-term data show that Vantris injection provides a high level of reflux resolution. Long-term follow up with this tissue-augmenting substance is required.
