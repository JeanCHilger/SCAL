Contrast-enhanced sonography in pediatrics. Microbubble US contrast agents are composed of an outer shell of protein, phospholipid or polymer that encase air or perfluorocarbon gas. These contrast agents have been widely used in adult cardiology patients to improve endocardial border delineation and have been proved safe and well tolerated in this patient population. There is also a growing body of literature elucidating the value of contrast-enhanced sonography to distinguish benign from malignant liver lesions in adults and to characterize non-hepatic adult malignancies. Because these agents have not been approved for pediatric use in many countries, less is known of the value of contrast-enhanced sonography in children. In this review I will discuss several proven and potential pediatric applications of contrast-enhanced sonography.
