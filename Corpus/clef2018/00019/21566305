Accuracy of cystosonography in the diagnosis of vesicourethral reflux in children. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is found in 1% of all children and in 30%-50% of those with urinary tract infection. Furthermore, VUR in childhood is the main reason for pyelonephritis, hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Recently, a variety of procedures with low radiation have been recommended for diagnosis of VUR. Therefore, in this study, voiding urosonography (VUS) or cystosonography was performed for evaluation of VUR and for comparing it with radio nucleotide cystography (RNC). We studied 25 children admitted with initial diagnosis of VUR in our center in the year 2007. Simultaneously, RNC and VUS were performed for all the patients. VUR was detected in eight patients with the VUS procedure and in nine children with RNC. Another patient was diagnosed only by RNC, and two other patients by only VUS. The two methods were concordant in detection and exclusion of urinary reflux in 87% (P: 0.000, r: 0.728). Furthermore, the diagnosis of various grades of reflux by these two schemes were comparable (P: 0.0000, r: 0.724). Sensitivity and specifity of VUS was determined as 87% and 88%, respectively, with a 94% positive predictive value and a 77% negative predictive value. We conclude that VUS is a highly accurate, safe and inexpensive tool for the screening, diagnosis and follow-up of VUR.
