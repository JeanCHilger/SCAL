Vesicoureteric reflux in children: prediction with color Doppler imaging. Work in progress. Unlike gray-scale sonography, color Doppler ultrasonography allows reliable visualization of the ureteric jet phenomenon. A study was undertaken to determine whether any measurable parameter predicts the presence of vesicoureteric reflux. Measurements of mean urine jet velocity, longitudinal angle, transverse angle, and distance of the origin of the jet from the midline of the bladder were obtained on 31 infants and children (62 ureters) with a proved urinary tract infection. Of these measurements, only the distance of the ureteric orifice from the midline of the bladder was found to correlate with vesicoureteric reflux (mean distance in the reflux group, 10.25 mm +/- 2.40 (standard deviation [SD]) in the nonreflux group, 7.98 mm +/- 2.40 [P = .004]). The authors conclude that the more laterally positioned the ureteric orifice, the more likely it is to reflux. Color Doppler ultrasound measurement of the laterality of the ureteric orifice may be useful for predicting which children with a urinary tract infection would benefit from voiding cystourethrography.
