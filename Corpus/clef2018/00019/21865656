Endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux using dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer in children: results of postoperative follow-up with real-time 3D sonography. We evaluated whether real-time 3D ultrasound (4D-US) together with clinical evaluation is an alternative to voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) after endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children at postoperative follow-up.We reviewed 178 children who underwent endoscopic therapy with dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer in grade II or III VUR between 2002 and 2005. 4D-US was performed in all patients 1 day and 3, 9 and 18 months after endoscopic therapy. Only children with postoperative urinary tract infections (UTIs) and/or nonorthotopic position of the bulking agent were referred for VCUG.In 93% of the ureteral units, the depot could be detected in the orthotopic position after 3, 9 and 18 months. None of these children developed UTIs in the postoperative follow-up. Twelve children demonstrated a shifting of the depot, indicating a possible therapy failure. Eight of these 12 patients (66.7%) presented a positive VCUG, and 50% of them sustained UTIs.4D-US seems to be a sufficient protocol in the follow-up of children after endoscopic treatment of low-grade VUR. VCUG should be performed in cases of a shifted position of the depot invasive investigations are unnecessary in asymptomatic children with orthotopic bulk.
