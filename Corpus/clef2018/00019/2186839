Ultrasound cystography in the diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux. Vesicoureteric reflux is common in children with urinary tract infection and may cause end-stage renal failure. The diagnosis is usually based on micturating cystourethrography (MCU). We describe an alternative technique using ultrasound during bladder infusion with agitated saline. Comparison of the 2 methods shows ultrasound to be 100% sensitive in the detection of grades 3 and 4 reflux. Conclusive evidence of reflux was seen in 2 cases where MCU was subsequently normal, questioning the role of MCU as the gold standard.
