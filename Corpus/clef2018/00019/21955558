High-pressure balloon dilatation for treatment of orthotopic ureterocele. Transurethral puncture or endoscopic unroofing is the best treatment currently used for both orthotopic and ectopic ureteroceles. However, they have a high incidence of secondary vesicoureteral reflux and subsequent procedures in both groups. We present a new technique for treatment of orthotopic ureterocele.We have analyzed 4 patients with orthotopic ureterocele (9.7 ± 6.2 months old) treated by dilatation of the meatus of the ureterocele. No patient had vesicoureteral reflux or duplicate systems. The indication was pyonephrosis in 2 children and progressive worsening of hydronephrosis in 2. Dilatation was performed with 5 or 6mm high-pressure balloon after inserting a stent with guidewire of 0.014" to the ureterocele.There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications, surgical time being 24 ± 9minutes. All patients were discharged at 24 postoperative hours. Ureterohydronephrosis disappeared in all the children and they continue asymptomatic after 35 ± 22.5 months of follow-up. There were no cases of secondary vesicoureteral reflux and renal scan was unchanged after treatment.High pressure balloon dilatation of the meatus in cases of orthotopic ureterocele is a fast, safe and successful surgical technique. We did not find any cases of secondary vesicoureteral reflux or subsequent procedures in our series, so we believe this may offer significant benefits over the transurethral puncture in such patients.
