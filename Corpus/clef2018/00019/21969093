Matrix metalloproteinase 9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 in vesicoureteral reflux. The aim of this study was to investigate whether urine levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (uMMP9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (uTIMP1) are novel biomarkers of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and to determine the optimal cut-off levels of these enzymes to predict VUR in children. The study group consisted of 67 children with VUR and 20 healthy children. Urine MMP9 and TIMP1 levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Children with VUR had significantly higher uMMP9 (1,539.8 vs. 256.4 pg/mL p = 0.0001) and uTIMP1 (182 vs. 32.6 pg/mL
