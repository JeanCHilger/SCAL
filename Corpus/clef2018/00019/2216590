Urinoma formation in posterior urethral valves: relationship to later renal function. A retrospective analysis of radiologically determined individual renal function was performed in five boys who presented in the neonatal period with posterior urethral valves, vesicoureteral reflux and documented urinoma formation. Renal function was evaluated with scintigraphy. There was reflux in eight of ten ureters. Six of these ureters had an associated urinoma and compromised renal function in the neonatal period. In two of the boys the kidney with urinoma functioned better than the contralateral kidney with reflux alone. In two other boys with unilateral urinoma the contralateral ureter did not reflux and the affected kidney functioned less well. In follow up (20 to 36 months) seven of the ten kidneys have a near normal appearance or function. Those kidneys which are now abnormal were noted to be abnormal in the neonatal period.
