Dextranomer-hyaluronic acid implants misdiagnosed as bladder tumor on transvaginal ultrasonography. The endoscopic injection of dextranomer-hyaluronic acid has become a popular treatment for childhood vesicoureteral reflux. Treated children are predominantly girls, and many are now entering adulthood. It has been reported in children that the radiographic appearance of implants may lead to misdiagnoses and unnecessary, invasive diagnostic procedures.We report the case of a woman treated with dextranomer-hyaluronic acid for childhood vesicoureteral reflux misdiagnosed with a bladder tumor on transvaginal ultrasonography. Renal ultrasound examination and urinalysis results were normal. Invasive testing was avoided given the history and characteristic ultrasonographic appearance of retained implants.It is important for health care providers to be aware of the radiographic appearance of dextranomer-hyaluronic acid implants in adults and to elicit an appropriate past medical history to avoid misdiagnosis and invasive diagnostic procedures.
