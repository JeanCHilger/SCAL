How does the presence of antenatally detected caliectasis predict the risk of postnatal surgical intervention? To determine the effect of antenatally detected caliectasis on the postnatal surgical intervention rate.From 2006 to 2010, 56 patients with an anteroposterior diameter (APD) of 7-20 mm on the prenatal ultrasound scan performed in the third trimester of pregnancy were included in the present study. In these 56 patients, other anomalies (vesicoureteral reflux, posterior urethral valves, duplex system, megaureter) were excluded, and the postnatal clinical and radiologic follow-up data were available. The mean follow-up was 12.82 ± 10.72 months. These 56 patients were divided into 2 groups: those with (n = 32) and without (n = 24) caliectasis. In the caliectasis group, the mean follow-up was 13.6 ± 12.09 months and was 11.7 ± 8.70 months in the group without caliectasis. The statistical correlation between the postnatal operation rates and the presence of caliectasis (APD range 7-20 mm in third trimester) was investigated using the chi-square test.In the study group (n = 56) with an APD range of 7-20 mm in the third trimester, postnatal surgical treatment (pyeloplasty) was performed in 12 (37.5%) and 3 (12.5%) of the children with and without caliectasis, respectively (P = .037). The risk of postnatal surgical treatment increased threefold in patients with an APD of 7-20 mm and a diagnosis of caliectasis (relative risk 3.0, 95% confidence interval 1.07-8.40).In our study, the presence of concomitant caliectasis within the APD range of 7-20 mm on the third trimester ultrasound scan increased the risk of surgical treatment threefold. During prenatal counseling, the presence of caliectasis requires more rigorous follow-up.
