Serial voiding urosonography: a safe technique for the study of the entire urinary tract in children. For more than a decade, serial voiding urosonography has been one of the imaging modalities used to detect vesicoureteral reflux in children and it is now also used to study the urethra. The main advantage of this technique is it does not irradiate. Given the important recognition of serial voiding urosonography by the European Society of Pediatric Radiology at the last congress in May 2011, we think it is useful to describe how to carry out this technique successfully. In this update on serial voiding urosonography, we describe the indications, the entire procedure, and the different characteristics of this technique, which we understand will soon become the technique of choice for screening for vesicoureteral reflux as well as for urethral pathology in children.
