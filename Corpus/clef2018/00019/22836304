Current management of antenatal hydronephrosis. The strategy for the management of children with urinary tract anomalies has changed considerably as a result of the development of ultrasound equipment and techniques that allow for detailed fetal evaluation. Hydronephrosis is the most common urogenital anomaly detected, suggesting that an obstructive process may be potentially present. The goal of postnatal management is to identify and treat those patients whose renal function is at risk, while leaving alone the high percentage of patients who are at no risk of renal damage. This management involves a spectrum of radiological, medical, and surgical interventions for diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment. In this article, we review our current understanding of the natural history of antenatal hydronephrosis and its management.
