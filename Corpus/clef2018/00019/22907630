Primary neonatal MRSA pyonephrosis. Pyonephrosis is uncommon in adult and paediatric population and very rare in neonates. Neonatal candidal and staphylococcal pyonephrosis has been reported earlier, and this is the first reported case of MRSA pyonephrosis. A case of potentially lethal fulminating primary MRSA pyonephrosis with septic shock in a neonate in whom investigations showed refluxing and obstructing left megaureter requiring successful surgical correction has been reported.
