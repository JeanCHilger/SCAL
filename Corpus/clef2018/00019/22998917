Identifying children with vesicoureteral reflux: a comparison of 2 approaches. Various screening approaches have been proposed to identify the subgroup of children with urinary tract infection who have vesicoureteral reflux. However, few studies have compared the sensitivity of screening approaches in a representative population of young children. We compared the sensitivities of the top-down ((99m)technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan to screen) and biomarker based (C-reactive protein level at presentation) approaches in identifying children with vesicoureteral reflux.We calculated the sensitivity of the 2 screening approaches in detecting vesicoureteral reflux and subsequently high grade (III or greater) vesicoureteral reflux in children.The top-down and C-reactive protein based approaches missed 33% and 29% of cases of high grade vesicoureteral reflux, respectively.The sensitivity of the top-down approach for detecting high grade vesicoureteral reflux was lower than previously reported. Further study of novel methods to identify children at risk for renal scarring is warranted.
