Hypertension in pediatric patients with renal scarring in association with vesicoureteral reflux. To examine the reflux nephropathy rate and severity as well as the hypertension rate in pediatric patients with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).The study included 240 patients with VUR. Renal scarring (RS) was demonstrated by renal parenchymal examination using technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scintigraphy. Office measurements of arterial blood pressure and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) of VUR patients were done during the follow-up period.Follow-up was a mean duration of 24 months. Rates of RS and hypertension increased parallel to increases in the degree of VUR. A gradual elevation in hypertension rates was evident during the follow-up period. All patients with hypertension had RS. Severe RS in 56 patients was associated with increasing blood pressure readings by 24-hour ABPM or office measurements in 19 patients (33.9%). ABPM measurements enabled us to detect additional patients compared with office measurements alone.Hypertension is a serious complication in children with reflux nephropathy and is associated with the severity of RS and VUR grade. ABPM seems to be superior over office measurements of blood pressure in identifying patients with hypertension.
