Predict the spontaneous resolution of vesicoureteral reflux by direct radionuclide cystography. To evaluate the prognostic value of initial direct radionuclide cystography (DRC) for spontaneous resolution of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).Fifty-one children with initial diagnosis and 1-6 years' follow-up of VUR by DRC were enrolled in this study. VUR was graded according to the anatomic grading as (1) mild reflux corresponding to tracer just in ureter, (2) moderate reflux with accumulation of activity in a non-dilated collecting system and ureter, and (3) severe reflux equated with a dilated ureter and collecting system. The severity of VUR was also expressed according to the functional classification as (1) transient reflux, which occurred at filling or voiding phase only and (2) persistent reflux, present in both filling and voiding phases.Twenty-nine of the 51 children had unilateral VUR, and the other 22 had bilateral VUR. In the total of 73 refluxing ureters, there were 12 mild, 49 moderate and 12 severe VUR according to anatomic grading, and 30 transient and 43 persistent VUR according to the functional grading. After follow-up, resolution of VUR was found in 92% (11/12) of mild, 59% (29/49) of moderate and 25% (3/12) of severe VUR (P=.04, mild vs. moderate P=.003, mild vs. severe). Eighty percent (24/30) of transient and 44% (19/43) of persistent reflux showed spontaneous resolution (P=.003).DRC allows anatomic and functional classification of VUR. It is an ideal method for the diagnosis, staging and follow-up of VUR, and provides valuable information to predict the patient's outcome.
