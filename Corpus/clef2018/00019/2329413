Relation of urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux to scars: follow-up of thirty-eight patients. A prospective study compared the outcome of vesicoureteral reflux and recurrent urinary tract infections in children (3 boys, 62 girls) who received medical prophylaxis or underwent surgical correction of reflux. Thirty-eight children returned for reevaluation 6 to 13 years (average 9.5 years) after entry. There was a marked decrease in prevalence and severity of reflux. At entry, 13 had significant scarring that had progressed at follow-up. New scars were documented by dimercaptosuccinic acid scan at follow-up in eight children on the medical regimen and two who were initially treated with surgical correction of reflux. Four patients with high-grade sterile reflux were followed for 6 to 10 years without the development of cortical scars. Our data support the role of urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux, but not sterile reflux, in the pathogenesis of chronic pyelonephritis and reflux nephropathy.
