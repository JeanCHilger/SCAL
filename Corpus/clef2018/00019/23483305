The predictive factors of hydronephrosis in patients with spina bifida: reports from China. To identify the risk factors for hydronephrosis in patients with neurogenic bladder caused by spina bifida.A retrospective analysis of 120 patients with hydronephrosis between January 2005 and 2012 was conducted. The patients were evaluated for the following factors: age, sex, voiding symptoms, experience of using clean intermittent catheterization, history of urinary tract infection (UTI), history of one or more tethered spinal cord release surgery, routine urine examination, serum creatinine, ultrasound for kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urodynamic findings by univariate and logistic regression analyses.Among the 120 patients, 45 (38 %) had unilateral or bilateral hydronephrosis. Univariate analysis indicated that detrusor hyperreflexia, poor compliance (PC), vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), urinary incontinence, high residual urine, and UTI were the significant factors in the incidence of hydronephrosis. Multivariate analysis indicated that PC, VUR, and UTI were the risk factors for hydronephrosis and that detrusor hyperreflexia and urinary incontinence were the protective factors. UTI was the most serious risk factor for hydronephrosis, with an odds ratio of 29.6. Hydronephrosis was not associated with the history of tethered spinal cord release surgery.This study revealed the prognostic risk factors for hydronephrosis. The medical history of patients, imaging examination, and urodynamic parameters play key roles in identifying the risk factors for hydronephrosis.
