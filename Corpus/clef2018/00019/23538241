Prospective study using a new bulking agent for the treatment of vesicoureteral reflux: polyacrylamide hydrogel. Vesicoureteral reflux is frequently diagnosed in the pediatric population. Endoscopic treatment has become a popular form of first-line therapy. Available products offer good short-term success rates. However, the cost of these injected implants is an issue. We evaluated the success of endoscopic treatment for vesicoureteral reflux using polyacrylamide hydrogel.We performed a single center, single surgeon, prospective, off-label study using polyacrylamide hydrogel to treat vesicoureteral reflux. All patients underwent endoscopic subureteral double hydrodistention implantation technique injection followed by renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram at 3 months postoperatively to confirm the absence of de novo hydronephrosis and correction of vesicoureteral reflux (grade 0).A total of 40 patients (69 refluxing ureters) underwent polyacrylamide hydrogel injection. Median age at surgery was 50 months. Bilateral reflux was identified in 29 patients (73%). Nine patients had duplex systems, 2 with reflux into both moieties. Reflux was graded using the International Reflux Study in Children grading system, with grade I seen in 9 ureters, II in 17, III in 20, IV in 18 and V in 5. Mean volume injected was 1.1 ml. Success rate for grade I to III vesicoureteral reflux at 3 months after a single treatment was 87%, and the overall success for all grades was 81.2%.Off-label use of polyacrylamide hydrogel injection therapy for primarily low grade vesicoureteral reflux demonstrates that the technique and short-term success rates are comparable to the most popular bulking agent, dextranomer/hyaluronic acid. These results suggest that further trials comparing polyacrylamide hydrogel and dextranomer/hyaluronic acid would be worthwhile.
