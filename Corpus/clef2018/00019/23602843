Randomized clinical trial comparing endoscopic treatment with dextranomer hyaluronic acid copolymer and Cohen's ureteral reimplantation for vesicoureteral reflux: long-term results. To compare efficacy of Cohen's ureteral reimplantation and endoscopic treatment with Dx/HA in patients with primary VUR grades II, III and IV.From April 2002 to June 2004, patients over 1 year old with VUR grade I, II, III or IV were included. Patients were randomized into two groups: endoscopic treatment (ET) or ureteral reimplantation (UR). In the ET group, an ultrasonography study was performed 24 h and 1 month after surgery, and two voiding cystourethrographies at 3 and 6 months post treatment. In the UR group, an ultrasonography study was done 7 days and 1 month after surgery and a micturial cystography 6 months post surgery. A postoperative nuclear direct cystogram was performed 5 years later in both groups.A total of 41 patients were included in this study: in ET 22 patients with 35 refluxing ureters and in UR 19 patients with 32 refluxing ureters. The VUR grades in ET were: 16 grade II, 16 grade III and 3 grade IV and in UR: 15 grade II, 12 grade III and 5 grade IV. VUR was resolved in 91% (32/35) of ET (28% of ureters needed a second injection), and in 100% of UR group. Five years after the procedure, VUR was still resolved in 30/32 of ET and 32/32 of UR.Short- and long-term follow up shows that multiple endoscopic treatment of VUR grades II, III and IV with Dx/HA is as effective as ureteral reimplantation.
