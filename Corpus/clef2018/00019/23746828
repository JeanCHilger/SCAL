Endoscopic correction of vesicoureteral reflux in children with a solitary kidney: the risk of obstruction. We aimed to review patients with a solitary kidney and ipsilateral vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) who underwent endoscopic correction of VUR (ECVUR) and to evaluate the prevalence of obstruction in this group of patients.We retrospectively reviewed the files of all patients who underwent ECVUR at our center between January 2000 and June 2011. Only patients with a solitary kidney and ipsilateral VUR were included.Thirteen patients met our criteria. Two patients (15.38%) developed obstruction post-ECVUR. Both patients developed anuria in the first 24Â h after surgery and required intervention. Two patients (15.38%) had increasing hydroureteronephrosis that was discovered on follow-up ultrasound, with no symptoms or signs of obstruction. Both were managed conservatively.Our results showed a higher percentage of obstruction post-ECVUR in patients with a solitary kidney (15.38%), who required immediate intervention. Thus, we recommend giving clear instructions to parents of patients with VUR and a solitary kidney post-ECVUR before discharge from the hospital regarding decreased urine output and loin pain. We recommend a follow-up ultrasound to rule out obstruction and detect new-onset hydronephrosis.
