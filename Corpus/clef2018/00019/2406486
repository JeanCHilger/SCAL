Perinatal management of congenital anomalies of the urinary tract detected in utero. The routine use of maternal ultrasonography has led to frequent discovery of fetal anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract. Herein we report on 35 cases with congenital urogenital anomalies which were found during the last 5 years by the prenatal ultrasonography and referred to our clinic either for treatment or consultation. 1. Findings of prenatal ultrasonography There were 12 cases of hydronephrosis, 7 of multicystic dysplastic kidney, 4 of megaureter, 3 of posterior urethral valve, 2 of ureterocele, 2 of vesicoureteral reflux and 5 other cases. Fetal anomalies were diagnosed during routine maternal examination, as intrauterine growth retardation, oligohydramnios, or the recurrent risk secondary to genetic risk factor or previous abnormal pregnancies. Prenatal diagnosis was made as early as 20 weeks of gestation in a case of hypoplastic urethra with large bladder diverticula. In about 30% of cases, abnormalities were found before 30 weeks of gestation. Oligohydramnios was evident in 5 cases. Prenatal diagnosis was correct in about 60% of cases. In the remainder the diagnosis was either incomplete or incorrect. Errors in the diagnosis resulted from difficulties in the differentiation of dilated ureter, intestinal dilation or intraperitoneal cystic masses. 2. Management in newborn periods Of the patients, 12 were treated urologically in newborn periods. Although patients with distended bladder and dilatation of upper tracts first underwent therapeutic placement of the urethral catheter, upper tract diversion with nephrostomy or tubeless ureterocutaneostomy was required in 2 because of continued elevation of serum creatinine levels. In 2 neonates nephrectomy was indicated for unilateral multicystic kidney, because the large cystic mass might compress the intestine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
