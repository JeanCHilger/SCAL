Early clean intermittent catheterization may not prevent dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan abnormalities in children with spinal dysraphism. To determine whether early initiation of clean intermittent catheterization is associated with increased renal preservation in children with spinal dysraphism based on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans.A retrospective review was performed of 100 patients from a pediatric spinal defects clinic from June 2007 to October 2011 who were followed with routine studies including DMSA scans, voiding cystourethrograms, renal/bladder ultrasounds, and urodynamics. DMSA scans were reviewed for evidence of renal cortical loss as defined by presence of scarring or difference in differential function greater than 15%. Multivariate analysis was performed for risk factors for upper tract damage.Renal cortical loss on DMSA scan was found in 43/100 (43%) of patients. CIC was started at birth in 17/100 (17%) of patients with the rest starting at a median age of 5 years (IQR 3-9). Upon multivariate regression analysis, age at DMSA scan (OR 1.21 95% CI 1.08-1.36), history of VUR (OR 8.64Early initiation of CIC may not reduce the incidence of DMSA abnormalities in pediatric patients with spinal dysraphism.
