Vesicoureteral reflux in a nonfunctioning kidney detected by 99mTc-DTPA study. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a well-recognized condition in the pediatric population, but is less well described in the adult population, and its prevalence decreases with increasing age. We describe the case of a 53-year-old male with nonfunctional kidney in which accumulation of radioactivity was observed in the ureter and renal pelvis owing to VUR, which was detected by technetium-99m diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid dynamic renal scintigraphy.
