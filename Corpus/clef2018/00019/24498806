There are various surgical methods for vesicoureteral reflux treatment. Current study evaluates effectiveness and success rate of the Lich-gregoir procedure in treatment of the vesicoureteral reflux.

Surgery outcome and success rate, sonographic findings and complications rate were recorded in follow-up. Patients mean age was 5.85 +/- 3.81 years. 28.1% were male and 71.9% were female. Reflux was unilateral in 53.1% and bilateral in 46.9%. Vesicoureteral reflux grade I to V was in one, 1, 13, 22 and ten patients, respectively. Voiding Cystourethrogram (VCUG) findings were abnormal in all cases before operation. Surgery success rate in first 6 months was 95.7% and was 100% in 8 months after operation. Hydronephrosis disappeared after operation in all cases. Complication occurred in 2 cases (6.25%) with bilateral reflux including urinary intention and lymphocele. Lich-gregoir anti-reflux procedure technique is accompanied with higher success rate, low complication and hydronephrosis improvement and is an appropriate treatment for vesicoureteral reflux in children.
