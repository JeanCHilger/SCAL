A bladder stone within a congenital paraureteral diverticulum: a case report. Paraureteral diverticula are rare in pediatric population. We here present a bladder stone in the congenital paraureteral diverticulum presenting with vesicoureteral reflux. To the best of our knowledge, stone formation in paraureteral diverticulum has not been reported previously. A 5-year-old boy was admitted with the complaint of dysuria. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a bladder stone in a diverticulum arising from right posterolateral wall and a small right kidney. Voiding cystourethrogram confirmed large bladder diverticulum with vesicoureteral reflux. Cystoscopy revealed a giant stone in the paraureteral diverticulum. The stone was removed with open diverticulectomy and right Cohen ureteroneocystostomy was performed.
