The value of direct radionuclide cystography in the detection of vesicoureteral reflux in children with normal voiding cystourethrography. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is one of the most important risk factors for urinary tract infection (UTI). Diagnosis and treatment of VUR is important to prevent irreversible complications, such as renal scarring and chronic renal failure. This study was conducted to assess the value of direct radionuclide cystography (DRNC) in the detection of VUR in children with UTI and a normal voiding cystourethrography (VCUG).DRNC was performed in 35 children with a normal VCUG after an episode of febrile UTI who had hydronephrosis or hydroureter, abnormal acute dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan results and/or febrile UTI recurrence. This study was conducted in the nephrology department of Mofid Children's Hospital, Tehran (Iran).The results were statistically analyzed. Among the 70 ureters studied, 33 (49.1 %) were observed to have VUR. Of these, 17 (51.5 %) had mild, 14 (42.4 %) moderate, and 2 (6.1 %) severe reflux. A significant relationship was observed between DRNC results and DMSA renal scan findings (P < 0.05).Based on our results, we suggest that DRNC may reveal VUR despite a normal VCUG in children with hydronephrosis, abnormal acute DMSA, and/or recurrent febrile UTI.
