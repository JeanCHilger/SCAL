Paediatric vesicoureteric reflux imaging: where are we? Novel ultrasound-based voiding urosonography. Vesicoureteric reflux is an important association of paediatric urinary tract infection. Fluoroscopic micturating cystourethrography and radionuclide cystography have been employed for detecting and grading vesicoureteric reflux. However, both modalities involve ionising radiation, which can pose significant radiation risk to growing children. They also have a lower detection rate due to intermittent fluoroscopic technique in micturating cystourethrography, and lower spatial resolution in radionuclide cystography. Therefore, newer radiation-free ultrasound-based contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography has been developed in Europe for 15 years. This article aimed to summarise the current literature and discuss the first local pilot study in our institution on detection of vesicoureteric reflux by contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography. Contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography is a valid alternative to micturating cystourethrography in assessing vesicoureteric reflux, based on its superior diagnostic performance, reliability, safety, feasibility, and radiation safety for children. Therefore, it should be incorporated in the guideline for investigating paediatric urinary tract infection.
