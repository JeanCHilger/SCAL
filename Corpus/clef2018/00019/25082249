Relationship between ultrasound criteria and voiding ultrasonography (VUS) in the evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). To analyze the usefulness of five ultrasound parameters (ureteral dilatation, renal pelvis dilatation, renal parenchyma width reduction, calyceal dilatation, and urothelial reaction) in detecting vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).The study included 101 patients with diagnosed and therapeutically treated urinary infection. The ultrasound examination and voiding urosonography (VUS) were carried out according to a standard protocol. In the group of patients with proven VUR the presence of the indirect ecomorphological signs of VUR was evaluated.The referral diagnosis urinary tract infection was present at the admission in 53 patients, while the remaining 48 patients were admitted with the diagnosis of infectio tractus urinarii recidivans. Pathological VUS was found in 53 patients. The ultrasound parameter with the highest sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (77.4%, 79.2%, and 76.0%, respectively) in detection of VUR was urethral dilatation, while the parameter with the highest positive predictive value (62.5%) in detection of VUR was urothelial reaction.In case of ultrasound verification of ureteral dilatation or urothelial reaction, especially in if the urinary infection has proved, it is necessary to exclude the existence of VUR.
