Early effect of American Academy of Pediatrics Urinary Tract Infection Guidelines on radiographic imaging and diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux in the emergency room setting. In 2011 the AAP revised practice parameters on febrile urinary tract infection in infants and children 2 to 24 months old. New imaging recommendations invigorated the ongoing debate regarding the diagnosis and management of vesicoureteral reflux. We compared evaluations in these patients with febrile urinary tract infection before and after guideline publication.During 2 separate 6-month periods 350 patients 2 to 24 months old were evaluated in the emergency room setting. Demographics, urine culture, renal-bladder ultrasound, voiding cystourethrogram and admission status were assessed.A total of 172 patients presented with initial febrile urinary tract infection in 2011, of whom 47 (27.3%) required hospitalization, while 42 of 178 (23.6%) were admitted in 2012. Admission by year did not significantly differ (p = 0.423). After guideline revision 41.2% fewer voiding cystourethrograms were done (72.1% of cases in 2011 vs 30.9% in 2012, p <0.001). A 17.2% decrease in renal-bladder ultrasound was noted (75.6% in 2011 vs 58.4% in 2012, p <0.001). Of 55 voiding cystourethrograms 21 (38.2%) were positive in 2012 compared to 36.3% in 2011 (p = 0.809). Mean ± SD maximum vesicoureteral reflux grade was unchanged in 2011 and 2012 (2.9 ± 1.2 and 2.5 ± 0.93, respectively, p = 0.109). There was no association between abnormal renal-bladder ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram positivity (p = 0.116).AAP guidelines impacted the treatment of infants and young children with febrile urinary tract infection. We found no relationship between renal-bladder ultrasound and abnormal voiding cystourethrogram, consistent with previous findings that call ultrasound into question as the determinant for additional imaging. Whether forgoing routine voiding cystourethrogram results in increased morbidity is the subject of ongoing study.
