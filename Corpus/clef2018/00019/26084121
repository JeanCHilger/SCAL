Urodynamic disorders and renal scarring in pediatric patients with nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis. In nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE), the incidence of organic abnormality and urodynamic disorder is more frequent than the general population. The aim of this study is to identify urodynamic disorders and renal scarring in children with NMNE.This study evaluated the urodynamic disorders and renal scarring of a total of 30 patients who were diagnosed with NMNE. A video-urodynamic test and Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy were applied.Records of 605 patients who had been diagnosed with enuresis were analyzed, and 215 (33.5%) of them had been diagnosed with NMNE. Thirty patients older than 6 years old with NMNE were included in the study. Detrusor overactivity was identified in 10 patients. Bladder capacity was low in 5 patients and bladder compliance was low in 2 patients. Renal scarring was identified in 1 patient. Unilateral vesicoureteral reflux was found in 4 patients.Bladder function disorder is also a significant risk factor for the development of renal scarring, besides other risk factors. Organic abnormalities are seen more often in patients with NMNE than patients with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, so urodynamic studies should be remembered for patients with NMNE.
