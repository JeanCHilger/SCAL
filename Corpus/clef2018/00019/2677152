Treatment of vesico-ureteral reflux in children by endoscopic injection of teflon. Evaluation of 2 years' experience. Authors treated 131 children with vesicoureteric reflux by endoscopic injection of teflon (217 ureters). At one month follow-up, 88.04% of cases were treated successfully after the first injection, 93.22% of these good results were effective one year later. A complete correction was obtained in 89.3% after one or two injections. Most of recurrence was attributed to insufficient amounts of Teflon and to difficult anatomical conditions. Indications of this procedure and safety of the paste used are discussed.
