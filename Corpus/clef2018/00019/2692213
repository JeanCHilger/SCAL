Application of Doppler color flow imaging method on the detection of vesicoureteral reflux. The doppler color flow imaging method was employed to detect the vesicoureteral reflux. The ultrasound examination was performed by using the doppler color flow imaging system. Ultrasonic sector scan was carried out by the use of the 3.75 MHz phased array and/or conbex array transducer with a transabdominal approach. The flow in the bladder from the ureteral orifice to the bladder was detected with a red color indicating the direction towards the probe and the flow from the bladder towards the ureteral orifice during the vesicoureteral reflux was detected with a blue color indicating the direction away from the probe. The doppler color flow imaging method appears to be a useful diagnostic procedure for the detection of the vesicoureteral reflux.
