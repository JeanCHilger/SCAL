"Indirect" radioisotope cystography after the furosemide test: its diagnostic efficacy compared to "direct" study. The diagnostic efficacy was investigated of "indirect" radionuclide cystography after a furosemide test in the detection of vesicoureteral reflux. A single i.v. injection of 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (DTPA) was administered during sequential renal scintigraphy. "Direct" radionuclide cystography with 99mTc-DTPA was assumed as the "golden standard". Thirty-three patients, 24 of whom in pediatric age, were examined with "indirect" radionuclide cystography after a furosemide test: the method had 32% sensitivity according to restrictive positivity criteria versus 59% according to less restrictive ones. In conclusion, "indirect" radionuclide cystography, in spite of the advantages coming from the use of the diuretic, cannot be considered as an efficient technique to recognize vesicoureteral reflux, especially when the latter is present at a low degree.
