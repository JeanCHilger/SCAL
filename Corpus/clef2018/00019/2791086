Radionuclide examination of kidney function in children with vesico-renal reflux. The authors report on their experience with the assessment of radionuclide, separated renal clearance in children with unilateral vesicorenal reflux. The radiopharmaceutical preparation 131I-orthoiodohippuran was used, the result of the examination was a separated effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) which was assessed according to a modification of Oberhausen's method. A total of 28 children were examined. In 8 children the vesicorenal reflux was grade III and IV, in 20 children a unilateral grade II vesiculorenal reflux was involved. In both groups the authors demonstrated a significant functional deficit (p less than 0.001) of the kidney with the reflux despite the fact that in the second group all children had normal excretory urography, a negative urinary sediment and a normal creatinine and urea blood level.
