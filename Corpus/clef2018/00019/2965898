Suprapubic micturition cystourethrography. Suprapubic micturition cystourethrography is performed by puncturing the bladder aseptically, in the midline, 1 to 2 cm above the symphysis pubis with an 18 to 21 gauge needle. The needle is pointed 10 to 15 degrees cranially to avoid puncture of the trigonum and urethra. Anaesthesia, antibiotic protection, and diuretics are not necessary. In 225 examinations performed on 200 patients, the only complications noted were transient haematuria (1.5%) and slight extravasation of contrast medium through the puncture sites (8%). None required any therapeutic measures. In 4 patients puncturing of the bladder needed ultrasound guidance. The technique is ideal for the study of vesicoureteral reflux, neurogenic bladder, urethral strictures, posterior urethral valves and other urethral pathology. It is also useful in balloon catheter dilatation of urethral strictures. Suprapubic micturition cystourethrography is safe, efficient and time-saving. It is well accepted by the patients and carries little risk of urinary infection.
