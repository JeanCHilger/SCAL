Sensitivity of 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid for the diagnosis of chronic pyelonephritis: clinical and theoretical considerations. Radioisotopic renal imaging proved to be much more sensitive than excretory urography in diagnosing renal parenchymal damage in 6 children with acute febrile urinary tract infections. This increased sensitivity may affect clinical management. More importantly, it may change the interpretation of scientific studies evaluating the natural history and treatment of vesicoureteral reflux.
