Elusive vesicoureteral reflux in children with normal contrast cystograms. Recurrent pyelonephritic episodes in children with normal contrast cystograms pose a difficult management problem, since the lack of demonstrable reflux adversely affects the treatment. A total of 10 children with clinical symptoms of pyelonephritis in whom normal contrast cystograms had been performed properly subsequently had significant degrees of reflux detected by isotope cystography. These findings indicate that isotope cystography should be included in the evaluation of patients with pyelonephritis in whom reflux is not confirmed by conventional contrast medium techniques.
