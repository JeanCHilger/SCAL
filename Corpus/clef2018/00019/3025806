Vesicoureteral reflux in asymptomatic siblings of patients with known reflux: radionuclide cystography. The familial nature of vesicoureteral reflux among siblings of patients with vesicoureteral reflux has been reported to be from 8% to 32%. These included both symptomatic and asymptomatic siblings. The incidence of vesicoureteral reflux in asymptomatic siblings, however, has not been studied extensively. Sixty asymptomatic siblings of patients known to have vesicoureteral reflux were studied with radionuclide voiding cystography. Their ages ranged from 2 months to 15 years (mean, 4.2 years). Vesicoureteral reflux was detected in 27 of 60 (45%) of the siblings. Vesicoureteral reflux was unilateral in 15 and bilateral in 12 of the siblings. Radionuclide cystography is more sensitive than radiographic cystography and results in a very low radiation dose to the patient. The gonadal dose with radionuclide cystography is only 1.0 to 2.0 mrads. Because of these features, radionuclide cystography is a nearly ideal technique for the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux in siblings of patients with known vesicoureteral reflux. All siblings (symptomatic or asymptomatic) of patients with known vesicoureteral reflux should have a screening radionuclide cystography.
