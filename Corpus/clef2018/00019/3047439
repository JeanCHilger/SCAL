Sonographic assessment of normal renal size in children with myelodysplasia. Periodic assessment of upper urinary tract anatomy and renal size is an important component in the urological management of children with myelodysplasia (spina bifida). As a correlation to a previous study of renal growth in children with spina bifida determined by excretory urography, we evaluated 297 renal ultrasonographic examinations in 145 patients with spina bifida and compared the renal size and growth pattern to those of normal children. Patients with known vesicoureteral reflux (grade 2 or greater), congenital renal anomalies, hydronephrosis, renal scarring or urinary tract surgery were excluded. Mean values and standard deviations for sonographically determined renal length were calculated. In general, mean renal length for each age group was below mean values for normal children. A normal renal growth curve for children with spina bifida, based on sonographic renal measurements, is developed for clinical use.
