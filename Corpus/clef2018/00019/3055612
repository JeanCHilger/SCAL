Acute focal bacterial nephritis and renal abscess associated with vesicoureteral reflux. Report of a case. We report the case of a child with acute focal bacterial nephritis and a renal abscess in the right kidney associated with bilateral vesicoureteral reflux. The patient was treated successfully with antibiotics and bilateral ureterocystoneostomy. Urine has remained sterile since the operation, but the affected kidney has developed progressive scarring. This case suggests that acute focal bacterial nephritis and a renal abscess may cause a small kidney, which looks like a hypoplastic kidney, associated with vesicoureteral reflux.
