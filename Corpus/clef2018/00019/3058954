Vesico-ureteral reflux. Ultrasonographic aspect of endoscopic treatment (excluding follow-up). Thirty four children, mean age 6 years, with reflux of 56 ureters were treated by an endoscopic approach. The technique, a recent innovation, attempts to reinforce the intravesical trajectory of the ureter by the injection of a Teflon disk below the vesical mucosa at the ureteral meatus level. The Teflon disk used is radiotransparent but could always be detected by ultrasound imaging, whatever its size, as a very reflecting image with a posterior cone shadow.
