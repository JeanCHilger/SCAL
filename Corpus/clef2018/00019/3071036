Characterization of intraurethral relations of urine flow in childhood using the Doppler ultrasound technic. In a number of diseases in childhood (vesico-ureteral reflux, myelodysplasia, recurrent urinary tract infection, enuresis) it is important to evaluate the functional patterns of the micturition phase. The therapeutic regimen is influenced especially by changes of the urethral flow resistance. The value of urodynamic methods which are available for the characterization of the micturition phase is limited because of the small anatomic conditions in childhood. The presented method of measurement of the intraurethral urinary flow using an ultrasound doppler technique is recommended as an alternative technique because of its superior diagnostic safety and unrestricted application in childhood.
