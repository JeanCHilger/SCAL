Diagnosis of reflux in children with CO2 and ultrasound. Technic and preliminary results. So far diagnosis and follow-up of vesico-uretero-renal reflux (VUR) is primarily based on radiological voiding studies. However this is accompanied by significant gonadal radiation doses. The goal of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of real time sonography, following CO2 instillation into the bladder with that of conventional radiography in the diagnosis of VUR in children. By means of sonography 13 out of the 16 grade III, and all 16 grade IV and V VUR were seen. 4 out of 7 grade II VUR could be demonstrated. No grade I reflux has been diagnosed. In conclusion, sonography reflux study is a sensitive and specific screening and follow up procedure for VUR. At present 75 per cent of all VUR's can be diagnosed by sonography alone.
