Diagnosis by imaging in renal and urinary tract malformations. Comparison of echography and traditional radiological studies. The diagnostic sensitivity of Ultrasound (US) was studied in 142 children with suspected kidney and urinary tract malformations. According to the clinical tests performed the patients underwent excretory urography (EU) and/or voiding cystouretrography (VCU) the results were compared to US findings. In the 75 patients with malformations, US proved to be extremely sensitive in abdominal renal ectopies, in "horseshoe" kidney, and in congenital obstructions of the ureteropelvic and vesico-ureteral junctions. US showed a higher sensitivity than EU in identifying multicystic kidney and in most cases of hypodysplasia. On the other hand, VCU was more accurate in vesico-ureteral reflux studies
