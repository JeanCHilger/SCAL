Radionuclide cystography in vesicoureteric reflux. We investigated 47 children in whom vesicoureteric reflux was clinically suspected by both conventional radiological and indirect radionuclide cystography. Comparison of the two methods showed no significant difference in their accuracy in detecting vesicoureteric reflux. The advantages and disadvantages of, and indications for, indirect radionuclide cystography are discussed.
