An unusual encapsulated collection of urine (urinoma) in an infant with vesicoureteral reflux. We describe an unusual case of encapsulated collection of urine (urinoma) in a 7-month-old female infant. The clinical diagnosis was urinary tract infection. The retrograde cysto-urethrogram revealed grade III vesicoureteral reflux, which we believe was the cause of the urinoma. The investigation was completed with isotope and ultrasound studies. High pressure reflux was the cause of the urine extravasation in the perirenal space.
