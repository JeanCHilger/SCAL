Enuresis--causes, diagnosis and therapy. 672 children aged between 4 and 16 years were treated for primary or secondary enuresis between 1980 and 1986. The group included more girls than boys. A systematic diagnostic investigation, consisting of a detailed medical history, physical examination, urinalysis and sonography of the kidneys and bladder, was carried out in all cases. This investigation was followed by urodynamic tests to detect any functional disorders of the lower urinary tract. Finally, a voiding cystogram, urethral calibration and urethrocystoscopy were conducted to screen for morphological changes. Three major groups of causes of enuresis were identified. Functional miction disorders were found in 312 (46.4%) children. In these cases there was an inability to voluntarily control the detrusor, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and hyperactivity of the detrusor. 223 (33.2%) of the children had pathological anatomical changes of the urinary tract, such as malformations leading to vesicoureteral reflux, vesicular diverticula, duplication of the upper urinary tract, megaureter, urethral stenosis or urethral valves, with associated infection. Psychogenic disorders were diagnosed in 137 (20.4%) cases. The first group received drug treatment and biofeedback training for reestablishment of conscious control over the vegetative functions of the lower urinary tract. The second group underwent surgery for correction of the pathological anatomical changes. The third group was referred for psychotherapy.
