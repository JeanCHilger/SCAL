The localization of urinary tract infection with 99mTc glucoheptonate scintigraphy. A retrospective study was performed of 39 children at the Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, Illinois, who underwent technetium-99m glucoheptonate (99mTcGH) scintigraphy for evaluation of possible urinary tract infection. Clinical and laboratory criteria classified the children as having pyelonephritis, cystitis, or no urinary tract infection. Of 28 children classified as having pyelonephritis, 24 (86%) children had abnormalities on 99mTcGH scintigraphy. Only 8 of 19 (42%) renal ultrasound scans and 4 of 17 (24%) intravenous pyelography studies performed in these children demonstrated findings consistent with parenchymal disease. Only 9 of 19 (47%) cystograms demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux. Three children who underwent gallium-67 citrate scintigraphy had localization at the sites of focal defects with 99mTcGH scintigraphy. 99mTcGH scintigraphy is a sensitive and specific indicator of renal parenchymal involvement that helps localize urinary tract infection to the kidney.
