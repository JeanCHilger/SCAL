Urinary tract infections in infants and children. Guidelines for averting permanent damage. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in childhood and, early in life, is often associated with vesicoureteral reflux or other urinary tract anomalies. Since the combination of reflux and infection can cause renal scarring and impaired renal function, identification of children at risk and provision of close follow-up are important. Diagnosis in the first year of life relies on a high index of suspicion on the part of the clinician, as signs and symptoms are nonspecific. Reliable cultures are the cornerstone of accurate diagnosis and will be the basis for selection of acute and long-term management. Vigilant follow-up of all children with UTI can prevent ultimate morbidity.
