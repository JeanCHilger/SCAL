Fetal ureteric reflux. Seven babies (six male, one female) with ureteric reflux, all of whom had antenatal renal dilatation, are described together with one other baby who was found to have gross ureteric reflux when investigated following an acute urinary infection at the age of 9 days. There was a strong probability that all of the babies had fetal ureteric reflux (FUR). Radioisotope studies demonstrated parenchymal damage in three of seven and reduced function in four of 10 refluxing kidneys. Subsequent investigation showed no increase in the areas of parenchymal damage but there was evidence that function in some kidneys had deteriorated. It was thought that this was due to disturbances in inter-renal or renal-child related growth velocities. A plea is put forward for more detailed postnatal examination of babies whose urinary tracts show evidence of dilatation antenatally.
