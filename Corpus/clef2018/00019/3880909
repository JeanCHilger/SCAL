Urinary tract infection in infants and children evaluated by ultrasound. Fifty-nine pediatric patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) underwent renal ultrasonography, excretory urography, and voiding cystourethrography. The imaging procedures were analyzed retrospectively to determine their relative effectiveness in detecting abnormalities that might predispose the patient to UTI. Voiding cystourethrography provided valuable information, particularly the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux, that could not be obtained from the other procedures. Excretory urography was less specific than ultrasonography in the majority of patients, with the exception of those who had renal scarring. The authors recommended ultrasonography as the initial imaging procedure in the evaluation of children with UTI. When the sonogram is normal, excretory urography is not considered necessary, but voiding cystourethrography is thought to be essential. If sonography is abnormal, excretory urography and/or other follow-up studies are indicated.
