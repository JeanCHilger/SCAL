Management of myelomeningocele. The care of the patient with myelomeningocele has improved over the last 15 years.

Clean intermittent catheterization can alleviate reflux and in 85 per cent of children can promote continence. The adolescent and adult will continue to require observation and management to ensure their active place in society.
