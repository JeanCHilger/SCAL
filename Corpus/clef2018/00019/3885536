Sonographic biometry in obstructive uropathy of children: preoperative diagnosis and postoperative monitoring. Renal sonography was performed in 92 children with obstructive uropathy or vesicoureteral reflux preoperatively and at follow-up. Renal volume and the anteroposterior diameter of the renal pelvis proved to be the most reliable morphometric criteria for objective sonographic staging and follow-up of urinary tract obstruction. If transient obstruction occurred after uncomplicated antireflux ureterovesico-plasties (n = 41), it lasted at most 4 weeks. Kidneys with transient postoperative ureterovesical junction obstruction (n = 21) reverted to normal sonographic pattern within 4 weeks following ureteral reimplantation. In cases of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (n = 30), it took up to 6 months for the majority of kidneys to present almost normal sonographic findings. Sonographic biometry and the knowledge about the uncomplicated postoperative course render postsurgical monitoring easier and more reliable.
