Identification of children requiring radiologic evaluation for urinary infection. Sixty-nine children younger than 13 years of age with urinary tract infection were evaluated to identify risk factors for treatable urologic problems i.e. those requiring surgery or prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis. All children had a renal ultrasound, intravenous pyelogram and voiding cystogram performed 4 to 6 weeks after the infection. Eleven children with treatable problems were identified, 10 with vesicoureteral reflux and 1 with a ureterocele. For identification of treatable problems the predictive value of a positive test was: (1) fever, 10 of 24 (41.7%)
