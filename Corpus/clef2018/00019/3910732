Vesicostomy: a temporary urinary diversion in childhood. The authors report on 21 pediatric cases of tubeless cystostomies (19 males and 2 females). 15 cases of posterior urethral valves (septic condition and very narrow urethra). 3 primitive vesico-renal refluxes (small bladder, severe impairment of renal function and extensive dilatation of the upper urinary tract). 2 prune-belly syndromes. 1 neurogenic bladder. (Impracticable intermittent catheterization). 19 of the 21 cases showed dramatic improvement (narrowing of the upper urinary tract, disappearance of infection and resumption of staturo-ponderal thrive). Only 1 child with valves had to be put on cutaneous ureterostomy. The improvement in the upper urinary tract, as seen on the IVP, is very rapid in valve cases without reflux. The improvement is visible earlier on isotopic renal scans than on IVP. 11 children suffered acute pyelonephritis during vesicostomy. There were no cases of cutaneous peristomal modification. Simultaneous closure of the derivation and surgery of the primitive disease were performed in 10 cases after a 1-3 year period of vesicostomy. Vesicostomy will succeed in those babies who have shown clinical and biological improvement after a short period of trans-urethral or suprapubic catheterization. The suprapubic endoscopis treatment of the valves becomes possible through the vesicostomy hole excluding urethral trauma.
