Nodules of renal regeneration in children. Presentation of 2 cases and review of the literature. Although rarely encountered in childhood, renal regenerated nodules present definite characteristics, individualizing this pseudorenal tumor. They appear on kidneys previously affected by infectious or degenerative process. On IVP they do not enlarge the kidney's size, but roll-up the calyces, without amputation. They are homogeneous on ultrasonic investigation, isofixing on radio-isotopic scan., normally vascularized on computerized angiography, if a doubt upon nephroblastoma imposes this investigation. The percutaneous puncture biopsy, aided by sonography, shows normal glomeruli and tubules two or three times wider than usual, without scars of the original disease. Some authors consider them as a peculiar pattern of hypertrophic compensation, starting from remaining healty renal parenchyma. Reasons of their i frequency, and functional value are still unknown.
