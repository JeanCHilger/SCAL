Estimation of glomerular filtration rate in children using 99m-technetium DTPA. A comparison with 51-chromium EDTA clearance. The usefulness of radionuclide imaging studies with 99m-technetium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Tc-DTPA) for quantitating the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in children was studied. This was compared to the conventional methods for measuring GFR using 51-chromium-EDTA clearance (Cr-EDTA), creatinine clearance and a height/plasma creatinine formula. In the 22 children studied, the correlation coefficient between renal uptake of DTPA and Cr-EDTA was 0.90 (p less than 0.001). In contrast, there was a poorer correlation between Cr-EDTA and creatinine clearance (r = 0.69) or the derived GFR using height/creatinine formula (r = 0.83). The regression line between Tc-DTPA uptake and Cr-EDTA clearance was used to derive a formula for calculating the predicted GFR. This was tested in 10 additional children, and the correlation between the predicted GFR and measured GFR (using Cr-EDTA clearance studies) was 0.92 (p less than 0.001). Quantitative estimation of the GFR during renal imaging studies is a feasible and convenient method of assessing renal function.
