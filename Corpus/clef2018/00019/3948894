Hippuran renography and scintigraphy in children with myelomeningocele. Long-term surveillance of the urinary tract is necessary in children with myelomeningocele and neurogenic bladder dysfunction. The results of Hippuran renography and scintigraphy were analyzed in 52 cases and compared to those of intravenous urography. In addition the radionuclide evaluation was correlated to the clinical course. It was concluded that renography is a suitable examination for the monitoring of the kidneys and upper urinary tract in these children. A decrease of renal function and drainage may occur without any changes of the clinical state.
