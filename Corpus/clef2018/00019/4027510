Unilateral ureteric reimplantation for primary vesicoureteric reflux in children. A policy re-evaluated. Fifty-one children had unilateral ureteric reimplants for primary vesicoureteric reflux over an 11-year period. Reflux was abolished in 50 patients but in 8 (15.7%) it developed or became worse on the contralateral side. An isotope renal scan (99mTc DMSA) was carried out in 15 of the 18 patients who had grossly scarred or dysplastic kidneys. Thirteen of these had less than 22% of total function coming from the affected kidney and seven had less than 10% of their total GFR coming from the kidney whose ureter had previously been reimplanted. Five of these children have undergone nephrectomy and it is felt that this would have been a better initial procedure. No patient was hypertensive at the conclusion of the study.
