The cystometric nuclear cystogram. Vesicoureteral reflux is a common clinical problem that we monitor by interval nuclear cystography. Of the children having nuclear cystograms 40% also have voiding abnormalities, including incontinence (damp pants), urgency and infrequent micturition. We have evaluated these symptoms by recording the intravesical pressure during the nuclear cystogram. This combined examination, the cystometric nuclear cystogram, has been done on 46 children. An abnormal cystometrogram was found in 61% of the children with a voiding abnormality and helped to establish a basis for successful therapy. The cystometric nuclear cystogram aids in the diagnosis and rational therapy of childhood voiding abnormalities. It is a practical method to obtain a cystometrogram in children with voiding abnormalities who are being evaluated for ureteral reflux and it has facilitated the management of childhood ureteral reflux.
