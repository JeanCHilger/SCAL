Ileocecal reflux. A potential source of error with nuclear cystography in the patient with ileocecocystoplasty. Nuclear cystography is recommended for the evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux because of its high sensitivity and its low radiation exposure. We encountered a potential source of false-positive studies in patients who have had an ileocecocystoplasty for bladder augmentation. This case presentation illustrates the findings in such a patient.
