Measurement of vesicoureteral reflux with intravenous 99mTc-DTPA compared to radiographic cystography. The results of a 99mTc-DTPA study of vesicoureteral reflux in 51 children with recurrent urinary tract infections were compared with those of radiographic micturition cystourethrography. Reflux, shown by either of the two methods, was regarded as an indication of the disorder. Neither method was regarded as a standard reference method. Agreement between the two methods was obtained in 90 of 102 renal units, i.e., ureter and/or renal pelvis (88%). Statistical analysis performed on the remaining 12 cases showed that the two procedures usually gave similar results.
