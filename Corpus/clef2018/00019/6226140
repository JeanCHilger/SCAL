Radionuclide voiding cystography. Radionuclide voiding cystography is a sensitive and accurate method for diagnosing vesicoureteric reflux. This method allows for continuous monitoring of bladder filling and emptying, permits detection of reflux at any time during the study, and evaluates its dynamics. Since it results in very low amounts of radiation to the patient, it is an ideal method for the diagnosis and follow-up of children with reflux.
