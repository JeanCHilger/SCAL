Renal nuclear imaging and analysis in pediatric patients. Because a renal scan reflects the physiologic configuration and function of the kidney, it provides information that cannot be obtained with conventional intravenous pyelography. It is particularly useful in children with hydronephrosis, vesicoureteral reflux, chronic pyelonephritis, and congenital renal anomalies.
