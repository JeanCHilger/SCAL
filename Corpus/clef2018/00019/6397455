The usefulness of ultrasound in the post operative management of hydronephrosis. The renal tracts of thirty-four children aged between 6 months and 12 years, with vesico-ureteric reflux or obstructive hydronephrosis were examined by ultrasound (US) pre and post operatively, in an attempt to determine the validity of US as an alternative means of diagnostic imaging. The results show the technique to be both accurate and reproducible and we therefore believe that US is a reliable procedure for monitoring urinary tract morphology in patients with hydronephrosis or in the post operative assessment of vesicoureteric reflux.
