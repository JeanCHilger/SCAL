Urinary tract infections in children: renal ultrasound evaluation. Ultrasound may replace urography in screening pediatric patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections but without vesicoureteral reflux. A child undergoing a first radiographic evaluation for urinary tract infection is initially examined by voiding cystourethrography. If reflux is present, urography is performed. If no reflux is present, the kidneys are evaluated by real-time ultrasound urography may also be performed if the ultrasound examination is abnormal, equivocal, or inadequate. A total of 192 patients was evaluated with this protocol
