Perinatal ultrasound monitoring: early detection and treatment of congenital uropathy. In childhood, delay in the diagnosis of congenital obstructive or refluxing urinary tract pathology can contribute to progressive renal failure. Ultrasound examination is a safe and reliable means of investigating the urinary system pre- and post-natally. We describe 13 children investigated with ultrasound during the perinatal period. In 10, pathology was identified in utero, confirmed after birth and treated surgically within 1 month. This indicates that perinatal ultrasonography is a valuable technique.
