Sonographic diagnosis of nephrourologic diseases in infants and childhood. Ultrasound is a harmless and renal function-independent screening procedure to detect malformations of the urinary tract, that need surgical intervention. Because of the paucity of symptoms concomitant with congenital malformations it is important to use this non-invasive exploration method frequently in the early course of the diagnostic investigations. Pathologic sonographic findings should be followed by radiologic exploration. In case of normal renal sonography in patients suffering from first urinary tract infection, further radiologic exploration of the upper urinary tract can be withheld, however ultrasound does not replace radiologic studies of the lower urinary tract. Complications after surgical procedures are readily depicted by sonography, thus avoiding the need for numerous post-operative radiologic study.
