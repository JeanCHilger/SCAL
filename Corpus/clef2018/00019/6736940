Familial study of vesico-ureteral reflux. We report our results of a retrospective study of vesico-ureteral reflux based on the families of 66 index patients. The recurrence risk for sibs is 9,3%. With a prospective approach (ultrasound and uroradiology), the proportion of affected sibs is 26,6%. Our results are discussed with reference to the data of the literature.
