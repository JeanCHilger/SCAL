Ultrasonic demonstration of ectopic ureterocele. The gray scale ultrasound findings in two children with ectopic ureterocele are presented and correlated with traditional radiographic findings. In one case, the diagnosis was made in utero, utilizing ultrasound. The examination is noninvasive and performed quickly, and it may be able to replace the intravenous pyelogram in the initial evaluation of patients suspected of having such congenital anomalies. Retrograde cystography will still be necessary to detect vesicoureteral reflux.
