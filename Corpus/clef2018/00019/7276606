Vesico-renal reflux and compensatory renal hypertrophy (author's transl). The effects of vesico-renal reflux on the proximal kidney vary widely from one child to another and there remains considerable disagreement concerning the harmful consequences of reflux. Even more curious is the fact that in the same child, bilateral, symmetrical and infected reflux with distension of the urinary tract may be accompanied by severe involvement of one kidney whilst the contralateral kidney is not only free of any problem but sometimes even in a state of compensatory hypertrophy. Eight examples (out of a series of 310 cases of reflux in the child) are reported, renal function being assessed by quantitative renal scintigraphy. It would seem that the manner of reaction of a kidney subjected to reflux varies according to whether it is previously healthy or already damaged. But what are the nature and pathogenesis of such pre-existent lesions? Why do they affect some kidneys but not others?
