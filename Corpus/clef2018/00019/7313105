Analysis of vesico ureteral reflux by functional scintigraphy (author's transl). With a large view scintillation camera and gamma 11/34 DEC-System it is possible to detect a reflux out of the bladder, if the volume is 0.2 ml or larger. Description of the function of upper urinary tract is given. Time of reflux beginning a bladder volume combined with measurement of intravesical and intraabdominal pressure and more details of the reflux dynamic are demonstrated. Background activity and absorption of body soft tissue should be corrected by phantom measurement. The results of investigations of 26 patients are shown in tables and by examples of morphologic and functional analyses.
