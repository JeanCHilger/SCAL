The ultrasonic diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux. Potentialities of ultrasonic investigation (USI) in diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) were elucidated by comparison of the USI evidence with that obtained at miction cystourethrography which had identified VUR of degree I-IV. Ultrasonic signs of active and passive VUR distinctly observable in the reflux degree III and IV are noted. The technique of USI in VUR-suspected children is described. Ultrasonic measurements of the intravesicular part of the lower ureter were made. It is shown that USI can serve a method of outpatient selection for miction cystourethrography. As demonstrated by the examination of 58 patients with transplanted kidney, USI is effective in identification of the reflux to the transplanted kidney as well as in differential diagnosis with obstructive complications after transplantation.
