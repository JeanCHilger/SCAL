The STING in the refluxing duplex system. To assess the efficacy of the subureteric Teflon injection (STING) procedure in the refluxing duplex ureter.The STING procedure was performed in 23 patients (five boys and 18 girls, mean age 6.5 years, [range 1.5-14]) with six refluxing upper and 31 refluxing lower moieties. Teflon was injected separately into each moiety of the duplex. All patients were assessed by a micturating cystourethrogram and ultrasonography at least 3 months after treatment and the results were analysed retrospectively for the success rate of each refluxing unit and the overall cure rate of patients.No patient suffered ureteric obstruction. After the first STING the unit cure rate was 57% but only nine of 23 patients were completely cured. This improved to a unit cure rate of 68% and 11 patients cured after a second STING.Because the patient cure rate was poor we do not advocate using the STING to treat vesicoureteric reflux in the duplex kidney.
