Acute pyelonephritis as a cause of hyponatremia/hyperkalemia in young infants with urinary tract malformations. Obstructive uropathy causes tubular resistance to aldosterone and severe metabolic imbalance may be precipitated by an episode of pyelonephritis. In the last 3 years we investigated 52 episodes of pyelonephritis (positive urine culture, elevated C reactive protein, fever, elevated neutrophil count) in 50 children between 15 days and 15 months of age. Ultrasonography voiding cystography and renal scintiscan were performed in all cases and i.v. urography in some. A salt-losing syndrome with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia (Na < 125 meq/liter K > 6.3 meq/liter) was observed in 17 infants < 3 months, accompanied by plasma aldosterone concentration of 5000 to 23,000 pg/ml (normal value, < 1000 pg/ml). All these children had a severe urinary tract (UT) malformation (ureteropelvic junction stenosis in 7 cases, vesicoureteral reflux in 7, posterior urethral valves in 2, double system in 1). Thirteen infants < 3 months, 7 with no urinary tract malformations, did not have electrolyte imbalance. Pyelonephritis was diagnosed in 20 other patients ages 4 to 15 months, including 16 with severe UT malformations
