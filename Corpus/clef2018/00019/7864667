Comparative sensitivity of intravenous urography, ultrasonography and DMSA scan in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux nephropathy. We compared the efficiency of the IVP, the ultrasound and the DMSA scan in the detection of pyelonephritic lesions during the evaluation of 165 kidneys in 83 children, aged up to 14 years, with vesicoureteric reflux. Our study showed an efficiency of 60.20% for the IVP, 29.60% for the ultrasound and 96.90% for the DMSA scan. These results clearly show that the best imaging method for detecting renal scars is the DMSA scan, followed by IVP and ultrasound.
