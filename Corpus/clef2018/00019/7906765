Ultrasonic indicators of ureteric reflux in the newborn. There is controversy over the value of ultrasonic screening for detection of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in babies. We scanned 300 newborn babies and identified 53 with a dilated renal pelvis or other minor abnormalities. Eventually, 9 of these were investigated by voiding cystourethrography and 3 (5 kidneys) proved to have VUR exceeding grade II. In 3 babies the reason for cystourethrography was persistent renal pelvis dilation in 3 it was urinary tract infection
