Color flow Doppler sonography in the diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux. We describe an alternative technique using color flow Doppler sonography (CFDS) for detection of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Twenty-one children, ages 2-16 years, were investigated for VUR using voiding cystourethrography (VCU) and CFDS. Forty-two ureterovesical junctions were studied and a total of 27 were found to be refluxing at VCU. Five of these 21 patients were operated for VUR and they were also reevaluated 3 and 6 months after the operation. With good diuresis ureteric jets could easily be detected with CFDS and if there was a reflux of urine into the ureter this could also be displayed. Afterwards, the patient was asked to urinate and if reflux into the ureter was detected, particular attention was paid to the detection of ureteral and pelvicalyceal dilatation by conventional gray-scale sonography. Taking VCU as the gold standard, CFDS revealed reflux in all cases except 1. There were 3 patients who had only one-sided reflux at VCU and bilateral reflux at CFDS examination (false-positive: 20%). Correlation of CFDS and VCU was 90, 100 and 75% in low grade, grade III and grade IV reflux, respectively. The results of CFDS correlated well with the results of VCU during the follow-up of 5 patients who had antireflux operations. As a conclusion, CFDS could be used as an adjunct to standard ultrasonography for detection of VUR.
