Isotope renography in childhood enuresis. A retrospective review was performed of 100 enuretic children who underwent isotope renography during the period 1981-1989. Studies performed were Tc99mDMSA studies for renal size and to detect renal scarring and renography using Tc99mDTPA or MAG3 to evaluate excretion and detect vesicoureteric reflux. Fifty-five children had microbiological evidence of urinary tract infection (UTI), and 16 (29%) of these had abnormalities on their isotope studies. Forty-five had sterile urine and all had normal isotope studies. Thus despite recent reports of urodynamic abnormalities and increased incidence of reflux in patients with enuresis, our findings indicate that standard nuclear medicine renal studies show few abnormalities in patients with monosymptomatic enuresis. The 29% incidence of abnormal studies in patients with enuresis and UTIs suggests that the presence of infection should be an indication for further investigation in this subgroup of enuretic children.
