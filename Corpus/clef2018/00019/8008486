Ultrasound screening of older asymptomatic siblings of children with vesicoureteral reflux: is it beneficial? The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the prevalence of renal abnormalities in 88 older asymptomatic siblings of the children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), using ultrasound (US) as a diagnostic method. The age of the siblings ranged from 5 to 15 years, the median age being 8.33 years. A midstream urine sample was taken for standard urinalysis and urine culture, and blood pressure was measured in all children. US examination did not reveal chronic inflammatory changes of the kidneys such as a small shrunken kidney, noticeable parenchymal thinning or parenchymal echogenicity changes nor did it reveal a small kidney due to growth retardation or any dilatation of the renal tract to indicate reflux. No hypertension was found. The study failed to prove the benefit of US screening of older asymptomatic siblings. The results of the present study are discussed in relation to other techniques and investigations/screening for VUR.
