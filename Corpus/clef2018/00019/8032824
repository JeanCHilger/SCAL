The significance of vesicoureteric reflux on kidney development assessed by dimercaptosuccinate renal scintigraphy. To study the influence of vesicoureteric reflux on kidney parenchyma and renal length, and identify typical distribution patterns by dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) renal scintigraphy.DMSA renal scintigraphies in 101 children (152 renal units) with vesicoureteric reflux grade 1-5 were reviewed.Three main types of pathological DMSA patterns were found: (i) dysplasia (ii) medial defectThe pathological DMSA distribution with vesicoureteric reflux generally conforms to one of three main patterns. Reduced kidney length is frequent even at lower grades of vesicoureteric reflux even in patients with no history of pyelonephritis, and can be the only sign of pathology.
