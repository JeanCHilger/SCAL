Typical technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid distribution patterns in acute pyelonephritis. Technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintiscans in 37 children with clinical diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis were reviewed. In 18 children, follow-up scintigraphy was obtained after an interval ranging from 5 to 8 months. Uptake abnormalities were found in 89% of the children (74% of the kidneys). We were able to identify four typical pathological uptake patterns: (i) pole defect(s), usually wedge shaped (60%) (ii) lateral wedge shaped defect (4%)
