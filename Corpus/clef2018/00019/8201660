Prenatal findings associated with a unilateral nonfunctioning or absent kidney. Prenatal findings in infants who were postnatally found to have a unilaterally nonfunctioning cystic, dysplastic or absent kidney were evaluated to understand better the prenatal pathophysiology of these conditions. Of the 38 cases in which prenatal and postnatal renal imaging studies were done fetal renal conditions leading to postnatal dysplasia or absence included small echogenic kidneys in 3, typical multicystic dysplasia in 30, obstructive uropathy in 4 and perinephric urinoma in 1. Abnormalities were noted on postnatal imaging in 30% of the contralateral kidneys. Vesicoureteral reflux was the most commonly identified abnormality, occurring in 23% of the cases.
