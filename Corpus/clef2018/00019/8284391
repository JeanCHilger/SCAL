Vesicoureteral reflux: an accurate predictor of acute pyelonephritis in childhood urinary tract infection? To determine the association between vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and the presence of acute pyelonephritis in children with urinary tract infections.The authors studied 150 consecutive patients less than 5 years of age with their first proved urinary tract infection. All patients underwent renal cortical scintigraphy (with technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid or Tc-99m gluconate) and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) to identify the presence of cortical defects and VUR, respectively.Of 300 kidneys, 88 (29.3%) had a cortical defect at scintigraphy. Fifty-four of the 88 patients (61%) did not have VUR demonstrated at VCUG. Conversely, 72 of the 300 kidneys (24%) had VUR of these, 38 (53%) had no cortical defect. The sensitivity of VCUG in helping predict a defect was 38.6%, and the specificity was 82.1%.VUR (as shown by VCUG) and renal cortical scintigraphic defects frequently occur independently of each other. Renal cortical scintigraphy may be a more accurate predictor of patients at risk for scarring.
