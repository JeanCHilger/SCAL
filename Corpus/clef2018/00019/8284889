Urologic manifestations of Goldenhar syndrome. Goldenhar syndrome (oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia) is associated with anomalies in multiple organ systems. Renal abnormalities have also been reported with the complex, but the incidence of associated genitourinary malformations has not been defined.We have reviewed our experience with 28 children with Goldenhar syndrome evaluated during the past twelve years. Twenty children underwent imaging evaluation of the urinary tract and 14 (70% of those imaged) children had urinary tract anomalies.The majority of anomalies presented as an incidental finding on a screening ultrasound (8 patients) or during cardiac catheterization (2 patients). Two children presented with urinary tract infection, 1 child presented with renal failure, and another was diagnosed antenatally. The genitourinary anomalies included the following: ectopic and/or fused kidneys (8 patients), renal agenesis (7), vesicoureteral reflux (5), ureteropelvic junction obstruction (2), ureteral duplication (2), and multicystic kidney (1 patient). Four children have undergone surgical intervention.Our experience in children with Goldenhar syndrome suggests that the incidence of genitourinary anomalies is higher than previously reported. A screening ultrasound in the neonatal period allows for early intervention in those children with significant urologic abnormalities.
