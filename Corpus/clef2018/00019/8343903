Effects of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in utero seen in neonates with myelodysplasia. Twenty neonates with myelodysplasia were prospectively evaluated during the first month of life with urodynamic studies, contrast voiding cystourethrograms (VCUG) and renal ultrasound scans. Ten of 20 infants had abnormal VCUGs--6 with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and 4 with bladder trabeculation alone. Only 2/20 neonates had abnormal ultrasounds--both with hydroureteronephrosis secondary to VUR. Elevated leak point pressure (LPP) and/or detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) were present in 10/20 infants--6 with elevated LPP and DSD, 3 with elevated LPP alone and 1 with DSD alone. Eight of 10 neonates with DSD or elevated LPP had abnormal VCUGs--4 with VUR and 4 with bladder trabeculation alone. Conversely, 8/10 neonates without DSD or elevated LPP had normal VCUGs. Contrast VCUG performed shortly after birth, therefore, is essential for the discovery of bladder trabeculation and reflux. There is a strong correlation between an abnormal VCUG and the presence of DSD and elevated LPP, suggesting that neurogenic bladder dysfunction in utero can lead to these structural abnormalities.
