Surgery of ectopic ureterocele in children: strategy based on prenatal function. From 1981 to 1993, we have treated 31 pediatric patients with ectopic ureterocele (associated to duplex system, intra and extravesicals). Diagnostic work-up included abdominal ultrasound, intravenous urography (IVU), sequence mictional cystouretrography (SM-CU) and diuresis renography (DTPA-DMSA o MAG-3). Patients were divided in two groups: 1. Good renal function in the affected system (5 cases) with 2 endoscopic incision of the ureterocele and 3 without surgical treatment (all intravesical). 2. Almost non-existent ipsilateral renal function (26 cases), treated by heminephrectomy and ureterocelic aspiration, and in the remaining a nephrectomy was done for ipsilateral non-existent renal function. 2 cases treated by endoscopic incision presented vesicoureteral reflux, and 4 cases treated by nephrectomy had a low grade reflux. There is no a definite treatment established. The choice should by made based on renal function. Endoscopic incision is a good choice in obstructed cases with good renal function. In those with no function at all, heminephrectomy with aspiration of the ureterocele will be the best treatment if we consider that almost 50 percent of the patients will need a second surgical procedure.
