Renal scintigraphy: a major test for urologic diseases in children. The number of asymptomatic uropathies detected by ultrasound has increased dramatically with antenatal diagnosis. Some of them only threaten the renal parenchyma and require surgery. Therefore, screening for patients at risk is a major challenge. During the initial evaluation and follow up of a dilated system, MAG3 scans evaluate and quantify the physiologic significance of a radiologically detected anatomic abnormality by measuring the relative renal function and wash out of the radiopharmaceutical. Moreover, DMSA scans show renal functional abnormalities due to pyelonephritis or dysplasia associated with vesicoureteral reflux or obstructive uropathy. With a low radiation burden, renal scintigraphy is now a major imaging modality for uropathies in pediatrics.
