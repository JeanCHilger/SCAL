Early 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy in symptomatic first-time urinary tract infection. During a 2 year period, 175 children below 6 years of age (median 0.4 year) with non-obstructive symptomatic urinary tract infection were studied by 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. DMSA scintigraphy was performed at a median of 10 days after the start of treatment and was abnormal in 73 children (42%), equivocal in 29 (16%) and normal in 73 (42%). Reflux was seen in 27% of all children and in 38% of the renal units that were abnormal at DMSA scintigraphy. A decreasing frequency of abnormalities at DMSA scintigraphy was seen within the first 14 days after the start of treatment. C-reactive protein and grade of reflux correlated significantly with abnormal DMSA studies. To demonstrate renal involvement in acute urinary tract infection, DMSA scintigraphy should be performed within days after the start of treatment. It is noteworthy that reflux was seen in less than half of renal units with abnormal DMSA scintigraphy.
