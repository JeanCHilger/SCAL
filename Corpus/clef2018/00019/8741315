Ultrasonography for the detection of ureteric reflux in infants with urinary infection. Several less harmful methods than voiding cysto-urethrography for detecting significant ureteric reflux have been proposed. The present prospective study investigated whether ultrasonography was effective in identifying ureteric reflux in infants with their first febrile urinary infection. The subjects were 27 infants (24 boys and 3 girls) aged from 0 to 8 months. The urinary tract was scanned when the bladder was full, and before and during induced voiding. Infants with abnormal ultrasound findings underwent voiding cysto-urethrography. The other infants were followed and those who had a recurrence of urinary infection underwent voiding cystography. Ten children underwent cysto-urethrography, with eight refluxing ureters identified in six boys. Ultrasound revealed transient dilatation of the renal pelvis on voiding in five kidneys, transient dilatation of distal ureters in 12 and hydro-ureteronephrosis in two. Each of the five kidneys with pelvic dilatation on voiding was associated with ureteric reflux grades III or IV. Of the 17 children who did not undergo cysto-urethrography, only one had recurrence of urinary infection and was diagnosed with ureteric reflux. This girl was one of the three babies who were not scanned during voiding. More than half of the infants with febrile urinary infection were excluded from invasive examination without having recurrence of urinary infection. Thus, ultrasound scanning during voiding was effective for screening infants with their first urinary infection to detect significant ureteric reflux.
