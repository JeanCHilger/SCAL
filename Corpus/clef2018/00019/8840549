A case of ureteral reflux identified by ultrasound. Reflux nephropathy is known to be a major cause of renal failure in children. Vesico-ureteral reflux is usually diagnosed by voiding cysto-urethrography (VCG). However, it has been observed that conventional VCG is not always reliable for the diagnosis of ureteral reflux. In the case of a 5 year old girl with recurrent febrile urinary tract infection, VCG showed no ureteral reflux. Urodynamic study revealed a large bladder capacity and significant residual urine. Renal scintigram delineated a right renal scar. Simple ultrasound examination with videotape recording during voiding definitely demonstrated the presence of significant ureteral reflux when she voided, that is, there was marked dilatation of the right distal ureter and ballooning of the right renal pelvis on voiding, and quick refilling of the bladder concomitantly with the disappearance of the pelvic ballooning. Therefore, an ultrasound during voiding may be useful for diagnosing ureteral reflux in patients where a VCG does not reveal reflux.
