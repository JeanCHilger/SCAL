Height and weight in children with vesicoureteric reflux and renal scarring. Height standard deviation scores (HSDS) and weight-for-height index (WHI) at diagnosis were evaluated in 156 children aged 2 months to 10.8 years (mean 3.7 years) with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and normal creatinine clearance, and in 156 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Forty-three patients had bilateral VUR with scintigraphic signs of renal scarring (B SCAR+), 25 had bilateral VUR without renal scarring (B SCAR-) 40 had unilateral VUR with (U SCAR+) and 48 unilateral VUR without (U SCAR-) renal scarring. B SCAR+ patients had an average HSDS of -0.5 +/- 1.4 (SD) which was significantly (P = 0.02) below that of controls (0.05 +/- 1 HSDS) and an average WHI of 100.6% +/- 16% which was significantly (P = 0.007) below that of controls (108% +/- 12%)
