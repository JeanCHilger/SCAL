In utero sonographic diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux by percutaneous vesicoinfusion. Vesicoureteral reflux affects approximately 1% of newborns. Although most affected children show only sonographic evidence of renal pelvic dilatation, others may show overt hydronephrosis, indistinguishable from that seen in fetuses with obstructive uropathy. Hydronephrosis secondary to fetal vesicoureteral reflux cannot be differentiated on ultrasound examination from that resulting from lower obstructive uropathy with or without reflux. As renal damage from vesicoureteral reflux may occur in up to 70% of cases, early identification and possible in utero treatment of these fetuses may be warranted. We report a sonographic technique, vesicoinfusion, for diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux in utero. The accurate identification of vesicoureteral reflux in utero may have important diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications.
