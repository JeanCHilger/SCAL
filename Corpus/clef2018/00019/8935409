Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan in children with urinary tract infection. The hospital records of 247 children less than 16 years old, who had had UTI and received dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans during the period October 1991 to October 1993, were reviewed. Abnormal DMSA renal scans were found in 207 kidneys (207/494, 41.9%) and in 163 cases (163/247, 66%). The appearance of an abnormal DMSA renal scan is correlated with fever and vesicoureteral reflux, but not with age or sex. Because the prevalence of upper UTI in children is high, DMSA renal scan is undoubtedly a valuable tool for pediatricians as a guide in giving appropriate antibiotic therapy and to prevent further renal damage.
