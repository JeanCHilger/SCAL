Renal function in children with reflux nephropathy followed up more than 10 years after disappearance of vesicoureteral reflux: usefulness of alpha 1-microglobulin as a marker to predict the prognosis of these children. Although reflux nephropathy (RN) is one of the most important causes of renal failure in adolescence and young adulthood, we have no appropriate markers to know the future course of children with RN. In order to find out useful marker to predict the prognosis of these children, we analyzed the result of over ten years follow-up of children with RN.We evaluated renal function in 25 patients (aged between 11 years and 23 years, 14 males and 11 females) with RN using urinary alpha 1-microglobulin (alpha 1 m), urinary albumin and 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan. All patients were followed up more than 10 years after disappearance of vesicoureteral reflux.Of 25 patients, 13 showed high levels of urinary alpha 1 m (> 4.4 mg/gCr = upper normal limit) during follow-up period. Among them, renal dysfunction developed in 9 on DMSA renal scan and/or serum creatinin (Cr) level. Before puberty, all patients, even children with renal dysfunction (serum Cr > 1.0 mg/dl), remained in normal or slight high urinary albumin levels. Five cases, showed high levels of urinary alpha 1 m before puberty, demonstrated a remarkable increase of urinary albumin levels after puberty.From these results, it was suggested that urinary levels of alpha 1 m could be utilized as a marker to predict the prognosis of children with RN.
