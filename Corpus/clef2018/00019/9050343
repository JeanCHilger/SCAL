Radionuclide cystography: a review of its use in adults. Although a common procedure in pediatric nuclear medicine, direct radionuclide cystography is infrequently performed in adults in whom there are few reports on its use. We describe the use of direct radionuclide cystography in adults.The medical records and direct radionuclide cystograms of 56 adults who underwent 75 studies at this institution over a 5 year period were reviewed.The study was performed at a major university teaching hospital.The major indications were for assessment of recurrent urinary tract infection and follow-up of known vesicoureteric reflux.Overall, reflux was demonstrated in 36% patients. It was most frequently mild or moderate in severity and detected during both the filling and voiding phases of the study. Patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction had a higher incidence of vesicoureteric reflux and significantly smaller functional bladder capacity than other referred patients. All studies were well tolerated, easily performed and without complication.Given the lower radiation exposure and higher sensitivity than voiding cystourethrography, we believe that radionuclide cystography can be recommended in the evaluation of vesicoureteric reflux in adults as well as children. In the group of adults whose genitourinary anatomy is already known from other investigations, radionuclide cystography may be particularly suited.
