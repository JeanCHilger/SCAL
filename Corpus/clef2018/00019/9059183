Clinical relevance and implications of antenatal hydronephrosis. Detailed antenatal sonography was performed on 18766 pregnant women between 1990 and 1994. Antenatal hydronephrosis, defined as an antero-posterior diameter of the renal pelvis (APPD) greater than 5 mm, was detected in 100 cases (0.59%). Sixty four infants had postnatal hydronephrosis at one and/or six weeks after delivery 21 of these had urological anomalies. Twelve infants had vesico-ureteric reflux. In all refluxing units the APPD of the renal pelvis was less than 10 mm. Three patients had obstruction at the pelviureteric junction (PUJ)
