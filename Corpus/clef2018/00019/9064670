Non-comparative open study of the efficacy and tolerance of cefaclor in the prevention of urinary tract infections in children. Cefaclor has been investigated as an additional prophylactic agent in the UTI. It is active against virtually all common urinary pathogens, is well absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, is well tolerated and safe. The Authors have carried out a clinical trial of the prophylactic use of cefaclor in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in children. We studied 52 children (25 females and 27 males, median age 7 +/- 19 months) with UTI, investigated by imaging (sonography, micturating cystourethrography, renal scintigraphy) and by urodynamic studies. We found vesicoureteral reflux in 37 cases, primitive megaureter in 6 cases, in 1 patient duplication of the collecting system in 1 patient and substenosis of ureteropelvic junction in 1 case. In the others 5 cases the UTI were associated with bladder disfunction and finally in 1 case the UTI occurred in absence of urinary malformations. All patients received cefaclor, as prophylaxis, at the dosage of 10-20 mg/kg/die, administrated as a single bedtime dose. The mean time of treatment with cefaclor was 8 +/- 3,48 months. We observed an optimal compliance in all patients, also in the first year of life. In only two out of 52 patients, during the prophylaxis, we found documented bacteriuria. We stopped treatment in two cases because of an adverse effect (in both children has been demonstrated a cutaneous rash). In conclusion our study shows that cefaclor is an effective, well tolerated and safe agent in the UTI prophylaxis, also in the first year of life, when it seems to offer an optime alternative to other agents.
