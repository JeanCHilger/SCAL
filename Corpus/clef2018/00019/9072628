Followup study of renal function in children with reflux nephropathy after resolution of vesicoureteral reflux. We evaluated data collected for 10 years on children with reflux nephropathy to identify a means of predicting the prognosis.A total of 15 boys and 13 girls were enrolled in this study at least 2 years after surgical and spontaneous resolution of vesicoureteral reflux in 25 and 3 patients, respectively. They were followed for more than 10 years and renal function was periodically evaluated. Urinary beta 2-microglobulin, alpha 1-microglobulin, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, microalbumin and 99mtechnetium dimercapto-succinic acid uptake were measured.Of the 28 patients 12 had high levels of urinary alpha 1-microglobulin during followup, including all 7 in whom renal function deteriorated. In 3 children with elevated alpha 1-microglobulin urinary microalbumin gradually increased after puberty. Although elevated levels of urinary beta 2-microglobulin, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and microalbumin were also observed, they were less predictive of renal function than alpha 1-microglobulin.These results suggest that elevated urinary levels of alpha 1-microglobulin may predict the risk of abnormal renal function in children with reflux nephropathy even before the appearance of significant proteinuria.
