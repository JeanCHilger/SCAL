Postnatal echography and cystography after prenatal diagnosis of minor dilatation of the kidney pelvis. Prospective study of 89 cases. We evaluated postnatal management after the prenatal diagnosis of moderate dilatation of the renal pelvis (antero-posterior diameter superior to 1 mm per month of pregnancy and inferior to 15 mm at full term). Eighty-nine neonates who had a moderate dilatation in utero were evaluated by ultrasound and voiding cysto-urethrography. Ultrasound was performed between day 2 and day 7 in 83 cases, after day 7 in 6 cases. Voiding cysto-urethrography was performed during first month in 80 cases, after this period in 9 cases. Sixty-five neonates were shown to have a malformation of the urinary tract: reflux (n = 27), megaureter (n = 20), uretero-pelvic junction obstruction (n = 19), renal duplication (n = 7), posterior urethral valves (n = 2), horseshoe kidney (n = 1), ureteric cyst (n = 1). Reflux which is frequent in neonates with urinary tract infection, is the most frequent cause of moderate dilatation of the fetal renal pelvis. Combination of ultrasound and voiding cysto-urethrography in neonates allows a quick, full diagnosis. It helps rationalize the use of prophylactic antibiotic treatment.
