Urinary bladder dysfunction and vesicoureteral reflux in patients with enuresis. We present preliminary results of prospective study on 38 children (aged 4-15 y.) with enuresis. The aim of the study was to document the association between bladder disfunction and urinary tract abnormalities. Enuresis was more common in girls (71%). Twenty one children (44.7%) suffered from secondary, and 17 (55.3%) from primary enuresis. High incidence of enuresis (31.6%) or voiding dysfunction, renal lithiasis, constipation of other kidney disease (42%) were disclosed among family members of children with enuresis. Urodynamic studies revealed bladder dysfunction in 84.0% of children with enuresis mostly in the form of dyssingeric (45.5%) or unstable/hyperactive bladder (45.5%). In 9% of patients bladder dysfunction as in the form of inadequate bladder with small and poor detrusor contractions often associated with large residue. Ultrasonography revealed dilatation of pyelocaliceal system in 13.2%, and vesicoureteral reflux was confirmed in 10.5% of patients. We stress out high incidence of bladder dysfunction among children with enuresis as well as among their family members.
