Vesicoureteral reflux as a familial disease. Vesicoureteral reflux and reflux nephropathy are causes of end-stage renal failure in 43 percent of our patients on haemodialysis. Aiming at early discovering of vesicoureteral reflux and preventing reflux nephropathy, we started an investigation of the familial character or the primary vesicoureteral reflux in the families of 44 our patients with the diagnosed anomaly. Investigations which consist of urinalysis, urine culture and ultrasound of kidneys have so far been carried out for siblings of our patients in ten families. Complete investigations, including voiding cystourethrogram where indicated, have been carried out in five families. Familial vesicoureteral reflux ascertained in three families.
