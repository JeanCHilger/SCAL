Vesicoureteral reflux in children: incidence and severity in siblings. We attempted to determine the incidence of vesicoureteral reflux in asymptomatic siblings of children with reflux at different ages and assess the incidence of renal damage in asymptomatic siblings with reflux.We reviewed radionuclide cystograms of 482 consecutively referred siblings of children with vesicoureteral reflux, including 295 girls and 187 boys 2 weeks to 12.8 years old (mean age 2.8 years). Ultrasonograms and renal cortical scintigrams of children with reflux were evaluated. All siblings were considered asymptomatic by the referring physicians.The overall incidence of vesicoureteral reflux was 36.5%, and the incidence in girls and boys was 39.3 and 32.1%, respectively. Children 24 months old or younger had the highest incidence (45.7%) and the highest risk of bilateral reflux. From ages 25 to 72 months the incidence of reflux was 33.1% and in siblings older than 72 months it was 7%. Reflux of urine to the level of the renal pelvis was detected in 28.6% of all referred siblings. Renal damage was observed on sonography or scintigraphy in 4.7% of the siblings with reflux.The high incidence of vesicoureteral reflux through age 72 months indicates that it is important to screen siblings of children with reflux at an early age to prevent renal damage, which can occur in the absence of symptomatic urinary tract infection.
