The treatment of the primary intrarenal reflux. Is the surgery always necessary?. THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY was to evaluate the relationship between intrarenal reflux (I.R.R.) and reflux nephropathy (R.N.) in order to know the results of surgical and non surgical treatment. Fifty one children with 64 kidneys with primary I.R.R. were studied. 53% of them were less than one year of age. Initial examination were: urography, ultrasounds, cystography and DMSA scan the follow up was done with ultrasounds, DMSA scan and cystography. When no R.N. was present, grade of reflux was < IV, and age < 12 years, a non surgical treatment was indicated.During first examination R.N. was demonstrated in 47% of kidneys the main difference was the grade of reflux: 16/44 II-III (36%) and 14/20 IV-V (70%). Surgical treatment was performed in 42 (82%) children and non surgical in 9 (18%). Reflux stopped in 98% and 100%, respectively. Only one child, without R.N., developed a new renal scar, and a previous R.N. progressed in two. I.R.R. can be treated successfully without surgery in selected cases.
