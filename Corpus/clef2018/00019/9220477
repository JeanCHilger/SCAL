Urodynamically controlled management of spinal cord injury in children. Spinal cord injuries in children are relatively uncommon. However, infants with cervical spine injury have an especially high risk of renal damage. Six patients, 4 of them tetraplegic, aged 15 months to 8 years, were primarily treated by oral anticholinergic medication and intermittent catheterization. With this concept, satisfactory results were achieved in 4 of 6 children for a mean follow-up of 17.7 months. Mean bladder capacity increased by 128% and intravesical pressure was reduced by 35%. While all patients initially presented with a detrusor leak point pressure above 40 cm H2O, in 4 patients detrusor leak point pressure could be sufficiently reduced by initial treatment. One patient required intravesical instillation of oxybutynin in another patient sphincterotomy was performed. No patient had signs of renal damage. In summary, even in tetraplegic infants, oral anticholinergic medication and intermittent catheterization is a safe and well-tolerated treatment.
