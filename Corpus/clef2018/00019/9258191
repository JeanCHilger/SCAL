A renal size nomogram for the patient with myelomeningocele. Renal anatomy and function are usually monitored in the myelomeningocele population using routine ultrasound as the child grows. Clinical questions arise when a renal unit is of marginal size when evaluated with nomograms derived from normal patient populations. Our goal was to construct a renal size nomogram using ultrasound for the myelomeningocele population to help the clinician identify abnormal growth.We reviewed the charts and radiological files of 96 patients with myelomeningocele followed at our institution. Images of 930 renal units were included to construct the nomogram. Patients were excluded from study due to hydronephrosis or hydroureter, solitary kidney, recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infection, vesicoureteral reflux, reconstructive surgery or known high bladder storage pressure.A renal size nomogram was constructed by plotting patient age against maximal renal length on real-time ultrasound. Expected mean and standard deviations were calculated for each age group.Previous studies using excretory urography have shown that kidneys in the myelomeningocele population are smaller than in a healthy control population. Ultrasound is now the modality most commonly used to monitor renal anatomy. The creation of a renal nomogram based on ultrasound should help the clinician identify abnormal renal growth more accurately.
