The uretero-vesical jet as a functional diagnostic tool in childhood hydronephrosis. Childhood hydronephrosis (HN) is accurately detected by ultrasound (US), but its functional work-up remains a domain of scintigraphy, the Whitaker-test, and clinical follow-up. We utilized color doppler US (CD-Jet) of uretero-vesical jets (UVJ) to visualize the post-obstructive ureteral flow in childhood HN. A total of 177 standardized CD-Jet were performed in 132 children aged 1 day to 14.9 years. Sixty-nine investigations in 43 patients with unilateral HN were compared with a standardized technetium 99m-mercaptotriacetylglycine nephrogram in 10 infants both procedures were performed consecutively on the same day. UVJ were visible in 96% of all investigations. Ureteral obstruction resulted in absence of UVJ in 85% of examinations
