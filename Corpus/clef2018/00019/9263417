Mild pyelectasis ascertained with prenatal ultrasonography is pediatrically significant. Isolated 'mild renal collecting system dilatation' (mild pyelectasis) is a common prenatal sonographic finding. An association between mild pyelectasis and fetal aneuploidy has been established, but in the absence of a concomitant anomaly, mild pyelectasis is usually regarded as benign and of no clinical consequence, and follow-up is often not obtained after the initial ascertainment. To test this, we investigated the relationship between mild pyelectasis and (1) progression to hydronephrosis (2) postnatal vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)
