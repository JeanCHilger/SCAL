Transurethral puncture of ureterocele associated with single collecting system in neonates. It is believed by some investigators that transurethral puncture (TUP) of single-system intravesical ureterocele (SSU) is the treatment of choice in totally asymptomatic patients who receive this diagnosis in utero, but its success depends on the incision technique and type of the uroterocele incised.Experience with 20 SSU in 17 asymptomatic newborns detected by prenatal ultrasound scan is reviewed. TUP of the SSU was performed as treatment of choice in 12 (60%) renal units (RU).Decompression of the ureterocele was achieved in 100% of cases, and a vesicoureteral reflux was created in three (25%) RU. Surgery was performed in only 30% of patients who underwent TUP of the ureterocele. Our experience confirms that short (2 to 3 mm) TUP achieves decompression of the affected renal unit and that this procedure can be performed in neonates as outpatient procedure. In addition, it is often the only procedure to perform.The authors believe that TUP should be considered the treatment of choice in the management of single-system ureteroceles.
