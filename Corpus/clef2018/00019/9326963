Antenatal hydronephrosis. Fetal and neonatal management. As many as 1% of newborn infants have a prenatal diagnosis of hydronephrosis or significant renal pelvic dilation. Hydronephrosis often is caused by nonobstructive conditions. The likelihood of significant urologic pathology is directly related to the size of the fetal renal pelvis, and 90% with an anteroposterior diameter more than 2 cm need surgery or long-term urologic medical care. Following delivery, antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered and a renal sonogram and voiding cystourethrogram should be obtained. If there is grade 3 or 4 hydronephrosis, usually a diuretic renogram is recommended also. Pediatric urologic or pediatric nephrologic consultation usually is helpful in planing evaluation and treatment. Prenatal recognition of hydronephrosis allows neonatal diagnosis and treatment of urologic pathology, preventing complications of pyelonephritis and obstruction.
