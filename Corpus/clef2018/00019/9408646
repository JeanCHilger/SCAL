Renal SPECT with Tc-99m DMSA in children with upper urinary tract infections using a triple-headed gamma camera. Renal cortical scintigraphy with Tc-99m DMSA provides an excellent imaging modality for the assessment of cortical damage secondary to upper urinary tract infection (UTI).The authors evaluated 48 children with UTI, 12 of whom had a history of vescico-ureteral reflux (from first of fourth degree), by planar scintigraphy and SPECT using a triple-headed gamma camera equipped with parallel-hole, high-resolution collimators.SPECT images yielded positive findings in 36 kidneys, whereas planar scans yielded positive findings in 18 kidneys. The total number of lesions detected by SPECT was 51, whereas the number found with the planar technique was 23.This study demonstrates the superiority of SPECT scanning in detecting kidney lesions in children with UTI.
