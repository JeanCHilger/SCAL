Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and reflux nephropathy: 2-year follow-up. We evaluated the effect of 2 years' therapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) in 16 patients who had severe reflux nephropathy and microalbuminuria. During the period of therapy, microalbuminuria decreased, glomerular filtration rate measured by diethylenetriamine pentaacetate scan, serum creatinine, and blood pressure remained stable. We suggest the captopril was useful in reducing microalbuminuria and may have slowed the progression of renal damage in our patients.
