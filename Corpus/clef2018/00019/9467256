Radiologic aspects of the coexistence of vesicoureteral reflux and other abnormalities of the urinary tact in children. In this report cases of the coincidence of vesicoureteral reflux with different congenital abnormalities have been described. Radiological and ultrasonographic examinations of 240 children with 324 vesicoureteral refluxes showed the presence in 8.7% additional congenital anomalies such as: duplex pelvicaliceal system and duplex ureter, ureterocele, horseshoe kidney, primary megaureter, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, posterior urethral valves, neurogenic bladder. The coincidence of these abnormalities with vesicoureteral reflux caused some diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties. In conclusion we suggest that in the cases of the coincidence of different congenital abnormalities, the proper sequence of performed diagnostic examinations and complexity evaluation of the results are very important.
