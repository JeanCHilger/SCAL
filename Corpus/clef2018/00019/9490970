Sonographic appearance of the bladder after endoscopic incision of ureteroceles. Our intent was to describe the range of postoperative sonographic appearances of the bladder after endoscopic incision of ureteroceles.Preoperative and postoperative sonographic examinations of the bladder were reviewed in 14 patients (15 ureteroceles) who underwent endoscopic ureterocele incision. Five different appearances of the ureterovesical junction after endoscopic incision were found: a pseudomass (5/15), focal mucosal thickening (3/15), residual ureterocele with decrease in size (3/15), persistent unchanged ureterocele (1/15), and no residual abnormality (3/15). The most common postoperative sonographic appearance associated with development of vesicoureteral reflux was a mucosal pseudomass (4/6). The other bladder sonographic appearances had no correlation with development of reflux, degree of hydronephrosis, or success of the surgery.
