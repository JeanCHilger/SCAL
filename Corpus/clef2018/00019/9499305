Usefulness of renal scintigraphy in the assessment of the first febrile urinary infection in children. The objective of this study was to compare the findings of renal ultrasonography and 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy in children with their first acute febrile urinary tract infection to determine which method is better in detecting patients at risk of renal injury or reflux.Thirty-three children between 0.2 and 12.3 years of age with their first acute febrile urinary tract infection were studied by means of clinical and laboratory assessment, renal ultrasonography and 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy. In 24 patients (72.7%) a voiding cystourethrography was made. The patients were divided into two groups, those under 2 years of age (n = 14) and those over 2 years old (n = 19).Cortical scintigraphy showed renal changes in 23 patients (69.7%) and ultrasonography showed renal changes in 2 (6.1% p < 0.05). Children over 2 years of age had a higher incidence of renal lesions than did younger children (84.2% vs 50%We found a high incidence of renal involvement in children with their first acute febrile urinary tract infection. The cortical scintigraphy is more sensitive than ultrasonography in detecting renal changes. The incidence of vesicoureteral reflux in febrile urinary tract infection is high. When there is a renal cortical defect the risk of reflux is higher. This suggests that cortical scintigraphy should be added to the initial examination of children with their first acute febrile urinary tract infection and this could be supplemented by voiding cystourethrography alone, with ultrasonography having a secondary role.
