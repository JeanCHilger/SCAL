Augmented enterocystoplasty for neurogenic bladder associated with renal transplantation: appearance on Tc-99m MAG3 renal transplant scan. Enterocystoplasty (bladder augmentation) is a method of increasing bladder capacity in patients with small or neurogenic bladders in order to prevent vesicoureteral reflux. In patients with poorly compliant bladders, enterocystoplasty, which consists of a segment of detubularized small bowel or a portion of the stomach attached to the bladder, often helps to reduce the intravesicular pressures, thus reducing the likelihood of infection. It is also useful in treating bladder dysfunction in children with end-stage renal disease who require renal transplantation. Radiographic evaluation of patients with a renal transplant and augmented bladder often can be confusing, and may suggest a urine leak or hematoma. We report a patient with a renal transplant, bladder augmentation, and rising serum creatinine who underwent renal scintigraphy and ultrasonography.
