Diurnal and nocturnal enuresis in a 6 year old. Justin is a 6-year-old boy diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who presented with daytime and night-time wetting. He had been toilet trained at the age of 3 years but was back in diapers as a result of the enuresis. His bowel movements were normal. The initial evaluation consisted of a urinalysis, urine culture, serum creatinine level, and renal/bladder ultrasound examination. The urine studies were normal. The serum creatinine level was elevated at 1.0 mg/dL. The ultrasound examination revealed bilateral mild hydronephrosis and a thickened bladder wall. A voiding cystourethrogram was ordered to evaluate anatomy, but Justin would not allow a Foley catheter to be inserted, so the procedure, along with cystoscopy, was performed under anesthesia. Cystoscopy revealed a highly trabeculated bladder, as is seen in either high-grade obstruction or a neurogenic bladder. The cystogram did not show any obstruction or vesicoureteral reflux. Meanwhile, Justin's symptoms continued to increase to the point at which he was constantly wet, and he no longer made any attempts to void on his own. A spinal magnetic resonance imaging study did not show any occult neurologic lesions. Urodynamic studies revealed a high-pressure bladder, poor emptying, and inappropriate voluntary contraction of the striated, urinary sphincter during micturition. Despite institution of anticholinergic medication, psychotherapy, and behavioral therapy, Justin continued to do poorly. He could not tolerate clean intermittent catheterization, and he eventually required a suprapubic tube for urinary drainage and preservation of his kidneys.
