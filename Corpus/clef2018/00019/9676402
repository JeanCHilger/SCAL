Transient pseudohypoaldosteronism in obstructive renal disease. The cases of two patients with transient pseudohypoaldosteronism due to an up to this point unrecognized obstructive renal disease are reported. Both girls presented with a severe salt-losing episode in early infancy mimicking congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Extensive endocrinologic work-up revealed markedly elevated plasma-aldosterone levels. Clinical and laboratory data were consistent with transient pseudohypoaldosteronism. Sonographic and radiological investigation showed in both children a vesicoureteral reflux of differing grades. After therapy of the electrolyte-imbalance and recovery, one of the children required surgical treatment of vesicoureteral reflux.
