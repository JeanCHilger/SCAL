Usefulness of ultrasound in the diagnosis of vesico-ureteral reflux in neonates and infants. Postnatal ultrasound (US) findings were assessed in an infant population with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and the findings of voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) were compared with those of sonography.Between 1988 and 1997 55 babies (43 boys and 12 girls) with primary VUR were diagnosed. US criteria for suspected VUR included unexplained or transient fullness of the collecting system, pelvic wall thickening and signs of renal dysplasia.Among 55 patients reflux was unilateral in 32 cases, and bilateral in 23 patients, altogether 78 refluxing units were investigated. VUR Grade III-V, were detected in 62 units (79%). At least one US anomaly was present in 66 units (85%). No ultrasound anomaly was found in 12 renal units (15%). In 34 cases (44%) conservative treatment was performed, 40 renal units (51%) underwent ureteric reimplantation, and in 4 (5%) cases nephrectomy was carried out.The correct detection and grading of reflux is not reliable by sonography, although with careful US examination of the neonatal urinary tract in 85% of VUR cases at least one sonographic abnormality has been found. However, the US negative group, (15%) showed severe reflux on VCUG in a few cases. Therefore, all neonates with ultrasound pathology of unknown origin detected prenatal or postnatal, should undergo VCUG to exclude VUR.
