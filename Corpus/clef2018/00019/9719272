Results of a vesicoureteral reflux practice pattern survey among American Academy of Pediatrics, Section on Pediatric Urology members. We evaluated practice patterns among urologists managing vesicoureteral reflux, and identified areas of consensus and controversy requiring further research.A 1-page questionnaire addressing various aspects of reflux management, including screening, diagnosis, treatment and followup, was mailed to a cohort of 225 practicing urologists identified by the membership roster of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Section on Pediatric Urology. Coded returned mailers were blindly analyzed and tabulated by 2 reviewers. Questionnaires were subdivided using a coding system by decade (1970s or earlier, 1980s and so forth) of participant membership in the American Urological Association. Select questions were analyzed to determine whether time of training affected the response.Of 225 surveys 155 were returned and usable (overall 60.8% response rate). General agreement exists regarding several important points in the management of vesicoureteral reflux, including evaluation of patients at the initial urinary tract infection (78.1% of respondents), use of voiding cystourethrography and ultrasound at the initial evaluation (99.4 and 96.8%, respectively), and evaluation of sibling reflux (83.2%). Certain absolute and relative indications for surgical intervention require further clarification. Various reimplantation techniques are used today, stents are not placed by the majority of practitioners and significant variations exist in the duration of postoperative hospital stay.Today there is substantial consensus among urologists on many issues regarding vesicoureteral reflux management. However, the areas of controversy will only be clarified by further scientific and clinical outcomes based research.
