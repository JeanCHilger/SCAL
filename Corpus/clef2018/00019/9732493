The impact of vesicoureteral reflux on contralateral renal length in infants with multicystic dysplastic kidney. The purpose of our study was to determine the influence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) on contralateral renal length in neonates and young infants with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK).We reviewed the imaging findings in 48 term neonates and infants (27 boys 21 girls) who had unilateral MCDK (mean age at diagnosis 0.09 yearsNine patients (19 %) had VUR into the contralateral kidney. The refluxing kidneys were significantly shorter (renal length: median 5.1 cm, mean 5.07 cm z-score: median - 0.43, mean - 0.58) than the nonrefluxing kidneys (renal length: median 6.2 cm, mean 6. 08 cmVUR into the kidney contralateral to a MCDK is associated with smaller size of that kidney during the first year of life.
