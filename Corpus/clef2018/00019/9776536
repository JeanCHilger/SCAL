Five-year study of medical or surgical treatment in children with severe vesico-ureteral reflux dimercaptosuccinic acid findings. International Reflux Study Group in Europe. The results of serial dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) imaging over 5 years are reported in 287 children with severe vesico-ureteral reflux entered into the European Branch of the International Reflux Study in Children. The children were randomly allocated to medical (n=147) or surgical (n=140) management and DMSA studies were performed during the follow up period at least 6 months after any urinary tract infection. Abnormal images were classified into four types: (1) large polar hypodensity with normal renal outline (2) peripheral photon deficient defect(s) in a non-deformed kidneyIn the International Reflux Study the DMSA scintigraphic data showed no difference in outcome between children managed surgically or medically.
