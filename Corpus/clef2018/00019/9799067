15-year follow-up of reflux nephropathy by imaging. Reflux nephropathy i. e. renal scarring associated with vesico-ureteric reflux and urinary tract infection is primarily a diagnosis based on renal imaging. It is well known to be associated with hypertension and renal failure. This has led to regular long-term follow-up of patients, clinically and radiologically. We report the findings of renal imaging in a cohort of 37 patients with reflux nephropathy 15 or more years after successful surgical correction of vesico-ureteric reflux. The degree of renal scarring had been assessed and recorded at the beginning of the study utilizing a score on the original X-ray films. The scar scores of the current intravenous urography (IVU) imaging underestimate the degree of scarring in 35% of cases when compared with the previously recorded scar scores of the original IVU images suggesting a reduction in the renal scar score in some cases over the years. In the current review, concomitant renal images obtained by IVU and 99mTc dimercapto succinic acid (DMSA) scanning were in agreement for scar scoring in only 50% of cases. The original scar score by IVU or the current scar score by either technique does not correlate with blood pressure, urine albumin excretion or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We conclude that serial long-term two-dimensional renal imaging in children with damaged kidneys who no longer have vesico-ureteric reflux, does not provide additional information that will alter clinical management. However, the changes in renal volume and echogenicity were not assessed in this study.
