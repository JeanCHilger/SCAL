Congenital megalourethra associated with urethral duplication and imperforate anus. A newborn with a prenatal diagnosis of right hydroureteronephrosis and enlarged penis is presented. At birth, the baby had an imperforate anus (IA) with a megalourethra radiologic and ultrasonographic studies showed a left polycystic kidney and right hydroureteronephrosis, right vesicoureteral reflux, and an incomplete urethral duplication with dilatation of the posterior urethra. The IA was corrected on the 1st day of life and a vesicostomy was performed at 1 month. At 1 year of age the valve obstructing the ventral posterior urethra was resected and the vesicostomy was closed. At 14 months the baby underwent a urethroplasty with a vertical preputial tubularized island flap and excision of the penile urethral duplication. Exact knowledge of the malformation was essential in planning the appropriate surgical treatment.
