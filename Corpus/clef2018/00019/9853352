The importance of 99Tcm-DMSA renal scintigraphy in the follow-up of acute pyelonephritis in children: comparison with urographic data. At present, 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy is the most sensitive examination for the detection of parenchymal damage during acute pyelonephritis (APN) in children. This prospective study had three aims: (1) to evaluate the medium-term evolution of the scintigraphic abnormalities, to find a prognostic criterion of scintigraphic evolution (2) to assess the correlation between the severity of early or late scintigraphic damage and selected clinical factors
