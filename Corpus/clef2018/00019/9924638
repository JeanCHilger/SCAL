Should renal ultrasonography be done routinely in children with first urinary tract infection? To reassess the impact of renal ultrasonography on the care of children with first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) we conducted a computer search and review of medical records of (1) all children who were admitted to our hospital with first febrile urinary tract infection and underwent renal ultrasonography during a 25-month period beginning February 1, 1995, (2) all children diagnosed by ultrasound to have hydronephrosis during the same time period. Of a total of 124 patients with UTI, renal ultrasound appeared normal or showed evidence of acute pyelonephritis in 105 (84.7%), and in another nine (7.2%) it showed only minor findings. In 10 children (8.1%) ultrasound showed hydronephrosis and/or hydroureter. In eight of the latter 10, voiding cystourethrography showed vesicoureteral reflux in one, posterior urethral valves
