Vesico-ureteral reflux in pediatrics. Vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) is the most frequent uropathy involving 1-2% of children. Genetics, familiarity, race gender and age intervene in the pathogenesis of VUR. In particular, neonatal VUR seems to represent a specific entity. Different factors determine a renal damage due to RVU: direct action of VUR (back pression), urinary tract infection (UTI), inflammatory mechanisms and renal dysplasia. Micturing cystourethrography and nuclear cystography are currently performed for the diagnosis of VUR, being ultrasound examination aspecific. Functional parameters are now investigated in association with new morphologic studies. The strict relationship of VUR and UTI is discussed. The treatment (medical, surgical) of VUR is not well established, although some guidelines can be suggested. Finally an adequate support must be given to the family for an optimal management.
