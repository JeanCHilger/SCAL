Thoughts about the domestic dog as the catalyst for relations between humans and a body contact object for humans. Based on an intensive analysis of literature, the study summarizes for the first time important but seldom realized reasons for dog keeping by humans. Firstly, the significance of the companion animal domesticated dog as catalyst of numerous different social contacts and communicative interactions of the dog keepers is emphasized. Secondly, the problem of total devotion of dog owners to the animal is discussed including its negative aspects, and the psychogram of a "typical dog owner" is described. Thirdly, the role of the domesticated dog as object of body contact (petting object) for humans is characterized, i.e., the positive effects of tactile stimuli for the emotional and physical well-being of dog owners as well as their animals are presented. All themes are finally discussed in the light of the historical dimension of dog domestication, whereby it is obvious that one of the first uses of this mammalian species was that as an object of affectional touch and hugging to serve basic human emotional needs. In this way it becomes also evident how deeply the dog depends on its owner.
