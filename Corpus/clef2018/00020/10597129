Percutaneous endoscopic trigonoplasty in children: long-term outcomes and modifications in technique. Long-term outcomes of a minimally invasive method of correcting vesicoureteral reflux are presented with a discussion of the modification in our original technique.A total of 29 children (46 refluxing ureters), 14 months to 18 years old, underwent percutaneous endoscopic trigonoplasty (PET) between December 1994 and June 1996. Follow-up ranged from 19 to 37 months. Reflux was grade 1 in 2, grade 2 in 16, grade 3 in 19, grade 4 in 8, and grade 5 in 1. The technique was a Gil-Vernet method in the first 23 patients and Cohen reimplantation in the last 6 patients.Resolution of reflux was observed to decrease from 63% to 47% with long-term (30-37 months') follow-up using the Gil-Vernet technique. Resolution was greater with unilateral reflux than bilateral reflux (83% v. 27%, respectively). The Cohen technique resulted in resolution of reflux in 83% however, the operating time nearly doubled when compared with the Gil-Vernet group. In both groups, failure was unrelated to grade of reflux, age, operative sequence, or bladder instability.Although showing an improvement in resolution of reflux over the Gil-Vernet PET procedure, the Cohen PET reimplant has a lower success rate than traditional open operative reimplants. The PET also requires more operating time and two operating surgeons. Despite some advantages in the promptness of recovery, we do not recommend PET by either technique at this time. Future modifications may make this approach more tenable.
