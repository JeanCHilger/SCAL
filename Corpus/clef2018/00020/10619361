Functional neuroimaging. Functional neuroimaging represents an area of brain imaging that has undergone tremendous advancements in the last decade. It is now possible to design experiments that elucidate the functional interplay between brain regions that give rise to specific human cognitive processes. Positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) form the core technologies that have allowed such studies. This article reviews the basis of these techniques, their strengths and limitations, the underlying neurophysiology, and the future of functional neuroimaging.
