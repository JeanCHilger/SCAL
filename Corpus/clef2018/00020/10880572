Orbitofrontal cortex: A key prefrontal region for encoding information. Little is known about the specific functional contribution of the human orbitofrontal cortex with regard to memory processing, although there is strong evidence from lesion studies in monkeys that it may play an important role. The present investigation measured changes in regional cerebral blood flow with positron emission tomography in normal human subjects who were instructed to commit to memory abstract visual patterns. The results indicated that the rostral orbitofrontal region (area 11), which is primarily linked with the anterior medial temporal limbic region and lateral prefrontal cortical areas, is involved in the process of encoding of new information.
