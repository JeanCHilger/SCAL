Primary vesicoureteral reflux: report of 100 pediatric observations. In this study, the authors have reported 100 cases of primary vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) which occurred over a 7-year period. Patient age at presentation ranged from 1 month to 13 years, with a mean age of 3 years and 5 months. Overall, a higher rate of reflux was observed in the female population (63%) which was particularly evident after the age of 3 years, but with a male predominance during the first 12 months of life. In the majority of cases, the diagnosis of VUR was made following diagnosis and investigation of urinary infection (UI). A high level of UI was the most frequent sign of VUR (87% of cases), while in 6% of cases this disorder was diagnosed during the investigation of an uropathy which was found to be complex in all subjects. An analysis of 143 ureteral reflux units (URU) showed that VUR was pathological only in 17% of cases, and that the reflux grade was I, II, III and IV in 47.4, 28.14, 11.11 and 2.34% of cases respectively. DMSA scintigraphy in 38 patients showed signs of nephropathy in 24 cases, i.e., 14 scars and a decrease in kidney size in 9 cases, and an absence of fixation for one grade IV reflux. Forty subjects with 56 reflux units (34 grade I, II and 22 grade III, IV) were treated by antibiotic prophylaxis, with a positive outcome in 85% of cases in children under 2 years of age, compared to 40% for children aged over 2 years. Only 7 patients were treated by teflon endoscopic injection, and in one case a further injection was required 21 patients with 30 reflux units were treated by surgery at a mean age of 4 years. In conclusion, VUR is a fairly common disorder, which is frequently detected via an IU
