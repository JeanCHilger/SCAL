Surface-immobilized dextran limits cell adhesion and spreading. Dextran has recently been investigated as an alternative to polyethylene glycol (PEG) for low protein-binding, cell-resistant coatings on biomaterial surfaces. Although anti-fouling properties of surface-grafted dextran and PEG are quite similar, the multivalent properties of dextran are advantageous when high-density surface immobilization of biologically active molecules to low protein-binding surface coatings is desired. The preferred methods of dextran immobilization for biomaterial applications should be simple with minimal toxicity. In this report, a method is described for covalent immobilization of dextran to material surfaces which involves low residual toxicity reagents in mild aqueous reaction conditions. 70 kDa MW dextran was immobilized on glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surfaces. 3T3 fibroblast cell adhesion was compared on untreated, aminated, and dextran-coated materials. Dextran coatings effectively limited cell adhesion and spreading on glass and PET surfaces in the presence of serum-borne cell adhesion proteins. With dextran-based surface coatings, it will be possible to develop well-defined surface modifications that promote specific cell interactions and perhaps better performance in long-term biomaterial implants.
