Usefulness of echocystography in the study of vesicoureteral reflux. The aim of our study was to assess the usefulness of contrast-enhanced sonography in detecting and staging vesicoureteral reflux in pediatric patients. Forty-nine children between birth and 5 years of age were studied for vesicoureteral reflux. Echocystography with the use of an endovesical signal enhancer was performed first, followed immediately by conventional voiding cystourethrography. The findings obtained by echocystography and voiding cystourethrography were consistent in 89 (90.8%) of 98 ureterorenal units (a ureterorenal unit is 1 kidney with its own ureter). Reflux was demonstrated by voiding cystourethrography in 13 cases in 9 of these cases diagnosis had also been made by echocystography. Five cases of reflux detected by echocystography were not identified by voiding cystourethrography. With voiding cystourethrography as the standard of reference, sensitivity was 69%
