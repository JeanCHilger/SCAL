Therapeutics of African pygmy hedgehogs and prairie dogs. The author examines the therapeutics for African pygmy hedgehogs and prairie dogs. The African or Asian hedgehog differs from the larger European hedgehog. Pronounced differences in size, seasonal behavior, and natural diet exist. Since the prairie dog's increase in popularity in the pet trade, numerous interrelated syndromes have been reported, including respiratory disease, obesity, cardiac disease, and oral neoplasia. This article describes the routes of administration and the common disease syndromes and appropriate therapeutics for each.
