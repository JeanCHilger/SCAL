Myocardial microcirculation in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. To examine myocardial microcirculation in patients with SLE.Examination of 21 SLE patients consisted of perfusion tomoscintigraphy of the myocardium with Tl-201 at rest and in combination with bicycle exercise. Various protocols were used.The majority of SLE patients had resting disorders of myocardial perfusion: 5 had macrofocal scar lesion of the myocardium, 12 had disorders typical for small-focal myocardial fibrosis. Normal distribution of the perfusion occurred in 4 cases. Tomoscintigraphy performed in combination with exercise test revealed in 11 of 15 patients transient perfusion disturbances reflecting transient myocardial ischemia. One third of the patients had changes characteristic of myocardial ischemia due to coronary atherosclerosis.SLE patients have disorders of myocardial perfusion including those characteristic of scar lesion, small-focal cardiofibrosis and transient myocardial ischemia of different genesis: due to disorders in microcirculation and atherosclerotic lesion of major coronary arteries.
