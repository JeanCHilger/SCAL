Estrogen receptor status in primary breast cancer: iodine 123-labeled cis-11beta-methoxy-17alpha-iodovinyl estradiol scintigraphy. To determine the sensitivity of iodine 123 ((123)I)-labeled cis-11beta-methoxy-17alpha-iodovinyl estradiol (Z-MIVE) scintigraphy for the detection of estrogen receptors in patients with primary breast carcinoma.In 22 patients, estrogen receptor status was assessed with planar scintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) 4 hours after the injection of 185 MBq (123)I-labeled Z-MIVE. For histologic and estrogen receptor immunohistochemical analysis, breast carcinoma tissue was obtained in all patients by means of biopsy or resection of the primary tumor. Two experienced physicians semiquantitatively scored the scintigraphic and immunohistochemical findings. The uptake ratio at scintigraphy and the immunohistologic staining intensity were scored as negative, weak, intermediate, or strong.All patients had histologically proven breast cancer. Immunohistologic staining for estrogen receptors yielded negative findings in four patients and positive findings in 18 (weak staining, n = 2 intermediate staining, n = 6(123)I-labeled Z-MIVE scintigraphy is a sensitive noninvasive tool for the detection of estrogen receptors in patients with breast cancer.
