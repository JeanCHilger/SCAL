Clinical study on epileptic aura in children with temporal lobe epilepsy. We studied the clinical characteristics of epileptic aura with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in children, by retrospectively reviewing medical records of 33 patients whose first seizures developed under 15 years of age. The diagnosis of TLE was made by interictal EEG and head MRI/SPECT, both of which demonstrated a temporal lesion. The patients were classified into 24 with mesial TLE syndrome, 3 with a temporal lobe tumor, 3 with temporal lobe dysplasia and 3 with other causes. The epileptic aura was not recognized in 5 patients (15%). The age at onset of aura ranged from 4 to 10 years with a median age at 7. In patients older than 10, it was always followed by impairment of consciousness. It was manifested with nausea in 14 patients (42%), vertigo, a sense of fear, palpitation and heating sensation on the back in three patients (9%) each. Thus, clinical manifestations of epileptic aura in children with TLE were largely identical to those of adult patients. Detailed history taking about the aura may provide a clue to the diagnosis of TLE even in children.
