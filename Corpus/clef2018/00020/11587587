Effects of filtration seeding on cell density, spatial distribution, and proliferation in nonwoven fibrous matrices. The cell seeding density and spatial distribution in a 3-D scaffold are critical to the morphogenetic development of an engineered tissue. A dynamic depth-filtration seeding method was developed to improve the initial cell seeding density and spatial distribution in 3-D nonwoven fibrous matrices commonly used as tissue scaffolds. In this work, trophoblast-like ED27 cells were seeded in poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) matrices with various porosities (0.85-0.93). The effects of the initial concentration of cells in the suspension used to seed the PET matrix and the pore size of the matrix on the resulting seeding density and subsequent cell proliferation and tissue development were studied. Compared to the conventional static seeding method, the dynamic depth-filtration seeding method gave a significantly higher initial seeding density (2-4 x 10(7) vs 4 x 10(6) cells/cm3), more uniform cell distribution, and a higher final cell density in the tissue scaffold. The more uniform initial cell spatial distribution from the filtration seeding method also led to more cells in S phase and a prolonged proliferation period. However, both uniform spatial cell distribution and the pore size of the matrices are important to cell proliferation and morphological development in the seeded tissue scaffold. Large-pore matrices led to the formation of cell aggregates and thus might reduce cell proliferation. The dynamic depth-filtration seeding method is better in providing a higher initial seeding density and more uniform cell distribution and is easier to apply to large tissue scaffolds. A depth-filtration model was also developed and can be used to simulate the seeding process and to predict the maximum initial seeding densities in matrices with different porosities.
