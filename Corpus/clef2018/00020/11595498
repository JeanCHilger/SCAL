Complementary emerging techniques: high-resolution PET and MRI. Noninvasive imaging technologies provide a unique window on the anatomy, physiology and function of living organisms. Imaging systems and methods have been developed for the study of small animal model systems that offer exciting new possibilities in neuroscience. Advances in magnetic resonance microscopy and positron emission tomography, and their applications in brain imaging, have provided many benefits to neurobiology, ranging from detailed in vivo neuroanatomy to the measurement of specific molecular targets.
