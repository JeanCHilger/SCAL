Prognostic value of dobutamine stress technetium-99m-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging: stratification of a high-risk population. This work was undertaken to define the intrinsic cardiac risk of the patient population referred for dobutamine stress perfusion imaging and to determine whether dobutamine technetium-99m ((99m)Tc)-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging is capable of risk stratification in this population.In animal models, dobutamine attenuates the myocardial uptake of (99m)Tc-sestamibi resulting in underestimation of coronary stenoses. Therefore, we hypothesized that the prognostic value of dobutamine stress (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging might be impaired, owing to reduced detection of coronary stenoses.We reviewed the clinical outcome of 308 patients (166 women, 142 men) who underwent dobutamine stress SPECT (99m)Tc-sestamibi imaging at our institution from September 1992 through December 1996.During an average follow-up of 1.9 +/- 1.1 years, there were 33 hard cardiac events (18 myocardial infarctions [MI] and 15 cardiac deaths) corresponding to an annual cardiac event rate of 5.8%/year, which is significantly higher than the event rate for patients referred for exercise SPECT imaging at our institution (2.2%/year). Event rates were higher after an abnormal dobutamine (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT study (10.0%/year) than after a normal study (2.3%/year) (p < 0.01), even after adjusting for clinical variables. In the subgroup (n = 29) with dobutamine-induced ST-segment depression and abnormal SPECT imaging, the prognosis was poor, with annual cardiac death and nonfatal MI rates of 7.9% and 13.2%, respectively.Patients referred for dobutamine perfusion imaging are a high-risk population, and dobutamine stress (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT imaging is capable of risk stratification in these patients.
