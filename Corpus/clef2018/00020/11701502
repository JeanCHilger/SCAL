Imaging transgenic animals. Transgenic and eugenic animals as small as 30 g can be studied non-invasively by radionuclides with resolutions of 1-2 mm, by MRI with resolution of 100 microns and by light fluorescence and bioluminescence with high sensitivities. The technologies of radionuclide emission, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, optical tomography, optical fluorescence and optical bioluminescence are currently being applied to small-animal studies. These technologies and examples of their applications are reviewed in this chapter.
