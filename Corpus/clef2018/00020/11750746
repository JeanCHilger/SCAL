Possible use of ultrasound estimated bladder weight in evaluating vesicoureteral reflux in children. The present study was designed to reveal the possible use of ultrasound estimated bladder weight (UEBW) in evaluating vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children in terms of possible implication of bladder hypertrophy in VUR. In 27 children with VUR, UEBW was measured by transabdominal ultrasound. The UEBW in an individual patient was evaluated quantitatively using the percent deviation from age matched UEBW. There was a significant difference noted in the percent deviation from age-matched UEBW between patients (n = 17) with primary VUR and those (n = 10) with secondary VUR (p <.05). When analyzed together in 27 patients, a significant positive correlation (p <.05) was recognized between the percent deviation from age-matched UEBW and VUR grade. This was also the case in ten patients with secondary VUR (p <.01), but not for 17 patients with primary VUR. The measurement of UEBW might be of clinical use in evaluating the pathogenesis as well as the severity of VUR in children.
