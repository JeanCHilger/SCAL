Assessment of underlying etiology and cardiac sympathetic innervation to identify patients at high risk of cardiac death. Cardiac (123)I-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) activity has significant incremental prognostic value, but the difference between the long-term prognostic value of MIBG imaging for ischemic cardiomyopathies and the long-term prognostic value of MIBG imaging for idiopathic cardiomyopathies is not clear. This study aimed to determine whether assessment of cardiac (123)I-MIBG activities in ischemic and idiopathic cardiomyopathies have equally prognostic values and whether the kinetics are different because of the underlying etiologies.After quantitative (123)I-MIBG imaging, 76 ischemic and 56 idiopathic cardiomyopathy patients were prospectively followed up for 54 mo. In addition to conventional parameters, cardiac (123)I-MIBG activity was quantified as a heart-to-mediastinum ratio (H/M) for early and late images and the washout kinetics were calculated using tomographic imaging. The data were compared with those obtained from 16 healthy volunteers.During follow-up, 29 deaths from heart failure, 11 sudden cardiac deaths, 2 deaths from arrhythmia, and 5 deaths from acute myocardial infarction were documented. Multivariate discriminant analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that, in comparison with other variables, late H/M was the most powerful independent predictor of a lethal clinical outcome in ischemic (Wald chi(2) = 18.6502 P = 0.0000) and idiopathic (Wald chi(2) = 5.3394Cardiac (123)I-MIBG activity has the most powerful independent long-term prognostic value for both ischemic cardiomyopathy patients and idiopathic cardiomyopathy patients, indicating that both disease processes have common pathophysiologic and prognostic implications of impaired cardiac sympathetic innervation. Although combined testing of cardiac function and (123)I-MIBG activity is most likely to identify patients at increased risk of cardiac death, the underlying etiology of cardiac dysfunction may affect the threshold of (123)I-MIBG activity for the differentiation of high-risk patients.
