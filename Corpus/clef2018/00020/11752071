Frequency and clinical significance of myocardial ischemia detected early after coronary stent implantation. A high number (30%-50%) of reversible defects have been detected early after coronary balloon angioplasty. Inadequate luminal enlargement despite a good angiographic appearance has been suggested as a possible mechanism of these perfusion abnormalities, and some reports have shown better coronary flow reserve after coronary stent implantation than after balloon dilatation. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of early ischemic defects detected by maximal exercise (plus dipyridamole) with (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin SPECT after successful coronary angioplasty with stent implantation. A secondary objective was to determine the prognostic value of these early ischemic defects.Thirty patients without previous myocardial infarction who successfully underwent 1-vessel coronary angioplasty with stent implantation were studied. Maximal-exercise (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT, with simultaneous dipyridamole if exercise was suboptimal, was performed at 6 +/- 1 d (mean +/- SD) after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. At 8 +/- 3 mo, all patients were followed up clinically, and 77% of them underwent follow-up angiography.The percentage of stenosis decreased from 68.5% +/- 12.6% of luminal diameter to 9.3% +/- 8.8% after stent implantation, and minimal luminal diameter increased from 0.89 +/- 0.36 mm to 2.85 +/- 0.45 mm. Mild-to-moderate reversible myocardial defects in the territory of the dilated artery were detected in 5 patients (17%), with no angiographic or procedural differences occurring between them and patients without ischemic defects. At follow-up, the target lesion revascularization rates depending on the presence or absence of early ischemic defects were 40% and 8%, respectively (P = 0.18). Angiographic restenosis occurred in 3 of 4 patients who had early ischemic defects and underwent follow-up angiography and in 3 of 19 patients who had no early ischemic defects and underwent follow-up angiography (restenosis rate, 75% and 16%, respectively P < 0.05).Coronary angioplasty with stent implantation is associated with a 17% rate of ischemic defects early after the procedure. Patients with early myocardial perfusion defects after coronary stent implantation had a high rate of restenosis.
