Planar imaging versus gated blood-pool SPECT for the assessment of ventricular performance: a multicenter study. Gated blood-pool SPECT (GBPS), inherently 3-dimensional (3D), has the potential to replace planar equilibrium radionuclide angiography (ERNA) for computation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), analysis of regional wall motion (RWM), and analysis of right heart function. The purpose of this study was to compare GBPS and ERNA for the assessment of ventricular function in a large, multicenter cohort of patients.One hundred seventy-eight patients referred in the usual manner for nuclear medicine studies underwent ERNA followed by GBPS. Each clinical site followed a GBPS acquisition protocol that included 180 degrees rotation, a 64 by 64 matrix, and 64 or 32 views using single- or double-head cameras. Transverse GBPS images were reconstructed with a Butterworth filter (cutoff frequency, 0.45-0.55 Nyquist order, 7), and short-axis images were created. All GBPS studies were processed with a new GBPS program, and LVEF was computed from the isolated left ventricular chamber and compared with standard ERNA LVEF. Reproducibility of GBPS LVEF was evaluated, and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) was computed in a subset of patients (n = 33). Using GBPS, RWM and image quality from 3D surface-shaded and volume-rendered cine displays were evaluated qualitatively in a subset of patients (n = 30).The correlation between GBPS LVEF and planar LVEF was excellent (r = 0.92). Mean LVEF was 62.2% for GBPS and 54.1% for ERNA. The line of linear regression was GBPS LVEF = (1.04 x ERNA LVEF) + 6.1. Bland-Altman plotting revealed an increasing bias in GBPS LVEF with increasing LVEF (Y = 0.13x + 0.61 r = 0.30GBPS LVEF was reproducible and correlated well with planar ERNA. GBPS LVEF values were somewhat higher than planar ERNA, likely because of the exclusion of the left atrium.
