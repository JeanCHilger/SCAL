Prediction of left ventricular wall motion recovery after acute myocardial infarction by Tl-201 gated SPECT: incremental value of integrated contractile reserve assessment. This investigation tested the application of low-dose dobutamine (LDD) gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with thallium 201 for myocardial viability detection early after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).Thirty-two hemodynamically stable post-AMI patients (aged 55 +/- 5 years [mean +/- SEM] 20 men) who were exhibiting regional left ventricular dysfunction underwent stress-redistribution Tl-201 scanning within 4 to 8 days, followed by 2 additional gated SPECT acquisitions after Tl-201 reinjection, at rest and during LDD. A visual 5-point score was computed for segmental radiotracer uptake (0, normalEvaluation of contractile reserve by means of LDD gated SPECT with Tl-201 is safely feasible early after AMI, with incremental value over perfusion assessment alone for myocardial viability detection.
