Augmentation of myocardial blood flow in hypertensive heart disease by angiotensin antagonists: a comparison of lisinopril and losartan. The goal of this study was to compare myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) before and after long-term treatment with lisinopril and losartan in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).Studies have suggested that treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) improves MPR in patients with hypertension by potentiating endogenous bradykinins. Because angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) lack a direct effect on bradykinins, we hypothesized that they may not improve MPR.We measured pre- and post-treatment myocardial blood flow (MBF) by positron emission tomography in 17 patients (lisinopril: 9 patients, losartan: 8 patients) with hypertension and LVH at baseline and after coronary vasodilation with intravenous dipyridamole. In addition, we measured rest and hyperemic blood flow in eight normotensive controls.Post-treatment maximal coronary blood flow and MPR in the lisinopril group increased significantly compared with pretreatment values (3.5 +/- 1.2 vs. 2.6 +/- 1.1 ml/min/g, p = 0.02 3.7 +/- 1.1 vs. 2.4 +/- 1 ml/min/g, respectively, p = 0.002, respectively). Post-treatment hyperemic flow in the patients treated with lisinopril was not significantly different from corresponding measurements in controls (3.5 +/- 1.2 vs. 3.9 +/- 1 ml/min/g, respectively, p = NS). In the patients treated with losartan, there was no difference between pre- and post-treatment MBF values and MPR.Myocardial perfusion reserve and maximal coronary flow improved in asymptomatic patients with hypertension-induced LVH after long-term treatment with lisinopril but not with losartan. Thus, ACEIs, but not ARBs, might be effective in repairing the coronary microangiopathy associated with hypertension-induced LVH.
