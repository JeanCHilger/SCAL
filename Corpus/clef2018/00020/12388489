Value of FDG positron emission tomography in conjunction with MR imaging for evaluating therapy response in patients with musculoskeletal sarcomas. The purpose of our study was to investigate the potential of FDG positron emission tomography (PET) to distinguish viable tumor from changes caused by therapy in areas with equivocal MR imaging findings in patients with musculoskeletal sarcomas.We evaluated 12 patients (nine males, three females age range, 9-56 yearsIn nine patients, MR imaging findings were equivocal in differentiating between posttherapeutic changes and tumor recurrence. FDG PET images showed increased uptake, suggestive of recurrent tumor, in five patients. These findings were confirmed by biopsy. Four patients showed no increased uptake on FDG PET and were closely monitored clinically. No tumor recurrence was found in these patients. One patient showed MR imaging findings suggestive of recurrent tumor that was confirmed on FDG PET and at histology. Two patients underwent a limb salvage procedure before MR imaging, but MR images were deemed inadequate for interpretation because of extensive metallic artifacts. FDG PET was helpful in evaluating these patients for tumor recurrence.FDG PET is a useful adjunct to MR imaging in distinguishing viable tumor from posttherapeutic changes in patients with bone and soft-tissue sarcomas.
