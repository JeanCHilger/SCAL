Matching PET and CT scans of the head and neck area: development of method and validation. Positron emission tomography (PET) provides important information on tumor biology, but lacks detailed anatomical information. Our aim in the present study was to develop and validate an automatic registration method for matching PET and CT scans of the head and neck. Three difficulties in achieving this goal are (1) nonrigid motions of the neck can hamper the use of automatic ridged body transformations (2) emission scans contain too little anatomical information to apply standard image fusion methods
