Coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with highly impaired ventricular function. Long-term outcome. Left ventricular function is the most important predictor of survival in patients with coronary artery disease. It is also an important indicator for hospital mortality after operation for end-stage coronary artery disease. In our study we investigated, how preoperative ventricular dysfunction influences long term survival after coronary bypass surgery.Between 4/1986 and 12/2000, 1751 patients (1440 men/311 women) with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 10-30% underwent coronary bypass grafting (CABG) at the Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin. The age of the patients was calculated to an average of 59,2 years. The prime criterion for CABG was ischemia ("hibernating myocardium") diagnosed by myocardial scintigraphy, echocardiography and in some cases with magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography.Operative mortality for the group was 7,1%. The actuarial survival rate was 87,6% after 2 years, 76,0% after 5, and 53,3% after 9. 455 had LVEF 10-20%, in these actuarial survival was 79,8% after 2 years, 63,0% after 5 and 45,7% after 9 years.We conclude that CABG can be used successfully to improve life expectancy of patients with end-stage coronary artery disease. CABG leads to acceptable prognosis for these high-risk patients when the myocardium is preoperatively identified as being viable.
