Whole-body FDG-PET in patients with stage I non-seminomatous germ cell tumours. Relapse occurs in 30% of patients with stage I non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCT) within 1 year after orchiectomy. Whole-body positron emission tomography with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) may detect small metastases when standard staging with computed tomography (CT) and tumour markers is negative. In this study, 46 patients underwent FDG-PET after staging with normal CT and tumour markers. To exclude diagnostic test bias and workup bias, all patients had routine follow-up with repeated CT and tumour marker evaluation, even though the initial FDG-PET was positive. Thirty-six patients have remained disease free with a median follow-up of 48 months (range 24-76). Ten patients (22%) suffered disease relapse after a median of 2 months (range 1-8), and of these, seven had a true positive initial PET with increased uptake of FDG indicating metastatic disease. There were three false negative and no false positive PET scans. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PET were 70%, 100% and 93%, respectively. The sensitivity of detecting small retroperitoneal metastases was 88%. The negative and positive predictive values were 92% and 100%, respectively, whereas the negative predictive value of standard staging procedures was 78%. FDG-PET thus seems to be superior to conventional staging (P=0.06) in stage I NSGCT. This non-invasive method may improve the overall management of patients with NSGCT.
