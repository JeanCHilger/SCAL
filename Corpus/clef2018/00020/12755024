Surgery for giant intracranial aneurysms using advanced technology. Outcome of surgery for giant intracranial aneurysms is still unsatisfactory. The reason for complications is occlusion of perforators or parent arteries by the aneurysmal clipping itself or temporary occlusion of the main arteries. We report the surgical outcome of treatment of giant aneurysms using several advanced techniques which we devised to prevent these complications.The subjects were eight patients with giant intracranial aneurysms who underwent surgery during the recent five years. Six patients had ruptured and two had unruptured aneurysms. Aneurysms were located at the ICA in five and the MCA in three patients. Aneurysmal sizes ranged from 25 to 50 mm. Preoperative 3DCTA was performed to investigate the aneurysm and the surrounding vessels in all cases. Patients with unruptured aneurysms at the ICA underwent balloon occlusion tests to check the potential for safe temporary occlusion of the parent artery, with SEP monitoring and Xe-SPECT. Intraoperative angiography and neuroendoscopes were used to prevent problems and complications which might be caused by aneurysmal clipping.In seven of eight cases, the aneurysmal neck was completely obliterated with clips and in one case the aneurysm was trapped with STA-MCA anastomosis. Glasgow Outcome Scale of the patients showed good recovery in six, moderately disabled (MD) in one and dead in one. The patient demonstrating MD developed hemiparesis due to vasospasm. One patient died from rebleeding of the aneurysm caused by slippage of the aneurysmal clip despite the confirmation of complete obliteration by intraoperative angiography.A better surgical outcome of treatment for giant aneurysms was obtained by temporary clips whose placement was based on the results of balloon occlusion test, as well as the use of intraoperative angiography and neuroendoscopes.
