Effects of age and speed of processing on rCBF correlates of syntactic processing in sentence comprehension. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to determine the effect of age on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during syntactic processing in sentence comprehension. PET activity associated with making plausibility judgments about syntactically more complex subject object (SO) sentences (e.g., The juice that the child spilled stained the rug) was compared to that associated with making judgments about synonymous syntactically simpler object subject (OS) sentences (e.g., The child spilled the juice that stained the rug). In the first study, 13 elderly (70-80-year-old) subjects showed increased rCBF in the left inferior parietal lobe. This result contrasted with previous studies, which have shown activation in Broca's area in this task in young subjects. Elderly subjects were noted to have longer reaction times than young subjects previously tested. A second study found that young subjects whose reaction times were as long as those of the elderly subjects tested in Experiment 1 activated left superior parietal, and not left inferior frontal, structures. A third experiment found that elderly subjects with reaction times as fast as previously tested young subjects activated left inferior frontal structures. The results suggest that the speed of syntactic processing, but not age per se is related to the neural location where one aspect of syntactic processing is carried out.
