Brain function and personality in normal males: a SPECT study using statistical parametric mapping. Understanding the differences between individuals' personality types at a functional brain level is now possible due to recent developments in both functional brain imaging and personality models. The psychobiological model for temperament and character offers one approach to exploring personality. This study uses SPECT imaging to investigate brain function in relationship to the personality traits in the Temperament and Character Index. A general linear model approach was implemented at a voxel-by-voxel level, using quartile groupings for the personality predictors. t contrasts were used to investigate significant clusters of activation or deactivation. The results show a number of significant relationships between personality traits and regional cerebral blood flow, which show distinct nonlinear trends. All seven of the Cloninger personality traits were significantly related to regional cerebral blood flow. The results suggest that differences in brain function in some regions may reflect differences in personality traits.
