Functional brain imaging and the bladder: new insights into cerebral control over micturition. Mechanisms for cerebral control over the micturition process remain poorly elucidated. The knowledge is based largely on human pathophysiology and data derived from electrophysiologic testing in animals. Recent advances in dynamic functional brain imaging technologies including positron-emission tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging have allowed new insights into how the human brain regulates this process. This article discusses animal studies, which provided the foundation for our understanding of cerebral control over micturition, and recent human studies, implementing functional brain imaging to enhance our knowledge of this complex phenomenon.
