Cerebral reorganisation of human hand movement following dynamic immobilisation. Surgical treatment of a flexor tendon lesion of the hand is followed by a 6-week period of dynamic immobilisation. This is achieved by the elastic strings of a Kleinert splint, enabling only passive and no active flexor movements. After such immobilisation, the appearance of a temporary clumsy hand indicates decreased efficiency of cerebral motor control. Using PET we identified the recruitment of contralateral parietal and cingulate activations specifically related to the suboptimal character of these hand movements. After 6-8 weeks, normalised movement was related with contralateral putamen activation. Activations of the sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum were present during both scanning sessions. Changes in the pattern of cerebral activations reflect functional reorganisation. The shift from cortical to striatal involvement, observed in the group of four patients, generates the concept of unlearned movements being relearned.
