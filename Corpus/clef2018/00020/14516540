Tumor Treatment Response Based on Visual and Quantitative Changes in Global Tumor Glycolysis Using PET-FDG Imaging. The Visual Response Score and the Change in Total Lesion Glycolysis. "Functional" tumor treatment response parameters have been developed to measure treatment induced biochemical changes in the entire tumor mass, using positron emission tomography (PET) and [F-18] fludeoxyglucose (FDG). These new parameters are intended to measure global changes in tumor glycolysis. The response parameters are determined by comparing the pre- and posttreatment PET-FDG images either visually from the change in image appearance in the region of the tumor, or quantitatively based on features of the calibrated digital PET image. The visually assessed parameters are expressed as a visual response score (VRS), or visual response index (VRI), as the estimated percent response of the tumor. Visual Response Score (VRS) is recorded on a 5 point response scale (0-4): 0: no response or progression 1: 1-33%
