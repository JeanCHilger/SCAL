Cost Analysis of FDG PET for Managing Patients with Ovarian Cancer. Monte Carlo simulation analysis was used to compare the cost of managing recurrent ovarian cancer patients with and without the use of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. Assumptions in the management pathway were: (1) a positive PET scan led to either laparoscopy or laparotomy, followed by chemotherapy (true positive PET) or follow-up (false positive PET) (2) a negative PET scan resulted in continued follow-up (true negative PET) or laparotomy (false negative PET)
