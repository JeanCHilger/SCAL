Detection of myocardial contractile reserve by low-dose dobutamine quantitative gated single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with Kawasaki disease and severe coronary artery lesions. We studied 24 patients with severe coronary artery lesions to assess myocardial perfusion and left ventricular contractile reserve simultaneously using low-dose dobutamine quantitative electrocardiographically gated single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with Kawasaki disease. Low-dose dobutamine infusion was started after an injection of technetium-99m tetrofosmin at rest. Myocardial contractile reserve was evaluated using the post-stress and low-dose dobutamine images, and myocardial perfusion was evaluated using the stress and rest images. Quantitative electrocardiographically gated single-photon emission computed tomography during low-dose dobutamine infusion is a useful and safe method for the combined evaluation of myocardial contractile reserve and myocardial perfusion.
