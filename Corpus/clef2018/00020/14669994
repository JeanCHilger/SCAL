Modulation of the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the production of inflammatory mediators by ADP-ribosylation inhibitors. ADP-ribosylation is involved in nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent gene expression induced by lipopolysaccharide in murine macrophages. Here we have investigated the mechanism by which ADP-ribosylation inhibitors block signaling pathways induced in macrophages. In RAW264.7 macrophages the inducers of NF-kappaB activate the production of reactive oxygen species and three mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), the c-jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK), and p38. We demonstrate that ADP-ribosylation inhibitors specifically inhibit ERK MAPK activation and reduce the release of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6 and nitrite.
