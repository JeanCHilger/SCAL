Contact allergy to fragrances: frequencies of sensitization from 1996 to 2002. Results of the IVDK*. Increasing frequencies of sensitization to the fragrance mix (FM) have been acknowledged as a serious problem for many years. It is well known that the single compounds (SCs) of the FM contribute differently to the FM patch rest reactions. In this study, we were interested in the time trends of the FM, the SCs, Myroxylon pereirae resin (MP balsam of Peru) and oil of turpentine (OT) as possible further indicators of perfume allergy and analysed the data collected by the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology multicentre project from 1996 to 2002. During the study period (1996-2002), the FM [8% petrolatum (pet.)], MP (25% pet.) and OT (1% pet.) were tested in 59,298, 59,334 and 59,478 patients, respectively. SCs were tested in a selected group of patients, ranging from n = 1083 to n = 1924 per year. A significant increase in the proportions of patients with positive reactions to FM, MP and OT between 1996 and 1998 is noted, and a significant decline from 1999 to 2002 (Cochrane Armitage trend test, P < 0.0001). The highest frequency of sensitization to the FM was 13.1% in 1999, and the lowest 7.8% in 2002. The number of concomitant reactions to OT, a surrogate marker for terpenes, in FM-positive patients was significantly increased between 1997 and 1999. Reactions to SCs in FM-positive patients were observed in 29.9% (oak moss absolute) to 5.9% (geraniol). There was no time trend in reactions to SCs, although the relative share was increased for isoeugenol, cinnamic aldehyde and geraniol in 1999. In summary, we report for the first time, a significant decline in sensitization to the FM, very probably due to a reduced exposure (less potent allergens used in fine fragrances, possibly less use of natural ingredient-based cosmetics and lowered use concentration of important fragrance allergens). The differences in ranking of SCs could stimulate (a) a redefinition of the FM and (b) a differentiated preventive and regulatory approach, with oak moss and isoeugenol being regulated strictly by prohibition, concentration limits further reconsidered and/or health warnings and clearly less noxious substances like geraniol treated less restrictively.
