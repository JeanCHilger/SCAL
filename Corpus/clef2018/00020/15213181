Immunization with native or recombinant Streptococcus pneumoniae neuraminidase affords protection in the chinchilla otitis media model. Streptococcus pneumoniae neuraminidase has been implicated as a virulence factor in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal otitis media. In this study, native neuraminidase was partially purified from cultures of S. pneumoniae by serial chromatography with DEAE-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200. Recombinant neuraminidase, a 3,038-bp fragment of the neuraminidase A (nanA) gene, was cloned into the pET-28b vector and then expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli. Chinchillas were immunized subcutaneously with either the gel-purified native or recombinant neuraminidase, and all responded with elevated titers of antineuraminidase antibody in serum. Immunization with neuraminidase resulted in a significant reduction in nasopharyngeal colonization as well as in the incidence of otitis media with effusion. These data demonstrate for the first time that neuraminidase affords protection against S. pneumoniae nasopharyngeal colonization and experimental otitis media.
