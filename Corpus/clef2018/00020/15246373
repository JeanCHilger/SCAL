Availability of N-isopropyl-p-[125I]iodoamphetamine (IMP) as a practical cerebral blood flow (CBF) indicator in rats. Since a very complicated technique is necessary to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) with [14C]iodoantipyrine in small animals, a practical and easy method is needed. In this paper, the differential uptake ratio (DUR) at 5 min after injection of N-isopropyl-p-[125I]iodoamphetamine (IMP) was estimated as an index of CBF in normal rats and compared with the quantitative CBF value measured using [15O]H2O and dynamic PET scan. A good correlation between the two values was obtained. The results indicate that DUR of [125I]IMP at 5 min after injection in rats is a useful and practical indicator of CBF since neither arterial blood sampling nor metabolite correction is necessary.
