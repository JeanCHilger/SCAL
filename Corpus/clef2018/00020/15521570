Evaluation of regional cerebral perfusion using 99mTc-HmPAO single photon emission tomography (SPET) in carbon monoxide acutely poisoned patients. Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning continues to be a significant health problem. An early assessment of organs injury due to carbon monoxide poisoning is even more difficult than confirming the diagnosis of CO poisoning. Numerous neuroimaging techniques have been used to evaluate CO intoxication. The aim of this pilot study was to estimate the regional cerebral perfusion in CO acutely poisoned patients using 99mTc-HmPAO SPET. Disturbances in cerebral perfusion mainly in frontal, parietal cortex and basal ganglia were observed in 17 (85%) of 20 examined CO poisoned patients. 99mTc-HmPAO scintigraphy seems be useful in demonstration of early CNS dysfunction and estimation to what extent perfusion abnormalities influence the brain injury. A further study to evaluate the rCBF in relation to poisoning severity scoring are needed.
