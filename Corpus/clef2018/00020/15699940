An experience of the use of stenting for recurrence of myocardial ischemia after coronary artery bypass grafting. Coronary artery stenting was carried out in 18 patients with angina recurrence 29.3+/-7.6 after coronary artery bypass grafting. Paired bicycle exercise tests, (199)Tl single photon emission tomography and graft angiography were used in evaluation of patients. Occlusions of 1 or 2 venous grafts were found in 38.9%, stenoses of both previously bypassed and native arteries in 27.8% of patients. Implantation of stents in grafts and/or native coronary arteries was associated with 2.7 fold decrease of angina frequency, 3 fold decrease of nitroglycerine consumption, 72.5% increase of exercise tolerance. The use of statins resulted in obvious lowering of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol.
