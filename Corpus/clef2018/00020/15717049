Positron emission tomography imaging of transplant function. In this article, the role of functional imaging for providing objective evidence that grafts of fetal tissue can survive and form connections in Parkinson's and Huntington's disease patients is reviewed. The dissociation between dopamine storage capacity, clinical improvement, and normalization of brain metabolism in PD is discussed, and possible mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of dyskinesias off medication are presented. It is concluded the positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography can provide valuable ancillary information alongside clinical observations but are not currently appropriate modalities for use as surrogate endpoints.
