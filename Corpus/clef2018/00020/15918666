Place of surgery in the treatment of adult temporal lobe epilepsy. Surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy has made significant progress during the past twenty years: in addition to traditional factors (frequency of partial seizures and relative resistance to medical treatment), the possibilities offered by MRI in a large number of cases to detect the responsible lesion (hippocampal sclerosis in the majority of cases) has led to an increase in the use of surgical methods. Furthermore, other examinations (EEG-video, SPECT Depth-electrode recording) now permit precise localization of the epileptic focus. Surgical techniques have likewise been considerably modified: in parallel to classical temporal lobectomy, new surgical methods offer more restricted resection of the lateral cortex. The results are, on the whole, quite satisfactory, as three-quarters of patients can be considered cured or greatly improved. The length of post-operative follow-up does not seem to influence the quality of the results, as observed by the end of the second year.
