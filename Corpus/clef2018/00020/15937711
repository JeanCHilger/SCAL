18FDG-PET applications for cartilage neoplasms. To assess the value of [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) in defining aggressive cartilage neoplasms, particularly those with problematic or borderline histologic, imaging and clinical characteristics.From 2000 to 2003, 29 cartilage lesions were studied with whole-body 18FDG-PET scans (Siemens Ecat Exact, Knoxville, Tenn.). Analyses of data in 20 females and nine males, 11-85 years old, were based on maximum standard uptake values (SUVs) in regions of interest (ROIs) on axial 3.37 mm thick, 3x3 pixel images. A statistically significant maximum SUV cutoff of 2.0 was used to distinguish benign from malignant cartilage neoplasms and correlated with the postoperative histopathologic findings.In 26 operated cases the overall sensitivity of whole-body 18FDG-PET in separating benign and malignant lesions was 90.9% (10/11), specificity 100% (18/18) and accuracy 96.6%.Whole-body 18FDG-PET is a valuable adjunct in identifying primary, recurrent and metastatic cartilage malignancies. It supplements classic histology and morphologic imaging with functional data which may facilitate management in individual cases.
