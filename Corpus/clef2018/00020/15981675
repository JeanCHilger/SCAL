Use of iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy for the detection of amiodarone induced pulmonary toxicity in a rabbit model: a comparative study with technetium-99m diethyltriaminepenta acetic acid radioaerosol scintigraphy. The purpose of the study was (i) to determine whether 123I-MIBG scintigraphy is sensitive for detection of amiodarone induced pulmonary toxicity (AIPT) and (ii) to compare it with 99mTc-DTPA radioaerosol. Twelve white New Zealand rabbit with initial mean body weight 4.24 +/- 0.47 g were divided into two groups. AIPT group (n = 7) was administered amiodarone (20 mg/kg BW). The control group (n = 5) received the same amount of 0.9% saline. All animals underwent 123I-MIBG and 99mTc-DTPA radioaerosol scintigraphy at the end of the treatment period. 123I-MIBG static thorax images were obtained during 10 minutes at 15 minutes and 3-hours after intravenous injection of the radiopharmaceutical. Lung to heart ratios (LHR) and lung to mediastinum ratios (LMR), and retention index (LRI) of 123I-MIBG were determined. Two days after 123I-MIBG scintigraphy, 99mTc-DTPA radioaerosol scintigraphy was performed, and clearance from the lungs was measured for 10 min (1 min/frame) following termination of inhalation. 123I-MIBG lung retention index (LRI) was significantly higher in the AIPT group than the control (61 +/- 4.6 vs. 40 +/- 4.5, p = 0.01). Early LHR and LMR were significantly lower in the AIPT group than in the control group (p = 0.04, p = 0.01, respectively), whereas those of late LHR and LMR were not significantly different. T1/2 values of DTPA clearance were significantly increased in AIPT group according to the control group (55 +/- 7.2 vs. 86.6 +/- 18.5, p = 0.02). 123I-MIBG scintigraphy is a valuable tool for detecting AIPT in a rabbit model. Additionally, 99mTc-DTPA radioaerosol scintigraphy is an excellent comprehensive investigational tool for detecting AIPT with the added advantage of lower cost.
