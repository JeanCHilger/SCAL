Axial bis(terpyridoxy)phosphorus(V) porphyrin: modulation of PET and EET by Zn2+ or Cd2+ ions. A novel phosphorus(V) porphyrin bearing two ptp[4'-(4-phenyloxy)-2,2'ratio6',2''-terpyridine] groups was prepared and modulation of the intramolecular PET (lambda(ex)= 566 nm) and PET --> EET (lambda(ex)= 300 nm) processes was studied from ptp to phosphorus(V) porphyrin by Zn2+ or Cd2+ ions.
