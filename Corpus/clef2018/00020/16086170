Modern ultrasound technologies and their application in pediatric urinary tract imaging. In children ultrasound plays a central role in the diagnostic imaging of the urinary tract. It is used most frequently and as a primary diagnostic option. Consequently, innovations in ultrasound technology and ultrasound contrast media have major impact on pediatric urosonography. Harmonic imaging is a modality that produces artifact-free images with high resolution. It has been shown that harmonic imaging is superior to fundamental mode in many urosonographic indications. Color Doppler is an established imaging modality, but its application for diagnosis of stones in the urinary tract, especially in children, is relatively new. The so-called twinkling sign, a color Doppler artifact at the site where one normally expects the acoustic shadow to be, enhances the conspicuity of the stone. A further development is three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound. It offers better volume measurement of the bladder and kidneys than 2D ultrasound. Contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography has already proven to be a valuable alternative in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux. Thus, a significant decrease of radiation exposure has become possible as it replaces the radiological methods. With the introduction of contrast-specific ultrasound imaging modalities, further improvements in voiding urosonography are emerging.
