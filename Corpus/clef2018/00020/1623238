Imaging in cerebrovascular disease. High-resolution structural imaging of ischemic lesions now enables the assignment of complex ischemic clinical symptoms to cortical and subcortical lesions. Functional imaging shows some new features of cerebral ischemia which can be directly investigated in the individual patient. Vascular imaging is rapidly improving with the introduction of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Today its diagnostic value is unsettled but promising, in particular if used in combination with other techniques like ultrasonography and positron emission tomography (PET).
