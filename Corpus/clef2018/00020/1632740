Radiological imaging of urinary tract infection in Malaysian children--a private hospital experience. The results of radiological investigations performed on 81 children with urinary tract infection (UTI) were reviewed. Investigations included 91 voiding cystourethrograms (VCU), 59 intravenous urograms (IVU) and 36 ultrasonograms (US). The aim was to study the local spectrum of renal tract abnormalities in childhood UTI and to compare the diagnostic yield of combining US and VCU against IVU and VCU. Renal tract abnormalities were detected in 37%. Vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) was the commonest, detected in 26%, with renal scarring found in 9% of refluxing units. Ultrasound should replace IVU in the initial diagnostic work-up of these children.
