Heterologous production of functional forms of Rhizopus oryzae lipase in Escherichia coli. To date, expression of the lipase from Rhizopus oryzae (ROL) in Escherichia coli always led to the formation of inclusion bodies and inactive protein. However, the production of active ROL and its precursor ProROL in soluble form was achieved when E. coli Origami(DE3) and pET-11d were used as expression systems.
