Tibolone improves myocardial perfusion in postmenopausal women with ischemic heart disease: an open-label exploratory pilot study. We sought to determine the effect of tibolone on myocardial perfusion in postmenopausal women with ischemic heart disease.Tibolone is a steroid that relieves climacteric symptoms and prevents osteoporosis. Recent studies have suggested a cardioprotective effect of this compound. However, its role on myocardial perfusion remains uncertain.Single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging was performed in 26 postmenopausal women. Patients were randomly assigned to tibolone for six months (treatment group) or to usual care (control group). All women underwent cardiac imaging at baseline and at six months.Mean stress perfusion defect (summed stress score) was moderate and did not differ between the two groups (8 +/- 3 vs. 9 +/- 4 p = NS). Summed difference score also was similar for both groups (7 +/- 3 vs. 8 +/- 3In postmenopausal women with ischemic heart disease, six months of therapy with tibolone significantly improved stress myocardial perfusion and the "amount of ischemia."
