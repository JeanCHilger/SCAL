Peritoneal dialysis as the treatment of choice for pediatric patients. CAPD is the best modality for children. In our center, we believe that a PD modality should not be arbitrarily assigned by the dialysis facility. Rather, the choice of PD modality should be made based on the individual child's treatment requirements and PET results as well as the family's strengths, challenges, and desires (Harmon et al., 2000). The family has the choice whether to use CCPD or CAPD. Families and children who are able to switch back and forth between the two modalities as needed are the most flexible and most successful because they can build their therapy around their lifestyle and not the other way around (Hislop & Lansing, 1983).
