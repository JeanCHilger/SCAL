The role of magnetic resonance imaging in pediatric urology. Magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool for the imaging of the pediatric genitourinary tract. The aim of this review is to familiarize the reader with the current applications and basic techniques utilizing magnetic resonance imaging in pediatric uroradiology.Magnetic resonance imaging can provide both a detailed anatomic and functional assessment of the pediatric genitourinary tract in a single study without the use of ionizing radiation. Magnetic resonance urography combines static and dynamic evaluation of the urinary tract following contrast administration and has been most often applied to the evaluation of hydronephrosis. In addition to unparalleled anatomic assessment, it allows for the evaluation of glomerular filtration rate, renal transit time, and differential renal function. It also provides unique insights into a wide range of obstructive uropathies and has been demonstrated to be useful in the evaluation of complex genitourinary anomalies. Magnetic resonance voiding cystourethrography has been used to rule out vesicoureteral reflux. Magnetic resonance imaging has also been demonstrated to be superior to nuclear scintigraphy for the diagnosis of pyelonephritis and renal scarring.Magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of pediatric genitourinary anomalies. It provides functional and anatomic assessment with a single procedure that in most cases is superior to conventional procedures. Magnetic resonance imaging will probably become the modality of choice for the imaging of pediatric genitourinary tract anomalies.
