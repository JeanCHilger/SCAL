Phase I study of 131I-chimeric(ch) TNT-1/B monoclonal antibody for the treatment of advanced colon cancer. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the biodistribution and toxicity of 131I-chimeric(ch) TNT-1/B monoclonal antibody (MAB), which binds to intracellular antigens of necrotic regions within tumors, in patients with advanced colon or colorectal cancer. The rationale for targeting areas of tumor necrosis is the observation that necrotic lesions are more abundant in cancer lesions than in surrounding tissues.Cohorts of patients with advanced colon or colorectal cancer were administered a one-time 30-60-minute intravenous (i.v.) infusion of 131I-chTNT-1/B at doses ranging from 12.95 to 66.23 MBq/kg (0.35-1.79 mCi/kg).The dose-limiting toxicity, experienced at 66.23 MBq/kg (1.79 mCi/kg) 131I-chTNT-1/B MAB, was myelosuppression. Two (2) patients at the 66.23-MBq/kg (1.79 mCi/kg) dose level had both grade 3 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 neutropenia that persisted for at least 2 weeks but were reversible. The maximum tolerated dose was 58.09 MBq/kg (1.57 mCi/kg) 131I-chTNT-1/B MAB. Of the 21 patients, one developed a moderate human antichimeric antibody (HACA) response and 6 developed low HACA responses.The infusion of 131I-chTNT-1/B MAB was well tolerated, without significant nonhematological toxicity. No patient obtained a complete or partial response, based on tumor cross-product response criteria. Tumor localization was seen in patients with dose levels at, and exceeding, 50.23 MBq/kg (1.36 mCi/kg) 131I-chTNT-1/B MAB.
