FDG-PET in the detection of residual disease and relapse in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Experience from a Swedish centre. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the value of FDG-PET with conventional imaging in patients with residual disease or suspected relapse in Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). We reviewed the records of all patients with HL who were referred for FDG-PET at our PET centre between April 2002 and August 2004. Thirty-four FDG-PET scans performed on 26 patients were included in the study. Referrals were based on either the presence of a residual mass on computed tomography (CT) (n = 13) or suspicion of relapse (n = 21). We found one false negative and one false positive FDG-PET scan. The high positive predictive value of FDG-PET in the residual group and the high negative predictive value in the relapse group strongly indicate that FDG-PET has an important role to play in the management of HL.
