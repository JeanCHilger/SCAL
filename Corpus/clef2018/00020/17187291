Growth hormone response in low-dose apomorphine test correlates with nigrostriatal dopamine transporter binding in patients with Parkinson's disease. Challenge with low-dose apomorphine causes a rise in growth hormone (GH) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We studied 18 patients with early PD, who showed an increase of GH in the low-dose apomorphine test, by means of [(123)I] FP-CIT-SPECT. The mean specific dopamine transporter binding of the 18 patients was 1.50 +/- 0.56 in the striatum, 1.20 +/- 0.59 in the putamen, and 1.76 +/- 0.59 in the caudate nucleus. The increase of GH (1.05 +/- 1.01 ng/ml at baseline to 9.46 +/- 6.36 ng/ml 45 min after apomorphine injection p < 0.001) was significant. There was a significant negative correlation of the increase of GH with the mean specific dopamine transporter binding in all three regions (r between -0.490 and -0.587
