Gross hematuria in children: a ten-year review. Gross hematuria in children is uncommon. We reviewed our experience characterizing its clinical presentation and diagnosis.The charts of all patients who presented for the 10-year period of 1994 through 2003 were reviewed, and 342 patients were identified. Of these 342 patients, 272 were boys (80%) and 70 (20%) were girls. At presentation, 21 patients (6%) were younger than 3 years (17 were boys and 4 were girls) 199 (58%) were 3 to 12 years old (155 were boys and 44 were girls)Of the 272 male patients, 52 (19%) had benign urethrorrhagia 48 (14%) had traumaGross hematuria most often had a benign cause in children and adolescents. It was more common in boys for almost all etiologic categories and ages. The extent of the urologic evaluation should depend on the clinical setting. Voiding cystourethrography is useful in those with suspicious ultrasound findings, urinary tract infection, or voiding symptoms. Cystoscopy should be reserved for the minority in whom hematuria persists or those with ambiguous imaging study findings.
