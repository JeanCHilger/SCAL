A 3D Adaptive Wiener Filter for Restoration of SPECT Images Using MRI as Reference Images. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images suffer from poor resolution and low contrast, which make it difficult for physicians to put an accurate interpretation for diagnosis, in particular, early diagnosis. Although the Wiener filter is a simple and powerful tool to restore degraded images, the requirement for a priori information limits its application. In this paper, we present a new 3D adaptive Wiener filter for restoration of brain SPECT images with a priori data taken from a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the same patient. The proposed algorithm automatically and significantly improve the contrast and sharpness of synthetic and real SPECT images while keeping amplification of noise under acceptable level.
