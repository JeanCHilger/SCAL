Long-circulating liposomes radiolabeled with [18F]fluorodipalmitin ([18F]FDP). Synthesis of a radiolabeled diglyceride, 3-[(18)F]fluoro-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol [[(18)F]fluorodipalmitin ([(18)F]FDP)], and its potential as a reagent for radiolabeling long-circulating liposomes were investigated. The incorporation of (18)F into the lipid molecule was accomplished by nucleophilic substitution of the p-toluenesulfonyl moiety with a decay-corrected yield of 43+/-10% (n=12). Radiolabeled, long-circulating polyethylene-glycol-coated liposomes were prepared using a mixture of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethyleneglycol)-2000] ammonium salt (61:30:9) and [(18)F]FDP with a decay-corrected yield of 70+/-8% (n=4). PET imaging and biodistribution studies were performed with free [(18)F]FDP and liposome-incorporated [(18)F]FDP. Freely injected [(18)F]FDP had the highest uptake in the liver, spleen and lungs. Liposomal [(18)F]FDP remained in blood circulation at near-constant levels for at least 90 min, with a peak concentration near 2.5%ID/cc. Since [(18)F]FDP was incorporated into the phospholipid bilayer, it could potentially be used for radiolabeling a variety of lipid-based drug carriers.
