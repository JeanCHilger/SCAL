How I explore ... a patient with cutaneous melanoma: actualisation of an algorithm. Cutaneous melanoma is a cancer affecting an ever growing proportion of young adults. Currently, the best approach for a prolonged remission or cure relies on early detection of the primary neoplasm and of its first possible metastases. Some therapies can bring much hope at this stage of the disease. The early detection of lymph node metastases is therefore essential in the global management strategy. The excision and the microscopic examination of the sentinel lymph node are important in this evaluation. Echography of the draining lymph nodes is a non invasive procedure which may also prove to be informative. PET-scan brings additional information, particularly when the dissemination risk is beyond the first group of lymph nodes.
