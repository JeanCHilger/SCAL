Glucose hypermetabolism in the thalamus of patients with essential blepharospasm. Essential blepharospasm (EB) is classified as a form of focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms of the musculature of the upper face. The basic neurological process causing EB is not known. The purpose of this study was to investigate cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with EB whose symptoms were suppressed by an injection of botulinum-A toxin. Earlier studies were confounded by sensory feedback activities derived from dystonic symptom itself. Cerebral glucose metabolism was examined by positron emission tomography (PET) with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in 25 patients (8 men and 17 women age 52.6 +/- 10.1 years) with EB. The patients were awake but with the spasms suppressed by an injection of botulinum-A toxin. Thirty-eight normal volunteers (14 men and 24 women
