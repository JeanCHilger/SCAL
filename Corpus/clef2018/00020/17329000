Cerebral glucose utilization and platelet mitochondrial complex I activity in schizophrenia: A FDG-PET study. Altered cerebral energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in periphery and in brain are implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This study investigated whether cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) abnormalities are linked to altered mitochondrial complex I activity in the periphery, in schizophrenia. Sixteen schizophrenic patients, 8 with total positive PANSS score >or=20 (high positive schizophrenics HPS), and 8 with total positive score <or=12 (low positive schizophrenics
