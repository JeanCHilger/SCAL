Innovative clinical assessment technologies: challenges and opportunities in neuroimaging. The authors review the reasons for the contrast between the remarkable advances that hemodynamic and electromagnetic imaging of the human brain appear capable of delivering in clinical practice in psychology and their very limited penetration into practice to date. Both the heritage of the relevant technologies and the historical orientation of clinical psychology away from biological phenomena are factors. Discussion of some technical aspects and prospects of these methods and recommendations for facilitating clinical use are provided, with an emphasis on fostering the participation of and contribution by practicing clinical psychologists and professionals in related fields lacking a strong grounding in biological measurement.
