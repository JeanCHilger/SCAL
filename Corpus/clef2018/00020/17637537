Ovarian cancer treatment from the standpoint of the gynecologic oncologist. Ovarian cancer treatment on the standpoint of the gynecologic oncologist: Ovarian cancer is comprehensively treated with combined surgery and anticancer chemotherapy, which influence each other. In the initial surgery, a cancer stage is decided, and in advanced cancer, primary debulking surgery is conducted. The outcome of postoperative chemotherapy has a correlation with the diameter of the postoperative residual tumor. Recently, a new treatment strategy of interval debulking surgery during chemotherapy has been widely conducted to completely remove tumors. Improved diagnostic imaging such as PET enhances aggressive surgery for recurrent cancer.
