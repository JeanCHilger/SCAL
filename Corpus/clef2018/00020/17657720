Salvage oesophagectomy after local failure of definitive chemoradiotherapy. Definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is one treatment option for locally advanced oesophageal carcinoma. CRT typically consists of high-dose (50-66 Gy) external beam radiotherapy concurrent with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. When definitive CRT fails to achieve local control, salvage oesophagectomy is frequently the only treatment available that can offer a chance of long-term survival.Online databases were searched for publications relating to salvage oesophagectomy and definitive CRT. Nine series containing a total of 105 patients were reviewed. Demographics, indications for surgery, type of resection, complications and outcome data were extracted.Each centre performed one to three salvage resections per year comprising 1.7-4.1 per cent of the oesophagectomy workload. The overall anastomotic leak rate was 17.1 per cent. The in-hospital mortality rate was 11.4 per cent. Five-year survival rates of 25-35 per cent were achieved. Prognostic factors for increased survival were R0 resection (P = 0.006) and longer interval between CRT and recurrence (P = 0.002).Salvage resection after CRT is feasible for selected patients but is a formidable undertaking. Restaging investigations after CRT for potentially resectable tumours in fit candidates should include endoscopy and positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Salvage oesophagectomy is carried out with the goal of cure and it should be attempted only if an R0 resection is technically possible.
