PET scanning in partial epilepsy. Many biologically active tracers are available for positron emission tomography (PET) investigations, but most studies of epilepsy have utilized 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to measure local cerebral metabolic rate for glucose. Over 70% of patients with medically refractory partial seizures demonstrate an interictal zone of hypometabolism corresponding to the epileptogenic region. This metabolic defect commonly involves the temporal lobe in patients with complex partial seizures of mesial temporal origin, and is encountered less consistently with seizures of extratemporal neocortical origin. Although false localization is less likely with FDG-PET than with EEG, the hypometabolic zone merely reflects a focal functional deficit and its epileptogenicity must still be demonstrated electrophysiologically. When hemispherectomy or large multilobar resections are planned in small children, FDG-PET also provides useful supporting evidence that the contralateral hemisphere is functioning normally. It is difficult to obtain FDG-PET scans and to interpret results during spontaneous partial seizures. Ictal scans can be more easily obtained with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), which may provide information for planning surgical resections.
