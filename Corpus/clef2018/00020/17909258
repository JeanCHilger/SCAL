Dynamic tracking during intracoronary injection of 18F-FDG-labeled progenitor cell therapy for acute myocardial infarction. We assessed the feasibility of dynamic 3-dimensional (3D) PET/CT tracking of (18)F-FDG-labeled circulating progenitor cell (CPC) therapy during intracoronary injection, using a porcine model of acute myocardial infarction (MI).Human and porcine CPC were radiolabeled with (18)F-FDG, with variation in temperature and incubation time to determine optimal conditions. For in vivo experiments, CPC were harvested before induction of infarction (using 90-min coronary balloon occlusion). At 48 h, animals underwent cardiac MRI to assess infarct size. A balloon catheter was placed in the infarct artery at the same location as that used for induction of MI, and during dynamic 3D PET/CT 3 x 10(7) autologous (18)F-FDG progenitor cells were injected through the central lumen using either (a) 3 cycles of balloon occlusion and reperfusion or (b) high-concentration, single-bolus injection without balloon occlusion (n = 3 for both protocols). Peripheral blood was drawn at 1-min intervals during cell injection.Labeling efficiency was optimized by 30-min incubation at 37 degrees C (human CPC, 89.9% +/- 4.8% porcine CPC, 91.6% +/- 6.4%). Cell-bound activity showed a nonsignificant decrease at 1 h (human, 74.3% +/- 10.7%Dynamic tracking during intracoronary injection of (18)F-FDG-labeled CPC is feasible and demonstrates significant cell washout from the myocardium immediately after balloon deflation. High-concentration, single-bolus therapy may be as effective as balloon-occlusion delivery. This tracking technique should facilitate development of improved delivery strategies for cardiac cell therapy.
