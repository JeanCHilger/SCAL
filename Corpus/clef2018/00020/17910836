Diagnostic accuracy of FP-CIT SPECT in patients with parkinsonism. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of FP-CIT SPECT in entities with and without presynaptic involvement of the nigral-striatal dopaminergic pathway in a large group of patients with movement disorders, evaluating the usefulness of quantitative analysis.A group of 183 consecutive patients clinically diagnosed as either having or not having degenerative Parkinsonism. These results were then contrasted with those of FP-CIT SPECT to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the procedure. The specific binding index was evaluated with ROC curves.FP-CIT SPECT was highly accurate in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative Parkinsonism (sensitivity: 95 %, specificity: 90 %). Most of the false positive results arose in patients with vascular Parkinsonism and the false negative results in patients with Parkinson disease. ROC curve analysis of semiquantitative evaluation had a sensitivity of 83 % and specificity of 82 % with an optimal cut-off of 1.44. The area under the curve was not significantly different between patients </= 60 and > 60 years (0.899 vs 0.884) of age.FP-CIT SPECT has a high degree of diagnostic accuracy for striatal dopaminergic involvement. No significant changes in diagnostic accuracy were seen with respect to patient age.
