Evaluation of acute myocardial infarction with late enhancement pattern on MRI compared with 201Tl and 99mTc-hydroxymethylenediphosphonate (HMDP) dual single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images. The purpose of this study is to evaluate reperfused acute myocardial infarction with late enhancement (LE) pattern on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging compared with myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images.Magnetic resonance and 201Tl and 99mTc-hydroxymethylenediphosphonate SPECT images were obtained from 40 patients within 6 days of reperfused myocardial infarction. We assessed the myocardial LE pattern using the true fast imaging with steady-state free precession sequence after the injection of Gd-DTPA. Patients were classified into 3 groups: group 1 included patients with localized endocardial enhancement group 2, patients with transmural enhancementThere were 9 patients (23%) in group 1, 15 (38%) in group 2, and 15 (38%) in group 3. In 1 patient, LE was not detected (3%). The %201Tl uptake for the infarcted area was 60.7 +/- 7.2 (mean +/- SD) for group 1, 49.5 +/- 12.3 (P < 0.05 vs. group 1) for group 2, and 36.9 +/- 8.2 (P < 0.0001 vs. group 1, P = 0.005 vs. group 2) for group 3. An overlap pattern of 201Tl and 99mTc was observed in 9 of the group 1 patients (100%) and 9 of the group 2 patients (60%), but was not evident in group 3 (0%).LE with residual defect is an important indicator of microvascular obstruction after reperfusion therapy.
