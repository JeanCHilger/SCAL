Importance of early diagnosis of urinary tract infections in childhood. Results of a retrospective study of children with vesico-uretero-renal reflux. Urinary tract infections (UTI) in children are common. In the case of high grade vesico-ureteric-renal reflux (VUR) or urinary tract obstruction the abnormality may lead to end-stage renal failure. An early evaluation and adequate therapy after UTI are mandatory. Between 1980 and 1987 we evaluated 63 children with VUR. The symptoms of UTI are variable and age-dependent. Only in 13% of the children the urinary tract was evaluated after their first UTI. In 70% of the cases there were more than 1, mostly multiple UTI. The remaining 17% were admitted for other reasons. The relation boys to girls was 1:2. In boys the diagnosis of VUR was made earlier than in girls: 57% of boys and 17% of girls in their first year of life. In 24% of the boys and in 36% of the girls VUR was found between the 5th and 15th year of life. In the case of high grade reflux (IV-V) the kidneys showed heavy damage, loss of function and hypertension at the time of diagnosis. The aim must be early diagnosis and adequate therapy to prevent avoidable damages.
