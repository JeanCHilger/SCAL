Chronic ACE inhibitor treatment increases angiotensin type 1 receptor binding in vivo in the dog kidney. PET imaging has been recently introduced for investigating the type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT(1)R) in vivo. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of acute and chronic exposure to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on the AT(1)R in the dog kidney.Animals were imaged at baseline, after acute intravenous ACEI treatment and after a chronic 2-week exposure to an oral ACEI. Control animals were imaged at identical time points in the absence of ACEI treatment.In vivo AT(1)R binding expressed by K (i) was increased in the renal cortex by chronic ACEI treatment (p < 0.05). In vitro measurements of AT(1)R density (B (max)) also revealed significant increases in AT(1)R in isolated glomeruli (p < 0.05). Plasma renin activity was increased, but angiotensin II (Ang II) and the Ang II/Ang I ratio showed a weak correlation with chronic ACEI treatment, consistent with an Ang II escape phenomenon.This study reveals, for the first time, that chronic ACEI treatment increases AT(1)R binding in vivo in the dog renal cortex.
