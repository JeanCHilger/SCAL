Cardiovascular diseases as target for imaging. Recent pathophysiological findings have lead to new concepts to identify patients at risk for cardiovascular disease using systemic serum markers or new imaging methodology. New probe technology and progress in imaging techniques have set the base for development of molecular imaging concepts in the cardiovascular systems. The aim of these new imaging techniques is the detection of active biological processes in cardiovascular systems combining specific probes with contrast agents for MRI, SPECT or PET. There are promising strategies mostly in preclinical tests, which will prove clinical applicability in the near future.
