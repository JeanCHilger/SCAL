Evaluation of unusual neuroendocrine tumours by means of 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET. (18)F-FDG PET value for the assessment of neuroendocrine tumours (NET) is limited. Preliminary studies indicate that somatostatin receptor PET using (68)Ga-DOTA-peptides is more accurate for disease assessment and provide additional data on receptor status, that are crucial for targeted radionuclide therapy. At present, however, few papers investigated the role of (68)Ga-DOTA-NOC PET in NET, especially in unusual situations. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate (68)Ga-DOTA-NOC for the evaluation of NET of uncommon presentation. Patients with biopsy-proven NET were scheduled for (68)Ga-DOTA-NOC PET we excluded from further evaluation cases with most common NET tumours (gastro-entero-pancreatic and pulmonary localization of primary lesion, MEN syndromes, medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytomas). PET results were compared with findings of conventional imaging, including CT, ultrasonography, MR and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy
