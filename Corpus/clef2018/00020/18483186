Hepatic uptake and metabolism of galactose can be quantified in vivo by 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxygalactose positron emission tomography. Metabolism of galactose is a specialized liver function. The purpose of this PET study was to use the galactose analog 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxygalactose (FDGal) to investigate hepatic uptake and metabolism of galactose in vivo. FDGal kinetics was studied in 10 anesthetized pigs at blood concentrations of nonradioactive galactose yielding approximately first-order kinetics (tracer only n = 4), intermediate kinetics (0.5-0.6 mmol galactose/l blood
