New directions in head and neck imaging. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and the hybrid modality of PET/CT are sensitive and reliable tools for detection and staging of head and neck cancers. This article describes the role of PET/CT in initial staging of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the utility of CT/MR perfusion imaging in qualitative analysis of tumor tissue, and the usefulness of diffusion weighted MR and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging in head and neck oncological imaging.
