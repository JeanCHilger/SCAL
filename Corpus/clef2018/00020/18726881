Preoperative investigations in the management of peritoneal surface malignancy with cytoreductive surgery and perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy: Expert consensus statement. At the Fifth International Workshop on Peritoneal Surface Malignancy, in Milan, the consensus on preoperative investigations for peritoneal surface malignancy was obtained through the Delphi process. The results showed that 100% of the voters considered that contrast-enhanced multi-sliced CT was the fundamental imaging modality, whereas MRI, PET, laparoscopy and serum tumor markers were regarded as useful, but not fundamental investigational modalities.
