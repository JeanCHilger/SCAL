The use of the water deprivation test for the diagnosis of apparent psychogenic polydipsia in a socially deprived African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus erithacus). A case report is presented of primary (psychogenic) polydipsia in a pet African grey parrot. A water deprivation test was employed to test the release of arginine vasotocin and the response of the kidneys to this neurohypophyseal hormone. After a diagnosis was made water restriction resulted in the disappearance of clinical signs. It seems that psychogenic polydipsia, like feather picking, is a neurosis resulting from social deprivation.
