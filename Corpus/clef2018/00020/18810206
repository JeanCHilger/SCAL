Tissue changes after radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas. The specific effects of radiosurgery on brain tumor tissue are not well understood. We review several approaches that have been used to address this issue. Correlating the radiobiology of radiosurgery with the radioclinical outcome may help to understand these tissue changes. In vivo imaging investigations are usually performed with MRI, but the use of functional and metabolic imaging, such MR spectroscopy, positron emission tomography or single-photon emission computed tomography may provide additional information on the effects of radiosurgery. Finally, histological observations represent an invaluable source of information, when systematically analyzed in their clinical context.
