Diagnostic value of myocardial perfusion imaging and multislice spiral computed tomography for coronary artery disease. To investigate the diagnostic value of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) for coronary artery disease (CAD).Coronary angiography (CAG), MPI and MSCT were performed in 43 patients (36 with suspected, 7 with known CAD). MPI examinations were evaluated semiquantitatively by agreement of two experienced observers. SDS (summed difference score) > 1 was defined as reversible ischemia, and each myocardial segment was allocated to the territory of one of the coronary arteries. The MSCT results were defined as positive when stenoses (> or = 50%) were found in one main vessel or its main branch vessel. CAG results served as "gold standard". The diagnostic values of MPI and MSCT for CAD were compared respectively on patient basis and on vessel basis.On patient basis, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of MPI for diagnosing CAD were 79.17%, 84.21% and 81.40% which were similar as those of MSCT: 83.33%, 89.47% and 86.05% (all P > 0.05). On vessel basis, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of MPI were 53.19%, 89.02% and 75.97% which were also similar to those of MSCT: 70.21%, 95.12% and 86.05% (all P > 0.05).The non-invasive MPI and MSCT provide satisfactory and similar diagnostic information on diagnosing CAD.
