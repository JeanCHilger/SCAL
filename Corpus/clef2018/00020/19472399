Cervical cancer histology and tumor differentiation affect 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake. This study aimed to evaluate the variation in cervical cancer glucose metabolism for different tumor histologies and levels of differentiation, as measured by the uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) by positron emission tomography (PET).The study population consisted of 240 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages Ib1 through IVb cervical cancer, who underwent a pretreatment FDG-PET. Tumor histology included 221 squamous cell (SC), 4 adenosquamous (AS), and 15 adenocarcinoma (AC) tumors. There were 14 well, 145 moderately, and 81 poorly differentiated tumors. The stage distribution was as follows: 70 stage I tumors (9 AC, 2 AS, and 59 SC), 102 stage II tumors (3 AC, 1 AS, and 98 SC), 64 stage III tumors (3 AC, 1 AS, and 60 SC), and 4 stage IV tumors (4 SC). From the FDG-PET, maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was determined. The variation in SUVmax was analyzed for differences based on tumor histology and differentiation.For all patients, the mean SUVmax was 11.62 (range, 2.50-50.39). The mean SUVmax by histology was as follows: SC, 11.91 (range, 2.50-50.39) AS, 8.85 (range, 6.53-11.26)Cervical tumor FDG uptake varied by histology and differentiation. SC tumors demonstrated a significantly higher SUVmax compared with nonsquamous cell tumors, and poorly differentiated tumors also had a higher SUVmax.
