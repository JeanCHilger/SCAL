Social support and striatal dopaminergic activities: is there a connection? Although patients' social support is a critical factor for the prognosis of mental disorder treatments, biological mechanisms responsible for the impact of social support remain scarcely explored. We speculated that there may be an association between social support and central dopaminergic activities in humans.A total of 65 medicated patients with schizophrenia and their primary first-degree caregivers and 54 healthy volunteers were recruited for Studies 1 and 2, respectively. In Study 1, the extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) of medicated patients with schizophrenia and the social support scores of their caregivers were examined. In Study 2, the availability of striatal D(2)/D(3) receptors, dopamine transporters (DAT) and social support scores were measured in 54 healthy volunteers.Study 1: the EPS scores of medicated patients with schizophrenia were negatively correlated with the social support scores of their relatives. Study 2: a positive correlation between the subjective social support scores and striatal DAT availability was noted.The central dopaminergic activity may be linked to the sense of social support.
