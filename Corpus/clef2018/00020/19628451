A position sensitive gamma-ray scintillator detector with enhanced spatial resolution, linearity, and field of view. The performance of a position sensitive gamma-ray scintillator detector (PSD) is described. This PSD is based on a lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) crystal read out by a crossed-wire anode position sensitive photomultiplier tube (PSPMT). The main difference with respect to similar existing devices is the individual multi-anode readout (IMAR) approach that is followed here. This method allows to exploit better the intrinsic characteristics of the PSPMT, thus yielding better linearity, improved spatial resolution, and a larger field of view. The new detector is intended for the characterization of 3-D position sensitive germanium detectors.
