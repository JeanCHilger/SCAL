The 18F-FDG myocardial metabolic imaging in twenty seven pilots with regular aerobic training. To evaluate the characteristics of myocardial (18)F-FDG imaging in pilots with regular aerobic exercise training.Twenty seven healthy male pilots with regular aerobic exercise training were included in this study. The subjects were divided into fasting (n = 17) or non-fasting group (n = 10). Fluorine-18-labeled deoxyglucose and Tc-99m-sestamibi dual-nuclide myocardial imaging were obtained at rest and at target heart rate during bicycle ergometer test. The exercise and rest myocardial perfusion imaging were analyzed for myocardial ischemia presence. The myocardial metabolism imaging was analyzed with the visual semi-quantitative analyses model of seventeen segments.The secondary-extreme heart rate (195-age) was achieved in all subjects. There was no myocardial ischemia in all perfusion imaging. In the visual qualitative analyses, four myocardial metabolism imaging failed in the fasting group while one failed in the non-fasting group (P > 0.05). In the visual semi-quantitative analyses, myocardial metabolism imaging scores at rest or exercise in all segments were similar between two groups (P > 0.05). In the fasting group, the myocardial metabolism imaging scores during exercise were significantly higher than those at rest in 6 segments (P < 0.05). In the non-fasting group, the scores of 3 exercise myocardial metabolism imaging were significantly higher than those at rest (P < 0.05).Satisfactory high-quality myocardial metabolism imaging could be obtained at fasting and exercise situations in subjects with regular aerobic exercise.
