Non-invasive assessment of coronary artery disease with CT coronary angiography and SPECT: a novel dose-saving fast-track algorithm. To validate a new low-dose and rapid stepwise individualized algorithm for non-invasive assessment of ischemic coronary artery disease by sequential use of prospectively ECG-triggered low-dose CT coronary angiography (CTCA) and low-dose single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT-MPI).Forty patients referred for elective invasive coronary angiography (CA) were prospectively enrolled to undergo a comprehensive non-invasive evaluation with low-dose CTCA and a dose-reduced stress/rest SPECT-MPI scan (using dedicated reconstruction algorithms for low count scans). The following algorithm was reviewed: CTCA first, followed by a stress-only MPI if a coronary stenosis (> or = 50% diameter narrowing) or equivocal findings were observed. Only abnormal stress MPI scans were followed by rest MPI. The accuracy of the individualized algorithm to predict coronary revascularization and its mean effective radiation dose were assessed.CTCA documented CAD in 18 and equivocal findings in two patients, thus, requiring additional stress MPI scans. Of these, 16 were abnormal, therefore requiring a rest MPI scan, revealing ischemia in 15 patients. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value, and accuracy of the individualized algorithm for predicting coronary revascularization was 93.3%, 96.0%, 96.0%, 93.3% and 95.0% on a per-patient base. The mean effective radiation dose was significantly lower for the individualized (4.8 +/- 3.4 mSv) versus the comprehensive method (8.1 +/- 1.5 mSv) resulting in a total population radiation dose reduction of 132.6 mSv.This new individualized low-dose algorithm allows rapid and accurate prediction of invasive CA findings and of treatment decision with minimized radiation dose.
