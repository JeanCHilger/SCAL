Cytotoxic drug residues in urine of dogs receiving anticancer chemotherapy. The presence of cytotoxic drug residues in urine of dogs may represent an exposure risk for pet owners and other people as well as a potential environmental contaminant. However, studies on cytotoxic drug residues in excretions of clinical patients are lacking in veterinary oncology.Variable concentrations of cytotoxic residues are present in urine samples, depending on sampling time and substance.Client-owned dogs with lymphoma or mast cell tumors treated with standard chemotherapy protocols.Urine samples were collected before, directly after, and on days after administration of chemotherapy. Measurement of vincristine, vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin residues in canine urine was performed by a quantitative liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method.Median cyclophosphamide residue concentration was 398.2 microg/L directly after treatment (d0) and was below the level of detection on days 1-3 (d1, d2, d3). Median vincristine residue concentration was 53.8 microg/L directly after treatment and was 20.2, 11.4, and 6.6 microg/L on days 1, 2, and 3. Median vinblastine residues were 144.9 (d0), 70.8 (d1), 35.6 (d2), and 18.7 microg/L (d3) with low concentrations detectable for 7 days after treatment. Median urine doxorubicin concentrations were 354.0 (d0), 165.6 (d1), 156.9 (d2), and 158.2 microg/L (d3). Low concentrations of doxorubicin were measurable up to 21 days after administration.Variable concentrations of chemotherapeutics were measured in urine samples, depending on sampling time point and drug. Findings may inform current chemoprotection guidelines and help minimize exposure risks.
