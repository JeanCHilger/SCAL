Effects of the combined treatment with Metformin/Glimepiride on endothelial function of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A positron emission tomography (PET) evaluation study. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of treatment, with Metformin alone or with the combination of Glimepiride/Metformin, on coronary endothelial function in asymptomatic patients with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) Methods: 16 asymptomatic patients with type DM2 and 15 healthy controls (HC) were studied. At baseline and after treatment, myocardial blood flow (MBF) was measured with 13N-ammonia Possitron Emission Tomography (PET) at rest, during cold pressor testing (CPT) and during pharmacologic stress with adenosine. The endothelial dependent vasodilation index (EDVI), myocardial flow reserve (MFR) and the percentage of the change between rest MBF and CPT MBF (%deltaMBF) were calculated as markers of endothelial function. MBF was normalized to the rate pressure product (RPP).EDVI and %deltaMBF were significantly lower in diabetic patients before treatment in comparison with HC demonstrating endothelial dysfunction in the former. Treatment with Glimepiride/Metformin significantly increased EDVI and %deltaMBF in diabetic patients from baseline, thus showing an improvement in coronary endothelial function.
