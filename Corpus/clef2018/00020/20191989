Coronary artery disease and cardiac ischemic disease: two different pathologies with different diagnostic procedures. Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death in the Western world, and early detection of CAD allows optimal therapeutic management. The gold standard has always been invasive coronary angiography, but over the years various non-invasive techniques have been developed to detect CAD, including cardiac SPECT and cardiac computed tomography (Cardiac CT). Cardiac SPECT permitted visualization of myocardial perfusion and have focused on the assessment of the hemodynamic consequences of obstructive coronary lesions as a marker of CAD. Cardiac CT focuses on the detection of atherosclerosis rather than ischemia, and permit detection of CAD at an earlier stage. Objectives of this manuscript are to discuss the clinical experience with both modalities and to provide a critical review of the strengths and limitations of Cardiac SPECT and Cardiac CT for the diagnostic and management of patients with suspected CAD or cardiac ischemic disease.
