The Swedish reflux trial in children: IV. Renal damage. We compared the development of new renal damage in small children with dilating vesicoureteral reflux randomly allocated to antibiotic prophylaxis, endoscopic treatment or surveillance as the control group.Included in the study were 128 girls and 75 boys 1 to younger than 2 years with grade III-IV reflux. Voiding cystourethrography and dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy were done before randomization and after 2 years. Febrile urinary tract infections were recorded during followup. Data analysis was done by the intent to treat principle.New renal damage in a previously unscarred area was seen in 13 girls and 2 boys. Eight of the 13 girls were on surveillance, 5 received endoscopic therapy and none were on prophylaxis (p = 0.0155). New damage was more common in children with than without febrile recurrence (11 of 49 or 22% vs 4 of 152 or 3%, p <0.0001).In boys the rate of new renal damage was low. It was significantly higher in girls and most common in the control surveillance group. There was also a strong association between recurrent febrile UTIs and new renal damage in girls.
