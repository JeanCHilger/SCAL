Annexin A5-quantum dot-DTPA-gadolinium Optical fluorescence imaging is increasingly used to monitor biological functions of specific targets (1-3). However, the intrinsic fluorescence of biomolecules poses a problem when visible light (350-700 nm) absorbing fluorophores are used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700-1000 nm) detection avoids the background fluorescence interference of natural biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues. NIR fluorophores have wider dynamic range and minimal background as a result of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. They also have high sensitivity, resulting from low infrared background, and high extinction coefficients, which provide high quantum yields. The NIR region is also compatible with solid-state optical components, such as diode lasers and silicon detectors. NIR fluorescence imaging is becoming a non-invasive alternative to radionuclide imaging in small animals (4). Fluorescent semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are nanocrystals made of CdSe/CdTe-ZnS with radii of 1-10 nm (5-7). They can be tuned to emit in a range of wavelengths by changing their sizes and composition, thus providing broad excitation profiles and high absorption coefficients. They have narrow and symmetric emission spectra with long, excited-state lifetimes, 20-50 ns, as compared with 1-10 ns of fluorescent dyes. They process good quantum yields of 40-90% and high extinction coefficients. They are more photo-stable than conventional organic dyes. They can be coated and capped with hydrophilic materials for additional conjugations with biomolecules, such as peptides, antibodies, nucleic acids, and small organic compounds, which were tested
