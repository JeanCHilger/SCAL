 It has been reported that almost 85% of critically ill patients in hospitals have fever but show no apparent signs of infection (2, 3). Prolonged febrile episodes are often fatal, so the detection of infection at an early stage is important in patient management to achieve a favorable treatment outcome. Radiological (x-ray computed tomography) and imaging (magnetic resonance imaging) techniques are often not suitable for the early detection of infection because such techniques are focused on specific body parts and provide information only if morphological changes have occurred in the applied areas (4, 5). In contrast, scintigraphy can scan the entire body and easily detect and distinguish between an infection and inflammation because it relies on functional, morphologically invisible, changes in the tissue (6). A variety of radiolabeled compounds, including
