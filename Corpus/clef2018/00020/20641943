 Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is a 75-kDa, heterodimeric, glycosylated protein that is a key cytokine for the differentiation of T helper 1 (Th1) cells, and it is also involved in the activation of natural killer (NK) cells (1). Although IL-12 is secreted mainly by monocytes, B cells, and cells positive for major histocompatibility complex II, the IL-12 receptor is expressed only on the activated T or NK cells (2). The Th1 cells are characterized by the production of interferon-Î³ and are believed to have a role in the development of chronic inflammatory disorders because of their function of clearing intracellular pathogens (3). Currently only a few non-invasive techniques are available for the diagnosis or monitoring of chronic inflammation and infection. Radioactive fluorine-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (
