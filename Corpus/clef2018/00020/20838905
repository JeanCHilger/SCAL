A noninvasive [99mTc]DTPA SPECT/CT imaging methodology as a measure of lung permeability in a guinea pig model of COPD. The purposes of this study are (1) to develop an efficient aerosol inhalation system for the delivery of [(99m)Tc]DTPA aerosol into guinea pig airways with high uniformity for measuring lung clearance using SPECT/CT imaging, as a measure of lung permeability, and (2) to use [(99m)Tc]DTPA studies in guinea pig model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to determine its usefulness in studying pathogenesis of COPD.We developed an aerosol delivery system and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging method to measure the pulmonary clearance rate in anesthetized guinea pigs. In this system, an 830-cc rebreather exposure chamber was filled with oxygen immediately before a 5 min [(99m)Tc]DTPA (4-5 mCi/mL) aerosol exposure. The rebreather included a top mounted AeroNeb micro pump nebulizer, a nose-only exposure tube, and rear evacuation port. An 830-cc rebreather exposure chamber was filled with oxygen immediately before 5 min [(99m)Tc]DTPA (4 ∼ 5 mCi/mL) aerosol exposure. One control and one cigarette smoking group were studied.Images showed high and uniform lung deposition and the mean clearance rate was increased by 37% in smoking group.The combined SPECT/CT imaging method developed here can be used for serial evaluation of lung function and its response to drug therapy in guinea pig model of COPD.
