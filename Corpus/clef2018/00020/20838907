18F-FET PET/CT in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: an intra-individual comparison with 18F-FDG PET/CT. To assess the diagnostic value of O-2-fluoro-18(F)-ethyl-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma compared with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT at initial staging and following radiochemotherapy.Thirteen patients were prospectively enrolled each of them underwent an (18)F-FDG PET/CT and (18)F-FET PET/CT before treatment. Ten of those were scanned 10 weeks after treatment.Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for (18)F-FDG PET/CT (primary and lymph node metastases) at initial staging were 89%, 50%, and 81%. For (18)F-FET PET/CT the numbers were 70%, 90%, and 74%. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for (18)F-FDG PET/CT at follow-up were 71%, 65%, and 67%. For (18)F-FET PET/CT the numbers were 29%, 100%, and 83%. Additionally, (18)F-FDG PET/CT detected a higher number of second malignancies or distant metastases.(18)F-FET is no substitute for (18)F-FDG. Although it is more specific, too many malignant lesions are missed due to its lower sensitivity.
