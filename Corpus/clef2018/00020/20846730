Brain ingress of regulatory T cells in a murine model of HIV-1 encephalitis. CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) transform the HIV-1 infected macrophage from a neurotoxic to a neuroprotective phenotype. This was demonstrated previously in a murine model of HIV-1 encephalitis induced by intracranial injection of HIV-1/vesicular stomatitis virus-infected bone marrow macrophages. In this report, relationships between Treg ingress of end organ tissues, notably the brain, and neuroprotection were investigated. Treg from EGFP-transgenic donor mice were expanded, labeled with indium-111, and adoptively transferred. Treg distribution was assayed by single photon emission computed tomography and immunohistochemistry. Treg readily migrated across the blood brain barrier and were retained within virus-induced neuroinflammatory sites. In non-inflamed peripheral tissues (liver and spleen) Treg were depleted. These observations demonstrate that Treg migrate to sites of inflammation where they modulate immune responses.
