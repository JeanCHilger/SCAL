4-[18F]fluoroglutamic acid (BAY 85-8050), a new amino acid radiotracer for PET imaging of tumors: synthesis and in vitro characterization. There is a high demand for tumor specific PET tracers in oncology imaging. Besides glucose, certain amino acids also serve as energy sources and anabolic precursors for tumors. Therefore, (18)F-labeled amino acids are interesting probes for tumor specific PET imaging. As glutamine and glutamate play a key role in the adapted intermediary metabolism of tumors, the radiosynthesis of 4-[(18)F]fluoro l-glutamic acid (BAY 85-8050) as a new specific PET tracer was established. Cell-uptake studies revealed specific tumor cell accumulation.
