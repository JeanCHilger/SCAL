An interdisciplinary outreach model of African American recruitment for Alzheimer's disease research. The African American Outreach Satellite (Satellite) provides educational outreach to facilitate African American recruitment for longitudinal studies at the Washington University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). This descriptive article characterizes the Satellite's recruitment methods, plan for community engagement, results of recruitment efforts, and potential for replication.The Satellite developed a comprehensive outreach and recruitment plan that identifies and addresses barriers to research participation. The Satellite conducts community outreach and recruitment programs and training for health care providers.Enrollment of cognitively healthy and mildly demented African Americans for participation in all ADRC studies increased following implementation of the recruitment plan. Current African American participation rates for ADRC studies include 39% for lumbar puncture, 43% for positron emission tomography with Pittsburgh Compound-B, 52% for magnetic resonance imaging, 95% for apolipoprotein E genotype testing, and 100% for clinical and cognitive assessment.The Satellite reduces barriers to research participation, encourages retention through sustained interactions with participants and their families, and develops lasting partnerships with community organizations and health professionals who care for African American elders.
