Nano/micro electro-spun polyethylene terephthalate fibrous mat preparation and characterization. Electro-spun polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibrous mats are potential substrates for biotechnological and biomedical applications. In this regard, substrate characteristics including, fiber diameter, orientation and mechanical properties play an important role in controlling the interaction of substrate with biological entities. However, few studies reporting the preparation of electro-spun PET substrates with such controlled characteristics have been published. In this study, electro-spun PET fibrous mats with fiber diameters in the nanometer and micrometer range were produced by varying polymer solution concentration and flow rate. Fiber orientation within the mats was also varied by varying collector surface velocities in rotation and translation. Their morphological, mechanical, thermal and structural properties were evaluated as a function of fiber diameter and collector speed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a micromechanical tester, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. Varying polymer solution concentration and flow rate allowed the production of matrices with fiber diameters ranging from 400 nm to 2 μm. Tensile properties increased with fiber diameter and collector surface velocity. Thermal properties of electro-spun PET fibers were different from the structure of as received raw PET in the form of pellets, revealing an amorphous structure for the entire electro-spun PET. This was also confirmed by XRD analysis. No considerable differences were observed between electro-spun PET fibers, in terms of crystalline and thermal properties, produced under various conditions. These electro-spun mats with different fiber diameters, orientation and mechanical properties can be used for various applications including tissue engineering scaffolds.
