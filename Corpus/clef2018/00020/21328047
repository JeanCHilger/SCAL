Whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging in oncology: technical aspects and practical relevance. This review illustrates the relevance of whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging (WB-DWI) in the field of oncological imaging. WB-DWI is an alternative method to positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) due to the lack of radiation and lower examination costs. Technical aspects of WB-DWI and the current role of the method in cancer imaging regarding practical requirements in oncology are presented.
