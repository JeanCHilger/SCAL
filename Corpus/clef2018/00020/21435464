Pregnancy promotes melanoma metastasis through enhanced lymphangiogenesis. The relationships of pregnancy and melanoma have been debatable. Our aim was to assess the influence of gestation on the course of melanoma in a classic murine model of tumor progression and in women. B16 mouse melanoma cells were injected in nonpregnant or pregnant mice on day 5 of gestation. Animals were evaluated for tumor progression, metastases, and survival. Tumor sections were analyzed for lymphatic and blood vessel number and relative surface and expression of angiogenic growth factors. Finally, primary melanomas from pregnant and nonpregnant women, matched for age and tumor thickness, were also considered. Tumor growth, metastasis, and mortality were increased in B16-injected pregnant mice. Tumors displayed an increase in intratumoral lymphangiogenesis during gestation. This increased lymphatic angiogenesis was not observed in normal skin during gestation, showing its specificity to the tumor. An analysis of melanoma from pregnant and matched nonpregnant women showed a similar increase in lymphatic vessels. Tumors from pregnant mice had increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A at the RNA and protein levels. The increased vascular endothelial growth factor A production by melanoma cells could be reproduced in culture using pregnant mouse serum. In conclusion, pregnancy results in increased lymphangiogenesis and subsequent metastasis. Caution should be applied in the management of patients with advanced-stage melanoma during gestation.
