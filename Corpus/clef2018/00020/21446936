Minimally invasive inguinal technique for the management of duplex ureteric anomaly. To present outcomes of a minimally invasive inguinal technique for the separation of the distal part of ureters in duplex systems and for the extravesical ureteroneocystostomy of only the pathologically involved ureter.From November 2001 to February 2007, we performed extravesical reimplantation of only the involved ureter in 21 duplex systems, of which 14 were refluxing (megaureters) and seven had obstruction of the ureterovesical junction. The mean (range) age of the patients was 39 (17-59) months. In seven patients, ureterocutaneostomy (of the involved ureter only) was performed first, with reimplantation 3-6 months later, after the diameter of the ureter had decreased, to ensure safe reimplantation. The mean (range) postoperative follow-up was 28 (12-47) months.Postoperative voiding cysto-urethrograms (VCUGs) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), showed an absence of vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) or obstruction in the ureters of the first 10 patients. In the remaining 11 patients, there was no ultrasound detectable dilatation, but symptomatic urinary tract infection developed in two of these patients. Subsequent VCUG and MRI results showed no obstructions or VURs.Our results showed that the minimally invasive inguinal approach to separation of ureters in duplex systems and single ureteroneocystostomy of only the pathologically involved ureter represents a viable treatment option.
