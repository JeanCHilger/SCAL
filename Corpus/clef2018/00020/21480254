Single photon emission tomography/computed tomography (SPET/CT) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to image cancer. Hybrid systems associating the sharpness of anatomic images coming from computed tomography (CT) and radionuclide functional imaging (SPET or PET) are opening a new era in oncology. This multimodal imaging method is now routinely used for the diagnosis, extent, follow up, treatment response and detection of occult disease in different types of malignancies with a significant impact on the treatment strategy leading for a change for more than 68% of all investigated patients.
