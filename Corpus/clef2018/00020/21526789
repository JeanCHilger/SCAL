Photoinduced electron transfer in a room temperature ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium octyl sulfate micelle: a temperature dependent study. The effect of temperature on the dynamics of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between different coumarin dyes and N,N-dimethyl aniline in a room temperature ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium octyl sulfate ([C(4)mim][C(8)SO(4)]) micelle have been investigated using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence quenching measurements at four different temperatures: 208, 298, 308, and 318 K. The quenching rates (k(q)(TR)) of the PET process in this micellar system are found to be lower than the PET rate in sodium dodecyl sulfate and Triton-X 100 micelle and almost comparable to the dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide micelle due to larger donorâ€“acceptor separation in the micellar phase. The temperature dependent PET rates are well correlated with the Arrhenius type of correlation for all the coumarin dyes. Marcus type of inversion in PET rates has been observed at relatively lower exergonicity, and the correlation plots gradually move upward with the increase of temperature.
