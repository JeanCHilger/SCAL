Does compliance status predict clinical status in patients undergoing endoscopic management of vesico-ureteral reflux? Previous studies of endoscopic management of vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) have had non-compliance rates around 50%. We examined success rates of patients non-compliant with a delayed follow up protocol after endoscopic injection for VUR.Patients undergoing Double HIT, dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer endoscopic injection for VUR were enrolled in a 1-year, delayed voiding cysto-urethrogram (VCUG) study. All patients non-compliant with the VCUG were contacted and information on their clinical status was collected. Non-compliant patients were re-scheduled for a VCUG.49/54 (91%) patients underwent endoscopic injection for VUR and completed the 6-week ultrasound. At 1-year 49% (24/49) were non-compliant with a VCUG 75% (18/24) were contacted and provided clinical information. All but one patient agreed to the VCUG. Patients compliant with the 1-year VCUG showed 96% (24/25) clinical and 92% (23/25) radiologic success rates. Non-compliant patients had an 89% (16/18) clinical success rateLong-term compliance remains an issue for patients treated endoscopically for VUR, but compliance does not predict clinical status as both groups have favorable clinical outcomes. The repeat VCUG is a barrier to long-term follow up as only 21% of patients underwent the study.
