Developing a multivariable prognostic model for pancreatic endocrine tumors using the clinical data warehouse resources of a single institution. OBJECTIVE: Current staging systems are not accurate for classifying pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) by risk. Here, we developed a prognostic model for PETs and compared it to the WHO classification system. METHODS: We identified 98 patients diagnosed with PET at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center (1999 to 2009). Tumor and clinical characteristics were retrieved and associations with survival were assessed by univariate Cox analysis. A multivariable model was constructed and a risk score was calculated the prognostic strength of our model was assessed with the concordance index. RESULTS: Our cohort had median age of 60 years and consisted of 61.2% women
