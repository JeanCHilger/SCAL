Spinal infection multidisciplinary management project (SIMP): from diagnosis to treatment guideline. Spine infections require a multidisciplinary approach to be treated and solved. A guide line to drive physicians in the deep complexity of such a disease is extremely helpful. SIMP suggests a flow-chart built up on clear concepts such as right and well managed antibiotic therapy, sound stability of the spine, correct and smart use of the standard and functional imaging techniques, such as f18 FDG PET/CT. In 16 months a total of 41 patients have been treated for spondylodiscitis, discitis and vertebral osteomyelitis by our team of physicians and 25 patients have been enrolled in a prospective study whose target is the assessment of the SIMP flow-chart and of every single aspect that characterize it.
