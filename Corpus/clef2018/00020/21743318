New diagnostic imaging modalities for pancreatic disease. Imaging of the pancreas is critical for diagnostic decision-making. Improvements in imaging have the potential to translate into improved patient outcomes by more accurate and rapid diagnosis. Evolving approaches to imaging for pancreatic diseases in the past year are reviewed.The approach to patients with cystic lesions continues to focus on careful patient selection for surgery and targeted use of imaging and cyst sampling. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm patients appear to have cancer risk independent of the neoplastic cyst itself. Imaging continues to focus on improved approaches to differentiation of inflammatory from neoplastic pancreatic mass lesions.The approach to patients with suspected pancreatic disease continues to evolve, thanks to improved imaging. Recently developed diagnostic and treatment strategies show promise for improved patient outcomes.
