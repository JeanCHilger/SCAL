Parametric Images in Assessing Bone Grafts Using Dynamic F-Fluoride PET. The early identification of graft failure would improve patient management. (18)F-fluoride is a suitable tracer for quantifying bone metabolism. Performance of parametric images constructed by Patlak graphical analysis (PGA) with various time periods was evaluated in the analysis of dynamic (18)F-fluoride PET studies of eight patients with fibula bone grafts after limb salvage surgery. The PGA parametric image approach tended to underestimate influx rate. The linear portion of PGA analysis was found to be from 10 to 50â€‰min. It shows promise in providing a quantitative assessment of the viability of bone grafts.
