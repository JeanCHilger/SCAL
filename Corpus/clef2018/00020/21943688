Proliferation of rat mesenchymal stem cells in collagen sponges reinforced with poly(ethylene terephthalate) fibers by stirring culture method. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of medium stirring conditions on the proliferation of rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in collagen sponges reinforced by the incorporation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fibers. A collagen solution with PET fibers homogeneously dispersed was freeze-dried, followed by dehydrothermal cross-linking to obtain a collagen sponge incorporating PET fibers. MSC were proliferated in the sponge by a stirring culture method. The PET fibers reinforcement significantly suppressed the sponge deformation in culture. The MSC proliferation was enhanced by the stirring culture to a significantly higher extent than that of a static one. Homogeneous distribution of cells proliferated was observed at the stirring rate of 50 rpm and compared with that at lower and higher rates. Combination of the PET fiber-reinforced sponge with the stirring culture method is a promising way to allow cells to homogeneously proliferate in the sponge.
