Increased affinity of dopamine for D(2) -like versus D(1) -like receptors. Relevance for volume transmission in interpreting PET findings. Evidence indicates that dopamine (DA) mainly acts as a volume transmission (VT) transmitter through its release into the extracellular fluid where the D(1) -like and D(2) -like receptors are predominantly extrasynaptic. It was therefore of interest to compare the affinities of the two major families of DA receptors. [(3)H] raclopride /DA and [(3)H] SCH23390/DA competition assays compared the affinity of DA at D(2) -like and D(1) -like receptors in rat dorsal striatal membrane preparations as well as in membrane preparations from CHO cell lines stably transfected with human D(2L) and D(1) receptors. The IC(50) values of DA at D(2) -like receptors in dorsal striatal membranes and CHO cell membranes were markedly and significantly reduced compared with the IC(50) values of DA at D(1) -like receptors. These IC(50) values reflect differences in both the high and low affinity states. The K(iH) value for DA at [(3)H] raclopride-labeled D(2) -like receptors in dorsal striatum was 12 nM, and this can help explain PET findings that amphetamine-induced increases in DA release can produce an up to 50% decrease of [(11)C] raclopride binding in the dorsal striatum in vivo. These combined results give indications for the existence of striatal D(2) -like receptor-mediated DA VT at the local circuit level in vivo. The demonstration of a K(iH) value of 183 nM for DA at D(1) antagonist-labeled D(1) -like receptors instead gives a likely explanation for the failure of a reduction of D(1) -like receptor binding after amphetamine-induced DA release in PET studies using the D(1) -like antagonist radioligands [(11)C] SCH23390 and [(11)C] NNC. It seems difficult to evaluate the role of the extrasynaptic D(1) receptors in VT in vivo with the PET radioligands available for this receptor.
