Unravelling global genome organization by 3C-seq. Eukaryotic genomes exist in the cell nucleus as an elaborate three-dimensional structure which reflects various nuclear processes such as transcription, DNA replication and repair. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) combined with chromosome conformation capture (3C), referred to as 3C-seq in this article, has recently been applied to the yeast and human genomes, revealing genome-wide views of functional associations among genes and their regulatory elements. Here, we compare the latest genomic approaches such as 3C-seq and ChIA-PET, and provide a condensed overview of how eukaryotic genomes are functionally organized in the nucleus.
