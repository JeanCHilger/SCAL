Downgrading of high-grade vesicoureteral reflux is a reliable option in the treatment of children with grade IV‒V reflux accompanied by breakthrough infections. To evaluate incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) and natural history of downgraded vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children with high-grade VUR following endoscopic correction.We retrospectively studied 54 children (13 males and 41 females) with a mean age of 1.8 years who underwent endoscopic correction of Grade IV‒V VUR due to breakthrough infections while on antibiotic prophylaxis. Reflux was Grade IV in 40 (74%) and V in 14 (26%) patients comprising 95 renal refluxing units (RRU). Reflux was corrected in 72 (76%) RRU. 18 (34%) patients/23 (24%) RRU demonstrated downgrading of VUR. 21 of the 23 RRU showed Grade II and 2 Grade III VUR, and were taken off antibiotic prophylaxis and allocated to observation. Patients were followed for 2-22 years (median 14 years).Technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan demonstrated preoperative renal scarring in 21 (78%) of the 23 RRU with downgraded VUR. None of the children developed febrile UTI after surgery. 1 RRU showed renal function deterioration. 8 (44%) of the 18 patients underwent follow-up voiding cystourethrogram, and in 7 (88%) there was either spontaneous resolution of VUR or downgrade to Grade I VUR.Downgrading of VUR is a reasonable option in patients with high-grade VUR suffering from breakthrough infections while on antibiotic prophylaxis. It leads to the cessation of febrile UTIs, further spontaneous resolution of VUR and may potentially avoid renal damage.
