Use of spectral analysis with iterative filter for voxelwise determination of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis with L-[1-11C]leucine PET. A spectral analysis approach was used to estimate kinetic parameters of the L-[1-(11)C]leucine positron emission tomography (PET) method and regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Spectral analysis applies to both heterogeneous and homogeneous tissues it does not require prior assumptions concerning number of tissue compartments. Parameters estimated with spectral analysis can be strongly affected by noise, but numerical filters improve estimation performance. Spectral analysis with iterative filter (SAIF) was originally developed to improve estimation of leucine kinetic parameters and rCPS in region-of-interest (ROI) data analyses. In the present study, we optimized SAIF for application at the voxel level. In measured L-[1-(11)C]leucine PET data, voxel-level SAIF parameter estimates averaged over all voxels within a ROI (mean voxel-SAIF) generally agreed well with corresponding estimates derived by applying the originally developed SAIF to ROI time-activity curves (ROI-SAIF). Region-of-interest-SAIF and mean voxel-SAIF estimates of rCPS were highly correlated. Simulations showed that mean voxel-SAIF rCPS estimates were less biased and less variable than ROI-SAIF estimates in the whole brain and cortex
