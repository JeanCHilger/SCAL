Innovation in cancer imaging. Cancer is rapidly becoming the worldwide leading cause of premature death. Iconographic techniques have traditionally provided information on tumor anatomy. The recent introduction of functional and molecular imaging techniques allows probing tumor physiology and biology in addition to mere anatomical description. In addition to the research implications, these novel imaging techniques offer early response assessment and target visualization which, in the era of personalized medicine, may offer significant advances in cancer therapy. Here, we provide an overview of the most important developments in cancer imaging, with a focus on the clinical applications.
