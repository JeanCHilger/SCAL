Single Agent Lenalidomide Activity in Multiple Myeloma Relapse Evidenced Uniquely by CT/PET. A 71 year old female with multiple myeloma presented with back pain seven year after autologous stem cell transplant. Skeletal bone survey and magnetic resonance imaging did not show a relapse that was evidenced by CT/PET. Lenalidomide as single agent induced a complete disappearance of the lesions 6 months later and confirmed after one year at CT/PET.
