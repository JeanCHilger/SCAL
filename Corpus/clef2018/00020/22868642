Sequential whole-body PET/MR scanner: concept, clinical use, and optimisation after two years in the clinic. The manufacturer's perspective. PET and MRI are established clinical tools which provide complementary information, but clinical workflow limits widespread clinical application of both modalities in combination. The two modalities are usually situated in different hospital departments and operated and reported independently, and patients are referred for both scans, often consecutively. With the advent of PET/MR as a new hybrid imaging modality there is now a possibility of addressing these concerns. There are two different design philosophies for integrated PET/MR imaging-positioning PET inside the MRI magnet or in tandem, similar to PET/CT. The Ingenuity TF PET/MR by Philips Healthcare is a sequential PET/MR tomograph combining state-of-the-art time-of-flight PET and high-field MRI with parallel transmission capabilities. In this review article we describe the technology implemented in the system, for example RF and magnetic shielding, MR-based attenuation correction, peculiarities in scatter correction, MR system optimisation, and the philosophy behind its design. Furthermore, we provide an overview of how the system has been used during the last two years, and expectations of how the use of PET/MR may continue in the years to come. On the basis of these observations and experiences we discuss the utility of the system, clinical workflow and acquisition times, and possible ways of optimization.
