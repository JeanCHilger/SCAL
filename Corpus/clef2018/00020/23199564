Procalcitonin, a useful biomarker in pediatric urinary tract infection. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common sources of bacterial infections among young febrile children. Accurate diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) and vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) are important because of their association with renal scarring, sometimes leading to long-term complications. However, the gold standard examinations are either a DMSA scan for APN and scarring, or cystography for VUR, but both present limitations (feasibility, pain, cost, etc.). Procalcitonin, a reliable marker of bacterial infections, was demonstrated to be a good predictor of renal parenchymal involvement in the acute phase and in late renal scars, as well as of high-grade VUR. These findings need further broad validations and impact studies before being implemented into daily practice. However, procalcitonin may play a role in the complex and still debated picture of which examination should be performed after UTI in children.
