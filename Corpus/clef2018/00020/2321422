30 years of urethral valve treatment in Sweden. To achieve the best possible late results in valve treatment we think the following procedure would be mandatory: 1. Immediate transfer to a specialised hospital. 2. Acute diagnostics with correction of the water and electrolytes balance. 3. Suprapubic procedure is preferable over the transurethral approach if the catheter is expected to remain indwelling for a length of time. 4. The obstructing urethral valve is the primary object. 5. Resection is done only in 12 o'clock position in dorsosacral (lithotomy) position. 6. In rare cases with a severely constricted neck of the bladder it may be necessary to perform resection after Turner-Warwick. 7. In most cases it is possible to avoid surgical intervention at the upper urinary tract. 8. Regular follow-up checks are urgently recommended (sonography, x-ray, endoscopy, urodynamics).
