New hydronephrosis and/or vesicoureteral reflux after bladder outlet surgery without augmentation in 75 children with neurogenic bladder. We report new upper tract changes in children after bladder neck (BN) surgery without augmentation for neurogenic incontinence.Consecutive children with neurogenic sphincteric incompetency had BN surgery without augmentation. Postoperative renal sonography and fluoroscopic urodynamics were done at 6 months, 12 months, and then annually.There were 75 patients with mean follow-up of 48 months. Of these, 17 (23%) developed new hydronephrosis (HN) or vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). All HN resolved with medical management, as did 25% of VUR cases. Persistent VUR was treated by dextranomer/hyaluronic acid injection, or re-implantation in two patients undergoing re-operative BN surgery. There was no association between these upper tract changes and end filling pressures (<40 cm vs. >40 cm) or continence status (dry vs. wet).Upper tract changes developed in 25% of patients with neurogenic bladders after BN surgery without augmentation during a follow-up of 48 months. All new HN and most new VUR resolved with medical management or minimally invasive intervention. No patient developed upper tract changes requiring augmentation.
