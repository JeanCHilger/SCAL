Intracellular uptake and accumulation of metaiodobenzylguanidine in neuroblastoma cells and small cell carcinoma of the lung. Recently m-131-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) has been successfully used to image neurocrest-derived tumours such as neuroblastoma. In fact, our autoradiographic evidences demonstrate that MIBG is able to bind, accumulate and be released by neuroblastoma cell line CHP 100 "in vitro", as well as by surgical biopsies from tumours bearing children. Moreover, all the cell lines tested "in vitro" were able to bind MIBG: neuroblastoma (WNT, CHP-100, IMR-32), small cell lung carcinoma (LC-8) and melanoma (WMB). A fibrosarcoma line, despite that it is not neurocrest related, was also able to bind MIBG. However only WNT, CHP-100 and the LC-8 lines were able to accumulate and then release large amounts of MIBG in cytoplasmatic vesicles. The heterogeneity of MIBG uptake "in vitro" seems related to the similar variability observed in the clinical scintigraphies. This phenomenon may be related to the biochemical maturity of individual neuroblastoma tumours.
