Early dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan in children with first febrile urinary tract infection. To determine use of early Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy in screening for vesicoureteral reflux following first febrile urinary tract infection.43 children (1 mo-5 yr) with first febrile urinary tract infection underwent micturating cystourethrography, abdominal sonogram and early dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy.Early dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy had 72% sensitivity and 76% specificity for vesicoureteral reflux. For dilating vesicoureteral reflux, sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 75%, respectively.Early dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy has the potential to replace micturating cystourethrography in initial evaluation of febrile urinary tract infection.
