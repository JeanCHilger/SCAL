Value of isotopic cystography in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux in childhood. We have studied 62 children with urinary infection simultaneously by means of micturitional cystoureterography (MCU) and indirect isotopic cystography. We confirm a correlation between the results of the MCU and in the indirect isotopic cystography in 86% of the ureters explored, whilst the results of the MCU and of the direct isotopic cystography coincided in 92% of the ureters explored. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of isotopic cystography, concluding that it is a suitable method for the diagnosis and evolutive control of vesicoureteral reflux in infancy.
