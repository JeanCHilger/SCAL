Results of SPECT thallium-201 of the myocardium in the diagnosis of coronary disease and the follow-up of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Sensitivity and specificity of 201Thallium-SPECT in rest-exercise studies were evaluated in 129 patients in comparison to coronary morphology. In addition, the results of 70 patients, examined before and after dilatation of coronary stenoses by PTCA were obtained. In this group, quantification of SPECT images was tested. Sensitivity in detection of CAD was 93%, specificity 84%. False negatives were most frequently found in the posterior wall. After PTCA 73% of the segments improved. With quantification, an increase of vitality by 11.6% and a decrease of the redistribution factor by a value of 8 was documented. 201Thallium-SPECT of the myocardium was found to be very useful to both evaluate CAD and follow-up interventional procedures. A quantification of slice-images is useful to objectively reveal therapeutic success.
