Production of gallium-66, a short-lived, positron emitting radionuclide. The excitation functions for the production of 66Ga and some other radionuclides produced by the 4He-particle bombardment of a natural copper target have been measured up to 31 MeV incident energy. The radiochemical separation of 66Ga from the irradiated copper target as well as from the other radionuclides formed is described. The yield of 66Ga at 18 MeV incident energy is 708 microCi/microAh at end of bombardment and the contamination of 67Ga is 0.25%. The intended use of the 66Ga produced is to label monoclonal antibodies for PET scanning.
