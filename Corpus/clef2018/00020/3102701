Radionuclide diagnosis and therapy of neural crest tumors using iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine. The successful application of [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) in diagnosis and therapy of pheochromocytoma has led to its use in other tumors which derive from the neural crest and potentially concentrate this radiopharmaceutical as well. In the present series, [131]MIBG total-body scintigraphy was used for detection of neuroblastoma in 47 patients and 47 cases of other neural crest tumors. The method was found to be as reliable in neuroblastoma (sensitivity 95%, specificity 100%), as it is in pheochromocytoma. Although other neural crest tumors may concentrate [131I]MIBG, this is not a consistent finding however, it is useful to investigate which tumors do, as this may provide an alternative treatment modality for some patients. Although followup is still very short, preliminary results of therapeutic use of [131I] MIBG in 21 patients indicate that this treatment modality may be effective in neuroblastoma and malignant pheochromocytoma.
