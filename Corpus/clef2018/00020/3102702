Iodine-131 MIBG scintigraphy of the extremities in metastatic pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma. Iodine-131 MIBG scintigraphy may be used to determine the presence or absence of metastases to the appendicular skeleton in malignant pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma. Normal bones show no uptake of [131I]MIBG and the joints are seen as photon-deficient areas surrounded by background muscle activity. Discrete concentrations of radioactivity in bone are often seen in patients with malignant pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma. Bone marrow involvement in neuroblastoma may be indicated by diffuse uptake of [131I]MIBG or focal accumulation at the metaphyses. Uncommonly, bone involvement may not be displayed by the [131I]MIBG images. Since conventional bone scanning agents may also fail to detect these tumors, skeletal scintigraphy with both [131I]MIBG and [99mTc]MDP is necessary to reliably stage malignant pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma.
