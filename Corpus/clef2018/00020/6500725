The use of C-18 SEP PAK cartridges to simplify routine production of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose. The synthesis of 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose has been simplified by the use of C-18 SEP PAK cartridges. The fluorinated sugar produced from the reaction of acetyl hypofluorite and tri-acetyl glucal (TAG) was extracted from the neutralized reaction mixture with C-18 SEP PAK cartridges. The product was washed off the cartridge with diethyl ether and hydrolyzed by HCl. After hydrolysis the product was purified by passage through ion retardation resin, alumina and another C-18 cartridge. The radiochemical purity was 98% and the radiochemical yield was 28%, decay corrected to EOB, with a total synthesis time of 50 min from EOB.
