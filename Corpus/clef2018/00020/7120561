Clinical applications of nuclear cystography. Nuclear cystography is a sensitive test for detection of vesicoureteral reflux. The value of this sensitivity has not always been appreciated fully. A significant degree of reflux that warrants surgical repair seems readily demonstrable by conventional x-ray methods. Our experience with x-ray and nuclear cystography illustrates the frequent inadequacies of the conventional x-ray study. In 15 of 86 patients reflux of significant clinical degree was demonstrated by the nuclear study alone. This information has proved valuable in the eventual management of these patients.
