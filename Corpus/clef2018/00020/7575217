Progressive apraxia in clinically discordant monozygotic twins. To determine disease concordancy in the first identical twin with corticobasal degeneration. The patients were 63-year-old, erythrocyte antigen-confirmed monozygotic male twins who were clinically discordant for progressive apraxia caused by corticobasal degeneration.Neuropsychologic and kinesiologic testing, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomographic measurements of cerebral metabolic rate for glucose.The affected twin had lower neuropsychologic and kinesiologic test scores than did his brother, particularly on tests sensitive to right-compared with left-hemisphere function widespread cerebral atrophy, worst in right parietotemporal corticesCorticobasal degeneration may remain clinically discordant in identical twins after 7 years. Positron emission tomography and neuropsychologic findings suggest the possibility of a preclinical stage of corticobasal degeneration. There is generalized cortical atrophy in patients with corticobasal degeneration in addition to focal atrophy.
