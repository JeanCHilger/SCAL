Single photon emission computed tomography using N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine in spinocerebellar degeneration. We investigated the clinical usefulness of N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for diagnosis of spinocerebellar degeneration. The uptake in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis was decreased in sporadic cerebelloolivary atrophy (Holmes, n = 9) and sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA, n = 6). The uptake in the pons was decreased in OPCA. The decrease of the uptake in the cerebellum and the pons was associated with clinical severity in OPCA. Our results show that semiquantitative SPECT analysis differentiates between the Holmes type and OPCA.
