Diagnostic imaging in children with urinary tract infection: the role of intravenous urography. Ninety children referred to hospital with urinary tract infection (UTI) were investigated by iv urography (IVU), ultrasonography (US) and 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA). Fifty-eight children also underwent micturating cystourethrography (MCUG). In 36 (40%) of the children, at least one result was abnormal. Abnormal findings were found in 29 children with IVU, in 10 with US and in 16 with DMSA. Six of the 58 children had vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in 8 kidneys. In 16 children, IVU was the only examination with an abnormal result, and in 10 of these the findings were considered important for treatment or prognosis. IVU is an important supplement to US and DMSA in investigation programs for children with UTI. IVU should be performed in cases of renal scars, dilatations or in children with recurrent infections.
