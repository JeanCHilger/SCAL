The intravenous urogram in the detection and evaluation of renal damage following urinary tract infection. Intravenous urography (IVU) still provides the most comprehensive structural assessment of the urinary tract. In particular, the radiological renal appearances approximate closely to the morphology of the renal scarring of reflux nephropathy or chronic atrophic pyelonephritis. It also provides reproducible renal measurements for follow-up assessment of renal growth and scarring. It is now less often used for first-line investigation of the acute urinary tract infection (UTI) because the swelling accompanying acute renal involvement is less easily recognised than the areas of defective function demonstrated on 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) studies. Also IVU contributes a higher radiation dose when calculated for full IVU (dependent on the number of films exposed) and there is a slight risk of side effects from injected contrast media, reduced by using non-ionic compounds. Because of its value in confirming such a serious diagnosis as renal scarring, suspected on ultrasonography or DMSA scintigraphy, modification of the technique of IVU with adequate preparation and the use of a reduced number of films, or single films localised to the renal areas, should be considered. Expertise in the interpretation of IVU must also be maintained because of the ancillary information regarding bowel and bladder function, the spine and evidence of stones, pertinent to the management of children with UTI and renal scarring. IVU and DMSA study remain complementary investigations.
