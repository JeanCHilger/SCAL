Scopolamine abolishes cerebral blood flow response to somatosensory stimulation in anesthetized cats: PET study. The effect of the cholinergic blocker, scopolamine on the cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to vibrotactile stimulation of a fore paw was studied using high-resolution positron emission tomography and H2 15O in 5 pentobarbital-anesthetized cats. Before scopolamine injection, the CBF response to the stimulation was found in the contralateral somatosensory cortex (mean ratio (contralateral/ipsilateral) control: stimulated 1.02 +/- 0.02: 1.17 +/- 0.05 P < 0.01). After intravenous injection of scopolamine (0.35 mg/kg), the CBF response was abolished. However, the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGlu) response to the same stimulation was unchanged after scopolamine injection in the same cats. We concluded that scopolamine abolishes the CBF response but not neuronal response to stimulation. We suggest that cholinergic mechanisms may play an important role for mediating CBF coupling to neuronal activity during physiological stimulation.
