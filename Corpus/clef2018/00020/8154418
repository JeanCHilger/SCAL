Does myocardial perfusion scintigraphy demonstrate clinical usefulness in patients with markedly positive exercise tests? An assessment of the method in a high-risk subset. To evaluate the clinical utility of perfusion scintigraphy in patients with markedly positive exercise ECGs, we studied 94 consecutive patients with markedly positive exercise ECGs 74 of them were also studied with scintigraphy. Patients undergoing scintigraphy had an intermediate pretest likelihood of coronary disease and were divided into two groups: those with reversible defects involving one complete area or aspects of multiple vascular areas (group 1, 38 patients), and those with normal scintigrams and reversible defects in a limited aspect of one vascular area, isolated fixed defects, or both (group 2, 36 patients). Among all demographic and exercise variables, only a hypotensive or blunted blood pressure response and scintigraphic lung uptake or cavitary dilation, although insensitive, were more frequent in group 1 (all p < 0.05). All 36 patients in group 1 and 14 of 18 in group 2 who underwent coronary angiography had significant coronary lesions
