Radioimmunoimaging of non-small cell lung cancer with 111In- and 99mTc-labeled monoclonal anti-CEA-antibodies. Radiolabeled monoclonal anti-CEA antibodies were used for radioimmunolocalization (RIL) of non-small cell lung cancer in 30 patients with 111In labeled anti CEA F(ab')2 fragment (BW 431/31) and in 16 with 99mTc-labeled intact MoAb (BW 431/26). RIL results were compared with those of other imaging modalities. Paraffin sections from some patients were also studied immunohistochemically using anti-CEA antibody. Patients with 111In labeled MoAB were imaged twice 1-4 days after injection and for image enhancement pulmonary and liver/spleen subtraction were performed. Twenty-seven of 28 primary tumors were positive and metastases were detected in all patients. The total number of lesions was 78 of which 61 (78%) could be detected by RIL. For verification CT was applied to the study of 46 lesions detected by RIL. We found 6 unknown lesions subsequently verified histologically. Using subtraction techniques we detected 9 lesions in 4 patients, later verified as pulmonary metastases, not detected in unprocessed images. Pleural, mediastinal and pericardial lesions were also better delineated in subtracted images than in unprocessed images. Imaging of non-small cell lung cancer with 99mTc-labeled MoAB was performed twice 4-24 h after injection. RIL results were compared with other imaging methods
