Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy of carcinoid tumours using the [111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-octreotide. Somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy using the 111In-labelled somatostatin-analogue octreotide ([111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-octreotide) was performed in 40 patients with carcinoid tumours. In 31/40 patients, this scintigraphy proved positive compared with the 33/40 patients whose tumours were disclosed on CT scans. In addition, 18 previously unidentified lesions were detected with this scintigraphy. Two of these lesions represented previously undetectable primary tumours. It is concluded that somatostatin receptor scintigraphy using [111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-octreotide has a future role in the staging of patients with carcinoid disease.
