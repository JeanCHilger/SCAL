Surgery for intractable infantile spasms: neuroimaging perspectives. Twenty-three infants and children underwent cortical resection (n = 15) or hemispherectomy (n = 8) for intractable infantile spasms. Infantile spasms were present at the time of surgery in 17 of the 23 patients in six, spasms had evolved to other seizure types during surgical evaluation. Children with a remote history of infantile spasms were excluded from this study. Focal or hemispheric lesions were identified by magnetic resonance imaging in seven children
