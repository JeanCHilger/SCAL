Rational use of CT in acute pyelonephritis: findings and relationships with reflux. Enhanced renal CT scanners were performed in 38 children (82% girls) to rule out acute pyelonephritis. Patients were divided in 2 groups on the basis of clinical presentation and bacteriology data. In patients of group A (n = 16, preliminary study), upper urinary tract infection (UTI) was certain. CT confirmed the diagnosis in all but 3 patients (a 2-year-old child and 2 patients with UTI developed on prior obstruction). In subsequently studied patients of group B (n = 22), clinical findings or bacteriology data were negative or questionable. CT made the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in 11 patients. As well as DMSA scintigraphy, CT scanner can help to diagnose or to rule out upper UTIs in difficult cases. In all boys of both groups, ipsilateral vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) was found by subsequent voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) on the side of pyelonephritis. In girls, this correlation was shown in only 7 of the 25 kidneys with pyelonephritis. This result supports the hypothesis of a gender-dependent contamination. We believe that absence of radiologic reflux cannot exclude the possibility of bacterial crossings of ureteric meatus capable to lead to genuine upper UTIs.
