Scintigraphy and sonography in reflux nephropathy: a comparison. The evaluation of reflux nephropathy (RNP) is a major task in the following up of children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Adequate monitoring of RNP development depends on the frequent use of sonographical and scintigraphical examinations. In order to evaluate the accuracy of sonography in monitoring RNP 63 patients suffering from VUR (mean age: 8.8 years, range: newborn to 18 years, male:female = 19:44) were examined prospectively. We calculated renal size sonographically and compared our data to static and dynamic renographic findings. Our results showed a good correlation between relative DMSA uptake and sonographically estimated relative renal size (r = 0.95, P < 0.001), whereas not unexpectedly the correlation between relative kidney function and sonographically estimated renal size was poor (r = 0.83, P < 0.01). We therefore believe, that in monitoring children with VUR, sonography can offer accurate information on questions about renal size and renal parenchymal structure as well as pelvic distention. With very small kidneys as well as with kidneys showing severe dilatation and above all for evaluating renal function, scintigraphy proved to be the better method.
