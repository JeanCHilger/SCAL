Stump pressure as a guide to the safety of permanent occlusion of the internal carotid artery. Does the absolute value of the stump pressure (post-occlusion back pressure) become a useful index of a good collateral circulation? The authors continuously monitored the mean arterial pressure before, during and after 20-minute balloon test occlusion in 24 patients. The stump pressure was then compared with the results of 99mTc-hexa-methyl propyleneamine (99mTc-HMPAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) performed after 20 minutes of test occlusion. Patients who failed to tolerate even brief periods of carotid occlusion and showed asymmetric decreases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) on SPECT were divided into high and moderate risk groups. Those with no significant change in CBF on the occluded side formed the minimum risk group. Mean stump pressure was over 50 mmHg in three of a total of 13 patients in the high and moderate risk groups, and below 50 mmHg in two of the 11 patients in the minimum risk group. The ratios of the initial mean stump pressure to the pre-occlusion mean arterial pressure (%) and of the final mean stump pressure at the end of occlusion to the post-opening mean arterial pressure (%) did not exceed 58% in any patient in the high and moderate risk groups, and were at least 60% in all patients of the minimum risk group. Maintenance of a mean stump pressure of 60% or more of the mean systemic pressure during test occlusion may be a more useful index of a good collateral circulation than the absolute value of mean stump pressure.
