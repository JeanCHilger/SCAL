Functional anatomy of GO/NO-GO discrimination and response selection--a PET study in man. The purpose of this study was to identify the functional fields activated in relation to the NO-GO decision. Nine healthy subjects participated in the study which consisted of two test positron emission tomography (PET) scans (GO/NO-GO task and response selection task) and one control scan. In the response selection task, subjects were asked to flex their thumb of the right hand when a light emitting diode (LED) placed 60 cm from their eyes turned on red and to flex their index finger of the right hand when LED turned on green. In the GO/NO-GO task, subjects were asked to flex their thumb when the LED turned on red, however, they were asked not to move their fingers when LED turned on green. In the control state, they were asked simply to look at the LED without any movement of finger during the course of the scan. The mean regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) change images for each task minus control and task minus task were calculated and fields of significant rCBF changes were identified. Several fields in the prefrontal cortex of the right hemisphere were specifically activated in relation to the GO/NO-GO task. The results indicate that the prefrontal cortex of the right hemisphere may be a key structure to make a decision not to move.
