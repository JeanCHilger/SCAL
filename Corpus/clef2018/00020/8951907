Sublingual nitrate plus 99Tcm-tetrofosmin infusion in the detection of severely ischaemic but viable myocardium: a comparative study with stress, redistribution, reinjection and late redistribution 201Tl imaging. To investigate the role of sublingual nitrate plus 99Tcm-tetrofosmin infusion in the detection of severely ischaemic but viable myocardium, we selected 25 patients with coronary artery disease who had at least one fixed segmental defect during conventional stress-redistribution (ST-RD) 201Tl single photon emission tomographic (SPET) imaging. Reinjection (RI) and 24 h late redistribution (LRD) imaging were also performed. Within a week of 201Tl imaging, one-day rest-stress (R-ST) 99Tcm-tetrofosmin SPET was performed with the same stress levels. The following day, 99Tcm-tetrofosmin was infused over 1 h immediately after sublingual nitrate administration and SPET images (N + Inf) were acquired. Of 100 fixed defects on R-ST 99Tcm-tetrofosmin imaging, 15 were reversible on N + Inf 99Tcm-tetrofosmin imaging. There was 91% concordance between ST-RD/RI/LRD 201Tl and R-ST/N + Inf 99Tcm-tetrofosmin imaging regarding reversibility. We conclude that N + Inf 99Tcm-tetrofosmin imaging may be clinically useful in the detection of severely ischaemic but viable myocardium.
