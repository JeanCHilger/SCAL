Semi-quantitative scintigraphic follow-up studies of cerebral arteriovenous malformations after radiosurgical treatment. An evaluation of semi-quantitative 99Tcm-red blood cell scintigraphy (RBCS) was undertaken in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) during follow-up after radiosurgical treatment. Twenty-seven patients were studied with an initial dynamic imaging sequence of 32 frames each lasting 2 s, planar images in four projections beginning 15 min post-injection and single photon emission tomography immediately following the planar imaging. A 2 ml cubital vein blood sample was imaged to obtain an extracorporeal equivalent of the intravascular activity. The counts within the AVM on a planar image were divided by the counts obtained from the image of the blood sample (corrected for the same acquisition time and radioactive decay). This value yielded the 'volume index' (VI), which was proportional to the volume of the AVM. The VI obtained from the first RBCS served as the initial reference value and was set at 100%. The VIs obtained from the follow-up investigations of the same patient in the same projection were expressed as the percentage of the initial VI. We found RBCS identified the AVM in all patients. The VIs obtained from the follow-up studies demonstrated a decrease in blood volume at different time intervals after radiosurgical treatment. RBCS provides a sensitive, relatively non-invasive, semi-quantitative method for measuring the relative volume and follow-up of the degree of obliteration of AVMs after radiosurgical treatment.
