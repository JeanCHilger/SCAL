Tc-HMPAO SPECT in persistent post-concussion syndrome after mild head injury: comparison with MRI/CT. The purposes of this study were: (1) to determine the prevalence of abnormal 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT scans in patients suffering from persistent post-concussive syndrome (PPCS) after mild closed head injury (CHI) (2) to compare SPECT with structural neuroimaging (MRI and CT) in patients with mild CHI
