Inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in post-ischaemic myocardium. Myocardial reperfusion following brief period of ischaemic is associated with prolonged, reversible periods of metabolic dysfunction. As the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is inhibited in vitro by reactive oxygen species, we hypothesized that production of reactive oxygen species during reperfusion would lead to inhibition of GAPDH in post-ischaemic myocardium.Anaesthetized closed-chest-dogs were subjected to 20 min balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Biopsy samples were taken after 3 and 24 h of reperfusion, to determine the activity of GAPDH and the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates in post-ischaemic and remote, non-ischaemic territories.A significant reduction in GAPDH activity was observed in post-ischaemic relative to remote tissue after 3 h reperfusion (4.8 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.2 mumol/min/mg protein P < 0.01). Western blotting revealed no reduction in the levels of GAPDH protein. Analysis of enzyme kinetics showed the loss of activity to be associated with decreased Vmax (5.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.2 mumol/min/mg proteinThese results suggest that inhibition of GAPDH activity may represent an important point at which glycolysis is limited during reperfusion, and further, that the mechanisms of enzyme inhibition do not involve simple oxidation or S-thiolation of critical active site thiol groups.
