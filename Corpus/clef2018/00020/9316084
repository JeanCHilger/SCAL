Evaluation of [125I]7 alpha-O-iodoallyl diprenophine as a new potential SPECT opioid receptor imaging agent. A new iodinated diprenorphine analog, [125I]7 alpha-O-iodoallyl diprenorphine ([125I]7 alpha-O-IA-DPN), was prepared by iododestannylation and characterized. As an opioid antagonist, this agent showed very high affinity (Ki = 0.4 +/- 0.2 nM) and 63% of specific binding by in vitro and in vivo binding studies. Inhibition curves indicated that this tracer labeled with the same affinities to three opioid receptors (mu = delta = kappa). The findings demonstrate that this proposed compound appears to be potential radioprobe for future study of opioid receptors by in vivo SPECT.
