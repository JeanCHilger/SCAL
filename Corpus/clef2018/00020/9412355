Fluid loss pressure in 45 children with congenital neurogenic bladder. This study analyzed the relation between leak point pressure (LPP) at first urodynamic evaluation and the status of the upper urinary tract (UUT) and renal reflux (RR).The study comprised 45 myelodysplastic children, one week to 13 years of age 19 (42%) were less than one year old. LPP was measured when liquid started to come out through the urethral meatus, around the 5-6 Fr catheter. UUT was evaluated by ultrasound and RR by voiding cystography.19 children had LPP < 30 cm H2O all cases had a normal UUT, although 5 (26%) had RR. Twenty-six cases (58%) had LPP > 30 cm H2OIn this study UUT was normal when LPP was < 30 cm H2O. Renal impairment and RR increased with LPP. Urethral functional obstruction carries a worse prognosis of pediatric neurogenic bladder. In these cases clean intermittent catheterization is recommended, regardless of patient age and sex.
