Simultaneous assessment of perfusion and myocardial viability with 2 isotope studies (thallium at rest and sestamibi in exercise). Initial experience in Mexico and Latin America. Rest-stress sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has sensitivity and specificity similar to those of thallium 201 SPECT for detection of coronary artery disease. However, sestamibi is not ideal agent to study myocardial viability. There is not published experience in Latin American using dual isotope SPECT protocol to evaluate myocardial perfusion and viability. We studied 44 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease, 37 of them with previous myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography was performed in all patients. We used a 3 mCi rest T 201 SPECT followed by stress and 25 mCi sestamibi injection. Sestamibi SPECT was performed 30 minutes after exercise or 1 hour after pharmacologic stress with dipyridamole. To validate perfusion findings patients returning next day for rest sestamibi injection and SPECT. Scintigraphic data were read by two blinded expert using 20 SPECT segment analysis and each segment was scored using 5 points scoring system (0 = normal, 4 = absent uptake). The segmental score agreement between rest thallium 201 and rest sestamibi and the comparison of defect reversibility percentage and non reversibility between both protocols was 90.7%.Separate acquisition dual isotope myocardial perfusion SPECT is accurate for coronary artery disease evaluation. It showed a good agreement with rest-stress sestamibi SPECT for assessment of rest perfusion defects and reversibility and it was a better method to evaluate myocardial viability.
