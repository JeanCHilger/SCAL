Studies on protein adsorption and activation of complement on hydrated aluminium surfaces in vitro. Adsorption of human plasma and serum proteins onto hydrated aluminium was studied by ellipsometry/antibody techniques, and soluble complement components iC3b, Bb, and C4d with commercial ELISA plates. Aluminium that was incubated in plasma for 1 min bound significant amounts of anti-lipoproteins (anti-LP), no antibodies against contact activation of coagulation proteins, and no anti-fibrinogen (anti-Fib). Time course studies with serum revealed increasing deposition of anti-C3c with time. Complement factor 1q (C1q) was antibody detectable only after short-time serum incubations, but no anti-IgG and anti-properdin bound to the protein film at any time. Anti-C3c was not deposited after exposure of the surfaces to Clq-depleted serum. Intriguingly, and in spite of increasing deposition of C3 to the surface with time, the combined ellipsometry and ELISA results gave no unequivocal proof of activation of complement by hydrated aluminium.
