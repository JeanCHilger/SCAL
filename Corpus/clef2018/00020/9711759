Brain glucose metabolism with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography before and after surgical resection of epileptogenic cavernous angiomas. Surgery of cavernous angiomas is often proposed due to the epileptogenic and hemorrhagic potential of this lesion. Little information is available on the impact of surgical resection on brain metabolism, locally or at a distance from the lesion. Fifteen patients presenting with a cavernoma and epileptic seizures underwent positron emission tomography examinations before and 1 year after surgical resection. We studied the quantitative cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGlu) with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose. The global brain CMRGlu remained unchanged after surgery. There was a significant decrease of metabolism in the lesion hemisphere, which remained unchanged after surgery. The perilesional regions were less metabolic than the contralateral ones and less metabolic than remote regions within the same hemisphere, before and after surgery. The absence of pre- to postsurgical variations suggests that the metabolic consequences of the lesion are maintained despite the surgical procedure during long-term follow-up studies.
