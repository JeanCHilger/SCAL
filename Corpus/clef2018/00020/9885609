Reflux in young patients: comparison of voiding US of the bladder and retrovesical space with echo enhancement versus voiding cystourethrography for diagnosis. To compare the usefulness of voiding US of the bladder and retrovesical space with echo enhancement with that of voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) for diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and to assess patient tolerance of the echo-enhancing agent.One hundred eighty-eight patients (aged 5 days to 20 years) referred for investigation of VUR underwent voiding US with echo enhancement, which was followed by VCUG in 110 patients (226 kidney-ureter units). After US of the renal tract, the bladder was filled with normal saline solution. Then SU U 508 A, a galactose-based, microbubble-containing echo-enhancing agent, was administered. Reflux was diagnosed when microbubbles appeared in the ureter or pelvicalyceal system.VUR was detected in 80 of the units with one (n = 18) or both (n = 62) methods. All grades of reflux were identified. In 15 units, reflux diagnosed at voiding US was not observed at VCUG the reverse was true in three units. In 208 (92%) of the 226 kidney-ureter units, there was concordance between the two methods regarding the diagnosis or exclusion of VUR. The echo-enhancing agent was well tolerated.SH U 508 A enhanced voiding US is as good as VCUG in the detection or exclusion of VUR and thus will make it possible to reduce the number of children having to be exposed to ionizing radiation.
