Correlations between brain SPECT and neuropsychology assessments in mild and moderate stages of Alzheimer's disease. Thirty-four patients with a probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (mild AD = 16 moderate AD = 18) and 12 matched controls were evaluated using semiquantitative SPECT-99mTc-HMPAO and neuropsychological tests (CERAD).Both temporal hypoperfusion (p < 0.01) and memory tests (p < 0.001) made it possible to differentiate the controls from mild AD patients. In these patients, significant correlations (p < 0.05) were also found between: 1) delayed recall test/temporal hypoperfusion, 2) learning memory test/temporoparietal and frontal hypoperfusion and 3) visual constructive praxis/posterior temporal hypoperfusion. In contrast to mild AD, moderate AD patients showed higher temporal (p < 0.01) parietal and frontal (p < 0.05) hypoperfusion along with worsening of praxis (p < 0.001) and memory tests (p < 0.05).SPECT imaging and neuropsychology evaluation can distinguish controls from AD patients with mild an moderate grades of dementia, showing a strong correlation from the early stages of AD.
