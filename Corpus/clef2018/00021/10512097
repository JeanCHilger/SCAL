Lymphoscintigraphy and gamma probe-guided surgery in papillary thyroid carcinoma: the sentinel lymph node concept in thyroid carcinoma The authors report the use of lymphoscintigraphy and gamma probe-guided resection of the sentinel lymph node in a 65-year-old woman with clinically and cytologically indicated metastasizing papillary thyroid carcinoma. The results of the preoperative lymphoscintigraphy corresponded well with FDG PET and histologic findings, which gives promise of its validity in thyroid carcinoma. With experience in ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy, this method can be performed without any serious side effects for the patient. The validity of the sentinel lymph node concept in thyroid carcinoma and a possible improvement of nodal staging and local recurrence rate must still be proved.
