Dynamic 99Tcm-ECD SPET correlates well with 201Tl indices in brain tumours. The dynamic 99Tcm-ethyl cysteinate dimer (99Tcm-ECD) single photon emission tomographic (SPET) characteristics of brain tumours were investigated and compared with 201Tl-chloride SPET indices. Thirty-five patients with histologically confirmed benign and malignant tumours were evaluated using dynamic and standard 99Tcm-ECD. Twenty-eight patients were also examined using standard 201Tl SPET. The following 201Tl indices were calculated: early uptake ratio, delayed uptake ratio, washout rate and retention index. The relationship between uptake of 99Tcm-ECD on dynamic SPET and 201Tl indices was analysed. Nine patients showed positive uptake on dynamic 99Tcm-ECD SPET, all of whom had benign tumours, including five meningothelial meningiomas, three pituitary adenomas of the chromophobe type and one chemodectoma without malignancy. The mean early uptake ratio of the tumours with positive uptake was significantly higher than that of the tumours with negative uptake (17.1 +/- 5.5 vs 9.0 +/- 5.7, P = 0.004). The mean washout rate of the tumours with positive uptake was significantly higher than that of the tumours with negative uptake (61.0 +/- 27.7 vs 0.35 +/- 30.9, P = 0.0004). The mean retention index of the tumours with positive uptake was significantly lower than that of the tumours with negative uptake (0.27 +/- 0.12 vs 0.88 +/- 0.48, P = 0.000006). Only benign tumours showed positive uptake on dynamic 99Tcm-ECD SPET. The 201Tl indices correlated well with the uptake of 99Tcm-ECD on dynamic SPET. The results suggest that dynamic 99Tcm-ECD SPET can identify the benign character of tumours of the brain.
