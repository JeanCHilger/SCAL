Single photon emission tomography with 99m Tc-HMPAO in Arab patients with depression. This study investigates the rate of cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in Arab patients wth depression.Forty-four patients with DSM-III-R major depressive disorders were studied at rest using single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) with 99m Tc-HMPAO in comparison with 20 normal controls. All patients were assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD).The depressed group showed greater rCBF in left and right posterior frontal and parietal cortical regions than normal controls. Within the depressed group, patients with the least severe illness (HRSD < 20) had significantly lower rCBF than normal controls, whilst those with moderately severe (HRSD 20-29) and severe (HRSD > 30) had significantly greater rCBF in most cortical regions than normal controls. Symptom scores, derived from the HRSD were predicted by rCBF principally increased rCBF in the left frontal cortex.These results suggest a generalized cerebral activation principally in the frontal cortex which is in contrast to the results of most previous studies but more in line with the results of studies of induced affect and some studies of depression subsyndromes.
