Comparison of correction techniques for simultaneous 201Tl/99mTc myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging: a dog study. We compared two correction methods for simultaneous 201Tl/99mTc dual-isotope single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Both approaches use the information from the third energy window placed between the photopeak windows of the 201Tl and 99mTc. The first approach, described by Moore et al, corrects only for the contribution of the 99mTc to the 201Tl primary 70 keV window. We developed the three-window transformation dual isotope correction method, which is a simultaneous cross-talk correction. The two correction methods were compared in a simultaneous 201Tl/99mTc sestamibi cardiac dog study. Three separate acquisitions were performed in this dog study: two single-isotope and one dual-isotope acquisition. The 201Tl single-isotope images were used as references. The total number of counts, and the contrast between the left ventricular cavity (LVC) and the myocardium, were used in 70 keV short axis slices as parameters for evaluating the results of the dual-isotope correction methods. Three consecutive short-axis slices were used to calculate averaged contrast and the averaged total number of counts. The total number of the counts was 667000+/-500 and 414500+/-400 counts for the dual isotope (201Tl+/-99mTc) and single-isotope (201Tl-only) 70 keV images, respectively. The corrected dual-isotope images had 514700+/-700 and 368000+/-600 counts for Moore's correction and our approach, respectively. Moore's method improved contrast in the dual isotope 70 keV image to 0.14+/-0.03 from 0.11+/-0.02, which was the value in the 70 keV non-corrected dual-isotope image. Our method improved the same contrast to 0.22+/-0.03. The contrast in the 201Tl single-isotope 70 keV image was 0.28+/-0.02. Both methods improved the 70 keV dual-isotope images. However, our approach provided slightly better images than Moore's correction when compared with 201Tl-only 70 keV images.
