Myocardial SPET in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of myocardial SPET in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC).One hundred and six consecutive patients (aged 53 +/- 12 years, 50 women, 66 with dynamic obstruction) with an echocardiographic diagnosis of HC were studied with exercise-rest myocardial SPET with 99mTc-tetrofosmin. Forty-six (43%) of these patients had chest pain and in 31 (29%) a coronary angiography was performed. Fifty-six per cent of the patients were treated with beta-blockers and 23% with verapamil.Angina during the exercise test was observed in only 8% of the patients. Perfusion defects were observed in 35% of the patients. Only 8 (26%) out of the 31 patients with angiography had coronary artery disease (stenosis > 50%). When fixed and reversible defects were considered as positive, the sensitivity was 50%, the specificity was 65%, the positive predictive value was 33% and the negative predictive value was 79%.Myocardial perfusion defects can be observed in more than one third of medically treated patients with HC. Only a quarter of catheterized patients, even with chest pain, have associated coronary artery disease. The accuracy of SPET for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is low. Thus, the value of this technique is limited in these patients.
