Ultrasound activates the auditory cortex of profoundly deaf subjects. Using three-dimensional PET, the cortical areas activated by bone-conducted ultrasound were measured from five profoundly deaf subjects and compared with the cortical areas of normal-hearing subjects activated by stimuli through bone-conducted ultrasonic, air-conducted, bone-conducted, and vibro-tactile hearing aids. All of the hearing aids, including the ultrasonic hearing aid, consistently activated the medial portion of the primary auditory cortex of the normal volunteers. The same cortical area was also significantly activated in the profoundly deaf subjects although the percentage increase in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was smaller than in normal subjects. These results suggest that extra-cochlear routes convey information to the primary auditory cortex and can therefore produce detectable sound sensation even in the profoundly deaf subjects, who reported a sensation themselves.
