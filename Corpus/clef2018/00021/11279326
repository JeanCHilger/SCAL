Technetium-99m sestamibi/tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion scanning in cardiac and noncardiac sarcoidosis. Left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) involvement in sarcoidosis must be firmly confirmed to determine patients' prognosis. We examined whether myocardial perfusion images using technetium-99m single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have a diagnostic benefit in the evaluation of biventricular involvement. Sixteen patients with sarcoidosis, aged 21-78 (54 +/- 12) years old, 5 males and 11 females, complicated with cardiac disease (cardiac sarcoidosis, n = 6) including tachyarrhythmias of ventricular origin (n = 5), atrioventricular block (n = 4), and congestive heart failure (NYHA > or = II, n = 1), were enrolled in this study. Myocardial SPECT using technetium-99m sestamibi or tetrofosmin was performed and semiquantitatively scored for comparison with 25 control subjects. Perfusion abnormalities were more frequently recognized in sarcoidosis (LV 5/16, 31% and RV 14/16, 88% vs. LV 0/25, 0% and RV 8/25, 32% in controls). LV involvement had a close correlation with atrioventricular block and with congestive heart failure, and multiple sites of RV involvement correlated with ventricular tachyarrhythmia of RV origin. Total number of defect segments were highest in cardiac sarcoidosis (18/30, 60% vs. 19/60, 32% in noncardiac sarcoidosis, and 11/150, 7% in controls, p = 0.0001), and semiquantitatively evaluated total LV and RV scores (ranging from 0 to 18) were higher than those of controls (15.1 +/- 1.8 vs. 11.4 +/- 3.0 in noncardiac sarcoidosis, and 9.0 +/- 5.0 in cardiac sarcoidosis) and exhibited a significant positive linear correlation with the RV ejection fraction (y = 19.8 + 1.83x, r = 0.786, p = 0.001). Biventricular SPECT using technetium-99m is clinically useful for the noninvasive evaluation of both ventricular involvements in sarcoidosis.
