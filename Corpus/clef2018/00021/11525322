Auditory triggered mental imagery of shape involves visual association areas in early blind humans. Previous neuroimaging studies identified a large network of cortical areas involved in visual imagery in the human brain, which includes occipitotemporal and visual associative areas. Here we test whether the same processes can be elicited by tactile and auditory experiences in subjects who became blind early in life. Using positron emission tomography, regional cerebral blood flow was assessed in six right-handed early blind and six age-matched control volunteers during three conditions: resting state, passive listening to noise sounds, and mental imagery task (imagery of object shape) triggered by the sound of familiar objects. Activation foci were found in occipitotemporal and visual association areas, particularly in the left fusiform gyrus (Brodmann areas 19-37), during mental imagery of shape by both groups. Since shape imagery by early blind subjects does involve similar visual structures as controls at an adult age, it indicates their developmental crossmodal reorganization to allow perceptual representation in the absence of vision.
