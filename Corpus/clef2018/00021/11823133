Chemical impurities in [18F]FDG preparations produced by solid-phase 18F-fluorination. [18F]FDG was produced by solid-phase 18F-fluorination (resin method) and chemical impurities were determined in the [18F]FDG preparations by ion chromatography. The major chemical impurities were D-glucose (90.5 +/- 6.4 microg/mL), 2-chloro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (11.8 +/- 2.7 microg/mL), and D-mannose (1.7 +/- 0.7 microg/mL), which were expected to be present by considering the synthetic routes. An FDG mass (0.5 +/- 0.2 microg/mL) was also detected in the preparations. No notable radiochemical impurities, including 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-mannose, were detected in the [18F]FDG preparations. Thus, the levels of several chemical impurities were determined in the [18F]FDG preparations produced by solid-phase 18F-fluorination.
