Unique aspects of caring for dying children and their families. Pediatric hospice has become an important service for children and their families in the past decade. In this article we present unique aspects of StarShine, the hospice of Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. Length-of-service data demonstrate the need to find innovative ways of encouraging earlier referral to hospice. Several specialized aspects of care, such as long-term bereavement, pet visitation and social services for the family are presented. The initiation of a novel in-home pain management program is described. StarShine has not followed an adult hospice model, and as such, we discuss those unique aspects of dying pediatric patients and suggest specific solutions and interventions designed for children.
