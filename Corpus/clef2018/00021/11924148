Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]-FDG in bronchopulmonary cancer and its impact on medical decision at the time of diagnosis, staging, or recurrence evaluation. Clinical usefulness of [18F]-FDG imaging, performed by means of a dedicated or a "hybrid" PET machine, has been recognised in France since November 1998. Among the clinical indications, three major clinical settings of lung cancer have been included: characterisation, staging and detection of recurrences. After a brief presentation of the PET scintigraphic imaging modality, authors report on the experience of the nuclear medicine team of HÃ´spital Tenon and summarise the results in literature. For tumour characterisation, a recent meta-analysis obtained a 96% sensitivity, a 73% specificity, a 91% positive predictive value and a 90% negative predictive value, the performances being better for lesions greater than 1 cm. For staging, an increase greater than 15% both in sensitivity and specificity has been observed with dedicated or "hybrid" PET versus CT for N staging. Detection of distant metastases was also more accurate using [18F]-FDG. A similar increase was observed in the detection of recurrence, in accordance with our study some authors described even better results. A better anatomical delineation of the lesions detected with FDG can be achieved by means of image fusion with CT
