Predicting cardiac events with Tl201 dipyridamole myocardial scintigraphy in renal transplant recipients. Renal transplant recipients should be screened for coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of thallium-201 dipyridamole myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to predict major cardiac events in these patients.Eighty-two consecutive patients (61 males) in hemodialysis (HD) treatment, awaiting renal transplantation, underwent dipyridamole Tl-201 SPECT for pretransplant risk stratification. SPECT semiquantitative analysis showed a normal perfusion pattern in 52 patients (group A) and fixed defects in 9 (group B). Reversible perfusion defects were found in 21 (group C). Cardiac death, myocadial infarction, and unstable angina were sought as cardiac events. During a follow-up lasting 28.3 +/- 21.6 months, three patients of group A died for a non-cardiac cause. In group C, six patients (28.6%) had a cadiac event: one had a non-q wave myocardial infarction after renal transplantation five were admitted with unstable angina. No cardiac events were observed in groups A and B (p = 0.0001). SPECT semiquantitative analysis showed that a summed difference score > or = 3 significantly increased the risk of cardiac events (odds ratio 4.5, C.I. 2.5-8.1).Cardiac events were only observed in HD patients with Tl-201 SPECT dipyridamole reversible defects (group C). A normal pattern or a fixed defect in Tl-201 dipyridamole SPECT in HD patients identified a good long-term prognosis.
