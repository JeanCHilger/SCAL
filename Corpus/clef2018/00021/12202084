Filtering of distractors during visual search studied by positron emission tomography. We investigated the sensitivity of brain areas to the presence of filtering operations during overt visual search in crowded displays. Task conditions involved either visual search or predetermined simple eye movements for the detection of target digits. Furthermore, visual displays either contained letter foils that required filtering or contained only target digits. Brain imaging using positron emission tomography showed extensive overlap between areas involved in overt visual search and eye movements. Selective filtering of foils affected visual processing in ventral areas associated with object recognition and in primary visual cortex.
