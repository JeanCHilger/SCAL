White matter glucose metabolism during intracortical electrostimulation: a quantitative [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose autoradiography study in the rat. [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) autoradiography was used to analyze the effects of intracortical electrostimulation on local cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (LCMRglu). The hindleg area in rat brains was electrically stimulated with different frequencies (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 stimulus trains per second, two animals per condition). The major result was a strong positive correlation between stimulation frequency and LCMRglu in the callosal fibers originating in the stimulated cortical area. At the highest stimulation frequency callosal LCMRglu was 50.01 micromol/min/100 g compared to 27.87 micromol/min/100 g at baseline. LCMRglu in gray and white matter control areas was stable across conditions. Direct injection of FDG in the stimulated cortex failed to produce increased callosal uptake, excluding the possibility that FDG uptake in the corpus callosum is related to axonal diffusion. Although several previous autoradiographic studies have demonstrated alterations in LCMRglu in white matter, correlations between neural activity and LCMRglu have never been explicitly addressed. Changes in white matter metabolism most likely reflect changes of electrical fiber activity and thus the presented results bear important implications for brain imaging studies.
