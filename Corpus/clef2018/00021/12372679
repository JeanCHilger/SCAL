Positron emission tomography, echo-doppler, and exercise studies of functional capacity in hypertensive heart disease. This study examines the relationship between functional capacity, left ventricular diastolic function, and myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).We studied 16 patients with LVH and 10 controls. Functional capacity was assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise, MPR by positron emission tomography, and left ventricular diastolic function by echo-Doppler.Functional capacity and MPR were significantly lower in the patients. Functional capacity correlated positively with MPR and left ventricular diastolic function.Diminished functional capacity in patients with hypertension-induced LVH is related to the impairment in MPR and left ventricular diastolic function.
