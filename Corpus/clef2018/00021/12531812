Utility of FDG-PET scanning in lymphoma by WHO classification. We retrospectively evaluated (18)fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans in 172 patients with lymphoma and correlated results with pathologic diagnosis using the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system.
