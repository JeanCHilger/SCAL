Clinical effects of air filters in homes of asthmatic adults sensitized and exposed to pet allergens. Despite medical advice, many pet-allergic asthma sufferers refuse to remove the pet to which they are sensitized from their home.We aimed to assess the clinical effects of air cleaners in the homes of adult asthma patients sensitized and exposed to cats and/or dogs.We performed a randomized, parallel-group study of 30 asthmatic adults sensitized to and sharing a home with cats or dogs. The effects of placing air cleaners in the living room and bedroom for 12 months and using high efficiency particulate air filter vacuum cleaners (active group) were compared with using these vacuum cleaners alone (control group). Measures of airway responsiveness, treatment requirement, lung function, peak flow, reservoir and airborne allergen were recorded before, during and after the interventions. A beneficial clinical response was assessed in terms of a 'combined asthma outcome'. This was defined as a two or more doubling dose improvement in bronchial hyper-reactivity to histamine and/or a reduction in treatment requirement of at least one step change on the British Thoracic Society guidelines for asthma treatment.A beneficial clinical response was observed in 10/15 subjects in the active group compared with 3/15 in the control group after 12 months intervention (P = 0.01). No significant differences between the active and control groups were detected for changes in measures of lung function, reservoir pet allergen and airborne pet allergen during the study.Whilst the study design has not allowed complete exclusion of a placebo effect, we believe that this pragmatic study of adult asthmatic patients sensitized and exposed to pets resulted in a small, but significant improvement in combined asthma outcome.
