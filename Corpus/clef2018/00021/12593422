Ischemic "memory image" in acute myocardial infarction of 123I-BMIPP after reperfusion therapy: a comparison with 99mTc-pyrophosphate and 201Tl dual-isotope SPECT. Ischemic "memory image" is a phenomenon of 123I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) in which an area at risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), could be detected as a defect in a couple of weeks even after successful reperfusion therapy. The purpose of this study was to clarify the incidence of the ischemic "memory image" of 123I-BMIPP in patients with AMI by comparing 99mTc-PYP and 201Tl dual-isotope SPECT. Materials consisted of 14 patients with successfully reperfused AMI and 20 patients with old myocardial infarction (OMI). All AMI patients underwent PYP/Tl dual-isotope SPECT within 1 week after the onset of AMI, and BMIPP SPECT was performed within 1 week after the PYP/Tl dual-isotope SPECT. The extent and severity of the defect of BMIPP and Tl were visually scored into four grades: 0 = no defect to 3 = large or severe defect. These scores were compared. PYP positive AMI lesions were concordant with BMIPP defects (13/14). In AMI, both the extent and severity scores of BMIPP were higher than 201Tl (p < 0.001). Differences (BMIPP - Tl) of extent and severity scores were greater in AMI than in OMI (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the ischemic "memory image" obtained by means of the BMIPP is a common phenomenon (13/14) in AMI, and helpful in evaluating the area at risk.
