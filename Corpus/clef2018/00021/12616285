NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Ethylene Glycol (CAS No. 107-21-1) in B6C3F1 Mice (Feed Studies). Ethylene glycol is a major constituent of motor vehicle antifreeze-coolant fluids and is also found in other commercial products including hydraulic brake fluids, adhesives, printer's inks, and wood stains. It is used in the manufacture of polyester films and fibers, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) solid state resins, plasticizers, elastomers, cellophane, and other products. Previous 13-week and 2-year studies of ethylene glycol in F344 rats were considered adequate to evaluate the toxicology and carcinogenicity of ethylene glycol in this species and strain therefore, the present studies were conducted in mice only. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering ethylene glycol (greater than 99% pure) in feed to male and female B6C3F1 mice for 13 weeks and 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells, and Chinese hamster ovary cells. 13-Week Studies: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice received feed containing 0, 3,200, 6,300, 12,500, 25,000 or 50,000 ppm ethylene glycol. All mice survived to the end of the studies. Final mean body weights of dosed male and female mice and feed consumption of dosed males were similar to those of the controls. Feed consumption of dosed females was significantly greater than that of controls. Absolute and relative organ weights of mice administered ethylene glycol were generally similar to those of controls throughout the study. No chemical-related clinical findings were observed. Chemical-related kidney and liver lesions, seen only in 25,000 and 50,000 ppm male mice, consisted of nephropathy and centrilobular hepatocellular hyaline degeneration (cytoplasmic accumulation of non-birefringent, eosinophilic, globular, or crystalline material resembling erythrocyte fragments). 2-Year Studies: Groups of 60 mice received diets containing ethylene glycol for up to 103 weeks (males: 0, 6,250, 12,500, or 25,000 ppm
