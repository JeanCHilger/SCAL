Study of the clinical factors associated with glomerular filtration rate. To investigate the relationship between glomerular filtration rate(GFR) and possible involved clinical factors and to offer an basis for building measurement GFR by the calculation method.GFR from 46 cases of normal renal function group and 52 cases of renal insufficient group were determined by using clearance of 99mTc-DTPA, serum creatinine(SCr), urea nitrogen, uric, potassium, sodium, calcium and hemoglobin were determined. Simultaneously, heart rate, urine specific gravity, 24 hours urine protein quantum, average artery pressure, weight index and body surface area were determined. Age, isotope dose for determining GFR were recorded. The simple correlation analysis between GFR in every group and the difference primitive diseases and clinical factors mentioned above were performed and the multiple correlation analysis between every clinical factors mentioned above that had significantly correlation between GFR and GFR were performed as well.GFR in normal renal function group, insufficient group and the difference primitive diseases had significantly negative correlation with SCr, while the correlations between GFR and other clinical factors were different.SCr is the ideal index for GFR for renal insufficient patients due to different primitive diseases and patients with normal renal function.
