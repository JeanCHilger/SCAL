Evaluation of positron emission tomography in diagnosing and staging of lung cancer. To evaluate positron emission tomography (PET) in diagnosing and staging of lung cancer.One hundred and forty-seven patients (93 with lung cancer, 15 with lung metastatic tumors, 39 with benign lesions) were involved in the study. 163 whole body examinations (twice in 12 cases and 3 times in 2 cases) were performed after injection of 18F-fluro-deoxy-glucose (18FDG) with a Siemens ECAT EXACT HR + PET system. The results of PET were compared with pathological diagnoses (112 cases), clinical follow-up (35 cases), CT (68 malignant and 30 benign cases), and other imaging diagnoses.For the 147 cases with lung lesions, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FDG PET in differentiating the malignant from the benign were 97.2%, 89.7%, and 94.6% respectively. For the 93 lung cancer cases, more lesions were detected by PET in 58 (62.4%) cases, and changed staging in 36 (38.7%). In the 98 cases examinations, PET positive findings were consistent with CT in 39 (39.8%) cases PET detected more lesions than CT in 29 (29.6%) casesFDG PET had advantages in diagnosing and staging of lung cancer by providing metabolic information of the lesions. Comparison and fusion of PET with CT will give much help to clinical diagnosis.
