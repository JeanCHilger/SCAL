Early gallbladder visualization during Tc-99m RBC scintigraphy. Gallbladder visualization has been described during delayed Tc-99m RBC blood pool imaging in patients with some combination of anemia, renal disease, and multiple recent blood transfusions. The authors present two cases of gallbladder activity that appeared 1 hour after the injection of Tc-99m RBCs in patients without renal or hematologic abnormalities.
