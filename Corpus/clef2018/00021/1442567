Myocardial thallium-201 scintigraphy for assessment of viability in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Many patients with ischemic heart disease and depressed left ventricular (LV) function have asynergic zones with sustained microcirculatory perfusion and myocardial metabolic activity that exhibit improved systolic function after coronary revascularization. The 2 predominant noninvasive techniques used to determine myocardial viability in patients with severely depressed LV function are thallium-201 (201Tl) scintigraphy and positron emission tomography (PET). Myocardial extraction of 201Tl is unaltered under experimental conditions of myocardial stunning or short-term hibernation (characterized by decreased flow and ischemic dysfunction). Akinetic or dyskinetic LV wall segments can exhibit normal or near normal 201Tl uptake as long as some residual flow is present. 201Tl scintigraphy can identify viable asynergic segments when performed on patients with severe coronary artery disease who are in the resting state. Many of these patients have initial resting defects that demonstrate delayed redistribution, or mild persistent defects that show improved perfusion and function after revascularization. There is a direct correlation between the extent of 201Tl uptake in zones of severe regional myocardial asynergy and the magnitude of improvement in resting LV ejection fraction after coronary bypass surgery. Rest 201Tl scintigraphy may help in the selection of patients with coronary artery disease and severely depressed LV function who would benefit the most from revascularization.
