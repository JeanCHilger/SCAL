Fibroblast attachment to smooth and microtextured PET and thin cp-Ti films. Improving the biological performance of engineered implants apposing interfacing tissues is a critical issue in Biomaterials Science and Engineering. Micromotion at the soft tissue-implant interface has been shown to sustain an inflammatory response. To eliminate micromotion, it is desirable to promote cellular and extracellular matrix adhesion to the implant surface. Surfaces are modified topographically or chemically to effect cellular adhesion and to influence cellular interactions and function. Previous studies have identified the specific topographical characteristics that appear to elicit cellular attachment. This in vitro study compares the independent effects of surface chemistry and topography on fibroblast-test specimen proximity. Titanium (Ti) was sputter-coated in stepwise, increasing thickness (20-350 nm) onto a series of either smooth or microtextured polyethylene terephthalate (PET), resulting in a stepwise change from a PET surface to a Ti surface. The series was evaluated in a 3-day fibroblast culture with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for cell-test specimen proximity. Fibroblast proximity to the coverslip surface increases, as the Ti thickness increases, on either smooth or textured test specimens. Furthermore, fibroblasts were firmly attached to the ridge tops on the coated textured test specimens. Therefore, fibroblast apposition is strongly enhanced by microtextured surfaces and Ti rather than smooth surfaces and PET.
