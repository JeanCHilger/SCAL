Temporal and extended temporal resections for the treatment of intractable seizures in early childhood. In our series of 33 children who underwent temporal and extended temporal lobe resections because of seizures, the average age at surgery was 7 years, 11 months. Sixteen cases (48%) were diagnosed as having tumors: low-grade astrocytoma (6), hamartoma (5), and ganglioglioma/neuroma (5). Other pathologic diagnoses included one or more cytoarchitectural abnormalities and/or reactive changes. Due to a more aggressive and early radiologic and electrophysiologic investigation of children with seizures, a resectable focus, e.g. neoplasm or structural abnormality, was found in a much younger age group of patients than previously reported. In children who had intractable seizures but normal radiologic studies, positron emission tomography was of great value in localizing the seizure focus. In a group of children with infantile spasms, seizures were controlled following the identification and resection of a focal lesion. Prompt detection and precise localization of lesions in the temporal lobe in the pediatric population may lead to surgical management and seizure control.
