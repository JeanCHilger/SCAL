The neurotransmitters and alcohol dependence. Exist many interactions of the endogenous system with dopaminergic, serotinergic, GABA--ergig, and glutamat--ergic, as well as the role of these interactions in mediating stress response, analgesia and in appearance the alcoholism. Thus pharmacological blockade of the endogenous opioid system by mu or delta opioid receptor antagonists prevents ethanol's activation of the dopamine system and reduces ethanol consumption. The role of genetic factors in alcohol dependency is recognized. The applicability of PET, SPECT, MRS, functional neuroimaging in the study have a very importance, for demonstrates the changes in regional cerebral blood flow at the alcoholics.
