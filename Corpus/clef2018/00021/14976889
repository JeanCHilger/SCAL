Study on glucose metabolic rate in non-small cell lung cancer patients with blood stasis syndrome and non-blood stasis syndrome. To study the difference of glucose metabolic rate in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with blood stasis syndrome and with non-blood stasis syndrome.Whole body positron emission tomography (PET) and functional agent 2-[fluorine-18] fluorine-2-deoxy-glucose (18FDG) were used to detect the 18FDG uptake value in regions of interest (ROI) in tumor tissue of patients.In patients with same pathologic type, the maximum and mean standardized uptake value (Max SUV and Mean SUV) were significantly higher in the blood stasis group than those in the non-blood stasis group (P < 0.01) it also showed the same in patients with NSCLC of phase I, II and III (P < 0.05), but the 18FDG uptake rate was obviously enhanced in patients of phase IV (P < 0.01).The glucose uptake in NSCLC patients of blood stasis syndrome was higher than that in those with of non-blood stasis syndrome.
