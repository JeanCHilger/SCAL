Effect of calcitonin gene related peptide vs sodium nitroprusside to increase temperature in spontaneous canine tumours during local hyperthermia. The objectives of this study were to compare the effects of two vasodilators, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and temperatures in tumour and surrounding normal tissue during local hyperthermia treatment. Eleven tumour-bearing pet dogs with spontaneous soft tissue sarcomas were given SNP intravenously during local hyperthermia. The drug infusion rate was adjusted to maintain a 20% decrease in MAP. The median (95% CI) increase in the temperature distribution descriptors T(90) and T(50) was 0.2 degrees C (0.0-0.4 degrees C, p = 0.02) and 0.4 degrees C (0.1-0.7 degrees C, p = 0.02), respectively, in tumour. Normal subcutaneous tissue temperatures were mildly increased but remained below the threshold for thermal injury. The effects of CGRP were investigated in six tumour-bearing dogs following a protocol similar to that used for SNP. The median (interquartile (IQ) range) decrease in mean arterial pressure was 19% (15-26%) after CGRP administration and a significant increase was seen in tumour but not normal subcutaneous tissue temperatures. The median (95% CI) increase in the temperature distribution descriptors T(90) and T(50) was 0.5 degrees C (0.1-1.6 degrees C, p = 0.03) and 0.8 degrees C (0.1-1.6 degrees C, p = 0.13), respectively. Administration of SNP or CGRP did not result in local or systemic toxicity in tumour-bearing dogs. However, the magnitude of increase in tumour temperatures was not sufficient to improve the likelihood of increased response rates. Therefore, there is little justification for translation of this approach to human trials using conventional local hyperthermia.
