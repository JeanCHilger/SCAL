Correlation of FDG-PET interpretation with survival in a cohort of glioma patients. Adult supratentorial gliomas continue to be one of the most challenging diagnostic and therapeutic problems for the neuro-oncologist. Despite a variety of therapeutic approaches, local control and survival rates remain disappointingly low, largely due to a relative inability to localize diffusely infiltrating glial tumor cells. FDG PET provides a relatively noninvasive method for studying glucose metabolism in normal and pathologic brain tissues. In order to assess the usefulness of FDG PET in a prospective cohort of patients, a group of 31 glial tumor patients underwent serial FDG PET scans at specified evaluation time points: initial or perioperative scan scan following completion of radiation or chemotherapy
