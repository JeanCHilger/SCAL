Use of 18F-FDG positron emission tomography following allogeneic transplantation to guide adoptive immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusions. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) provides valuable prognostic information in the management of lymphoma patients. However, the utility of (18)F-FDG PET following allografting is unclear. We analysed the use of (18)F-FDG PET after allogeneic reduced-intensity transplantation (RIT) performed in our institution. Between June 1998 and January 2002, 55 patients underwent RIT for either Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. At least one (18)F-FDG PET scan was performed during the post-transplant period (median five studies) in 15 (27.2%) of these 55 patients. PET scans were performed after re-staging computed tomography (CT) and were categorised depending on (18)F-FDG uptake. The first PET scan was informative in 11 of 15 patients (73%) and influenced the administration of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) in nine: leading to earlier DLI administration in two patients, earlier dose escalation in one, withholding of DLI administration in five and dose reduction in one. In addition, subsequent monitoring with (18)F-FDG PET scans documented a graft-versus-lymphoma effect in five patients (median post-DLI follow-up 33 months, range 13-36 months). These preliminary data suggest that (18)F-FDG PET has a role in guiding DLI administration and monitoring the immunotherapeutic effect in patients after allogeneic transplantation. This retrospective pilot study forms the basis for a prospective study to clarify the utility of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in these patients.
