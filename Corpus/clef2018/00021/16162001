F-18 stilbenes as PET imaging agents for detecting beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. Imaging agents targeting beta-amyloid (Abeta) may be useful for diagnosis and treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compounds 3e and 4e are fluorinated stilbene derivatives displaying high binding affinities for Abeta plaques in AD brain homogenates (Ki = 15 +/- 6 and 5.0 +/- 1.2 nM, respectively). In vivo biodistributions of [18F]3e and [18F]4e in normal mice exhibited excellent brain penetrations (5.55 and 9.75% dose/g at 2 min), and rapid brain washouts were observed, especially for [18F]4e (0.72% dose/g at 60 min). They also showed in vivo plaque labeling in APP/PS1 or Tg2576 transgenic mice, animal models for AD. Autoradiography of postmortem AD brain sections and AD homogenate binding studies confirmed the selective and specific binding properties to Abeta plaques. In conclusion, the preliminary results strongly suggest that these fluorinated stilbene derivatives, [18F]3e and [18F]4e, are suitable candidates as Abeta plaque imaging agents for studying patients with AD.
