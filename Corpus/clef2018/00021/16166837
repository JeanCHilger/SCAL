Bone scintigraphy in common tumors with osteolytic components. Osteolytic lesions are frequently encountered in clinical practice. Radionuclide bone scans with technetium-99m-labeled diphosphonates are often performed in the evaluation of both solitary and multiple osteolytic lesions. In this pictorial review, we critically evaluate the current role of bone scan in common osteolytic tumors including aneurysmal bone cyst, simple bone cyst, fibrous dysplasia, nonossifying fibroma, giant cell tumor, eosinophilic granuloma, enchondroma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, myeloma, and metastases. The merits and limitations of bone scanning are emphasized.
