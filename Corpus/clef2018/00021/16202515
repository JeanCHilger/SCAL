A novel two-stage MBR denitrification process for the treatment of high strength pet food wastewater. A novel paradigm using pre-denitrification process is presented to optimize an existing system of two-stage MBRs treating high strength pet food wastewater. Successive reduction of organics in the 1st stage and almost complete nitrification in the 2nd stage generated effluent meeting stringent surface discharge criteria i.e. BOD5, TSS and NH4+ -N of < 10 mg/L at an overall HRT of 6.3 days. Pre-anoxic zone was created by a submerged coil in the path of influent to the 1st stage. Final effluent and the 1st stage mixed liquor were recirculated to the coil. With prevailing high denitrification rates, more than 94% of the recirculated nitrates were denitrified in less than 15 min of effective anoxic residence time. At a recycle ratio of 3:1, total nitrogen was reduced by 84%, aeration energy by 25% and the external alkalinity requirement by 65%, enhancing economical viability of the system.
