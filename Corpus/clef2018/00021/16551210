SPECT Imaging for Radioaerosol Deposition and Clearance Studies. Planar gamma camera scintigraphy is well established for measuring the deposition and clearance of radioaerosols. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides threedimensional (3D) reconstructions of the radioactivity distribution, thus avoiding the compression of 3D data into two-dimensional (2D) images and potentially offering superior assessment of aerosol deposition patterns. However, SPECT has traditionally been associated with long imaging times, making it unsuitable for measuring deposition and clearance of radioaerosols with fast clearance. Multi-detector SPECT systems can collect complete SPECT studies in <1 min, allowing both initial deposition and clearance over time to be assessed by dynamic SPECT. Simultaneous transmission measurement with an external source provides attenuation correction for absolute activity quantification as well as aiding in the definition of the lung volume of interest. A dynamic SPECT imaging protocol has been developed to allow fast imaging from the oropharynx to the abdomen using gamma cameras with limited axial field of views. This allows activity quantification not only in the lungs, but also in areas outside the thorax. However, fast dynamic SPECT imaging is technically and computationally more demanding and provides less scope for reducing the radioactivity administered to the subjects. It has been shown that dynamic SPECT, compared to planar imaging, is more sensitive in detecting changes in deposition as measured by the Penetration Index (PI). Thus, SPECT can better differentiate between large and small airways, which is important for lung regional analysis.
