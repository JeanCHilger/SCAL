Dichotic listening and spect in dyslexic children. Dichotic listening (DL) was evaluated in 36 children with: verbal dichotic listening test, alternating disyllable dichotic test and non-verbal dichotic listening test. Children were separated into two groups: experimental group with 18 dyslexic children and control group with 18 normal children. Both groups were comparable in gender, laterality and social-economic level. All dyslexic children underwent neuroimaging exam (SPECT). Our data showed that there was a statistical difference between both groups in all DL tests. Abnormal SPECT findings were seen in 50% of the dyslexic children, hypoperfusion of the left temporal lobe being the most frequent abnormality. We conclude that dyslexic children present an impairment of central neurologic processing that may be detected by DL tests, and by functional imaging exam, such as SPECT, as well.
