99mTc-labelled red blood cell single-photon emission computed tomography for the diagnosis and follow-up of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. To confirm the usefulness of blood pool scintigraphy with Tc-labelled red blood cells ((99m)Tc-RBCs) in the diagnosis and follow-up of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma.A prospective study design was used. (99m)Tc-RBCs were prepared by a modified in-vivo method. After the rapid intravenous injection of 370-740 MBq of (99m)Tc-RBCs, dynamic imaging of 1-min duration was performed. After dynamic imaging, static acquisitions at 5 min (second phase: blood pool phase) and 2 h (third phase: static image) were obtained. In addition, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging was performed at 2 h. SPECT images were obtained using a rotating gamma camera (GE-Starcam 4000 XR/T).All patients showed no activity in the first phase and mild activity in the second phase (blood pool phase). All patients with juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma showed a prominent increased activity in the third phase and in SPECT images.This study shows that blood pool scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-RBC SPECT is very accurate, easy to perform and a suitable alternative to pre-operative and post-operative imaging techniques, including computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI angiography, for the detection of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma.
