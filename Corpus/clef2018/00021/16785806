Use of 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]-fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography to monitor therapeutic response by rhabdomyosarcoma in children: report of a retrospective case study. The purpose of this study was to study the use of 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]-fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (F-18 FDG PET) for monitoring therapeutic response by rhabdomyosarcoma (RMSA) in children.A retrospective case study was performed by searching a computer database for the patients with RMSA in whom F-18 FDG PET studies were performed pre- and posttreatment. The data of the PET studies from these patients were analyzed in conjunction with clinical treatment and other imaging studies to determine whether interval changes of F-18 FDG uptake by the RMSA reflect response of RMSA to treatment.Four patients with RMSA who received both pretreatment and posttreatment F-18 FDG PET studies were identified from the database and included in this study. A dramatic decrease of F-18 FDG uptake by the tumor was evident in the patients who had a favorable response to the therapy and prolonged remission of the disease. In contrast, persistent abnormal FDG uptake in one patient was associated with early relapse of the RMSA.F-18 FDG PET may be useful for monitoring therapeutic response by RMSA in children, which needs to be verified with a prospective study in a larger patient population.
