Naturally-occurring chronic renal disease in Australian cats: a prospective study of 184 cases. To describe cases of naturally occurring feline chronic renal disease (CRD) in a defined population of Sydney.Prospective case series.The inclusion criteria were the presence of a serum creatinine concentration above the reference range with either inadequately concentrated urine (urine specific gravity < or = 1.035), necropsy findings consistent with CRD, renal proteinuria or persistent azotaemia despite rehydration. Cats were excluded if a specific aetiology was identified ante or post mortem. Patients were divided into two categories (renal insufficiency or renal failure) on the basis of history, physical findings and serum creatinine concentration. The gender and age of cats with CRD was compared to an estimated Australian urban pet cat population. The breeds of cats with CRD were compared to the breeds of cats visiting the respective veterinary hospital where possible. Breed and gender comparisons were made using Fisher's exact tests. Age comparisons were made using Mann-Whitney U tests. The age at which cats were diagnosed with CRD was compared between veterinary hospitals using a Kruskal-Wallis test.One hundred and eighty-four (99 female 85 male) cats fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Amongst cats with CRD, males (median 12 years) were significantly younger than females (median 15 yearsMale cats with CRD were significantly younger than female cats with CRD. Younger cats were more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease than older cats. The age at which cats were diagnosed with CRD was influenced by the clinic the cats attended. Whether these differences reflect differences in the aetiology of CRD or in the rate of disease progression warrants further investigation. Breed did not appear to play a significant role in the development of CRD in this survey.
