Response of cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity to acetazolamide in patients with dementia and idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus. The responses of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to administration of acetazolamide were investigated in 16 patients with dementia and ventriculomegaly to clarify the cerebral hemodynamics in patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The mean CBF velocity in the whole brain was measured by the Patlak plot method by using technetium-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission computerized tomography. The CVR values were obtained from the response to administration of 500 mg of acetazolamide and calculated as the percentage of change from the baseline mean CBF value. The mean CBF value was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in six patients with (35.2 +/- 5 ml/100 g/minute) and 10 patients without (33.5 +/- 2.8 ml/100 g/minute) NPH compared with the age-matched normal controls (40.8 +/- 3.2 ml/100 g/minute), showing no significant difference. The CVR was significantly impaired in patients with NPH (0.8 +/- 1.7% p < 0.001), whereas in patients without NPH preserved CVR (11.3 +/- 3%) was demonstrated compared with the normal controls (14.7 +/- 1.1%). In patients with NPH a significantly lower CVR (p < 0.001) was shown than in those without NPH. The CVR significantly increased (p < 0.001) after placement of a shunt in patients with NPH. Reductions in both CBF and CVR may be diagnostic indicators of NPH in patients with dementia in whom ventriculomegaly is present. In patients with dementia and idiopathic NPH both reduced CBF and extremely impaired CVR are shown. The results of the present study suggest that ischemia due to the process of NPH is responsible for the reduction of CBF and manifestation of symptoms in patients with idiopathic NPH.
