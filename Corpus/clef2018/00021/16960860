Correlation between cardiac 123I-MIBG and odor identification in patients with Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. We investigated an association between olfaction and cardiac (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). There was a significant positive correlation between cardiac MIBG uptake and the Cross-Cultural Smell Identification (CCSI) score in patients with PD (r = 0.56 P = 0.003) independent of the disease duration or clinical rating of motor status. However, patients with MSA did not show a significant correlation between cardiac MIBG uptake and the CCSI score. Our findings suggest that the functional losses of the olfactory and cardiac sympathetic systems are closely coupled in PD.
