18F-FDG PET/CT fusion imaging in paediatric solid extracranial tumours. This paper aims at discussing the utility of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the evaluation of paediatric solid extracranial tumours. Following a brief discussion of the basic principles and methodology of PET/CT system, it reviews the main characteristics of the tumours that can be visualised with 18F-FDG PET and presents examples of cases where the combined use of 18F-FDG PET/CT fusion imaging helped in the management of patients. It will also discuss the physiologic biodistribution of 18F-FDG, outlining the normal variants in the paediatric patients that may lead to misinterpretation.
