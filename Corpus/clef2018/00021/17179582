Estimate the insulin absorption in diabetic patients on peritoneal dialysis. Good control of blood glucose obtains both with subcutaneus and with intraperitoneal insulin administration. Intraperitoneally administered insulin is absorbed more rapidly and evenly than subcutaneously administered insulin. It passes directly into the portal vein system. But insulin requirement in peritoneal insulin administration is higher then in subcutaneous. Factors affecting this insulin absorption are unclear, and our aim was to find the relationship of insulin absorption with the parameters, which theoretically might be play role in insulin absorption process. 10 diabetic patients on peritoneal dialysis were studied. Transport status was determined by a standard 4-hour peritoneal equilibration test (PET). Dialysate insulin was analyzed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As it was expected, intraperitoneal insulin absorption is related with membrane transport status, glicemia, infusion volume of dialysate and insulin dose. According to our results obese and dislipidemia are not important factors in insulin absorption process.
