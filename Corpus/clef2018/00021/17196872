Clinical-pathologic study of biomarkers in FTDP-17 (PPND family with N279K tau mutation). The objective of this clinical-pathologic study was to identify biomarkers for a pallidopontonigral degeneration (PPND) kindred of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) harboring the N279K tau mutation. Five affected subjects, one at-risk who later became symptomatic, and one at-risk asymptomatic mutation carrier, had abnormal (18)fluorodeoxyglucose PET demonstrating asymmetric temporal lobe hypometabolism. All except the asymptomatic mutation carrier had abnormal brain MRI. Parkinsonism, myoclonus, anosmia, insomnia, speech, and autonomic dysfunction were identified. Autopsy of six affected subjects showed frontotemporal degeneration with extensive tauopathy. Further studies of FTDP-17 patients are needed to replicate these findings.
