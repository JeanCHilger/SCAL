Recycling of waste PET into useful textile auxiliaries. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste fibers were initially depolymerized using a glycolysis route in the presence of sodium sulfate as a catalyst, which is a commonly used chemical and ecofriendly as compared to heavy metal catalysts. Good yield of the pure monomer bis(2-hydroxyethylene terephthalate) (BHET) was obtained. Further, to attempt its reuse, the purified BHET was converted to different fatty amide derivatives to obtain quaternary ammonium compounds that have a potential for use as softener in the textile finishing process. The products were characterized by infrared spectroscopy. Application of these synthesized compounds was carried out on cotton fabric they were evaluated for performance and were found to give good results. The chemicals used during depolymerization and reuse of PET are inexpensive and comparatively less harmful to the environment, and thus offer advantages in the chemical recycling of polyester waste fibers.
