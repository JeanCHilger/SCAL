Ictal SPECT in supplementary motor area seizures. We used ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to clarify the propagation pathways of epileptic discharges in patients with supplementary motor area (SMA) seizure.In four patients (four males, age range, 18-27 years) with SMA seizures, SPECT studies by radioisotope 99mTc-ECD were performed as a preoperative evaluation. Two of the patients remained seizure-free after complete resection of the focal cortical dysplasia on magnetic resonance (MR) images including epileptic foci. In the other two patients, MR images were normal, but subdural electrode monitoring allowed for verifying the ictal onset in the left SMA. After partial resection of the SMA including epileptic foci, these patients experienced a significant (>90%) reduction of seizure frequency. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements obtained under ictal and interictal conditions were compared on a voxel-by-voxel basis by means of the SPM99 paired t-test option (uncorrected p<0.001).Significant increases in rCBF under ictal conditions were identified in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the globus pallidus ipsilateral to epileptic foci and the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. The right ACC included a cluster with a submaximum in the right primary sensorimotor area.In patients with SMA seizures, the hyperperfusion areas of ictal SPECT did not localize within the SMA but spread to the adjacent cortex such as the ACC and sensorimotor cortex ipsilateral to epileptic foci. Additionally, the epileptic discharges propagated to the remote areas such as the globus pallidus and cerebellum. We caution that ictal SPECT localization in patients with SMA seizures is not always concordant to epileptic focus but reveals already spread seizure activities.
