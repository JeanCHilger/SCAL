Regional cerebral (18)FDG uptake during subarachnoid hemorrhage induced vasospasm. The aim was to elucidate whether aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced vasospasm induces changes of regional glucose uptake in surgically treated, asymptomatic cases.(18)FDG uptake (standardized uptake value, SUV) was analysed with PET in eight surgically treated aneurismal patients with a mean middle cerebral artery flow velocity >120 cm/seconds measured with transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Data were compared with a healthy control group using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM99b).Six of the eight patients had no focal neurological signs. The inhomogeneous bilateral increase in SUV (p<0.0001) was asymmetrical, with an almost 70% larger volume on the operated side. Reduced glucose uptake was found in the frontal and temporobasal regions of the two patients with neurological deficits (p<0.0001) the affected volume was 40% larger on the operated side.SAH-induced vasospasm results in widespread increase of glucose uptake-probably reflecting increased glycolysis. This was earlier than neurological focal signs appear. Decreased glucose uptake can be detected in severe cases of vasospasm reflected by neurological deficit. Although the changes are more prominent where surgery had taken place our results suggest that not only the surgery, but also subarachnoid blood might have resulted in our findings.
