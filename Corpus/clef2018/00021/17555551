A comparison of the high-affinity peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands DAA1106 and (R)-PK11195 in rat models of neuroinflammation: implications for PET imaging of microglial activation. Activated microglia are an important feature of many neurological diseases and can be imaged in vivo using 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK11195), a ligand that binds the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl) acetamide (DAA1106) is a new PBR-specific ligand that has been reported to bind to PBR with higher affinity compared with PK11195. We hypothesized that this high-affinity binding of DAA1106 to PBR will enable better delineation of microglia in vivo using positron emission tomography. [(3)H]DAA1106 showed higher binding affinity compared with [(3)H](R)-PK11195 in brain tissue derived from normal rats and the rats injected intrastriatally with 6-hydroxydopamine or lipopolysaccharide at the site of the lesion. Immunohistochemistry combined with autoradiography in brain tissues as well as correlation analyses showed that increased [(3)H]DAA1106 binding corresponded mainly to activated microglia. Finally, ex vivo autoradiography and positron emission tomography imaging in vivo showed greater retention of [(11)C]DAA1106 compared with [(11)C](R)-PK11195 in animals injected with either lipopolysaccaride or 6-hydroxydopamine at the site of lesion. These results indicate that DAA1106 binds with higher affinity to microglia in rat models of neuroinflammation when compared with PK11195, suggesting that [(11)C]DAA1106 may represent a significant improvement over [(11)C](R)-PK11195 for in vivo imaging of activated microglia in human neuroinflammatory disorders.
