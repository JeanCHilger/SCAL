Migration of tumor antigen-pulsed dendritic cells after mucosal administration in the human upper respiratory tract. Tumor-specific peptide-pulsed dendritic cells (DC) were administered via different routes to a group of patients with head and neck cancers. The migration and homing patterns of such antigen-stimulated cells was carefully studied employing single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The DC administered directly into the nasal submucosa quickly migrated very rapidly to the regional neck lymph nodes in the neck. However, after inoculation of the cells into the palatine tonsils, the DCs remained close to the site of administration and did not migrate to the regional lymph nodes or to other mucosal regions. After nasal submucosal administration of the DC, tumor-antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells were detected in the ipsilaterals but not in the contra lateral lymph nodes. These results suggest that after antigen processing, the regional lymph nodes serve as inductive sites for development of mucosal immune responses and for induction of memory cells during the local immunological responses in the nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue in man.
