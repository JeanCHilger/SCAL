Giving up pets--organic milk--eliminating mold. What preventive measures are reliable?. Data gained from studies show that allergies are aggravated by passive smoking and a room climate that fosters the growth of mold. On the other hand, a certain degree of protection is provided by breastfeeding, hypoallergenic infant formulas, the banning of cats or pet rodents from a household with risk children, and the appropriate stimulation of the young child's immune system. Vaccinations recommended by the STIKO (National Board for Immunization) should also be given to children at risk of developing an allergy, since they are more likely to have a preventive rather than an allergy-promoting effect.
