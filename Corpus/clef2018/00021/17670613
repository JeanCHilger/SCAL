The false assumption of lung cancer based upon a positive positron emission tomographic scan. To show that positron emission tomography (PET) can have false positive results from inflammatory lesions.We present a complicated, elderly patient who underwent an extensive work-up that failed to provide a diagnosis for a radiographic abnormality.A PET scan was positive and the patient was believed to have lung carcinoma until eventual surgical excision was performed. Final pathology revealed that the patient had exogenous lipoid pneumonia.PET scans that are positive cannot be assumed to show a malignancy. Inflammatory lesions will also be positive with PET scanning.
