18F-dihydroxyphenylalanine PET in patients with biochemical evidence of medullary thyroid cancer: relation to tumor differentiation. Curative treatment for recurrent medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), diagnosed by rising serum calcitonin, is surgery, but tumor localization is difficult. Therefore, the value of 18F-dihydroxyphenylalanine PET (18F-DOPA PET), 18F-FDG PET, (99m)Tc-V-di-mercaptosulfuricacid (DMSA-V) scintigraphy, and MRI or CT was studied.Twenty-one patients with biochemical recurrent or residual MTC underwent 18F-DOPA PET, 18F-FDG PET, DMSA-V scintigraphy, and MRI or CT. Patient- and lesion-based sensitivities were calculated using a composite reference consisting of all imaging modalities.In 76% of all patients with MTC, one or more imaging modalities was positive for MTC lesions. In 6 of 8 patients with a calcitonin level of <500 ng/L, imaging results were negative. In 15 patients with positive imaging results, 18F-DOPA PET detected 13 (sensitivity, 62% with 4.6 lesions per patient [lpp]). Morphologic imaging (n = 19) was positive in 7 (sensitivity, 37%MTC lesions are best detectable when serum calcitonin was >500 ng/L. 18F-DOPA PET is superior to 18F-FDG PET, DMSA-V, and morphologic imaging. With short calcitonin doubling times (< or =12 mo), 18F-FDG PET may be superior.
