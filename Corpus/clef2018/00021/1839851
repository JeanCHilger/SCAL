User-friendly image processing software tools: general purpose features and application to the correlation of PET-CT brain images. An interactive software package, performing some useful general purpose image processing operations and being used as a tool for the problem of the anatomical correlation of PET brain images, is under development. The software is developed as a comprehensive tool with a graphic user-interface allowing the display of the processed images through the use of a variety of colormaps. The implemented routines perform a lot of processing operations on the images: a) Local image processing, i.e. smoothing and sharpening, contours extraction, interactive expansion, shrinking and thresholding of the gray scale, histogram equalization. b) ROI handling, i.e., ROI drawing and computing, transformation of an image to a ROI, ROI editing. c) Additional operators include frequency space image processing such as FFT.
