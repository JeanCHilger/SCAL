Helicobacter pylori in allergic inflammation--fact or fiction? Although it has been hypothesized that infections may play a preventive role in allergic diseases, the role of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is not clear. In this study we aimed to determine the association between H. pylori infection and allergic inflammation.H. pylori infection was assessed in gastric mucosa tissue by microscopy. Skin prick tests (SPT) were performed with a battery of common inhalant and certain food allergens. Serum samples were tested for total immunoglobulin E (T.IgE). Predictive factors for H. pylori infection and atopy were examined by a questionnaire.A total of 90 subjects suffering dyspeptic symptoms were enrolled into the study. SPT positivity was similar between H. pylori (+) and H. pylori (-) subjects. Among the possible factors examined: age genderIn this sample group from a developing country H. pylori infection was not shown to be associated with atopic diseases. Therefore, the eradication of H. pylori may not be assumed to have an effect on allergic inflammation.
