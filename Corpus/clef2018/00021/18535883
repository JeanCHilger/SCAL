Diagnostic accuracy of supine and prone thallium-201 stress myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography to detect coronary artery disease in inferior wall of left ventricle. Prone thallium-201 ((201)Tl) myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) reduces false-positive rates when evaluating inferior wall abnormalities by minimizing diaphragmatic attenuation. The present study investigates the diagnostic validity of prone (201)Tl stress myocardial perfusion SPECT for detecting coronary artery disease in the inferior wall of the left ventricle in Japanese patients.Of the 104 consecutive patients who underwent (201)Tl stress myocardial perfusion SPECT to diagnose coronary artery disease, we evaluated 46 who underwent image acquisition in both the supine and prone positions, and coronary angiography within 3 months thereafter. Images were acquired in the routine supine position immediately following (201)Tl (111 MBq) injection and 4 h following early acquisition. Images were acquired in the prone position only during the early phase following supine acquisition. We evaluated the SPECT images of the inferior half segments of the left ventricle using a five-point defect scoring system. According to the coronary angiographic findings, we investigated the diagnostic accuracy of stress-rest supine, stress supine, stress prone, and combined supine-prone images. Reduced uptake in the stress supine image of the combined images was considered as attenuation when uptake was normal in the prone image.The sensitivity of the stress-rest supine, stress supine, stress prone, and stress-combined supine-prone images was 77%, 86%, 55%, and 55%, and the specificity was 71%, 54%, 79%, and 83%, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy was the highest in stress-rest supine images.Prone images tended to improve the specificity of detecting coronary artery disease in the inferior wall, but not diagnostic accuracy compared with stress-rest supine images because of decreased sensitivity.
