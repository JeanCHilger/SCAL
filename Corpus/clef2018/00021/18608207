Whole body radiography for bone survey screening of cancer and myeloma patients. To determine the utility of a rapid, low dose whole body radiographic system (Statscan) for the detection of focal metastatic deposits in cancer patients and multifocal disease in myeloma patients.After IRB approval, 30 consecutive patients had a frontal and lateral whole body radiography done with the Statscan system as a substitute for conventional radiographic skeletal survey. Both whole body images were obtained in less than five minutes. Images were retrospectively reviewed, independently, by three musculoskeletal radiologists. Findings were compared to information from all other available imaging studies. Final determinations were by consensus.Of the 30 patients in the study group, there were 18 men and 12 women with an age range from 37 to 88 years, average 60 years. Diagnoses were MGUS/multiple myeloma in 18 cases, lymphoma/leukemia in two cases, and cancer in 11 cases. Eleven of the Statscan exams were interpreted by all three radiologists as normal. The remaining 19 Statscan exams showed a total of 117 lesions (96 osteolytic and 21 osteoblastic). Ninety percent of these (106/117) were confirmed as areas of suspected metastatic disease or multifocal involvement by a variety of other imaging studies (radiographic bone survey-7, CT-33, MR-13, bone scan-4, PET/CT-8).The Statscan whole body radiographic system is a useful method for detecting focal metastatic disease in cancer patients and multifocal involvement in myeloma patients.
