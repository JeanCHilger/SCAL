Zoonoses transmitted by mouse and rat maintained as laboratory or pet animals. Large numbers of mice (Mus spp.) and rats (Rattus spp.) are maintained for scientific reasons and as pet animals in Germany. While laboratory animals are monitored for pathogenic agents, the hygienic status of pet animals is usually completely unknown. Despite great efforts, zoonotic infections were reported even in laboratory settings, e.g. with Hantavirus (Seoul virus), Streptobacillus moniliformis, and Trichphyton mentagrophytes. However, in current reports, zoonotic infections were transmitted by mice and rats maintained as pet animals. This includes infections by Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Leptospira interrogans, Streptobacillus moniliformis, Salmonella enterica, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Ornithonyssus bacoti. Furthermore, entero-hepatic Helicobacter spp. of rats and mice are currently discussed to be involved in the etiology of hepatobiliary diseases. Pasteurella spp. of mice and rats do not present a risk for human disease comparable to those species that are transmitted by dogs or cats and might induce serious disease after bites. Altogether, this article lists potential zoonotic agents that were detected in mice and rats and are present in Germany, as well as agents that were reportedly transmitted by mice and rats maintained as laboratory or pet rodents.
