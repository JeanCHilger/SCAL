NODAPA-OH and NODAPA-(NCS)n: synthesis, 68Ga-radiolabelling and in vitro characterisation of novel versatile bifunctional chelators for molecular imaging. This report concerns synthesis, (68)Ga-radiolabelling and stability data of 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid-7-p-isothio-cyanatophenyl-acetic acid (NODAPA-NCS), 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1-acetic acid-4,7-di-p-isothiocyanatophenyl-acetic acid (NODAPA-(NCS)(2)) and 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid-7-p-hydroxyphenyl-acetic acid (NODAPA-OH), versatile bifunctional chelators with potential for molecular imaging. Protein binding and exemplified conjugation are also reported.
