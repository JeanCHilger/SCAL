Reconstruction from uniformly attenuated SPECT projection data using the DBH method. An algorithm was developed for the 2-D reconstruction of truncated and nontruncated uniformly attenuated data acquired from single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The algorithm is able to reconstruct data from half-scan (180 ( degrees ) ) and short-scan (180 ( degrees ) +fan angle) acquisitions for parallel- and fan-beam geometries, respectively, as well as data from full-scan (360 ( degrees )) acquisitions. The algorithm is a derivative, backprojection, and Hilbert transform (DBH) method, which involves the backprojection of differentiated projection data followed by an inversion of the finite weighted Hilbert transform. The kernel of the inverse weighted Hilbert transform is solved numerically using matrix inversion. Numerical simulations confirm that the DBH method provides accurate reconstructions from half-scan and short-scan data, even when there is truncation. However, as the attenuation increases, finer data sampling is required.
