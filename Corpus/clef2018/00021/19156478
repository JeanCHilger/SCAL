Diagnostic performance of fusion of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and computed tomography coronary angiography. We evaluated the incremental diagnostic value of fusion images of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) over MPI alone or MPI and CTA side-by-side to identify obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD > 50% stenosis) using invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the gold standard.50 subjects (36 men 56 +/- 11 years old) underwent rest-stress MPI and CTA within 12-26 days of each other. CTAs were performed with multi-detector CT-scanners (31 on 64-sliceOne or more critical stenoses during ICA were found in 28 patients and non-critical stenoses were found in 9 patients. MPI, side-by-side MPI-CTA, and fused CTA/MPI showed the same normalcy rate (NR:13/13) in LLK subjects. The fusion technique performed better than MPI and MPI and CTA side-by-side for the presence of CAD in any vessel (overall area under the curve (AUC) for fused images: 0.89 P = .005 vs MPI, P = .04 vs side-by-side MPI-CTA) and for localization of CAD to the left anterior descending coronary artery (AUC: 0.82, P < .001 vs MPIUsing ICA as the gold standard, fusion imaging provided incremental diagnostic information compared to MPI alone or side-by-side MPI-CTA for the diagnosis of obstructive CAD and for localization of CAD to the left anterior descending coronary artery.
