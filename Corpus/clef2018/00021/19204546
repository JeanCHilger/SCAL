Imaging in sports medicine: an overview. Increasing sports participation, and the inevitable sports injury, is a significant contributor to total healthcare expenditure in the United States. With sports-related injury ever increasing, and technology rapidly expanding in the areas of diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal trauma, a continual revisiting of the latest in technology is critical for the sports physician. Advances particularly in the areas of magnetic resonance imaging, diagnostic office ultrasound, and 3-dimensional reconstruction computed tomography, offer the clinician a myriad of diagnostic options in patient evaluation. Care must be exercised, however, as one pursues additional radiographic data in the patient care arena. The information must be interpreted with a firm foundation and understanding of not only the patient history and physical examination, but also the availability, indications, contraindications, sensitivity, specificity, and even the cost implications of the great spectrum of diagnostic options.
