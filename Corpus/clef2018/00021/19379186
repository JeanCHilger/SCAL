Trends in veterinary cancer imaging. With the recent advances in diagnostic imaging technology, cancer imaging in veterinary medicine has become more specific for disease diagnosis, more accurate for determining tumour margins and more sensitive for detecting metastatic disease. Ultrasound provides highly detailed images of parenchymal masses and infiltrative lesions while providing a means for aspiration or biopsy using real-time image guidance. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance-imaging techniques provide exquisite anatomical resolution that improves diagnostic accuracy, provides an accurate means of radiation or surgical treatment planning and a quantitative means for monitoring response to therapy. In addition to traditional anatomic imaging, new techniques are being developed for estimating functional parameters such as tumour perfusion, cell metabolism and gene expression. While conventional planar scintigraphy has been available for some time, newer nuclear imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography promise to further improve the accuracy of initial tumour diagnosis and staging and determination of response to therapy. Although many of these functional techniques are not yet clinically available, it is highly likely that some will be integrated into routine clinical practice in the near future.
