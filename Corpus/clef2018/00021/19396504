Influence of 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging on the prediction of future adverse cardiac events. The impact of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) on prediction of risk for future cardiac events was examined by comparing predictions based on clinical information alone and in combination with MPI findings.A 3-cardiologist Cardiac Event Prediction Panel (CEPP) estimated three-year cardiac event (non-fatal MI aborted sudden cardiac death(99m)Tc-tetrofosmin MPI single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) findings significantly improve accuracy of cardiac event rate prediction compared to those based on clinical information alone.
