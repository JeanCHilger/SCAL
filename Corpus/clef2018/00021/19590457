Efficacy of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration of hilar lymph nodes for diagnosing and staging cancer. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is used mostly in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to sample mediastinal lymph nodes that are visible on computed tomography (CT). We sought to determine the efficacy of EBUS-TBNA in sampling enlarged hilar lymph nodes in this patient population.From January 2004 to May 2007, patients with suspected NSCLC and CT or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging demonstrating enlarged (>1 cm) or PET-positive hilar lymph nodes underwent EBUS-TBNA. Patients with enlarged central mediastinal nodes were excluded. Identifiable lymph nodes at locations 10R, 10L, 11R, and 11L were aspirated. All patients underwent subsequent surgical staging or clinical follow-up as indicated. Diagnoses based on aspirates were compared with those based on surgical or clinical results.Of 213 patients evaluated (mean age, 56 years 138 men), 188 (mean age, 56.3 yearsNo complications occurred. In experienced hands, EBUS-TBNA of enlarged hilar lymph visible on CT or hilar nodes that are PET scan-positive can provide diagnostic results similar to those for central mediastinal nodes.
