Synthesis and evaluation of (99m)Tc-moxifloxacin, a potential infection specific imaging agent. To synthesize and evaluate a (99m)Tc labeled fluroquinolone, moxifloxacin as a potential bacteria specific infection imaging agent. A radiolabeling formulation including moxifloxacin, [Moxicip(TM) injection, Cipla] (4mg), sodium pertechnetate and stannous chloride (5microg) gave the best radiolabeling efficiency and moderately stable labeled (99m)Tc moxifloxacin. Quality control analysis was performed by ITLC. Rats and rabbit with infectious intramuscular lesions induced in either thigh with E. Colli were used for studying biodistribution and scintigraphic imaging of the labeled product. Imaging of an infected thigh of a rabbit was performed with a gamma-camera at various intervals. A good radiolabeling efficiency (90-95%) was obtained within 5min. No purification of the labeled product was done. Labeled product retained its radiochemical purity upto 85% even at 3h. Scintigraphy showed uptake in infectious lesions at 30min after injection, which remains constant upto 3h study. Abscess-to-muscle ratios were 1.60, 1.62, 1.74 and 1.75 at 30min, 1, 2 and 3h, respectively. Thus, (99m)Tc moxifloxacin, a new potential radiopharmaceutical has been developed for infection imaging agent.
