Personalized management of patients with inoperable alveolar echinococcosis undergoing treatment with albendazole: usefulness of positron-emission-tomography combined with serological and computed tomography follow-up. The present study aimed to identify a sub-group of inoperable alveolar echinococcosis (AE) patients undergoing long-term treatment with benzimidazole (BZM) who presented with an evolution suggestive of a parasitocidal effect. An evolution compatible with parasite death was observed in five patients.
