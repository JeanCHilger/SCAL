Expression, purification and characterization of bacteriophage lysin of Streptococcus in Escherichia coli. Lysins are murein hydrolases produced by bacteriophage that act on the cell wall of host bacteria to release progeny phages. Research indicated that lysins could kill bacteria effectively and specifically in vitro. To prepare recombinant bacteriophage lysin of Streptococcus (PlyC) and analyze its biological activity, we obtained two genes of PlyC named PlyCA and PlyCB by PCR amplification and inserted them into pET-32a(+), then transformed the recombinant expression vectors pET-32a(+)-PlyCA and pET-32a(+)-PlyCB into E. coli BL21(DE3) respectively. After induction with 0.7 mmol/L IPTG at 30 degrees C for 7 h, PlyCA and PlyCB were successfully expressed, SDS-PAGE analysis determined that they all constituted above 30% of the total cell proteins. After Ni(2+)-NTA affinity chromatography, the purity was more than 95%. With the denaturation and protein refolding, we gained the recombinant PlyC. To determine its biological activity, we adopted turbidimetry and plate count method. Before and after lysin treatment, the cell morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the recombinant PlyC could specifically cleavage Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci). Under the incubation time of 60 min with 4 microg/mL PlyC in Streptococcus pyogenes dilution which OD600 was 0.56, the germicidal effect was up to 99.6%, while SEM observations showed that cell wall cracked and presented cell debris. This finding laid the foundation for the further study and achieving an effective treatment for streptococcal infection.
