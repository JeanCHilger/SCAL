Comparative PET study using F-18 FET and F-18 FDG for the evaluation of patients with suspected brain tumour. The aim of this prospective pilot study in patients with suspected or known brain tumour was to establish the diagnostic value of O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) positron emission tomography (PET) when compared to fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Twenty-five FET PET and FDG PET scans were performed on 21 consecutive patients within 24 months. Final malignant pathology included 11 glioma (eight low-grade, three high grade), two lymphoma, one olfactory ganglioneuroblastoma, one anaplastic meningioma. Benign pathology included two encephalitis and one cortical dysplasia. Definitive pathology was not available in three patients. The accuracy of PET was determined by subsequent surgical histopathology in 12 and clinical/imaging course in nine patients. Median follow-up period was 20 months. FET sensitivity was 93%, specificity 100%, accuracy 96%, positive predictive value (PPV) 100% and negative predictive value (NPV) 91%. FDG sensitivity was 27%, specificity 90%, accuracy 52%, PPV 80% and NPV 45%. FET PET is more accurate than FDG PET for detecting malignant brain lesions, especially low-grade gliomas.
