C-11 methionine positron emission tomography/computed tomography localizes parathyroid adenomas in primary hyperparathyroidism. In patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT), positive preoperative localization studies enable to perform a minimally invasive approach for parathyroid surgery. However, current imaging techniques are not always successful. We therefore conducted a study to determine the sensitivity of C-11 methionine positron emission tomography/computed tomography (Met-PET/CT) in localizing parathyroid adenomas in pHPT. Met-PET/CT scans of the neck and mediastinum of 33 patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary HPT were compared with intraoperative and histological findings. Primary HPT was caused by a single gland adenoma in 30 patients, while another 3 patients had multiglandular disease. Met-PET/CT scan correctly located a single gland adenoma in 25 out of 30 (83%) patients with pHPT, among them 2 patients with persistent disease, 7 patients with prior neck surgery, and 8 patients with concomitant thyroid nodules. In 3 patients with multiglandular disease, Met-PET/CT showed only one enlarged parathyroid gland in two individuals and was negative in the third patient. Statistical analysis found a significant correlation between true-positive results and the weight (2.42+/-4.05 g) and diameter (2.0+/-1.18 cm) of parathyroid adenomas while the subgroup with false negative findings had significantly smaller (0.98+/-0.54 cm) and lighter (0.5+/-0.38 g) glands. Sensitivity was 83% for single gland adenomas and 67% for multiglandular disease. Met-PET/CT correctly localized 83% of single gland parathyroid adenomas in patients with pHPT. However, preoperative localization of multiglandular disease due to double adenomas or parathyroid hyperplasia remained difficult.
