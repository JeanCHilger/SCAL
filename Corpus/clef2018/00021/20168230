Pediatric genitourinary tumors. To review the 2008-2009 literature on pediatric genitourinary tumors and highlight the most significant publications.New techniques such as gene expression profiling, PET, nephron-sparing surgery, and stem cell transplantation are being incorporated into contemporary treatments for pediatric patients with genitourinary tumors. The WTX gene is the most commonly mutated gene in Wilms tumor, and its product enhances Wilms tumor gene 1-mediated transcription. Germline WTX mutations cause an X-linked sclerosing bone dysplasia but do not appear to predispose to Wilms tumor formation. Protocadherin gene clusters on chromosome 5q31 may act as tumor suppressors. In rhabdomyosarcoma, ILK and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-A join the paired box gene 7 and 3-forkhead box O1 fusions as potential therapeutic targets, and muscle-specific microRNAs offer promise as adjuvant therapy. Despite the high cure rate of Wilms tumor, long-term survivors remain at risk of death from various causes.In general, the prognosis for patients with pediatric genitourinary tumors is favorable. The elucidation of the molecular abnormalities in these tumors is determining risk stratification, treatment strategies, and candidates for new drug development.
