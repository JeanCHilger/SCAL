 Somatostatin (SS) is a tetradecapeptide acting as an inhibitor of the release of somatotropin, glucagon, gastrointestinal hormones, and other secretory proteins. Critical to these actions is the expression of SS receptors (SSRs) present on cell membranes. Such receptors recognize and bind to the ligand with high affinity and specificity and generate a transmembrane signal that induces a biological response. SSRs have been found on a variety of neuroendocrine tumors and cells of the immune system, and five individual subtypes have been identified and subsequently cloned from animal and human tissues (1,  2).
