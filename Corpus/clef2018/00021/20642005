 Malignant melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer (1). Early and accurate diagnosis is necessary for surgery and successful treatment (2). The melanocortin (MC) system is a neuropeptide network of the skin, and it is involved in pigmentation regulation, cortisol production, and many other physiological processes (3). Most cutaneous cell types express MC receptors, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), and prohormone convertases, and they also release MCs. However, these receptors have been found to be overexpressed in melanoma cells. There are five MC receptors (MC1R to MC5R), which belong to the G-protein−coupled receptor superfamily. Melanotropin-stimulating hormones (α-, β-, and γ-MSH) are derived from POMC by the proteolytic action of prohormone convertases. α-MSH (Ac-Ser
