The Correlation between FDG PET/CT Imaging and Molecule Makers in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.. PET is a sensitive and special method of determining malignant degree of the lung cancer. This study investigates the correlation between (18)F-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake and various biological markers in clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The non-small cell lung cancer specimens of 23 patients were examined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, the relationship between the max standard uptake value (SUV) of FDG and the expression of the biological markers p53, Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1), S-phase fraction (SPF) were studied.The max SUV was correlated with the expression of p53 (P <0.05), Ki-67 (P <0.05), PCNA (P <0.05), VEGF (P <0.05) and SPF (P <0.05) in stage I NSCLC. Glut-1 expression showed significant correlation with FDG uptake (P =0.001), however the max SUV showed no correlation with tumor pathology.Our study indicates that (18)F-FDG uptake in NSCLC correlates well with the expression of p53, Ki-67, PCNA, VEGF, GLUT-1, SPF.
