Value of (99m)Tc-MIBI/(18)F-FDG-dual-isotope simultaneous acquisition in diagnosis and treatment of myocardial infarction. To investigate the value of(99m)Tc-MIBI/(18)F-FDG-dual-isotope simultaneous acquisition (DISA) in diagnosis and treatment of patients with myocardial infarction.Sixty-three patients with myocardial infarction who underwent DISA before and after treatment were enrolled in the study. All cases were divided into subgroups based on different treatment and myocardial viability: Group A1 (n = 16) with coronary revascularization and viable myocardium, A2 (n = 9) same as A1 but no viable myocardium B1 (n = 6) with coronary revascularization + stem cell transplantation and viable myocardium, B2 (n = 7) same as B1 but no vital myocardiumThere were statistical significances in DF value of (99m)Tc-MIBI or (18)F-FDG imaging before and after treatment in all groups (P <0.05), except Group A2 (P>0.05). The improvement of blood perfusion and metabolism in cardiac survival groups was more marked than that in non-cardiac survival groups after treatment (P<0.05). Furthermore, Group B1 was superior to Groups A1 and C1 Group B2 was superior to Group A2 and Group C2 (P<0.05 or<0.01).(99m)Tc-MIBI/(18)F-FDG DISA can detect myocardial viability and is of value for patients with myocardial infarction to choose appropriate therapeutic strategies. The degree of cardiac improvement after treatment can be evaluated by DISA.
