Application of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography to detection of proximal lesions of obstructive colorectal cancer. In cases of obstructive colorectal cancer (CRC), preoperative diagnosis of the proximal lesion is often difficult when the primary lesion impedes the passage of the endoscope. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in such cases.A total of 52 obstructive CRC patients who underwent preoperative FDG-PET and subsequent surgical resection were retrospectively reviewed. The correlation between characteristics of the proximal lesion and FDG-PET findings was analyzed statistically.There was a significant correlation between the proximal lesion size and the maximum standardized uptake value (P = 0.00016). Abnormal FDG accumulation in the proximal colon indicated the existence of proximal cancer or adenoma with a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 100%. There was a significant difference in the distribution of tumor size between the cases with proximal abnormal accumulation and those with no proximal accumulation (P = 0.00014). A proximal tumor of â‰¥8 mm can be demonstrated by an accumulation of FDG with a sensitivity of 94.1%.FDG-PET can estimate the existence of a proximal lesion and its size. Results may contribute to decisions regarding the type of surgery in cases of obstructive CRC.
