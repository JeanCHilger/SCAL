The human and canine TERT promoters function equivalently in human and canine cells. Telomerase targeted cancer gene therapy is being exploited for treatment of human cancer. The high incidence and many comparative aspects of human and canine cancer and the compliance and dedication of dog owners to treat cancer makes the canine pet population a good clinical model for investigating and developing new cancer therapeutics. Here, we report that the human telomerase promoter operates in canine cells, suggesting that human telomerase promoter-driven cancer therapy can be used to treat cancer in canines. Therefore, the canine pet population can act as a clinical model for new drug development based on telomerase therapeutics.
