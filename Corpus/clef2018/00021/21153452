Regional cerebral blood flow in healthy volunteers measured by the graph plot method with iodoamphetamine SPECT. The graph plot method, a technique that uses N-isopropyl-(123)I-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for non-invasive measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), has been developed and applied in the clinical setting, although it has been performed without obtaining normal CBF values in normal, healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to measure normal regional CBF in older healthy subjects with IMP SPECT and the graph plot method.Eleven healthy volunteers (mean age: 63.5 Â± 8.9 years six males and five females) were recruited and regional CBF was measured using IMP SPECT and the graph plot method.The averaged global CBF was 45.4 ml/100 g/min. The distribution of regional CBF was almost homogenous in the cortices. There was no significant correlation between the global CBF and age in subjects aged 50-80 years.We used the IMP graph plot method to measure regional CBF in normal healthy subjects, without arterial blood sampling, and obtained compatible CBF values. This method is non-invasive and convenient for determination of regional CBF in the clinical setting.
