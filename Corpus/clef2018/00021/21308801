(76) Br]BMK-152, a nonpeptide analogue, with high affinity and low nonspecific binding for the corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 recepto. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a neuropeptide, regulates endocrine and autonomic responses to stress through G-protein coupled receptors, CRF(1) or CRF(2) . A PET ligand able to monitor changes in CRF(1) receptor occupancy in vivo would aid in understanding the pathophysiology of stress-related diseases as well as in the clinical development of nonpeptide antagonists with therapeutic value. We have radiolabeled the CRF(1) receptor ligand, [8-(4-bromo-2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)-2,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-α][1,3,5]triazin-4-yl]-N,N-bis-(2-methoxyethyl)amine (BMK-152) (ClogP = 2.6), at both the 3 and 4 position with [(76) Br]. Using in vitro autoradiography saturation studies the 4-[(76) Br]BMK-152 exhibited high affinity binding to both rat (K(d) = 0.23 ± 0.07 nM n = 3) and monkey frontal cortex (K(d) = 0.31 ± 0.08 nM
