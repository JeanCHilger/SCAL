Diseases transmitted from pets to man: an evolving concern for veterinarians. Pets are not a major source of human infections but they can transmit certain diseases to man. This transmission usually is complex, requiring close contact with pets or their excretions and frequently involves a breach of sound hygienic practice. In some instances, pathogens of animal origin are acquired inadvertently because  infectivity can persist after evidence of gross contamination has gone. Veterinarians participate in controlling zoonotic diseases by encouraging rabies vaccination and hygienic treatment of pet feces and urine, by supporting community efforts toward responsible pet ownership and by advising on precautions for handling sick animals. It is recommended that veterinarians discourage the keeping of wild or exotic animals as pets and excess fondling of pets (particularly by children and pregnant women). Clients and kennel workers should be advised to use caution with animals that have aborted.
