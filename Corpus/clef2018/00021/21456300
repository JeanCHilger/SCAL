Synthesis and characterization of 3-[131I]iodo-L-tyrosine grafted Fe3O4@SiO2 nanocomposite for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we have successfully developed 3-[131I]iodo-tyrosine grafted Fe3O4@SiO2 nanocomposites for dual potential tumor imaging agent for SPECT and MRI. Fe3O4 nanoparticle was synthesized through thermal decomposition and Fe3O4@SiO2 was prepared by reverse microemulsion method. After conjugating aminopropyltriethoxysiliane, L-tyrosine was introduced by amide coupling reaction. Finally, [131I]iodide was labeled on L-tyrosine grafted Fe3O4@SiO2 nanocomposite by aromatic iodination using chloramine-T.
