CT iterative reconstruction in image space: a phantom study. Although iterative reconstruction is widely applied in SPECT/PET, its introduction in clinical CT is quite recent, in the past the demand for extensive computer power and long image reconstruction times have stopped the diffusion of this technique. Recently Iterative Reconstruction in Image Space (IRIS) has been introduced on Siemens top CT scanners. This recon method works on image data area, reducing the time-consuming loops on raw data and noise removal is obtained in subsequent iterative steps with a smoothing process. We evaluated image noise, low contrast resolution, CT number linearity and accuracy, transverse and z-axis spatial resolution using some dedicated phantoms in single, dual source and cardiac mode. We reconstructed images with a traditional filtered back-projection algorithm and with IRIS. The iterative procedure preserves spatial resolution, CT number accuracy and linearity moreover decreases image noise. These preliminary results support the idea that dose reduction with preserved image quality is possible with IRIS, even if studies on patients are necessary to confirm these data.
