Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer. This study aimed at retrospectively evaluating the outcomes of radiofrequency ablation of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer.This study was carried out on 50 nonsurgical candidates (29 men and 21 women mean age, 74.7 years) with clinical stage I (IA, n = 38Grade 2 and 3 adverse events occurred after 6 (12%) and 3 (6%) of the 52 sessions, respectively. The median follow-up period was 37 months. Local progression was observed in 16 (31%) of the 52 tumors. The median survival time was 67 months. The overall, cancer-specific, and disease-free survivals were 94%, 100%, and 82% at 1 year, 86%, 93%, and 64% at 2 years, and 74%, 80%, and 53% at 3 years, respectively.Radiofrequency ablation of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer was minimally invasive and provided promising patient survival, although the local efficacy needs to be improved.
