Optimisation of whole-body PET/CT scanning protocols. Positron emission tomography (PET) has become one of the major tools for the in vivo localisation of positron-emitting tracers and now is performed routinely using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to answer important clinical questions including those in cardiology, neurology, psychiatry, and oncology. The latter application contributed largely to the wide acceptance of this imaging modality and its use in clinical diagnosis, staging, restaging, and assessment of tumour response to treatment. Dual-modality PET/CT systems have been operational for almost a decade since their inception. The complementarity between anatomic (CT) and functional or metabolic (PET) information provided in a "one-stop shop" has been the driving force of this technology. Although combined anato-metabolic imaging is an obvious choice, the way to perform imaging is still an open issue. The tracers or combinations of tracers to be used, how the imaging should be done, when contrast-enhanced CT should be performed, what are the optimal acquisition and processing protocols, are all unanswered questions. Moreover, each data acquisition-processing combination may need to be independently optimised and validated. This paper briefly reviews the basic principles of dual-modality imaging and addresses some of the practical issues involved in optimising PET/CT scanning protocols in a clinical environment.
