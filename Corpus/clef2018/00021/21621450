(18)FDG-PET/CT for detecting distant metastases and second primary cancers in patients with head and neck cancer. A meta-analysis. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the role of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)FDG-PET/CT) in detecting distant metastases and second primary cancers in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) at staging. Studies about (18)FDG-PET/CT for detecting distant metastases and second primary cancers in patients with HNC were systematically searched in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EBM Review databases from January 1, 2000 to March 1, 2011. A software called "Meta-DiSc" was used to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratios, summary receiver operating characteristic curves, and Q* index. Twelve articles fulfilled all inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and Q* index estimates with 95% confidence interval for PET/CT were 0.888 (0.827-0.928), 0.951 (0.936-0.963), and 0.937 (0.844-0.964). Subgroup analysis showed similar pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and Q* index for initial staging and restaging, nasopharyngeal cancer and all other sites of HNC. (18)FDG-PET/CT has good diagnostic performance in detecting distant metastases and second primary cancers in patients with HNC.
