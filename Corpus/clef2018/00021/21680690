Mapping of lymphatic drainage from the prostate using filtered 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid and SPECT/CT. We have developed a practice procedure for prostate lymphoscintigraphy using SPECT/CT and filtered (99m)Tc-sulfur nanocolloid, as an alternative to the proprietary product (99m)Tc-Nanocoll, which is not approved in the United States.Ten patients were enrolled for this study, and all received radiotracer prepared using a 100-nm membrane filter at a commercial radiopharmacy. Whole-body scans and SPECT/CT studies were performed within 1.5-3 h after the radiotracer had been administered directly into 6 locations of the prostate gland under transrectal ultrasound guidance. The radiation dose was estimated from the first 3 patients. Lymphatic drainage mapping was performed, and lymph nodes were identified.The estimated radiation dose ranged from 3.9 to 5.2 mSv/MBq. The locations of lymph nodes draining the prostate gland were similar to those found using the proprietary product.When the proprietary radiolabeled nanocolloid indicated for lymphoscintigraphy is not available, prostate lymph node mapping and identification are still feasible using filtered (99m)Tc-sulfur nanocolloid.
