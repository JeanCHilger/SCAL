PET/CT imaging in systemic lupus erythematosus. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the classical immune-complex disease. Involvement of vital organs, particularly the kidneys and brain, accounts for significant morbidity and mortality. A number of imaging tools are currently available for evaluation of inflammatory conditions. By targeting the increased glucose uptake of infiltrating granulocytes and tissue macrophages, positron emission tomography with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18) F]FDG PET/CT) has been shown to delineate inflammation with high sensitivity. Because activated lymphocytes have increased glucose metabolism, [(18) F]FDG PET has been successfully used to visualize large concentrations of these cells in lymphoid organs where antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation occur. Widespread increased FDG uptake in lymph nodes of patients with active SLE, as well as increased thymic uptake, has been described. The most prevalent and dramatic PET/CT finding in neuropsychiatric SLE (NP-SLE) patients is parieto-occipital hypometabolism. In conclusion, PET/CT has become an excellent ancillary tool to assess disease activity and prognosis in SLE patients.
