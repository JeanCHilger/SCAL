Image correlation in oncology. Image correlation techniques can provide objective spatial registration between multimodality data sets acquired during the planning and follow-up phases of radiation therapy. Correlation of pre-CT/MRI with follow-up CT/MRI and 3D dose matrices may provide insights into normal tissue tolerance. Correlation of SPECT and planar scintigraphs with anatomical maps derived from CT/MRI may be useful in the precise localization of disease and in the evaluation of new modalities, such as radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Correlation of PET and MRI may lead to a more precise understanding of structure-function relationships of the brain. The development and refinement of multimodality image-correlation techniques is a logical step in the evolving role of imaging in radiation therapy.
