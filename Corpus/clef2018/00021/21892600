PET in T-Cell Lymphoma. Most non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are of B-cell origin only about 10% are T-cell or NK-cell lymphomas. The clinical features of T/NK-cell lymphomas differ from those of B-cell lymphomas: advanced stage and extranodal disease are more common and the prognosis is worse. Several studies have confirmed that 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG) uptake varies among different subtypes of lymphoma, a disparity that can be explained by the differences in histology, proliferation of tumor cells, and the ratio of viable tumor and reactive cells in the environment. These observations are based on investigation of B-cell lymphomas. Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) was found to be useful both at staging and at measuring the therapeutic outcome after two to three cycles of chemotherapy (interim PET/CT). Several meta-analyses have confirmed the role of PET in evaluating the viability of the residual tumor mass after treatment. 18FDG-PET has been proved to have an excellent negative predictive value. Conversely, only a few studies have investigated the role of FDG-PET in T/NK-cell lymphomas. This paper summarizes the current information regarding the potential use of PET/CT in patients with T-cell lymphoma.
