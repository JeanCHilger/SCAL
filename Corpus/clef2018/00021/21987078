A simple, rapid procedure for nucleophilic radiosynthesis of aliphatic [18F]trifluoromethyl groups. A procedure for the radiosynthesis of aliphatic [(18)F]trifluoromethyl groups by reacting 1,1-difluorovinyl precursors with [(18)F]fluoride ions, resulting in the equivalent of direct nucleophilic addition of H[(18)F]F, has been developed. A variety of (18)F-labelled model compounds were then obtained and two potential [(18)F]radiotracers were synthesised by a two step process starting from 1,1-difluorovin-2-yl 4-toluenesulfonate. The method is widely applicable for the synthesis of novel radiotracers in high radiochemical yields and good specific activity.
