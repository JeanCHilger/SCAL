Rosuvastatin improves myocardial function and arteriosclerosis plaque in patients with ST-segment elevation after acute myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary intervention. To evaluate the effect of rosuvastatin on the functions of the surviving myocardium and arteriosclerosis plaque in patients with ST-segment elevation after acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Sixty-five STEMI patients were randomized to receive 40 mg simvastatin (n=32) or 10 mg rosuvastatin (n=33) before sleep in addition to conventional medications. Before PCI and after the 12-month medications, the plasma levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured, and echocardiography and (99)Tc(m)-MIBI single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were performed to assess the therapeutic effects.At the end of 12 months, the patients in simvastatin group showed significantly reduced total cholesterol, LDL-C, CRP, TNF-α, and (99)Tc(m)-MIBI uptake fraction. In rosuvastatin group, these reductions were even more obvious the intima media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery was reduced significantly after a 12-month rosuvastatin therapy, but almost remained unchanged after simvastatin therapy.Rosuvastatin therapy in addition to conventional medications can significantly reduce IMT and improve the functions of the surviving myocardium in patients with STEMI after PCI.
