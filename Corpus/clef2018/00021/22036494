Educating the child neurologist about neuroimaging. Training in child neurology is becoming increasingly technically oriented. Neuroimaging, in particular, has undergone massive expansion over the past few decades. By the end of training, it is important for trainees to be reasonably adept with magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography scanning, positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography scanning, and cranial ultrasound. Trainees should understand the means by which images are acquired, the types of image contrast available, the risks inherent to each modality, the clinical setting in which a particular imaging method is useful, and the fundamentals of image interpretation. Training should include formal sessions in imaging basics as well as continuous exposure to imaging throughout clinical rotations. Trainees should be encouraged to evaluate all images from their patients, forming their own interpretation before reviewing them with attending neurologists and/or radiologists.
