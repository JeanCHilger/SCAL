Design and Implementation of a Block Detector Simulation in SimSET. SimSET (a Simulation System for Emission Tomography) is being modified to more accurately simulate typical PET block detector tomographs. A new detector module that models the detector system as a collection of rectangular boxes is being added to the software. The new model is sufficiently general to allow many more imaginative or speculative detector systems to be simulated.
