Scintigraphic imaging in Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy. Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC, stress cardiomyopathy) is more common in elderly women and its symptoms can be deceptively similar to those of acute myocardial infarction. Although coronary arteries appear normal on coronary angiograms, a shape like a Tako-Tsubo (a Japanese fishing pot for trapping octopuses) can be observed on left ventriculogram. TTC is generally considered to be a trigger for sudden cardiac death. The onset mechanism of TTC is still controversial. Catecholamine cardiotoxicity and/or coronary circulation disturbance due to coronary microvascular spasm and/or neurogenic stunned myocardium as a result of autonomic imbalance are considered to be the most likely causes. In this review, we assess the usefulness of myocardial scintigraphic imaging in TTC patients on the basis of the results obtained from earlier studies and case reports in order to establish a deeper understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of this syndrome.
