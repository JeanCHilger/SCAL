Physiological ¹⁸F-FDG uptake by the spinal cord: is it a point of consideration for cancer patients? It is essential to be familiar with normal patterns of (18)F FDG distribution in the whole body for accurate PET interpretation. We assessed FDG uptake by the spinal cord to evaluate its characteristics in cancer patients. For 101 cancer patients who underwent (18)F FDG PET/CT the spinal cord along its segments was visually assessed for FDG uptake, regarding MaxSUV-measurement ≥1 as cut-off point. This assessment was correlated with the patient's database variables. MRI and FDG PET-CT follow-up were included in the evaluation of positive subjects with FDG cord uptake. Forty-nine (48.5%) were positive for FDG cord uptake. The most encountered sites were the eleventh and twelfth dorsal vertebrae (36/49 73.5%), all cervical (24/49
