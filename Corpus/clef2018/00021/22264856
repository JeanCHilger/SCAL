Evaluation of the relationship between [18F]FDG and P-glycoprotein expression: an experimental study. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a cell-membrane-associated protein that transports a variety of drug substrates. We sought to evaluate the relationship between 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) and P-gp expression using breast carcinoma Bcap37/multidrug resistant (MDR1) and Bcap37 in vitro and in vivo.The function of P-gp expressed in Bcap37/MDR1 cells was evaluated using verapamil (VER), a classical inhibitor of P-gp. The accumulation of 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile ([99mTc]MIBI) in vitro was measured. In vivo imaging of severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice implanted with Bcap37 and Bcap37/MDR1 cells was performed by scintigraphy and micro-positron emission tomography (PET).The uptake of [99mTc]MIBI was 0.62%±0.05% in the Bcap37/MDR1 cells and 2.02%±0.28% in the Bcap37 cells. VER significantly increased the uptake of [99mTc]MIBI in the Bcap37/MDR1 cells (1.90%±0.09%) but not in the Bcap37 cells (2.15%±0.27%). In vivo, neither the Bcap37 nor Bcap37/MDR1 tumors grown in the SCID mice could be detected by [99mTc]MIBI scintigraphy. Both the Bcap37 and Bcap37/MDR1 tumors were visible by micro-PET. The mean standardized uptake value (SUV) was significantly higher in the Bcap37 tumors (1.00±0.06) than in the Bcap37/MDR1 (0.67±0.11) tumors. VER significantly increased the mean SUV in the Bcap37/MDR1 tumors (1.02±0.16) but not in the Bcap37 tumors (1.09±0.22).[18F]FDG combined with VER may be an effective noninvasive method of determining P-gp expression in tumors.
