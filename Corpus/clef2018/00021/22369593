Comparison of fast peritoneal equilibrium test with the standard method: a pilot study. Standard peritoneal equilibrium test (PET) is an implementation that requires hard work for peritoneal dialysis (PD) staff. We analysed the efficacy of the fast PET and compared its results with standard PET. Forty-nine patients on PD therapy were included in the study. For standard PET, glucose, urea and creatinine values of dialysate were analysed at zeroth, second and fourth hours, and the patient's serum glucose, urea and creatinine values were analysed at second hour. In the fast PET, urea, glucose and creatinine values in plasma and dialysate were analysed at the fourth hour only. The results of both methods were compared with Pearson correlation and kappa tests. According to the standard PET, low transport in five patients, low-average transport in 17 patients, high-average transport in 23 patients and high transport types in four patients were identified. Fast PET results were similar in 46 (94%) patients (r = 0.77, p = 0.0001). Kappa (Îºw) analysis of results of both PETs was also statistically significant (p = 0.0001). This study showed that the peritoneal transport type may be determined more easily, practically and faster.
