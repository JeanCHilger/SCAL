Novel application of polyelectrolyte multilayers as nanoscopic closures with hermetic sealing. Closure systems for personnel protection applications, such as protective clothing or respirator face seals, should provide effective permeation barrier to toxic gases. Currently available mechanical closure systems based on the hook and loop types (example, Velcro) do not provide adequate barrier to gas permeation. To achieve hermetic sealing, we propose a nonmechanical, nanoscopic molecular closure system based on complementary polyelectrolyte multilayers, one with a polycation outermost layer and the other with a polyanion outermost layer. The closure surfaces were prepared by depositing polyelectrolyte multilayers under a variety of deposition conditions, on conformable polymer substrates (thin films of polyethylene teraphthalate, PET or polyimide, PI). The hermetic sealing property of the closures was evaluated by measuring the air flow resistance using the dynamic moisture permeation cell (DMPC) at different humidity conditions. The DMPC measurements show that the polyelectrolyte multilayer closures provide significantly large resistance to air flow, approximately 20-800 times larger than that possible with conventional hook and loop type closure systems, at all humidity levels (from 5 to 95% relative humidity). Hence, from the point of view of providing a hermetic seal against toxic gas permeation, the polyelectrolyte multilayer closures are viable candidates for further engineering development. However, the adhesive strength of the multilayer closures measured by atomic force microscopy suggests that the magnitude of adhesion is much smaller than what is possible with mechanical closures. Therefore, we envisage the development of a composite closure system combining the mechanical closure to provide strong adhesion and the multilayer closure to provide hermetic sealing.
