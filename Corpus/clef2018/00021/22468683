Coordination-driven self-assembly of 2D-metallamacrocycles using a new carbazole-based dipyridyl donor: synthesis, characterization, and C60 binding study. A new carbazole-based 90° dipyridyl donor 3,6-di(4-pyridylethynyl)carbazole (L) containing carbazole-ethynyl functionality is synthesized in reasonable yield using the Sonagashira coupling reaction. Multinuclear NMR, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), including single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis characterized this 90° building unit. The stoichiometry combination of L with several Pd(II)/Pt(II)-based 90° acceptors (1a-1d) yielded [2 + 2] self-assembled metallacycles (2a-2d) under mild conditions in quantitative yields [1a = cis-(dppf)Pd(OTf)(2) 1b = cis-(dppf)Pt(OTf)(2)
