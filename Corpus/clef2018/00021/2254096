Ornithine decarboxylase activity in prostate and tumor: a feasibility study for PET with L-[5-14C]- and L-[5-14C]ornithine. The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of measuring ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in tissues such as prostate and tumor, by PET. The ODC activity in vitro and the distribution of L-[1-14C]- and L-[5-14C]ornithine were studied in prostate, tumor, liver and kidney. For the animal models, rats bearing Walker 256 carcinosarcoma, were used. Our results indicate that the ODC activity in prostate is correlated with the difference in uptake between L-[1-14C]- and L-[5-14C]ornithine. Measurement of ODC activity in tumor by PET demands a tumor with an ODC activity comparable to that of prostate. Such a tumor will show a sufficient difference in uptake, which can be detected by PET.
