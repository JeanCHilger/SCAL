Effective fluorescent chemosensors for the detection of ZnÂ²+ metal ion. Benzimidazole derivatives synthesized from three components assembling condensation reaction behaves as a selective fluorescent sensor for Zn(2+) metal ion. These benzimidazole derivatives were characterized by (1)H, (13)C NMR, mass and elemental analysis. XRD analysis was carried out for 1-(4-methylbenzyl)-2-p-tolyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole. The increase in the fluorescence enhancement can be explained on the basis of photo induced electron transfer (PET) mechanism. The blockage of the photoinduced electron transfer process from benzimidazole ring to aryl fluorophore induced by Zn(2+) co-ordination induced emission enhancement.
