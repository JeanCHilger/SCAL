Preoperative predictive model of cervical lymph node metastasis combining fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computerized tomography findings and clinical factors in patients with oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. This study aimed to construct a preoperative predictive model of cervical lymph node metastasis using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computerized tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) findings in patients with oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).Forty-nine such patients undergoing preoperative (18)F-FDG PET/CT and neck dissection or lymph node biopsy were enrolled. Retrospective comparisons with spatial correlation between PET/CT and the anatomical sites based on histopathological examinations of surgical specimens were performed. We calculated a logistic regression model, including the SUVmax-related variable.When using the optimal cutoff point criterion of probabilities calculated from the model that included either clinical factors and delayed-phase SUVmax ≥0.087 or clinical factors and maximum standardized uptake (SUV) increasing rate (SUV-IR) ≥ 0.100, it significantly increased the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (87.5%, 65.7%, and 75.2%, respectively).The use of predictive models that include clinical factors and delayed-phase SUVmax and SUV-IR improve preoperative nodal diagnosis.
