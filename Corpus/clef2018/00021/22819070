Altered extrafocal iomazenil activity in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. To investigate involvement of extrafocal regions in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), we retrospectively explored abnormalities in distribution of iomazenil (IMZ) activity by identifying interhemispheric asymmetry on IMZ-SPECT images of patients with MTLE. Fourteen MTLE patients in whom a good surgical outcome was achieved were included in the study. Voxel-based (VB) analysis and volume-of-interest (VOI) analysis with predefined VOIs were applied to compare IMZ binding between the hemispheres ipsilateral and contralateral to the epileptic focus. VB analysis showed significant decreases in iomazenil binding not only in the ipsilateral anterior temporal lobe including the mesial temporal structures but also in the ipsilateral extratemporal region including the insula, putamen, and medial occipital lobe. VOI analysis showed similar significant decreases in the ipsilateral parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, putamen, lateral temporal lobe, and lateral occipital lobe. Results of the SPECT analyses suggest that decreased or dysfunctional IMZ activity extends from the mesial temporal lobe to the ipsilateral extrafocal region in patients with MTLE.
