The significance of 18F-FDG PET/CT in secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This study was aimed to investigate the significance of 18F-FDG PET/CT in secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) patients. A total of 18 patients received 18F-FDG PET/CT scan at initial diagnosis. All patients (18/18) had at least 3 organs involved, with increased FDG metabolism in different degrees. Fifteen cases (15/18) had definite underlying diseases, including infections (IAHLH), rheumatosis (RAHLH), or malignancy (MAHLH). The SUVmax of patients in MAHLH group was significantly higher than patients in IAHLH group or RAHLH group (P = 0.015, P = 0.045). Furthermore, the SUVmax of patients in IAHLH group was significantly higher than patients of RAHLH group (P = 0.043). Therefore, we concluded that 18F-FDG PET/CT may especially play important role in differential diagnosis of sHLH.
