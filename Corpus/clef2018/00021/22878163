Amyloid deposition detected with florbetapir F 18 ((18)F-AV-45) is related to lower episodic memory performance in clinically normal older individuals. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship of amyloid burden, as assessed by florbetapir F 18 ((18)F-AV-45) amyloid positron emission tomography, and cognition in healthy older control (HC) subjects. Seventy-eight HC subjects were assessed with a brief cognitive test battery and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with (18)F-AV-45. A standard uptake value ratio was computed for mean data from 6 cortical regions using a whole cerebellum reference region. Scans were also visually rated as amyloid positive or amyloid negative by 3 readers. Higher standard uptake value ratio correlated with lower immediate memory (r = -0.33 p = 0.003) and delayed recall scores (r = -0.25
