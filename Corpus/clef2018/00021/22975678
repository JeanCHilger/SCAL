Evaluation of cerebral ischemia using near-infrared spectroscopy with oxygen inhalation. Conventional methods presently used to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics are invasive, require physical restraint, and employ equipment that is not easily transportable. Therefore, it is difficult to take repeated measurements at the patient's bedside. An alternative method to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics was developed using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with oxygen inhalation. The bilateral fronto-temporal areas of 30 normal volunteers and 33 patients with cerebral ischemia were evaluated with the NIRS system. The subjects inhaled oxygen through a mask for 2 min at a flow rate of 8  L/min. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the data, and a topogram was drawn using the calculated weights. NIRS findings were compared with those of single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT). In normal volunteers, no laterality of the PCA weights was observed in 25 of 30 cases (83%). In patients with cerebral ischemia, PCA weights in ischemic regions were lower than in normal regions. In 28 of 33 patients (85%) with cerebral ischemia, NIRS findings agreed with those of SPECT. The results suggest that transmission of the changes in systemic SpO2 were attenuated in ischemic regions. The method discussed here should be clinically useful because it can be used to measure cerebral ischemia easily, repeatedly, and noninvasively.
