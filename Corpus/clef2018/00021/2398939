Hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis--Dutch type. Tc-99m HM-PAO single photon emission computed tomography. We performed single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and cerebral CT-scans in nine patients with hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy. CT-scans showed 23 focal hypodense lesions, 13 of which were visible on SPECT as a CBF-defect. One patient showed a CBF-defect on SPECT without CT-scan lesion and had a cerebral hemorrhage three months later in that particular region. In two additional patients, who were 50% at risk for this autosomal dominant disease, CBF-defects on SPECT, but no cortical lesions on CT-scan were found. CT-scans may be more sensitive than SPECT to detect chronic lesions caused by cerebral hemorrhages, but another possibility is that hemorrhages do not always lead to persistent CBF-defects. SPECT can show the effect of amyloid deposits on CBF before the angiopathy causes clinical symptoms.
