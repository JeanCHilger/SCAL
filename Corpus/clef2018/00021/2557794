PET imaging of human gliomas with ligands for the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site. Human gliomas were imaged in vivo using ligands for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site (or omega 3 binding site) and positron emission tomography (PET). Although gliomas have a high density of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site, PET scans with a selective ligand for this site, [11C] Ro5-4864, failed to demonstrate higher radioactivity levels in human gliomas than in brain. In vitro studies of surgically removed specimens of human glioma demonstrated little binding of Ro5-4864 but high levels of binding of another selective ligand, PK 11195. Scans with [11C]PK 11195 demonstrated increased radioactivity in glioma compared to brain in 8 of 10 patients. Radioactivity in tumor and the ratios of radioactivity in tumor to that in remote gray and in white matter correlated significantly with the specific activity of [11C]PK 11195, suggesting that accumulation represents saturable high-affinity binding. We conclude that the PK 11195 manifests greater binding than Ro5-4864 to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site on human gliomas and that human gliomas can be successfully imaged using [11C]PK 11195 and PET.
