Dementing conditions studied with PET. Papers published between 1980 and 1986 reporting PET scans performed on patients with dementia are reviewed. Application of PET in clinical practice is limited to date. However, PET methods contribute to clarify pathophysiology of the dementias. Some possibilities for future investigations are outlined but progress will be slow due to the complexities of the technique.
