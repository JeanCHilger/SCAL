Anxiety, pain and sedation: some psychiatric aspects. Whereas pain is an important factor that brings the patient to the dental office, fear and anxiety about pain are common reasons for patients to delay or avoid dental care. The relation between anxiety and pain is discussed in view of recent neuroanatomical and pharmacological findings obtained through modern research techniques, including positron emission tomography. Mechanisms behind sedation induced by the benzodiazepines and through psychological management of the apprehensive patient are discussed. It is concluded that the optimal quality of treatment may be obtained through the combined use of pharmacological and psychological treatment modalities.
