Scatter correction in SPECT using non-uniform attenuation data. Quantitative assessment of activity levels with SPECT is difficult because of attenuation and scattering of gamma rays within the object. To study the effect of attenuation and scatter on SPECT quantitation, phantom studies were performed with non-uniform attenuation. Simulated transmission CT data provided information about the distribution of attenuation coefficients within the source. Attenuation correction was performed by an iterative reprojection technique. Scatter correction was done by convolution of the attenuation-corrected image and an appropriate filter. The filter characteristics depended on the attenuation and activity measurement at each pixel. The scatter correction could compensate completely for the 28% scatter component from a line source, and the 61% component from a thick, extended source. Accuracy of regional activity ratios and the linearity of the relationship between true radioactivity and the SPECT measurement were both significantly improved by these corrections. The present method is expected to be valuable for the quantitative assessment of regional activity.
