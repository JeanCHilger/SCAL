Pheochromocytoma and the normal adrenal medulla: improved visualization with I-123 MIBG scintigraphy. The radiopharmaceutical iodine 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (I-131 MIBG) has been shown to locate pheochromocytomas scintigraphically with a false-negative rate of approximately 13%. To improve image quality and reduce the false-negative rate, I-123 was examined as a radioactive label for MIBG, as it has many advantages over I-131, including superior dosimetry and better detection efficiency. Diagnostic doses of 0.5 mCi (18.5 MBq) I-131 MIBG and 10.0 mCi (370.0 MBq) I-123 MIBG with nearly equivalent radiation dosimetries were compared in 18 patients with known or suspected pheochromocytomas. Images of superior quality were obtained with I-123 MIBG in 18 of 18 patients, and in eight cases lesions not visualized on I-131 MIBG scintigraphy were portrayed. A further advantage of I-123 MIBG is that it permits single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). This was performed in six cases and provided additional information in three cases. The adrenal medullae were definitely visualized using I-123 scintigraphy in eight of 14 patients still possessing adrenal glands, whereas I-131 MIBG images portrayed the adrenal medulla in only one of 14 cases. Five remaining patients had multiple abdominal tumor deposits that were difficult to differentiate from normal adrenal medullae.
