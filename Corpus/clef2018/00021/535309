Assessment of the Coag-a-Pet Dual Channel in the routine haemostatic laboratory. The Coag-a-Pet Dual Channel is an instrument which automatically records coagulation test end-points utilizing a photo-optical clot detection system. The instrument and its operation are described in detail. The capability of the instrument to perform tests of oral anticoagulant control, basic coagulation profiles and one-stage factor assays is assessed. In terms of precision and accuracy, the instrument performs well in carrying out the one-stage prothrombin time, Thrombotest, activated partial thromboplastin time using an automated APTT reagent but not kaolin, and one-stage factor assays. The thrombin clotting time can not be measured on this instrument. The instrument is most suitable for batched repetitive tests, reducing observer error and improving laboratory efficiency.
