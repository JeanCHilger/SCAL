Nutritional therapy for diabetes mellitus. Dietary therapy affects diabetes management in the dog and cat directly through control of blood glucose and indirectly through control of obesity and lipid abnormalities. Caloric intake, the feeding schedule, food form, macronutrient composition of the diet, and the presence of any concurrent problems must all be considered when planning the dietary regime. Generally, the healthy diabetic dog or cat should be fed a diet with increased fiber and moderate carbohydrate in a quantity sufficient to attain and maintain optimal body weight whenever possible, the daily food allotment should be divided into multiple small meals that are fed through the day and evening when the physiologic effects of administered insulin are present. Once established, the dietary regime should be kept constant from day to day. Following these guidelines will help minimize postprandial hyperglycemia and may lead to a decreased exogenous insulin requirement. However, if a concurrent disorder has dietary requirements that conflict with those for the diabetic pet, nutritional management of the other disorder should usually take precedence.
