A PET study of cognitive strategies in normal subjects during language tasks. Influence of phonetic ambiguity and sequence processing on phoneme monitoring. We previously demonstrated using PET in normal subjects (DÃ©monet et al., Brain 1992 115: 1753-68) that, by comparison to a reference task of monitoring for pure tones, a phoneme monitoring task involving two factors of complexity (sequence processing and perceptual ambiguity) activated Wernicke's area and Broca's area. In the present experiment, we explored the respective influence of these factors on brain activation. In addition to the reference task, four phoneme monitoring tasks in non-words were used with stimuli presented binaurally. These included an easy, non-sequential, unambiguous task
