Clozapine effects on glucose metabolic rate in striatum and frontal cortex. Eighteen patients with schizophrenia had cerebral metabolic rates assessed with positron emission tomography during a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of clozapine treatment. Relative metabolic rates were increased in the basal ganglia, especially on the right side. In the frontal lobe, metabolic rates were lowered, more on the left than on the right. The anterior nuclei of the thalamus also showed lower metabolic rates after clozapine. We have previously observed patients with schizophrenia to have low metabolic rates in the basal ganglia and to lack the normal right > left asymmetry in this study, clozapine normalized striatal activity. In the frontal lobe, asymmetry was normalized, but hypofrontal function was, if anything, exaggerated. This effect in the frontal lobe was not observed with haloperidol in earlier studies. The cortical effects of clozapine may be related to its unique clinical properties and suggest important differences between typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs.
