The peritoneal equilibration test in children. Eight children, aged 15 months to 17 years 9 months, maintained by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)/continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis and nine adults, aged 20-59 years, managed by CAPD were compared using a standardized peritoneal dialysis protocol, the peritoneal equilibration test (PET). The peritoneal glucose concentration tended to equilibrate with the serum glucose more rapidly in children, but the percentage of the glucose load absorbed was not different between the two age groups. There was an inverse trend between the percentage of glucose absorbed and age in children. Peritoneal creatinine clearance scaled to surface area in children was significantly less than that of the adults however, the clearances became similar when adjusted for body weight. Peritoneal creatinine clearance scaled to surface area bore a positive and significant relationship to age which, when expressed per kilogram body weight, disappeared. Children had a significantly higher dialysate/plasma (D/P) creatinine ratio after the first 2 h of the PET, but this ratio approached unity by 4 h and was not different from adults. The fractional change in the creatinine D/P ratio during the PET was not different between the two age groups. Drain volume adjusted to surface area was significantly less in children than adults. This difference was reversed when drain volume was factored by weight. Similarly drain volume scaled to surface area demonstrated a significant and positive relationship to age, which disappeared when drain volume was expressed per kilogram body weight. Ultrafiltration, whether factored by weight or scaled to surface area, did not differ between the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
