A comparison of iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy and single bone marrow aspiration biopsy in the diagnosis and follow-up of 26 children with neuroblastoma. In staging neuroblastomas, the demonstration of tumoural invasion of the bone marrow is an important criterion with regard to the therapeutic prospects and the prognosis. Iliac crest aspiration sampling has been used routinely for the detection of bone marrow metastases in neuroblastoma. However, due to the limited character of the sampling, it sometimes leads to false-negative results. Another procedure which is used to determine the extent of neuroblastoma is metaiodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) scintigraphy. In order to establish the respective merits of both diagnostic techniques retrospectively, 148 iodine-123 mIBG scans of 26 children with neuroblastoma have been re-evaluated and compared with the results of routine bone marrow samples obtained within a 4-week period before or after scanning. Three types of mIBG uptake in the bone/bone marrow could be differentiated: (1) no visualization of the skeleton (2) diffuse uptake in the skeleton with or without focally increased uptake, which indicates massive, diffuse bone marrow invasion by the tumour
