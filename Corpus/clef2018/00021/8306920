Biological markers in schizophrenia. Based on a review of the literature, the article deals with the major biological markers of schizophrenia. Recent developments in molecular biology have shown a possible association between schizophrenia and various HLA markers (A1, A2, A9, A10, A28, B27, BW16), and a linkage--in several families--between the disease and some polymorphisms of chromosome 5. On the other hand, chromosome X might also be involved. Neuropathological abnormalities have often been found in the brains of schizophrenics, such as cellular alterations in the basal ganglia and the limbic structures. Investigations by means of CT-scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging have pointed out an enlargement of cerebral ventricles and/or an atrophy of frontal areas, especially amongst patients with prominent negative symptoms. The dopaminergic hypothesis of schizophrenia reposes on the major following facts: the therapeutic efficiency of neuroleptics (dopaminergic antagonists) a positive correlation between plasma homovanillic acid (metabolite of dopamine) concentration and the severity of schizophrenic illness
