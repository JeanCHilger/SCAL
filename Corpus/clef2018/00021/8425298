Direct comparison of [13N]ammonia and [15O]water estimates of perfusion with quantification of regional myocardial blood flow by microspheres. Both [13N]ammonia and [15O]water have been used to quantify myocardial blood flow with positron emission tomography using appropriate tracer kinetic models. A direct comparison of the two tracers with radioactive microspheres has not been performed in the same experimental preparation.The two tracers have been tested for myocardial blood flow quantification in closed-chest dogs with circumflex coronary stenosis or permanent occlusion at rest and during adenosine-induced hyperemia. [13N]ammonia- and [15O]water-derived myocardial blood flow values have been compared with radiolabeled microspheres. Validation studies consisted of simultaneous measurements of blood flow with positron emission tomography and microspheres over a wide range of flow values. Blood pool and regional tissue activity curves were fitted with a three-compartment model for [13N]ammonia with and without arterial metabolite correction and with a single-tissue-compartment model for [15O]water. A correction for finite-resolution effect before the fit was also applied. In large regions of interest (5 cm3), a good correlation between the microsphere method and [13N]ammonia (with metabolite correction) was obtained (y = 3 + 0.78x, r = 0.94). The correlation with microspheres was slightly better with [15O]water (y = -3 + 0.89x, r = 0.97). Similar correlations were achieved in smaller regions of interest (1 cm3) as well as in akinetic segments and in central infarct regions.Positron emission tomography with appropriate tracer kinetic models using [13N]ammonia and [15O]water provides an accurate quantitative method for measuring regional myocardial blood flow over a wide range of flow values in normally contracting or akinetic canine myocardium in the absence and in the presence of infarction.
