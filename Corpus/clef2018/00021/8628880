Alzheimer disease: improved visual interpretation of PET images by using three-dimensional stereotaxic surface projections. To compare the diagnostic usefulness of three-dimensional (3D) stereotaxic surface projection (SSP) with that of standard transaxial display in brain positron emission tomography (PET) in Alzheimer disease (AD).Standard transaxial section display and 3D-SSP PET image sets obtained after administration of 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose in 39 patients with probable AD (aged 53-82 years 15 men, 24 women) and 40 subjects without AD (aged 21-78 yearsDiagnostic performance was superior with 3D SSP (Az[section]=0.94,Az[3D SSP]=0.99[Az=area under the ROC curve]P=.043). With 3D SSP, diagnosis of AD was equally good in beginners and experts. The sensitivity and specificity in questionable or mild dementia were 94% and 99% with 3D SSP and 79% and 88% with standard transaxial display.Accuracy of detecting AD was improved in PET with 3D SSP.
