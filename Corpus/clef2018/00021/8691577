Assessment of cardiac toxicity by 123I-MIBG myocardial SPECT in elderly non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with COP-BLAM and G-CSF. COP-BLAM chemotherapy with concomitant G-CSF was performed on patients 65 or older with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and cardiac sympathetic disorders due to the chemotherapeutic agents were studied using 123I-MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) myocardial SPECT (single photon emission CT). The results showed no correlation between the ejection fraction due to echocardiography and the total dose of adriamycin (ADR). However, there was a positive correlation between the total dose of ADR and the washout rate, and the possibility of cardiac sympathetic disorders caused by ADR was suggested.
