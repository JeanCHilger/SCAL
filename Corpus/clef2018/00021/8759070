Only hibernating myocardium invariably shows early recovery after coronary revascularization. The aims of this study were to identify hibernating myocardium (hypocontractile, hypoperfused viable myocardium that regains contractility after revascularization) in the clinical setting and to predict functional outcome in patients with coronary artery disease after coronary revascularization.Preoperative data related to the anterior free wall of the left ventricle were collected in 50 coronary bypass surgery candidates (positron emission tomography [PET], [13N]NH3 for flow, and [18F]FDG for metabolism [MET] equilibrium-gated nuclear angiography [EGNA] for regional ejection fraction [REF]Multivariate analysis identifies hibernating myocardium showing early postrevascularization recovery, as opposed to viable but myolytic myocardium with no early recovery. Postrevascularization recovery can be predicted (combination of low REF and high MET) by noninvasive techniques.
