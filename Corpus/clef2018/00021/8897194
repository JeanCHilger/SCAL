A microsporidian isolated from an AIDS patient corresponds to Encephalitozoon cuniculi III, originally isolated from domestic dogs. The ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of a recently cultured human Encephalitozoon cuniculi isolate was analyzed by gene amplification and DNA sequencing. Restriction endonuclease digestion (FokI) and double-stranded DNA heteroduplex mobility shift analysis were performed to determine their utility for strain differentiation. The human E. cuniculi isolate was identical to E. cuniculi III, which had been isolated only from domestic dogs until now. The patient providing the isolate owned a pet dog, but no microsporidia were detected in the pet's urine.
