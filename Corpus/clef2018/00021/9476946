Increased lung uptake of iodine-123-MIBG in diabetics with sympathetic nervous dysfunction. Scintigraphy with 123I-MIBG and 201TI was compared in patients with various diseases including diabetes mellitus, with and without sympathetic nervous dysfunction. This study was done to assess lung uptake of these tracers semiquantitatively.Thirty-eight patients with diabetes mellitus, seven patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), 12 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and eight healthy subjects were studied. Sympathetic nervous dysfunction was observed in 13 of the 38 diabetic patients. Simultaneous imaging with 123I-MIBG and 201TI was performed. The ratio of lung to total injected dose count and washout rate in the lung were calculated from dynamic images acquired in the initial 2 min and static images acquired at 15 min and at 4 hr after injection of the tracers.Lung uptake of 123I-MIBG at 4 hr was significantly increased in the diabetic group as compared with those in the other groups. In diabetic patients with sympathetic nervous dysfunction, the lung uptake ratio of 123I-MIBG at 4 hr was significantly higher than that in the diabetic patients without sympathetic nervous dysfunction, due to decreased clearance of 123I-MIBG from the lung. On the other hand, increased lung uptake of 201TI was observed in DCM patients at both 15 min and 4 hr. There was no significant difference between lung uptake of 201TI in diabetic patients and that in healthy subjects.Lung uptake of 123I-MIBG was increased and lung washout of 123I-MIBG was decreased in diabetic patients with sympathetic nervous dysfunction, while lung uptake of 201TI was not altered. lodine-123-MIBG scintigraphy of the lung may provide information on sympathetic nervous activity in diabetic patients. It is a promising method for studying the kinetics of norepinephrine in the lung because MIBG is taken up in the lung by the same mechanism as norepinephrine.
