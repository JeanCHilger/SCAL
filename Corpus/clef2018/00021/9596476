Domestic pets as risk factors for alveolar hydatid disease in Austria. To identify the risk of pet ownership (i.e., cats and dogs) for alveolar echinococcosis caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, the habits and activities of 21 patients (histologic confirmation or positive serology with corresponding evidence on an ultrasonogram, radiograph, or computed tomography scan) in Austria during the period 1967-1997 were compared with the habits and activities of 84 controls matched by sex, age, and residence. Cat ownership (odds ratio (OR) = 6.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54-27.29) and hunting (OR = 7.83, 95% CI 1.16-52.77) were independent risk factors associated with alveolar hydatid disease. The study is not in agreement with the hypothesis that eating mushrooms or certain wild berries which grow near the ground are the main risk factors for acquiring this disease. No other behavior patterns or activities studied were identified as risk factors.
