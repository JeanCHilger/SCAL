Ictal regional cerebral blood flow in frontal lobe seizures. 99mTC (single photon emission computed tomography) (HMPAO SPECT) was carried out during 16 frontal-lobe seizures in 15 patients. Focal changes in regional cerebral blood flow were seen during all seizures. In 9 of 16 seizures SPECT showed hyperperfusion localized to one frontal lobe. In 1 of 16 seizures ictal hypoperfusion was seen in one frontal lobe. In 2 of 16 seizures there was hyperperfusion in both frontal lobes, and in 4 of 16 seizures hyperperfusion involved the frontal lobe or lobes plus other lobes of the brain. These changes were accompanied by hyperperfusion of subcortical structures in 13 seizures. SPECT thus localized to one frontal lobe in 10 of 16 seizures, and localized to the frontal lobes without lateralizing in two further seizures. No seizure showed a pattern of perfusion similar to that reported in mesial-temporal-lobe seizures. We conclude that ictal SPECT may provide useful localizing information in frontal-lobe seizures.
