Neural correlates of depth of processing effects on recollection: evidence from brain potentials and positron emission tomography. The probability that words would be recollected during tests of recognition memory was varied by manipulating depth of processing at study. Experiment 1 employed scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs), and identified as a correlate of recollection a late (onset c. 500 ms), strongly left-lateralized positive-going modulation of the ERP waveform. The findings from experiment 2, which employed positron emission tomography (PET), indicated that recollection was associated with activation of the left hippocampal formation together with an extensive region of left temporal and frontal cortex. The findings support current ideas about the role of the hippocampal formation in episodic memory retrieval, and provide complementary information about the time course and localization of the cortical correlates of the recollection of recently experienced words.
