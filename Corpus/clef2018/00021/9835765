PET in neuroendocrine tumors. With the radionuclide tracers available today, 50-90 per cent of neuroendocrine tumours of the gastro-intestinal tract can be visualised with PET (positron-emission tomography). PET also enables the effect of tumour treatment to be monitored in terms of biochemical and functional variables, which is not possible with other radiological techniques. Owing to the very good tumour resolution possible with PET, it serves as a complement to other routine methods such as computed tomography and ultrasonography, and can be used to screen the chest and abdomen for small primary tumours that can not be detected with other methods. In several pre-operative trials PET has been shown to demonstrate more changes in the pancreas and liver than was possible with other methods. In the near future it will be possible to demonstrate the presence of and quantify growth factor receptors, hormones, enzymes, DNA synthesis, mRNA synthesis and protein synthesis. Access to these tumour biological data will be of crucial importance to the individualisation of treatment.
