Crossed cerebellar diaschisis: the role of motor and premotor areas in functional connections. The authors assessed the relationship between crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) and cortico-pontine cerebellar pathway (CPCP) damage in 29 chronic supratentorial infarct patients to elucidate the role of motor and premotor areas for functional cerebro-cerebellar connections. The CCD rate was calculated from side-to-side cerebellar count differences on 123I-IMP single-photon emission computerized tomography images. Neuronal damage was estimated by the three scores of computed tomography density from equal to normal brain tissue (score 0) to equal to cerebrospinal fluid (score 2) in the 4 major regions on CPCP frontal association, motor and premotor, sensory and parietal associations, and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Two-factor factorial ANOVA by the score and the region revealed significant differences of the CCD rate in the score factor (score 0 or 1 vs. score 2, p = < 0.05) and the independency of these two factors. Categories determined by the scores in each region were analyzed by multiple stepwise regression analysis using the theory of quantification I, in which significant correlation only between CCD and the necrotic density (score 2) in motor and premotor areas were demonstrated (r = 0.515, p = < 0.05). The authors conclude that neuronal loss in motor and premotor areas seem to contribute significantly to functional cerebro-cerebellar disconnections.
