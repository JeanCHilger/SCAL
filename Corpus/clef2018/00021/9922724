Clinical application of magnetoencephalography in a patient with corticobasal degeneration. Previous neuroimaging studies in corticobasal degeneration (CBD), such as MRI and positron emission tomography, showed lateralized cortical atrophy and a decrease in cortical oxygen metabolism, respectively. The advantage of magnetoencephalography in the research of the auditory system is that activity of both hemispheres can be detected separately. Auditory-evoked magnetic fields (AEFs) were then applied to a patient with corticobasal degeneration. The strength of N100m equivalent current dipoles (ECD) in left hemisphere was extremely smaller (20 nAm) than that in right hemisphere (48 nAm). This results implies that CBD patient might have a decrease in the number of neurons in the primary auditory cortex. This study suggests that AEF measurement is one of the most powerful tools for detecting latent impairment of auditory function in patients with corticobasal degeneration.
