Effect of olprinone, phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, on cerebral blood flow assessed with technetium-99m-ECD SPECT. Few clinical reports exist regarding the effects of phosphodiesterase III inhibitors on cerebral arteries. Therefore we used a [99mTc]-ECD brain SPECT and an ultrasound method to quantitatively evaluate cerebral and systemic flow dynamics after the administration of olprinone, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor. In 15 patients (65 +/- 8 years, M/F = 13/2) with no abnormalities on a brain computed tomography (CT), cerebral blood flow and cardiac output were measured using [99mTc]-ECD brain SPECT and Doppler echocardiography, respectively. Measurements were repeated at baseline and after the administration of olprinone. Significant increases in cerebral blood flow (p = 0.0007) and cardiac output (p = 0.001) were observed, and systolic blood pressure (p = 0.02) and systemic vascular resistance (p = 0.002) significantly decreased. No significant correlation between the increase in cerebral blood flow and the increase in cardiac output was observed. The data indicate that olprinone has a direct vasodilator effect on the cerebral artery, which was little related to the increase in cardiac output in patients who had not experienced stroke.
