Dopamine receptor-mediated regulation of striatal cholinergic activity: positron emission tomography studies with norchloro[18F]fluoroepibatidine. Large numbers of in vitro studies and microdialysis studies suggest that dopaminergic regulation of striatal acetylcholine (ACh) output is via inhibitory dopamine D2 receptors and stimulatory dopamine D1 receptors. Questions remain as to the relative predominance of dopamine D2 versus D1 receptor modulation of striatal ACh output under physiological conditions. Using positron emission tomography, we first demonstrate that norchloro[18F]fluoroepibatidine ([18F]NFEP), a selective nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR) ligand, was sensitive to changes of striatal ACh concentration. We then examined the effect of quinpirole (D2 agonist), raclopride (D2 antagonist), SKF38393 (D1 agonist), and SCH23390 (D1 antagonist) on striatal binding of [18F]NFEP in the baboon. Pretreatment with quinpirole increased the striatum (ST) to cerebellum (CB) ratio by 26+/-6%, whereas pretreatment with raclopride decreased the ST/CB ratio by 22+/-2%. The ratio of the distribution volume of [18F]NFEP in striatum to that in cerebellum, which corresponds to (Bmax/K(D)) + 1 (index for nAChR availability), also showed a significant increase (29 and 20% n = 2) and decrease (20+/-3%
