123I]IPCIT and [123I]beta-CIT as SPECT tracers for the dopamine transporter: a comparative analysis in nonhuman primate. [123I]2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane ([123I]-CIT) and its isopropylester analog [123I]PCIT, both of which are phenyltropane derivatives of cocaine with high affinity for the dopamine (DA) transporter, were compared using single photon emission computed tomography in nonhuman primates. Although IPCIT is significantly more selective for the DA transporter than beta-CIT, striatal distribution volumes of specifically bound tracer were similar for both tracers. Compartmental modeling results were compared with a simple peak equilibrium method used previously by this group. The peak equilibrium method is shown to overestimate striatal distribution volumes, primarily due to a difference in the calculated time of peak specific uptake.
