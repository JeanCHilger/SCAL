Demonstration of [11C] 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan uptake and decarboxylation in carcinoid tumors by specific positioning labeling in positron emission tomography. In three patients with carcinoid liver and/or lymph node metastases, we studied the process of tumor tracer uptake and decarboxylation by means of positron emission tomography (PET) using 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP) 11C-labeled in the beta-position (HTP) and later the same day with 5-HTP 11C-labeled in the carboxyl group (HTC). With HTP, in which the 11C-label follows the molecule through decarboxylation to form 11C-serotonin, a high tumor accumulation of the tracer was found. With HTC, in which the label is rapidly eliminated from the tissues as 11CO2 if decarboxylation takes place, there was virtually no uptake by the tumors. By utilizing data from PET scanning with both tracers, we could quantify the decarboxylation rate and tissue accumulation of [11C]-serotonin and hence the enzymatic action of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase.
