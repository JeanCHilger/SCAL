Tc99m-sestamibi SPECT and head and neck tumors: preliminary data. After underlining recent progress in nuclear medicine diagnostics, even in oncology, the authors describe the most important methods used and oncotropic capacity of some radiodrugs currently used in clinical practice: i.e. perfusion tracers. Then they present the results of a personal experience using Tc99m-SestaMIBI SPET in detail. Fifteen patients suffering from various primary head and neck neoplasms underwent systematic clinical evaluation, endoscopy, CT and/or MRI and Tc99m-SestaMIBI SPET. The authors then briefly describe the method and underline the fact that the literature lacks any homogeneous data on the use of Tc99m-SestaMIBI SPET in the study of head and neck neoplasms. The results indicate that the method is reliable in identifying both primary tumors and laterocervical metastases. Then, taking indication from the only case currently available on post-radiotherapy recurrence, the authors suggest an interesting field of application for this technique: the study of post-radio-chemotherapy and/or surgery recurrences. In conclusion, the authors underline the valid contribution this method currently offers both in diagnosis and follow-up as well as its future of ever expanding clinical applications.
