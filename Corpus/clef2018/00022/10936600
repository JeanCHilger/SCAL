Acute partial paralysis alters perceptions of air hunger, work and effort at constant P(CO(2)) and V(E). Breathing sensations of AIR HUNGER, WORK and EFFORT may depend on projections of central motor discharge (corollary discharge) to the forebrain. Source of motor drive (brainstem or cortex) may determine what is perceived. To test the effect of changing motor discharge at constant ventilation, we induced partial neuromuscular blockade during hypercapnic hyperpnea (31 + or - 9 L min(-1) PET(CO(2))=49 + or - 2 Torr) and during matched volitional hyperpnea (34 + or - 5 L min(-1)
