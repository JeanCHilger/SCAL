High-level expression and single-step purification of human tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase. Human trpS gene was cloned into the expression vector pET-24a(+) to yield pET-24a(+)-HTrpRS, which could direct the synthesis of a mammalian derived protein in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL. The vector allows overproduction and single-step purification of His(6)-tagged human tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase by the facilitation of metal (Ni(2+)) chelate affinity chromatography. The expression level of human TrpRS was about 40% of total cell proteins after isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside induction. The overproduced human TrpRS-His(6) could be purified to homogeneity within 2 h and about 24 mg purified enzyme could be obtained from 400 ml cell culture. The His(6) tag at C terminus had little effect on the binding ability of its substrates.
