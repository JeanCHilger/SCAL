A new reverse PET chemosensor and its chelatoselective aromatic cadmiation. [reaction: see text]. A new fluorescent chemosensor, anthryl tetra acid, was synthesized and showed large fluorescence quenching effects in 100% aqueous solution with metal ions via photoinduced electron transfer (PET). Chelatoselective fluorescence perturbation was observed with Cd(II) and resulted from electrophilic aromatic cadmiation.
