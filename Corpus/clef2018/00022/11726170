Behavior of aeromonas hydrophila in bottled mineral waters. The growth and survival of Aeromonas hydrophila in three types of natural mineral waters were investigated. Mineral waters with different levels of mineral content (low, medium, and high) were experimentally contaminated with A. hydrophila, stored at different temperatures (10 degrees C and 20 degrees C), and analyzed at intervals over a 60-day period. Water samples that were not experimentally contaminated were investigated for indigenous A. hydrophila. The results confirmed that A. hydrophila may occur naturally in mineral waters and showed that the level of mineral content, temperature, length of storage, and, in some cases, the type of container used may favor the growth of A. hydrophila. The greatest proliferation was observed in water with a low mineral content stored in PET bottles at 10 degrees C, in which A. hydrophila peaked at day 28 (4.47 +/- 0.01 log CFU/100 ml). At 20 degrees C, the same load was observed at day 60. The presence of high densities of A. hydrophila in bottled mineral water can constitute a risk for some groups of consumers, such as elderly and immunocompromised persons.
