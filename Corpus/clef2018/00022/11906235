Increased FDG uptake in the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex in congenital hemiplegia. The resting brain metabolism was estimated in six children suffering from a right congenital hemiplegia (CH) of subcortical origin. This estimate was based on the 18F-labeled 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) uptake measured by means of positron emission tomography and compared, using statistical parametric mapping (SPM99), with that of six control subjects. The contrast [CH children - Controls] showed that CH children had two loci of relatively higher FDG uptake. The larger voxel cluster was found in the ipsilesional hemisphere and comprised the primary motor and somatosensory cortices and left inferior parietal lobule. The other cluster was located in the contralesional hemisphere and encompassed the primary motor cortex, callosomarginal sulcus, and cingulate gyrus. The reverse contrast [Controls - CH children] showed that control subjects had a relatively higher FDG uptake bilaterally in the temporal and hippocampal gyri, the rostral part of the brain stem, the thalami, the putamen, and the superior frontal gyri. A crossed cerebellar diaschisis was not observed in CH children. This relatively higher FDG uptake in the ipsi- and contralesional motor areas of CH children stands out in contrast to the hypometabolism (diaschisis) frequently observed in adult stroke patients with a subcortical lesion. This increased FDG uptake in the disconnected ipsilesional motor areas may reflect a long-term adaptation leading, for example, to an increased synaptic density and/or activity or to a change in the density of glucose transporters.
