Chest pain unit management of patients at low and not low-risk for coronary artery disease in the emergency department. A 5-year experience in the Florence area. In this study, we screened a total of 6723 consecutive patients with chest pain and ECG non-diagnostic for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) on presentation to the emergency department (ED). The aim of the study was to avoid missed AMI, improve safe early discharge and reduce inappropriate coronary care unit (CCU) admission. Chest pain patients were triaged using a clinical chest pain score and managed in a chest pain unit (CPU). Patients with a low clinical chest pain score were considered at very 'low-risk' for cardiovascular events and discharged from the ED patients with a high chest pain score were submitted to CPU management. Observation and titration of serum markers of myocardial injury were obtained up to 6 hours. Rest or stress myocardial scintigraphy (SPECT) was performed in patients > 40 years or with > or = 2 major coronary risk factors. Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) or Stress-Echocardiogram (stress-Echo) were performed in younger patients or with < 2 coronary risk factor, or unable to exercise, respectively We discharged directly from the ED the majority of patients (4454
