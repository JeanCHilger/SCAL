Clinical application of positron emission tomography (PET). Functional imaging using PET (positron emission tomography) has a great impact on current medical practice. It allows to explore, in a very precise way, different processes such as tissue flow and metabolism. Fluor-deoxyglucose labeled with F18 fluorine represents glucose metabolism. Among its main applications are detection, staging, follow up and recurrence assessment of malignant tumors myocardial viability detection in patients with myocardial infarction or ischemic cardiomyopathy, and evaluation of hyperactive epileptogenic foci in brain. The basis and clinical applications of PET tomography are reviewed especially oriented to its cost benefit relationship, change in patient management and diagnostic value of the most accepted oncological indications. Important economic resources may be saved with PET in this field, considering appropriate staging and recurrence detection, avoiding expensive therapeutic approaches in advanced disease.
