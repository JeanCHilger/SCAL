Effect of repeated peritonitis on peritoneal membrane function in children on chronic peritoneal dialysis. Chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) is the most commonly used method of pediatric dialysis. The preservation of peritoneal membrane function is essential for successful peritoneal dialysis. Two main factors are responsible for long-term loss of membrane function. Peritonitis, the major complication of CAPD, can be life-threatening and lead to more rapid failure of the technique. The other factor is continuous exposure of peritoneal membrane to bioincompatible dialysis solutions. To investigate the role of repeated peritonitis on peritoneal membrane function, we performed a retrospective study to elucidate the association between peritonitis episodes and peritoneal membrane solute transport characteristics.From 1996-2000, 32 pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients were included in this study. According to the peritonitis occurrence frequency, 8 patients were divided into HPO group (peritonitis occurrence rate > or = 5 times/year), and 24 patients were divided into LPO group (peritonitis occurrence rate < or = 1 time/year). The mean age of study patients was 13.95 +/- 5.27 years. The peritoneal equilibration test was performed to evaluate the peritoneal membrane dialyzing function.The mean duration of peritoneal dialysis was 3.31 +/- 1.08 years. The change of peritoneal solute transport (AD/P), computed by subtraction of 4-hour D/P at baseline PET study from that at the last follow-up PET study, showed significant difference (p < 0.05) between HPO (-0.234 + 0.074) and LPO (-0.040 +/- 0.079) groups of children. There was also a significant correlation between repeated peritonitis occurrence and PET deterioration(p < 0.05). The relative risk was 2.63.Children with frequent peritonitis occurrence have significant decreasing peritoneal solute transport and decreasing PET scaling in follow-up period.
