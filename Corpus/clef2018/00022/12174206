Assessment of myocardial viability with myocardial contrast echocardiography. The application of noninvasive imaging techniques to assess myocardial viability has become an important part of routine management of patients with acute myocardial infarction and chronic coronary artery disease. Information regarding the presence and extent of viability may help identify patients likely to benefit from revascularization or therapy directed at attenuating left ventricular remodeling. Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) is capable of defining the presence and extent of viability by providing an accurate assessment of microvascular integrity needed to maintain myocellular viability. It is especially suited for the spatial assessment of perfusion, even when myocardial blood flow is reduced substantially in the presence of severe epicardial stenoses or in a bed dependent on collateral perfusion. The routine use of MCE to evaluate viability in patients with acute and chronic coronary artery disease is now feasible with the advent of new imaging technologies and microbubble agents capable of myocardial opacification from venous injections. The utility of this technique for determining treatment strategies has not been established but is forthcoming.
