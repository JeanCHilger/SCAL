Dichlorogallane (HGaCl(2))(2): its molecular structure and synthetic potential. Dichlorogallane (HGaCl(2))(2) is readily prepared from gallium trichloride and triethylsilane in quantitative yield. Its crystal structure has been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. In the chlorine-bridged dimers of crystallographically imposed C(2h) symmetry, the terminal hydrogen atoms are in trans positions. In the reaction with 2 equiv of triethylphosphine, the mononuclear complex (Et(3)P)GaHCl(2) is formed. Thermal decomposition of (HGaCl(2))(2) affords hydrogen gas and quantitative yields of "GaCl(2)" as mixed-valent Ga[GaCl(4)]. Treatment of this product with triethylphosphine gives the symmetrical, Ga-Ga-bonded gallium(II) complex [GaCl(2)(PEt(3))](2) with an ethane-type structure and with the phosphine ligands in a single-trans conformation. The corresponding [GaBr(2)(PEt(3))](2) complex is prepared from Ga[GaBr(4)] and has an analogous structure. (Et(3)P)GaCl(3) has been synthesized and structurally characterized as a reference compound.
