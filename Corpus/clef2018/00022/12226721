Identification and heterologous expression of the cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase from the white-rot basidiomycete Coriolus versicolor. A cDNA encoding cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR) from the lignin-degrading basidiomycete Coriolus versicolor was identified using RT-PCR. The full-length cDNA consisted of 2,484 nucleotides with a poly(A) tail, and contained an open reading frame. The G+C content of the cDNA isolated was 60%. A deduced protein contained 730 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 80.7 kDa. The conserved amino acid residues involved in functional domains such as FAD-, FMN-, and NADPH-binding domains, were all found in the deduced protein. A phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that C. versicolor CPR is significantly similar to CPR of the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium and that they share the same major branch in the fungal cluster. A recombinant CPR protein was expressed using a pET/ Escherichia coli system. The recombinant CPR protein migrated at 81 kDa on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It exhibited an NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reducing activity.
