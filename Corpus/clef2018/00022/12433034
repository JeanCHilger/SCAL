Production and dosimetry of [14O]water for PET activation studies. [14O]water was produced by the 14N(p,n)14O reaction in quantities greater than 80mCi (EOB). The carbon-11 impurity in the final product was approximately 0.003 +/- 0.002% of 14O activity at EOB. A factor of 0.5 +/- 0.02 was obtained to correct the dose calibrator for the additional 2.313 MeV gamma-ray. The effective dose equivalent was calculated for 14O and 15O using MIRDOSE, and the 14O dose was found to be approximately 70% of that for 15O. For scanner performance based on noise equivalent count measurements, the peak activity concentration for 14O was 30% lower than that for 15O. At their peak activity concentrations the noise equivalent count rate for 14O was found to be about 13% less than that for 15O.
