Concordant pre- and postsynaptic deficits of dopaminergic neurotransmission in neurologic Wilson disease. Although previous brain imaging studies of Wilson disease (WD) focused on the dopaminergic system, correlational data on the integrity of the pre- and postsynaptic compartments are lacking. The present study was initiated to intra-individually determine the integrity of these compartments in patients with WD.A total of 46 patients with WD and 10 matched control subjects underwent [(123)I]2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4[(123)I]iodophenyl)tropane ([(123)I]beta-CIT) and [(123)I]iodobenzamide ([(123)I]IBZM) single photon emission CT (SPECT). For both radiotracers, specific striatal binding ratios (with the cerebellum as the reference region) were calculated after a standardized region-of-interest technique was applied. In addition, the severity of putative neurologic symptoms was evaluated by using a linear scoring system.In patients without neurologic symptoms, striatal binding ratios of both radiotracers did not differ from those of the control group (13.8 +/- 3.1 vs 12.0 +/- 3.4 and 2.00 +/- 0.19 vs 1.90 +/- 0.27 n.s.). In symptomatic patients, however, striatal binding ratios for both [(123)I]beta-CIT and [(123)I]IBZM were significantly reduced (9.1 +/- 2.3 and 1.64 +/- 0.18These findings of a concordant bicompartmental dopaminergic deficit in neurologic WD provide in vivo evidence for assigning WD to the group of secondary Parkinsonian syndromes. These results could be relevant in therapeutic decision making in patients with this copper deposition disorder.
