Effect of a dental chew on dental substrates and gingivitis in cats. The use of special diets or dietary adjuncts, although not eliminating the need for regular professional therapy, may serve to improve gingival health during the interval between professional oral health assessments and intervention. This study was performed to determine the effect of a dental chew on dental hygiene and gingival health in cats. The accumulation of dental substrates and the development of gingivitis were assessed in cats fed either a dry diet only or a dry diet supplemented with dental chews. A two-period, crossover design was used with the test phase lasting 4-weeks. Results indicated that the daily addition of dental chews to a dry diet was effective in reducing plaque and calculus accumulation on tooth surfaces in cats, as well as reducing the severity of gingivitis.
