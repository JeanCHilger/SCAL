Value of new isotopes in cardiology. Nuclear Cardiology has seen many advances in the past few years: new indications for tracers already known, but also the appearance of new markers, by single photon imaging or by position emission (PET). With regard to the investigation of myocardial perfusion, thallium remains the most widely used isotope. Its sensitivity in the diagnosis of coronary disease is improved by the use of scintigraphic CT scan (SPECT) and excellent predictive value in terms of the onset of coronary events or mortality has been confirmed in particular. At the same time, the sensitivity and specificity of new technetium markers have been better defined. The investigation of myocardial metabolism, accessible up to now only via PET and confined, in France, to the domain of clinical research, is in the process of becoming a tool suitable for use by clinicians as a result of new SPECT-Thallium protocols (reinjection, late redistribution and rest), but also because of the development of single photon markers of myocardial viability, e.g. iodinated fatty acids. A functional approach to coronary disease, indispensable adjuvant to the anatomical approach, is now possible on a routine basis.
