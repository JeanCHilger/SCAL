In-vivo SPECT imaging of D2 receptor with iodine-iodolisuride: results in supranuclear palsy. We assessed the potential use of [123I]iodolisuride (ILIS), a new iodine ergolene derivative, to study human striatal D2 dopamine receptors with SPECT. In normal subjects, we found that the tracer accumulated preferentially in striatum. This was prevented by high doses of haloperidol. The striatal accumulation was maximal between 60 and 180 min after injection. The striatum-to-cerebellum radioactivity concentration ratio as an index of specific binding, measured 60 min after injection, was 1.52 +/- 0.19 (mean +/- s.d.) in controls and 1.36 +/- 0.11 in patients with supranuclear palsy (p less than 0.03). Our results show that ILIS may be used to study D2 receptors with SPECT. In-vivo changes of D2 receptors in human brain may be detected with this method.
