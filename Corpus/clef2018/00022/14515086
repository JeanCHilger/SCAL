Mechanisms of cancer invasion of the mandible. There is little evidence that the tumor enters the mandible preferentially through the occlusal surface, the periodontal membrane, or named foramina. Tumor enters the mandible at the point of contact, which is often at the junction of the attached and reflected mucosa, which lies below the crest of the ridge in all but grossly resorbed mandibles. Angulation of the bone cut in rim or marginal resection of the mandible is advised. The erosive pattern of disease is associated with shallow mandibular invasion and smaller tumors in the soft tissue. This finding supports the principle of marginal resection in such cases. There is little evidence to support the principle that the tumor spreads preferentially along the inferior alveolar nerve or the bone marrow. The inclusion of the neurovascular bundle in marginal resections of the mandible is not necessary. Preoperative assessment should include plain radiography combined with a sensitive scan (bone scintigraphy, single photon emission computerized tomography, or MRI) and inspection of the bone surface after periosteal stripping at the time of the resection.
