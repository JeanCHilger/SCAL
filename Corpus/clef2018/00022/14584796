A new access to polyhydroxy piperidines of the azasugar class: synthesis and glycosidase inhibition studies. A new synthetic strategy has been devised to access a variety of polyhydroxylated piperidines belonging to the azasugar class of glycosidase inhibitors. The key precursor (3aR, 7aR)-5-benzyl-2,2-dimethyl-7-methylenehexahydro[1,3]dioxo[4,5-c]pyridine is obtained by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) cyclization of the corresponding alpha-trimethylsilylmethylamine radical cation to the tethered acetylene functionality. The new molecules have been evaluated for inhibitory properties for certain beta-glycosidases and have been found to be moderate to weak inhibitors of the enzymes under study.
