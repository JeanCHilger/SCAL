Measuring the rate of progression of Parkinson's disease over a 5-year period with beta-CIT SPECT. Recent imaging studies suggest a rapid degeneration of the dopaminergic system in early Parkinson's disease (PD), followed by a slowing of the degenerative process in advanced disease. In the present study, a group of early-stage PD patients underwent three sequential [123I]beta-CIT SPECT studies to assess the decline of striatal dopamine transporter binding over a 5-year period. Twenty-one of a cohort of 24 early PD patients who participated in an earlier longitudinal beta-CIT SPECT imaging study [Mov Disord 200217:45-53] were included. Scan intervals were 26 +/- 11 months (scan 1-2) and 38 +/- 15 months (scan 2-3), respectively. The relative annual rate of decline of striatal beta-CIT binding from age-expected normal values at the time of Scan 1 was used as primary outcome variable. The relative annual decline of striatal binding from Scan 1 to Scan 2 (4.5 +/- 4.6%) and from Scan 2 to Scan 3 (3.0 +/- 3.0%) was not significantly different. The non-significant difference in progression rate was due mainly to the rapid early decline of striatal binding in 1 patient who subsequently developed a severe dysexecutive dementia syndrome. These data are not suggestive of substantial change in the course of dopaminergic degeneration in PD within the first 5 to 7 years after symptom onset.
