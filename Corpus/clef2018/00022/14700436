Environmental exposure reduction in high-risk newborns: where do we start? When analyzing the effect of environmental exposure reduction measures on asthma in high-risk children, one must know how far asthmatic families already have applied such measures, because this would affect the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions aimed at reducing environmental exposure.To describe the room for improvement by asthmatic families in mite, pet, and food allergen reducing measures and in parental passive smoking and to determine the resulting levels of mite and pet allergens by the applied sanitation measures.Data were sampled by observation, weekly diary entries, and questionnaire when the infant was 6 months old and 1 year old. Dust samples were collected by vacuuming the living room floor and the parental and infant mattresses. Multiple logistic regression analyses were applied with the use of mattress encasing, having a smooth floor covering, having pets, exclusive breast-feeding and/or hypoallergenic formula during the infant's first 6 months, and passive smoking as the dependent variables.Frequencies of applied measures were as follows: having a smooth floor covering, 36% daily house cleaning, 27%There is (still) enough room for improvement to reduce exposure to inhalant and food allergens, especially by application of mattress encasings, exclusive breast-feeding and/or hypoallergenic formula feeding, and postponing the time until first solids are given.
