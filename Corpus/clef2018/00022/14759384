Comparison of the predictive value of exercise-induced ST depression versus exercise technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging for detection of coronary artery disease in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Scant knowledge exists regarding the significance of either additional ST depression in the presence of baseline depression or new stress-induced ST depression in patients with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Accordingly, the purpose of this investigation is to determine whether the appearance and/or severity of ST abnormalities during exercise stress testing can accurately predict the prevalence of ischemic burden as measured by quantitative technetium-99m-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging in patients with LV hypertrophy. The results show that the presence of exercise ST-segment depression, as well as its magnitude, are not accurate predictors for identifying patients with coronary artery disease in the presence of electrocardiographic criteria for LV hypertrophy.
