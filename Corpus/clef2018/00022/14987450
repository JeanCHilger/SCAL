Sensing limb movements in the motor cortex: how humans sense limb movement. We can precisely control only what we can sense. Sensing limb position or limb movement is essential when we precisely control our limb movements. It has been generally believed that somatic perception takes place in the neuronal network of somatosensory areas. Recent neuroimaging techniques (PET, fMRI, transcranial magnetic stimulation) have revealed in human brains that motor areas participate in somatic perception of limb movements during kinesthetic illusion in the absence of actual limb movement. In particular, the primary motor cortex, which is an executive locus of voluntary limb movements, is primarily responsible for kinesthetic perception of limb movements. This probably forms the most efficient circuits for voluntary limb movements between the controlled muscles and the motor areas.
