Transoesophageal atrial pacing stress echocardiography in coronary artery disease: role, principles and methodology. This article reviews the physiology and methodology of transoesophageal atrial pacing stress echocardiography (TAPSE) and clarifies its place among the other stress modalities. TAPSE correlates well with myocardial perfusion stress scintigraphy and coronary angiography and is a simple and safe diagnostic option for patients with suspected or known CAD, including those with recent myocardial infarction. Furthermore, the results of TAPSE have prognostic significance in patients with uncomplicated MI. Although, it is a highly feasible and safe technique, the cardiologist should be directly involved in the procedure and the personnel must be well trained in a large number of tests, as for any other stress echocardiographic modalities.
