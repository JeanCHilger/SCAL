Magnetoencephalography in cognitive disorders involving frontal lobes. Frontal lobe, more specifically prefrontal cortex, is one of the brain regions that undergoes more protracted ongoing development. The wider the developmental window of one brain structure, the more vulnerable the functions related to it. Hence, executive functions, which are mediated by prefrontal networks, seems to be specially vulnerable during childhood. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders. Functional neuroimaging techniques have shown a dysfunction in a fronto-striatal network in this disorder, that is likely subserving deficits in executive processes, such as in response inhibition.This review focuses on contributions of neuroimaging techniques, with high spatial (SPECT, PET and fMRI), temporal (ERP) and spatio-temporal (MEG) resolution, to the neurofunctionality of ADHD.
