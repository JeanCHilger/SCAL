Receptor imaging in the thorax with PET. This review focuses on positron emission tomography (PET)-imaging of receptors in the sympathetic and the parasympathetic systems of heart and lung and highlights the human applications of PET. For the alpha-adrenoceptor, only [11C]GB67 (N2-[6-[(4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-quinazolinyl)(methyl)amino]hexyl]-N2-[11C]methyl-2-furamide hydrochloride) has been developed. Its potential for application in patients needs to be assessed. For both the beta-adrenergic and the muscarinic systems, potent PET radioligands have been prepared and evaluated in patients. It has been possible to measure receptor densities quantitatively in human heart [[11C]MQNB: [11C]methylquinuclidinyl benzilate, [11C]CGP12177: S-(3'-t-butylamino-2'-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazol-2-[11C]one and [11C]CGP12388: (S)-4-(3-(2'-[11C]isopropylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy)-2H-benzimidazol-2-one] and qualitatively in lung [[11C]VC002: N-[11C]-methyl-piperidin-4-yl-2-cyclohexyl-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetate and [11C]CGP12177]. Besides these subtype nonselective radioligands, the development of compounds that are selective for one subtype are ongoing and have not found successful application in humans yet.
