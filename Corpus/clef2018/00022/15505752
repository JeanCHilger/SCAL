Assessment of disease progression in parkinsonism. In this brief article, we report preliminary results from an NIH-funded project to use functional brain imaging to study the natural history of neurodegeneration during the earliest clinical stages of PD. We used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure DAT binding (18F-FPCIT), resting glucose metabolism (18FFDG), and brain activation (H215O) responses in 20 newly diagnosed PD patients. The longitudinal study is being conducted at three time points for each measurement during a 5-year period. The interim results indicate the evolution of abnormal metabolic brain networks and activation responses occurring in parallel with presynaptic nigrostriatal dopamine dysfunction in early PD.
