Application of RT-PCR for the detection of avian reovirus contamination in avian viral vaccines. An efficient procedure for the detection of avian reovirus (ARV)-specific RNA sequences in veterinary immunological medicinal products using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is described. Four ARV vaccine strains (1133, 1733, 2408 and Olson WVU2937), two ATCC strains (VR826 and VR856) as well as several ARV field isolates obtained from domestic, wild and pet birds could be easily detected with S2- and S4-specific primers. The identity of the amplified fragments was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis and sequence analysis. Furthermore, not only the starting substrates used for the production of a vaccine, but also additives and the manufacturing process (matrix effects) can influence the results. These RT-PCRs have been useful for screening poultry vaccines for extraneous ARV in the quality control of biologicals used in veterinary medicine.
