Adenosine A1 receptor mapping of the human brain by PET with 8-dicyclopropylmethyl-1-11C-methyl-3-propylxanthine. Adenosine is an endogenous modulator of synaptic functions in the central nervous system. To investigate the physiologic and pathologic roles of the adenosine receptors in the human brain, PET is a powerful in vivo technique. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated the distribution of a major subtype A(1) adenosine receptor in the human brain by PET with a newly developed radioligand, 8-dicyclopropylmethyl-1-(11)C-methyl-3-propylxanthine ((11)C-MPDX).In 5 healthy volunteers, after PET measurement of the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with (15)O-H(2)O, a 60-min PET scan with (11)C-MPDX was performed. The distribution volume (DV) of (11)C-MPDX was quantitatively evaluated by Logan's graphical analysis.(11)C-MPDX was taken up at a high level, reaching a peak at 2-2.5 min, followed by a rapid decrease. The unchanged form of (11)C-MPDX in plasma was 75% at 60 min after injection. The DV of (11)C-MPDX was large in the striatum and thalamus, moderate in the cerebral cortices and pons, and small in the cerebellum. The distribution pattern of (11)C-MPDX in the brain was coincident with that of adenosine A(1) receptors in vitro, reported previously, but discretely different from that of rCBF.(11)C-MPDX PET has the potential for mapping adenosine A(1) receptors in the human brain.
