An analysis of the 18F-FDG uptake pattern in the stomach. The concentration of (18)F-FDG in the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) and gastric antrum (GA) varies significantly from patient to patient. To document the reference range of uptake in patients, we reviewed the (18)F-FDG PET scans of patients with no documented gastroesophageal disease.The medical records of patients undergoing PET/CT were reviewed. Patients with known gastric, pancreatic, or liver pathology were excluded. The peak standardized uptake value (SUV) for the GEJ and GA were measured in the remaining patients. The clinical record was also reviewed for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and previous chemotherapy.A total of 763 patients met the inclusion criteria (388 male and 375 female mean age +/- SD, 57.4 +/- 17 yIn patients without a specific history of esophagogastric disease, a gastroesophageal maximum SUV less than 4 is usually not associated with gastroesophageal neoplasia.
