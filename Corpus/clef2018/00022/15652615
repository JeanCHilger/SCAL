A stimulation method using odors suitable for PET and fMRI studies with recording of physiological and behavioral signals. A design for a semi-automatic olfactometric system is described for PET and fMRI experiments. The olfactometer presents several advantages because it enables the use of an 'infinite' number of odorants and the synchronization of stimuli with breathing. These advantages mean that the subject is recorded while breathing normally during olfactory judgment tasks. In addition, the design includes a system for recording the behavioral (rating scale) and physiological (breathing, electrodermal reaction (ED), plethysmography (PL)) signals given by the subject. Both systems present the advantage of being compatible with fMRI magnetic fields since no ferrous material is used in the Faraday cage and signals are transmitted via an optical transmission interface to an acquisition system.
