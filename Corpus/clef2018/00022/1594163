MAb 170H.82: an evaluation of a novel panadenocarcinoma monoclonal antibody labelled with 99Tcm and with 111In. A novel method for generating monoclonal antibodies against synthetic tumour-associated glycoconjugates has been developed. One of these monoclonal antibodies, designated 170H.82, was derived against the TF antigen and has been shown in vitro to have a wide range of reactivity with adenocarcinoma. This antibody has been labelled with 111In and 99Tcm and has been evaluated in pilot clinical trials involving 48 patients with a range of adenocarcinoma. Overall clinical accuracy with the radiolabelled antibody was 92%, with the antibody appearing to have particular clinical utility in gynaecological and breast cancers. Single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging was shown to improve the quality of the images and to improve the diagnostic sensitivity. We believe that this unique antibody, labelled with 99Tcm, appears to offer promise for routine clinical use in the evaluation of patients with a range of primary and metastatic adenocarcinoma.
