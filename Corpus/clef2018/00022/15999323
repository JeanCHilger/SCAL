Pharmacoresistant temporal-lobe epilepsy. Exploration with foramen ovale electrodes and surgical outcomes. To report our experience in the surgical treatment of temporal-lobe epilepsy.An analysis was performed of the outcomes of 137 patients submitted to surgery between 1990 and 2001, with a follow-up of more than two years. A study was conducted of the percentages of successful detection by the different complementary tests--MRI, EEG, interictal SPECT, video-EEG with foramen ovale electrodes (FOE), neuropsychological study (NPS)--and the precision with which they reported the epileptogenic focus.Successful surgical outcomes (Engel grades I-II): 73.4%. No surgical mortality occurred, although some mild, reversible morbidity was observed. Surgical outcomes were not affected by sex, age, age of onset and the length of time the patient had had the disease, or the frequency of the seizures. No association was found between seizures in the immediate post-operative period and a poorer long term control of the epilepsy. MR images were normal in 25% of patients in these cases the surgical outcomes (Engel grades I-II at two years: 62%) were significantly poorer than in cases of tumours/cavernomas (86%)
