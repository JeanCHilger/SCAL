Prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy by sequential F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate sequential F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to predict patient outcome after the first and third cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced-stage (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages IIIC and IV) ovarian cancer.Thirty-three patients received three cycles of carboplatin-based chemotherapy, followed by cytoreductive surgery. Quantitative FDG-PET of the abdomen and pelvis was acquired before treatment and after the first and third cycle of chemotherapy. Changes in tumoral FDG uptake, expressed as standardized uptake values (SUV), were compared with clinical and histopathologic response overall survival served as a reference.A significant correlation was observed between FDG-PET metabolic response after the first (P = .008) and third (P = .005) cycle of chemotherapy and overall survival. By using a threshold for decrease in SUV from baseline of 20% after the first cycle, median overall survival was 38.3 months in metabolic responders compared with 23.1 months in metabolic nonresponders. At a threshold of 55% decrease in SUV after the third cycle median overall survival was 38.9 months in metabolic responders compared with 19.7 months in nonresponders. There was no correlation between clinical response criteria (P = .7) or CA125 response criteria (P = .5) and overall survival. There was only a weak correlation (P = .09) between histopathologic response criteria and overall survival.Sequential FDG-PET predicted patient outcome as early as after the first cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and was more accurate than clinical or histopathologic response criteria including changes in tumor marker CA125. FDG-PET appears to be a promising tool for early prediction of response to chemotherapy.
