Quantification of subendocardial and subepicardial blood flow using 15O-labeled water and PET: experimental validation. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and accuracy of quantifying subendocardial and subepicardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) and the relative coronary flow reserves (CFR) using (15)O-labeled water (H(2)(15)O) and 3-dimensional-only PET.Eight pigs were scanned with H(2)(15)O and (15)O-labeled carbon monoxide (C(15)O) after partially occluding the circumflex (n = 3) or the left anterior descending (n = 5) coronary artery, both at rest and during hyperemia induced by intravenous dipyridamole. Radioactive microspheres were injected during each of the H(2)(15)O scans.In a total of 256 paired measurements of MBF, ranging from 0.30 to 4.46 mL.g(-1).min(-1), microsphere and PET MBF were fairly well correlated. The mean difference between the 2 methods was -0.01 +/- 0.52 mL.g(-1).min(-1) with 95% of the differences lying between the limits of agreement of -1.02 and 1.01 mL.g(-1).min(-1). CFR was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) in the ischemic subendocardium (PET = 1.12 +/- 0.45 microspheres = 1.09 +/- 0.50Dynamic measurements using H(2)(15)O and a 3-dimensional-only PET tomograph allow regional estimates of the transmural distribution of MBF over a wide flow range, although transmural flow differences were underestimated because of the partial-volume effect. PET subendocardial and subepicardial CFR were in good agreement with the microsphere values.
