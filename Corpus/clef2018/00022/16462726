Does 18F-FDG PET/CT play a role in the differential diagnosis of parotid masses. The aim of the present study was to assess the accuracy of an hybrid PET/CT scanner in the evaluation of newly diagnosed parotid masses, comparing the results with those reported in the literature with using PET scanners only.The potential role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in distinguishing benign from malignant parotid masses in 14 consecutive patients was investigated. All patients were preoperatively evaluated by means of ultrasound (US), US-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology, computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18F-FDG PET/CT. For To interpreting FDG PET findings, the right to left parotid (R/L) SUV max ratio was calculated in a group of 54 patients without evidence of parotideal disease (mean+/-SD = 1+/-0.2 range = 0.8-1.2)Imaging data were compared with surgical and histopathological findings. At FDG PET/CT, 9 false positive cases were found (8 Warthin's tumours, 1 pleomorphic adenoma), 1 false negative (acinar cell carcinoma), 4 true negative (1 Warthin's tumour, 1 pleomorphic adenoma, 1 lymph epithelial cyst, 1 parotid inflammation) whereas there was no case of true positive. The global accuracy of FGD PET/CT was rather low = at 29%.In agreement with other preliminary reports in which the FDG PET without CT fusion imaging was used, in our experience 18F-FDG PET/CT did not prove to play a significant role in differential diagnosis (benign vs malignant) of parotid masses. Further studies collecting larger groups of patients are needed to further elucidate this observation.
