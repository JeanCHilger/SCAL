Brief report: respiratory illness associated with boot sealant products--five states, 2005-2006. During February 2005-February 2006, six regional poison control centers in five states were consulted regarding 172 human and 19 animal (i.e., pet cat or dog) exposures to shoe or boot leather protection or sealant products resulting in respiratory illness. One product was associated with 126 cases of human illness and another product with seven cases. An ongoing investigation, begun in December 2005, is being conducted by the poison centers. The majority of cases occurred in Michigan, where poison control centers are collaborating with the Michigan Department of Community Health to further document exposures and adverse health effects from the products. Results of the investigation of the 150 cases reported during 2005 underscore the continuing need to assess the magnitude of the problem, evaluate the toxic etiology of the products involved, and determine how to prevent further cases of illness resulting from use of the products.
