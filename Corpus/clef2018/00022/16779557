O-[18F]fluoromethyl-L-tyrosine is a potential tracer for monitoring tumour response to chemotherapy using PET: an initial comparative in vivo study with deoxyglucose and thymidine. To compare the utility of a new artificial amino acid, O-[18F]fluoromethyl-L-tyrosine ([18F]FMT), for monitoring cancer chemotherapy with deoxyglucose and thymidine.[18F]FMT, [14C]deoxyglucose ([14C]DG) and [6-3H]thymidine ([3H]Thd) were applied in this study. A 2.5 mg/kg dose of mitomycin (MMC) was administered to AH272 rat hepatoma-bearing Donryu rats. Tumour uptake of each tracer was measured just before (baseline) and on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after the MMC administration, 1 h after a mixture of [18F]FMT, [14C]DG and [3H]Thd had been injected, and was shown as DURs (% injected dose/gram tissue normalised for the rat body weight). Dual-tracer macroautoradiographs with [18F]FMT and [14C]DG were also prepared.The tumour uptake for each tracer decreased earlier than did the tumour size. DURs (mean+/-SD) at baseline and on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 were as follows: [18F]FMT: 4.68+/-0.72, 3.34+/-0.66, 3.13+/-0.72, 3.42+/-0.45, 3.01+/-0.32 [14C]DG: 3.26+/-0.40, 3.09+/-0.55, 3.01+/-0.97, 2.28+/-0.35, 1.70+/-0.72[18F]FMT uptake shows a rapid and sensitive response to chemotherapy, comparable to that of [3H]Thd, suggesting that it may be applied as a powerful tracer for monitoring of proliferative activity after cancer chemotherapy using PET.
