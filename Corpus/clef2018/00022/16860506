ZT glue immobilizes iodinated oil in vivo. ZT glue immobilizes iodinated oil to raise treatment efficiency.ZT glue and iodinated oil were mixed at a series of volume ratios on a level surface which be put vertically after 30 min. Five Sprague-Dawley rats (group 1) were subcutaneously injected in the groin with ZT glue and (131)I-iodinated oil (volume ratio at 1:4, 0.1 ml per rat, (131)I activity 13.6 x 37 x 10(3)Bq), at 1, 8, 12, and 27 days, a SPECT plain scan was performed to observe the (131)I distribution in the body, and to calculate the gamma counts at the site of injection. At 28 days, the rats were sacrificed and organs were collected. Iodinated oil states at the injection spot were recorded. Specimens from organs and the injection spot were used to detect gamma counts. Another five Sprague-Dawley rats (group 2) were subcutaneously injected (131)I-iodinated oil in the groin as control group. Through portal vein, five rabbits right liver lobe received (131)I-iodinated oil (1 ml, 20 x 37 x 10(3)Bq)+ZT glue (0.25 ml). gamma counts in the liver region were recorded on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 21, 27, and 33 after surgery. Then, gamma counting and pathological examination of the liver specimen and the lung specimen were performed. All gamma counts data was processed by INDFIT1.0 software that was designed in our laboratory to establish nuclide metabolic equation.The mixed iodinated oil above the volume ratio of 1:12 stop at level surface local. At rat the injection site, the nuclide stagnation time of group 1 are longer than those of group 2, and the biological half-life of group 1 is four times that of group 2. Single agent analysis of variance comparing the biological half-life: F value is 81.999, p<0.001. No visible damage was seen in the rat organs. All rat organs except the liver had no statistically significant gamma counts difference. Tissue gamma counts at the site of injection at day 28 had statistically difference between the two rat groups, F value is 5.608, p=0.045. The iodinated oil metabolic patterns in rabbit liver revealed two portions, the rapid and the slow. ZT glue rabbit group had higher slow proportion than iodinated oil group. Pearson Goodness-of-Fit Chi-square test found the Chi-square value was 25.433, d.f.=6, p<0.0001. ZT glue rabbit group right liver lobe has iodinated oil and ZT glue depositing, some liver cells were degenerated and vacuolated in the cellular plasma. Fibrous tissue proliferated around hepatic portal canal regions.ZT glue fixed iodinated oil is possible in vivo. This provides a new potentiality to delay iodinated oil metabolic in clinical liver cancer interventional treatment.
