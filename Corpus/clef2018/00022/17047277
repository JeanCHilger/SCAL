Non-diverging analytic expression for the on-axis sensitivity of converging collimators: analytic derivation. The expressions for the sensitivity of converging collimators found in the literature diverge at points near the focal locus of the collimator. In this paper, an analytical formula that does not diverge is derived and compared to that available in the literature. An analysis is provided to predict the cases in which use of the new formula is advisable. Since the first expression derived is rather complex, approximations were made to reach simpler formulae. The formulae derived can be used to define and extend the realm of applicability of the literature expression in the cases identified in their derivation.
