Cytologic diagnosis of diseases of rabbits, guinea pigs, and rodents. This article reviews the diseases most amenable to cytologic diagnosis in clinical small mammal practice. Diseases of pet rabbits, guinea pigs, rodents, chinchillas, sugar gliders, and hedgehogs are addressed. The small size of these patients, risk of anesthesia and invasive surgery, and cost factors make small mammals ideal patients for cytologic evaluation when applicable however, surprisingly few reports exist in the literature, and no other reviews of cytology in these species exist. Much of the data in this article is derived from case submissions to Northwest ZooPath, and disease presentations that seem to be common in this group of animals are emphasized. Diseases of the skin are particularly well represented, especially tumors and inflammatory processes.
