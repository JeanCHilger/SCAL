18F-FDG-PET in therapy response of esophageal cancer. PET imaging with the glucose analog fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) has been evaluated in several studies to monitor tumor response in patients undergoing chemo- and radiotherapy. The clinical value of FDG-PET for differentiation of residual tumor and therapy induced fibrosis has been documented for esophageal cancer. Furthermore, there are now several reports suggesting that quantitative assessment of therapy induced changes in tumor FDG-uptake may allow prediction of tumor response and patient outcome very early in the course of therapy. This suggests that FDG-PET may be used to identify non-responders early during neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy allowing for early modifications of the treatment protocol.
