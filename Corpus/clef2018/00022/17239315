Contemporary imaging modalities for the surveillance of patients with renal cell carcinoma. In recent years, there have been multiple advances in imaging technologies that have improved the surveillance for recurrence of neoplasms. Multidetector row CT and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI now provide excellent anatomic detail and are beginning to show functional detail as the rapid capture of images following contrast administration improves. Positron emission tomography is emerging as a useful tool in evaluating patients with suspected metastatic disease to the abdomen and bone, particularly when combined with CT. The role of ultrasound in the surveillance of renal cell carcinoma is yet unclear, but its role may be expanding with use of newly developed contrast drugs. Herein we review the relevance of these modalities to the follow-up of patients with renal cell carcinoma.
