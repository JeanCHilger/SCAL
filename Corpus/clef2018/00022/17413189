Diagnostic imaging of dopamine receptors in pituitary adenomas. Dopamine D2 receptor scintigraphy of pituitary adenomas is feasible by single-photon emission computed tomography using (123)I-S-(-)-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-2-hydroxy-3-iodo-6-methoxybenzamide ((123)I-IBZM) and (123)I-epidepride. (123)I-epidepride is generally superior to (123)I-IBZM for the visualization of D2 receptors on pituitary macroadenomas. However, (123)I-IBZM and (123)I-epidepride scintigraphy are generally not useful to predict the response to dopaminergic treatment in pituitary tumour patients. These techniques might allow discrimination of non-functioning pituitary macroadenomas from other non-tumour pathologies in the sellar region. Dopamine D2 receptors on pituitary tumours can also be studied using positron emission tomography with (11)C-N-raclopride and (11)C-N-methylspiperone.
