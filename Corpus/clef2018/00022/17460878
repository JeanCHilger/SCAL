Defect images in stress thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy in patients with complete left bundle branch block: comparison of exercise stress and pharmacological stress. Stress thallium-201 (201Tl) myocardial scintigraphy can demonstrate perfusion abnormalities, especially in the septum in patients with complete left bundle branch block (CLBBB) even with angiographically normal coronary arteries. Differences in the images between exercise and pharmacological stress 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy were evaluated in patients with CLBBB and normal coronary arteries.Forty-five patients with CLBBB underwent exercise stress using treadmill or pharmacological (adenosine triphosphate) stress 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy from October 1997 to February 2003. Patients with myocardial diseases were excluded, such as cardiomyopathy and coronary artery diseases detected by echocardiography and/or cardiac catheterization. The myocardial segment was classified according to the American Heart Association style for coronary artery disease.Peak blood pressure levels and heart rates were significantly higher in the exercise stress group than in the pharmacological stress group (p < 0.001). The rate of defects in stress images was significantly higher in the exercise stress group (72.4% 21/29 cases) than in the pharmacological stress group (18.8%Patients with CLBBB showed different frequencies of defects by stress 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy according to the stress method. Moreover, defects also occured in areas other than the septum. Blood pressure and heart rate were involved in the mechanisms of defects in left bundle branch block.
