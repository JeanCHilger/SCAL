Neuroimaging in trauma. Developments in imaging following traumatic brain injury are outlined. Numerous techniques have evolved over the past several years giving us more information about the injury and prognosis for recovery. Some of these techniques are in clinical use while others are used primarily in research but have the potential to become clinically useful.Computed tomography (CT) scanning is the primary imaging technique for acute brain injury, giving rapid information and being part of a general trauma work up in the emergency situation. It has supplanted plain films in the immediate management of brain injury. Following stabilization, MRI is the method of choice for evaluating the full extent of brain injury. Information on diffuse axonal injury is obtained by several MRI sequences. Diffusion tensor imaging is able to show long tract damage and relates to prognosis. There are several techniques which are best suited to research in brain injury, including single photon emission CT, PET and xenon CT.CT and MRI are now the imaging techniques for acute and subacute brain injury, respectively. Diffusion tensor imaging is being developed to provide more information on structural damage in brain injury. There are several research techniques available for brain injury, particularly relating to cerebral blood flow and metabolism.
