Dosimetry for (90)Y-DOTATOC therapies in patients with neuroendocrine tumors. The aim of this study was to determine the inter- and intrapatient variability of absorbed dose to the whole body, kidneys, and tumor, as well as the question of whether the first therapy could serve as a guide for future therapies. Fifty (50) (90)Y-DOTATOC therapies were given to 30 patients diagnosed with refractory stage IV neuroendocrine tumors (20 patients received two therapies, 10 patients received one therapy). The first and second therapies were delivered at standard intervals. (90)Y-activity was prescribed by surface area (3.7 GBq/m(2)), and approximately 100 MBq (111)In-DOTATOC was administered concurrently for imaging purposes. Amino acid coadministration for renal protection was performed. Measurements of activity in whole-body and single-photon emission computed tomography images were acquired at various time points after the administration of the radiopharmaceutical. The dosimetry for whole body, kidneys, and tumor was based on these data. The interpatient variability (the ratio of the maximum absorbed dose per injected activity for all patients) was larger than the intrapatient variability (the ratio of absorbed dose per injected activity for subsequent therapies in the same patient for whole body, kidneys, and tumor. These results imply that the first therapy could serve as a guide for future therapies. This approach might allow for targeted radionuclide therapy to be delivered by prescribed absorbed dose, rather than by administered activity.
