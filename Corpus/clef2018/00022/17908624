Is [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography the ultimate tool for response and prognosis assessment? [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is currently the most accurate and reliable tool for the assessment of response in Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). FDG-PET is superior to conventional imaging techniques for detection of residual disease at the end of treatment, especially in the presence of a residual mass, a frequent finding in HL. FDG-PET response assessment has also a high predictive value early after the initiation of therapy. However, whether risk-adapted treatment strategies based on FDG-PET may also improve patient outcome remains to be proved.
