Serotonin-1A receptor imaging in recurrent depression: replication and literature review. Serotonin-1A receptor (5-HT1AR) function appears to be decreased in major depressive disorder (MDD) based on physiological responses to 5-HT1AR agonists in vivo and to 5-HT1AR binding in brain tissues postmortem or antemortem. We have previously assessed 5-HT1AR binding potential (BP) in depression using positron emission tomography (PET) and [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635, and we have demonstrated reduced 5-HT1AR BP in the mesiotemporal cortex (MTC) and raphe in depressives with primary recurrent familial mood disorders (n=12) versus controls (n=8) [Drevets WC, Frank E, Price JC, Kupfer DJ, Holt D, Greer PJ, Huang Y, Gautier C, Mathis C. PET imaging of serotonin 1A receptor binding in depression. Biol Psychiatry 199946(10):1375-87]. These findings were replicated by some, but not other, studies performed in depressed samples that were more generally selected using criteria for MDD. In the current study, we attempted to replicate our previous findings in an independent sample of subjects selected according to the criteria for primary recurrent depression applied in our prior study.Using PET and [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635, 5-HT1AR BP was assessed in 16 depressed subjects and 8 healthy controls.Mean 5-HT1AR BP was reduced by 26% in the MTC (P<.005) and by 43% in the raphe (P<.001) in depressives versus controls.These data replicate our original findings, which showed that BP was reduced by 27% in the MTC (P<.025) and by 42% in the raphe (P<.02) in depression. The magnitudes of these reductions in 5-HT1AR binding were similar to those found postmortem in 5-HT1AR mRNA concentrations in the hippocampus in MDD [LÃ³pez JF, Chalmers DT, Little KY, Watson SJ.
