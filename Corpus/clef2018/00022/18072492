Uniform attenuation correction using the frequency-distance principle. The frequency-distance principle (FDP) is a well-known relationship that relates the distance between the object and the detector to the slope in the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the projection sinogram. This relationship has been previously applied to compensation of the distance dependent collimator blurring in SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) in the literature. This paper makes an attempt to use the FDP to correct for uniform attenuation in SPECT. Computer simulations reveal that this technique works well for objects consisting of point sources but does not work well for distributed objects.
