Quantitative imaging of estrogen receptor expression in breast cancer with PET and 18F-fluoroestradiol. The PET compound (18)F-fluoroestradiol ((18)F-FES) has been developed and tested as an agent for the imaging of estrogen receptor (ER) expression in vivo. (18)F-FES uptake has been shown to correlate with ER expression assayed in vitro by radioligand binding however, immunohistochemistry (IHC) rather than radioligand binding is used most often to measure ER expression in clinical practice. We therefore compared (18)F-FES uptake with ER expression assayed in vitro by IHC with both qualitative and semiquantitative measures.Seventeen patients with primary or metastatic breast cancer were studied with dynamic (18)F-FES PET cancer tissue samples, collected close to the time of imaging, were assayed for ER expression by IHC. For each tumor, partial-volume-corrected measures of (18)F-FES uptake were compared with ER expression measured by 3 different ER scoring methods: qualitative scoring (0-3+), the Allred score (0-10), and a computerized IHC index.There was excellent agreement (r = 0.99) between observers using IHC as well as the different methods of measuring ER content (P < 0.001). ER-negative tumors had (18)F-FES partial-volume-corrected standardized uptake values of less than 1.0, whereas ER-positive tumors had values above 1.1. Correlation coefficients for the different measures of ER content and the different measures of (18)F-FES uptake ranged from 0.57 to 0.73, with the best correlation being between the computerized IHC index and (18)F-FES partial-volume-corrected standardized uptake values.Our results showed good agreement between (18)F-FES PET and ER expression measured by IHC. (18)F-FES imaging may be a useful tool for aiding in the assessment of ER status, especially in patients with multiple tumors or for tumors that are difficult to biopsy.
