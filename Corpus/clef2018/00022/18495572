Oesophageal cancer: what's new during the last 10 years?. During the last 10 years, the incidence of lower third oesophagus and esogastric junction adenocarcinomas in western countries continued to increase whereas that of squamous cell carcinomas declined. In France, this trend was also observed even if it remained much fainter than that observed in the United States. Increasingly arguments incite to propose specific diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for each histological type. Preoperative work-up includes for some patients primary laparoscopic approach and positrons emission tomography. Indications for both procedures are specified in the recent recommendations of the National Thesaurus. Endoscopic approach is now a valuable option offered for selected patients treated in a curative or palliative attempt or sustaining postoperative fistula. Curative therapeutic strategies include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, mostly in a combined fashion. Therapeutic strategies have markedly changed for 10 years, and their respective place is specified for each histological types and according to tumour location.
