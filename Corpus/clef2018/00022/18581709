A method designed for the assessment of myocardial metabolism in rats with 18F-FDG using small-animal-PET. Initial experience in Mexico. To standarize an acquisition protocol for the study of myocardial metabolism in adult rats.Three Wistar adult male rats were studied in three different protocols: no fasting group, fasting group over a period of 12 hr before the study with only water provided ad libitum, and fasting group by the same time receiving an oral 50% glucose solution. Thirty-minute acquisition images were obtained with a micro-PET, thirty and sixty minutes after the administration of 370-555 MBq 18F-FDG. Comparative and visual analysis were performed by two experts in the field.Eigtheen studies were analyzed, six per group. The best images were those of the first group, especially those taken at 60 minutes after the 18F-FDG administration.It is possible to establish the non-fasting protocol for the assessment of myocardial metabolism to be used in the future for the myocardial viability evaluation in ischemic cardiopathy.
