FDG-MicroPET and diffusion-weighted MR image evaluation of early changes after radiofrequency ablation in implanted VX2 tumors in rabbits. The objective of this study was to evaluate the early changes after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in VX2 rabbit tumors implanted into the back muscles by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET). Percutaneous CT-guided RFA was conducted in seven rabbits with implanted VX2 tumors. VX2 tumors on the other side were untreated and served as the control. MR imaging was performed with a clinical 1.5-T instrument 2 days after RFA, and FDG-PET, using a high-resolution PET scanner for small animals, was obtained 3 days after the procedure. The mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and radioactivity count of untreated and ablated tumors were calculated. Untreated VX2 tumors showed hyperintensity on T1-, T2-, and diffusion-weighted MR images, ring-enhanced on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, and ring-shaped FDG accumulation on FDG-PET. Ablated VX2 tumors showed slight hyperintensity on T1-, T2-, and diffusion-weighed images, slight enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, and low accumulation on FDG-PET. The ADC value of ablated VX2 tumors (1.52 +/- 0.24 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) was significantly higher than that of untreated tumors (1.09 +/- 0.12 x 10(-3) p < 0.05). The tumor/muscle ratio of ablated tumors (0.5 +/- 0.3) was significantly lower than that of untreated tumors (11.6 +/- 3.2
