Development of molecular imaging probes in oncology. Molecular imaging probes used for positron emission tomography(PET)in oncology are reviewed. Although [18F] FDG is presently the most useful probe for imaging tumors, there is a need for complementary probes of FDG with some limitations on detection in the brain or inflammatory region. The review is mostly focused on 18F-labeled probes designed for amino acid transport and protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, membrane lipid, and hypoxia such as FET, FLT, FMAU, fluorocholine, and FMISO, together with our original probes of FMT and FRP-170.
