Synthesis of a novel calix[4]arene derivative with 2-methylquinoline and study of it's spectrum character with Zn(II) and Cu(II). A novel calix[4]arene derivative(25,27-two2-methylquinoline t-butylcalix[4]arene, MQBC) with the lower rim modified fluorescence groups was synthesized. IR spectra, elemental analysis, HNMR spectra and MS were used to determine its structure. Meanwhile, the spectra characters of MQBC and the fluorescent behaviors of the complex with zinc(II) and copper (II) were investigated, and the results showed that the lower rim oxygen atoms in calix[4]arenes may act as electrons donor to metal ions. Calix[4] arene was chosen as a basic skeleton of a photoresponsive ion carrier because its quinolin derivatives are known to emit fluorescence and absorb UV in the solution, and the information of the complex with metal ions will be known by spectra experiment. The UV absorbance became weak at the band of 226 nm but was enhanced at the band of 315 nm when it bound zinc ions, The complex constant(K) and binding ratio(x) were determined to be 2 064 L x mol(-1) and 1, respectively, by UV spectra experiment. It is expected that MQBC will be applied to the detection of trace zinc ions. The fluorecence spectra experiment found that MQBC is has feeble fluorecence attributed to the intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer(PET) between oxygen atoms and methylquinoline groups. When MQBC was combined with zinc(II) and copper(II), it caused the inhibiting photoinduced electron transfer process between oxygen atoms and methylquinoline groups leading to the enhancement of fluorescence. In addition, the photoinduced electron mechanism was discussed and the influence of the concentration of zinc(II) and copper(II) on the fluorescence intensities was studied.
