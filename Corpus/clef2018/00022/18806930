Is transketolase like 1 a target for the treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma? A study on thyroid cancer cell lines. Radioactive iodine-refractory [(18)F] fluorodeoxy-glucose-positron emission tomography-positive thyroid carcinomas represent especially aggressive tumors. Targeting glucose metabolism by the transketolase isoenzyme transketolase like 1 (TKTL-1) which is over-expressed in various neoplasms, may be effective. The correlation of TKTL-1 expression and the response to oxythiamine as the currently best-characterized inhibitor of transketolases was studied in differentiated thyroid cancer cell lines. We determined TKTL-1 expression, proliferation, glucose uptake and GLUT-1 expression in non-treated thyroid cells and recorded the effect of oxythiamine on iodide uptake and on thymidine uptake. TKTL 1 was highest expressed in cell lines derived from more invasive tumors but the expression level was not strongly correlated to proliferation rate, to GLUT-1 expression or to the response to oxythiamine. Oxythiamine showed only a weak effect in the TKTL-1 expressing cell lines. Over-expression of TKTL-1 is not an indicator for responsiveness to oxythiamine. More specific inhibitors should be tested.
