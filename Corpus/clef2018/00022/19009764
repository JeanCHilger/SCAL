Myocardial viability findings interpretation using SPECT and PET imaging. Myocardial perfusion and function imaging using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) plays the important role in coronary artery disease diagnostics and risk stratification, however, there is nowadays growing significance of the myocardial viability detection. A glucose metabolism assessment using positron emission tomography (PET) becomes accessible also. A brief review is given about the interpretation principle in the viable myocardium diagnosis and current progress in perfusion and metabolism defect severity quantification in patients with the left ventricular dysfunction.
