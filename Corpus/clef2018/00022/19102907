Assessment of therapeutic effects of stem cell transplantation in heart failure patients with old myocardial infarction by magnetic resonance imaging. To evaluate the therapeutic effects of stem cell transplantation in heart failure patients with old myocardial infarction (OMI) by MRI.Heart failure patients [NYHA 2.7 +/- 0.7, male = 18, mean age (59.5 +/- 10.1) y] with OMI were randomly divided into 2 groups (group A: CABG + stem cell transplantation, group B: CABG n = 10 each). Left ventricular (LV) function was measured by MRI, viable myocardium was detected by (18)F-FDG myocardial metabolism imaging and late contrast-enhanced at baseline and 6 months post intervention.LVEF and LVEDV at baseline for group A were (20.71 +/- 6.09)% and (172.73 +/- 32.74) ml, and for group B were (27.59 +/- 2.31)% and (155.13 +/- 28.36) ml, respectively (P > 0.05). The LVEF was equally improved in group A and B (mean 8.63% vs. 10.37%, P > 0.05) while DeltaLVEDV was significant higher in group A than that in group B [(9.91 +/- 39.50) ml vs. (-22.34 +/- 31.35) ml, P < 0.05]. Ventricular wall thickening ratio at 6 months post intervention was significantly higher in group A than that in group B [(11.40 +/- 11.53)% vs. (2.27 +/- 7.20)%, P < 0.05]. Late contrast-enhanced MRI results correlated with (18)F-FDG myocardial metabolism imaging SPECT well in assessment of myocardial viability (kappa value: 0.446, P < 0.001 sensitivity: 68.3% and specificity: 92.5%).Stem cell therapy on top of CABG aggravated LV remodeling in heart failure patients with old myocardial infarction. The specificity of MRI is similar to (18)F-FDG SPECT while the sensitivity is inferior to (18)F-FDG SPECT on detecting viable myocardium.
