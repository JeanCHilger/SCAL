Effects of visual stimulation on the redistribution of iodine-123-IMP in the brain using SPECT imaging. A study was performed to validate the assumption that redistribution and clearance of [123I]IMP localization in the brain are unaffected by changes in ambient light levels and visual stimulation occurring after radiopharmaceutical is administered and deposited in the brain. Serial SPECT and planar imaging studies were performed on six healthy, volunteer, adult male subjects under resting, nonactivation conditions. Studies were repeated 7 days later with each subject exposed to strobe light stimulation prior to delayed SPECT procedures at 3 hr. Redistribution and clearance of 123I-IMP in the brain were examined in cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar regions on transaxial slices for the two sets of serial procedures in each subject. Visual stimulation following the initial uptake of [123I]IMP did not affect the distribution or clearance of [123I]IMP in the brain, including the visual cortex, and therefore should not influence the interpretation of delayed SPECT images.
