How to teach pet loss to veterinary students. This paper covers the history of teaching pet loss, the skills new veterinarians should know, suggestions for who might teach those skills, and a sample curriculum. In the last 25 years, the veterinary profession has become more aware of the needs of clients who have lost pets and more skilled at meeting those needs. To maximize the ability of practitioners to handle pet loss, veterinary colleges and teaching hospitals can prepare students to do four things: explain a bad medical situation, assess the client, help a client to make a good decision, and support a client through their loss. These skills can and should be taught by a variety of experts, including veterinary faculty and practitioners, mental health professionals, clients, and peers.
