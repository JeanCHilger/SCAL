Faster analysis of radiopharmaceuticals using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) in combination with low volume radio flow cell. With the aim of reducing analysis time of radiopharmaceuticals, especially for carbon-11 and fluorine-18, radio-high performance liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC) is the analysis method of choice. Faster and more sensitive analytic methods are needed. Recently, ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) has become an accepted analysis method but has not yet been established in radiopharmacy. This study demonstrates with the established positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [(18)F]fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) the applicability of using UPLC) in combination with low volume radio flow cell for a fast, sensitive and efficient analytic method. The developed UPLC) method showed a sharp and high radio signal. The total analysis time was thus reduced from 15 to 2 min.
