Practical tips and tricks in cardiovascular computed tomography: diagnosis of myocardial infarction. In addition to accurately diagnosing coronary artery disease, cardiac CT (CCT) has the potential to provide information on myocardial function, perfusion, and viability. As ongoing research continues to support the utility of such noncoronary uses of CCT, this information is increasingly being integrated into clinical practice. An emerging important use of CCT is the ability to accurately identify areas of infarcted myocardium. From a clinical perspective, detecting and quantifying infarct size has important prognostic and therapeutic implications. This article provides a brief overview on the use of CT to diagnose myocardial infarction (MI) and provide practical "tips and tricks" that can aid in the CT-based detection of MI.
