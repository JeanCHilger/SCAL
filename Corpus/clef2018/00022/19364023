Difficulty in oxygen procurement in conflict or disaster areas. The main problem for anesthesia in a conflict or disaster area is the difficulty of oxygen procurement. It is impossible to transport a heavy oxygen cylinder to a remote area, and the oxygen concentrator has its difficulties in repairing on the spot. Ketamine anesthesia is carried out commonly in a conflict or disaster area. SpO2 and PET(CO2) under ketamine anesthesia were analyzed from the data of Afghan war wounded. Where there is no oxygen distribution system, anesthesia is better to be carried out without oxygen, until an oxygen factory is established in the given area. In order to do this, we should make an effort to use minimum oxygen, in our daily anesthesia.
