Cloning and expression of a hemolysin gene of Aeromonas hydrophila and the immunogenicity of the toxoid. According to the GenBank sequences (GenBank Accession No. AF539467), one pair of primers was designed to amplify hly gene of Aeromonas hydrophila by PCR. After sequencing, homology analysis indicated that a DNA fragment of 1485 bp was amplified from isolated DNA from Aeromonas hydrophila, and it shared more than 99% homology in nucleotide sequence compared with other reference strains in GenBank. The gene was cloned in pET-28a vector to construct a recombinant plasmid pET-28a-hly, which was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and the recombinant strain BL21(DE3)(pET-28a-hly) was obtained. The hemolysin was highly expressed when the recombinant strain BL21 (DE3) (pET-28a-hly) was induced by IPTG. The expressed protein was 56 kD as estimated by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The immunogenicity of the expressed Hly protein was confirmed by Western blotting. Mice were immunized with inactivated whole bacteria vaccine and the genetic engineering vaccines showing promise that all these vaccines have a high protective ability. The results showed that the recombinant strain BL21 (DE3)(pET-28a-hly) could be candidate of hemolysin toxoid vaccine to provide protective immunity against diseases caused by Aeromonas hydrophila.
