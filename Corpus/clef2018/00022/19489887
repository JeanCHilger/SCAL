Interictal metabolic changes in episodic migraine: a voxel-based FDG-PET study. Whereas there are many H(2)(15)O-positron emission tomography (PET) studies demonstrating neuronal activation during acute migraine attacks, little information is available on the interictal (headache-free period) glucose metabolic changes in migraine. We therefore conducted voxel-based statistical parametric mapping analysis of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET to evaluate interictal metabolic differences between 20 episodic migraine patients (four with aura three men
