Cardiac MRI for detection of unrecognized myocardial infarction in patients with end-stage renal disease: comparison with ECG and scintigraphy. The purposes of this study were to use the myocardial delayed enhancement technique of cardiac MRI to investigate the frequency of unrecognized myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with end-stage renal disease, to compare the findings with those of ECG and SPECT, and to examine factors that may influence the utility of these methods in the detection of MI.We prospectively performed cardiac MRI, ECG, and SPECT to detect unrecognized MI in 72 patients with end-stage renal disease at high risk of coronary artery disease but without a clinical history of MI.Fifty-six patients (78%) were men (mean age, 56.2 +/- 9.4 years) and 16 (22%) were women (mean age, 55.8 +/- 11.4). The mean left ventricular mass index was 103.4 +/- 27.3 g/m(2), and the mean ejection fraction was 60.6% +/- 15.5%. Myocardial delayed enhancement imaging depicted unrecognized MI in 18 patients (25%). ECG findings were abnormal in five patients (7%), and SPECT findings were abnormal in 19 patients (26%). ECG findings were false-negative in 14 cases and false-positive in one case. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of ECG were 79.2%, 22.2%, and 98.1% (p = 0.002). SPECT findings were false-negative in six cases and false-positive in seven cases. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of SPECT were 81.9%, 66.7%, and 87.0% (not significant). During a period of 4.9-77.9 months, 19 cardiac deaths were documented, but no statistical significance was found in survival analysis.Cardiac MRI with myocardial delayed enhancement can depict unrecognized MI in patients with end-stage renal disease. ECG and SPECT had low sensitivity in detection of MI. Infarct size and left ventricular mass can influence the utility of these methods in the detection of MI.
