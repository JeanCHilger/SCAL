Neuronavigation: geneology, reality, and prospects. Currently, neuronavigation is an indivisible and indispensable part of the neurosurgical reality with a significant potential impact in each neurosurgical procedure. The history of neuronavigation is quite short (< 3 decades), but full of highly promising achievements. The advent of neuronavigation would be unimaginable without the development of imaging technology, electronics, robotics, and space technology. The history of neuroradiology is reviewed briefly parallel with the detailed evolution of frame-based stereotaxy and its successor-neuronavigation. The historic milestones and the state of the art of neuronavigation are discussed in a genealogical manner. The future trends of neuronavigation as integrated with intraoperative CT, MR, and ultrasonography, as well as with robotic systems are outlined.
