SPECT-CT in sentinel node detection in patients with melanoma. The prognosis of patients with cutaneous melanoma is greatly influenced by the presence of lymph node metastases. One of the most innovative and fascinating concepts to emerge in the field of oncology in recent years is the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).The aim of this study was to determine what SPECT-CT images contribute to the search for sentinel nodes in patients with melanoma.From March 2007 to October 2008, 18 patients were examined for sentinel nodes using dynamic scintigraphy, planar images, and SPECT-CT in the Nuclear Medicine Department of San Carlos University Hospital. The group contained 10 women and 8 men, age range 14-83 years, mean age 57 years (57+/-20.1).The sentinel node was located by conventional imaging techniques (dynamic scintigraphy and planar images) in 16 of 18 patients (88.88%). SPECT-CT identified the sentinel node in 18 of 18 patients (100%) and detected clinically relevant findings in 6 of 18 patients (33.33%)SPECT-CT imaging contributed clinically relevant information on sentinel nodes of melanoma, which is particularly important in patients with melanoma of the trunk or head and neck.
