Myocardial viability imaging and revascularization in chronic ischemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The high rate of periprocedural morbidity and mortality associated with revascularization in moderate-to-severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction has provided the rationale for noninvasive viability imaging. The most established viability imaging techniques are PET, single-photon emission computed tomography and dobutamine echocardiography. Cardiac MRI is gaining widespread use and accessibility, and computed tomography is emerging as a promising technique. Each imaging modality has unique advantages but also suffers from limitations. Furthermore, evidence of the impact of viability imaging on patient outcomes has generally been limited to observational studies. Uncertainty remains regarding the optimal treatment strategy in this patient subset. This review describes the current status of viability imaging and revascularization in chronic moderate-to-severe ischemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
