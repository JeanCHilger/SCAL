Epidemiology and diagnosis of endograft infection. Endograft infection is reported to occur in between 0.2 and 0.7 of patients and in general presents either within four months of endograft implantation of after more than 12 months. Review of all cases reported to date reveals three modes of presentation: approximately one third of patients present with evidence of an aorto-enteric fistula (although less than half of these present with gastrointestinal haemorrhage), one third present with non specific signs of low grade sepsis (malaise, weight loss) and the remainder with evidence of severe systemic sepsis. Infection is most commonly attributed to Staphylococcus aureus. Diagnosis relies on a high index of suspicion, imaging of the aorta and periaortic tissues (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) and bacteriological culture. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the features of all cases reported to date and examines the aetiology, pathogenesis and imaging of endograft infection and aorto-enteric fistula.
