Dual PET/CT with (18)F-DOPA and (18)F-FDG in metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma and rapidly increasing calcitonin levels: Comparison with conventional imaging. To evaluate the role of a multi-imaging PET with (18)F-DOPA and (18)F-FDG in comparison with conventional imaging (CI) in recurrent medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).18 MTC patients who had thyroidectomy were included they presented with elevated and rapidly increasing calcitonin levels during follow up. CI had revealed metastatic deposits in 9 patients. Patients were referred to us for a PET/CT with (18)F-DOPA and (18)F-FDG. Histologic/cytologic confirmation of recurrent MTC was obtained in at least one PET-positive lesion in all patients.Foci of abnormal uptake were observed in 15 patients at (18)F-DOPA and in 11 at (18)F-FDG 8 patients showed the same number of positive lesions with both tracers, 2 showed more lesions on (18)F-FDG, 1 was positive at (18)F-FDG alone and 5 at (18)F-DOPA alone. In 3 patients with a DOPA-positive loco-regional relapse a re-operation with curative intent was offered. SUV(max) values were higher for (18)F-FDG compared to (18)F-DOPA (mean 12.7+/-4.1 vs. 5.5+/-2.1, p<0.05). Calcitonin was higher in PET-positive patients compared to PET negative ones, while no significant differences were observed between (18)F-DOPA and (18)F-FDG positive patients.In MTC patients with rapidly increasing calcitonin levels during follow up, (18)F-DOPA has a good sensitivity and a complementary role with (18)F-FDG PET/CT in detecting metastatic deposits. In our experience, the sensitivity of a multi-imaging (18)F-DOPA &(18)F-FDG PET/CT approach is greater than that obtained with CI. The higher SUV(max) values found with (18)F-FDG in some patients may reflect more aggressive tumors.
