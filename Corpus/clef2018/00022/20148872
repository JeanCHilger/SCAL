Higher striatal dopamine transporters in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder: a SPECT study with [Tc] TRODAT-1. Dopamine has been implicated in the etiology of bipolar disorder. The aim of this study was to explore striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability in euthymic bipolar patients.Seventeen drug-free euthymic bipolar patients were recruited. The availability of DAT was approximated using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [99mTc] TRODAT-1.Compared to the controls, the euthymic bipolar patients had significantly higher availability of striatal DAT.Even for patients in the euthymic state, the DAT availability is still higher than that of the controls.
