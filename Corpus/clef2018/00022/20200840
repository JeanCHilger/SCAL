Neuroimaging in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Advances in neuroimaging in the last decade have allowed a number of new findings about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to be obtained. Quickly developing technology, together with the progress being made in genetics and neurochemical research, suggests a dysfunction of the fronto striatal circuit that involves the prefrontal cortex and its relationship with the basal, thalamic and cerebellar nuclei as the pathophysiological foundation of this disorder. On the other hand, neuroimaging in the future may complement clinical evaluation, which will favour more accurate diagnoses and allow the subtypes and even the mode of treatment and its monitoring to be identified.The aim of this study was to review the more significant literature on neuroimaging and ADHD and to discuss the usefulness and drawbacks of the different modes of neuroimaging techniques that can be applied with a view to gaining an improved and deeper knowledge of ADHD in the future.Although the development of neuroimaging in ADHD is a promising area, at the present time its diagnostic value is very restricted. One of the greatest difficulties in this respect concerns the clinical, genetic and pathophysiological heterogeneity of the disorder. Hence, given the inexistence of a specific marker, future studies will have to search for several markers that have a suitable value in the diagnosis, prognosis and/or treatment of the different subtypes of ADHD.
