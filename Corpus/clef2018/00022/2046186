Simultaneous assessment of wall motion and myocardial perfusion by technetium-99m methoxy isobutyl isonitrile. The aim of this study was to assess whether or not myocardial uptake of Technetium-99m methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (Tc-MIBI) indicated myocardial viability. We performed simultaneous Tc-MIBI angiography and myocardial SPECT at rest on 12 patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Left ventricle was divided into 3 segments, and regional wall motion was graded as normal, hypokinesis and akinesis/dyskinesis. Myocardial uptake of Tc-MIBI was assessed as normal, reduced and absent in each segment. In segments with normal and reduced Tc-MIBI uptake, 7% (2 of 28) and 33% (2 of 6) showed wall motion abnormalities of akinesis/dyskinesis, respectively. However, all segments with absent Tc-MIBI uptake had asynergy of akinesis/dyskinesis (2 of 2, 100%). Myocardial Tc-MIBI uptake at rest indicated wall motion abnormalities and was considered to be useful for the evaluation of myocardial viability. First-pass radionuclide angiography followed by myocardial SPECT with Tc-MIBI demonstrated to be useful for the simultaneous assessment of the left ventricular wall motion and myocardial perfusion.
