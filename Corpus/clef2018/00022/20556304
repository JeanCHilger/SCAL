A copper radiopharmaceutical for diagnostic imaging of Alzheimer's disease: a bis(thiosemicarbazonato)copper(II) complex that binds to amyloid-beta plaques. A bis(thiosemicarbazonato)copper(ii) complex with an appended stilbene functional group binds to amyloid-beta plaques that are associated with Alzheimer's disease. The complex has the potential to be of use as a copper-64 radiopharmaceutical to assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by positron emission tomography.
