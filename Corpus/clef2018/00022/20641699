 The tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is synthesized as a 26-kDa membrane-bound protein on certain cell types, e.g., T cells. The membrane-bound protein is cleaved to release a 17-kDa soluble form that exists as a homotrimer. It has been implicated in the pathogenesis of different diseases including cancer and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn’s disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (1, 2). The stimulation of TNF-α induction is known to activate several pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and endothelial adhesion molecules that attract cells known to promote inflammation (3). Because of its role in the pathogenesis of different inflammatory diseases, a variety of anti–TNF-α agents have been developed and investigated for the treatment of these conditions (4). Several anti–TNF-α antibodies such as infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab are now available for the treatment of TNF-α–mediated inflammatory diseases (2). Infliximab is an anti–TNF-α, chimeric mouse-human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is commercially available and is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases (2, 4). This mAb is known to bind TNF-α in the serum or on the cell membranes and to inhibit its biological activity mediated through the TNF-α receptor. To evaluate its
