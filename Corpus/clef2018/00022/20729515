Comparison of toltrazuril and sulphadimethoxine in the treatment of intestinal coccidiosis in pet rabbits. Treatment of intestinal coccidiosis was studied in domestic pet rabbits. In 45 rabbits aged four months or more, coccidial oocysts were observed in the faeces of 35 rabbits at a mean density of 806 opg (range 50 to 6800 opg). Eimeria magna was the dominant species, with Eimeria media and Eimeria intestinalis also being common. The presence of the hepatic species Eimeria stiedae was not recorded. A single oral dose of 2.5 mg/kg or 5.0 mg/kg toltrazuril, or a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg sulphadimethoxine followed by its inclusion in drinking water at 1 g/4 l for nine days, were all found to significantly reduce the faecal oocyst count by 73 to 99 per cent. The extent of oocyst reduction in the faeces was not dependent on the dose of toltrazuril. Oocyst counts began to rise again in the days after treatment ceased.
