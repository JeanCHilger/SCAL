Gynecological cancers. The clinical problems raised in patients presenting with all forms of gynecological malignancy are currently addressed using conventional cross-sectional imaging, usually MRI. In general, F-18 FDG PET-CT has not been shown to have a clinical role in any of these cancers at presentation, although studies are under way to use this form of metabolic imaging to predict prognosis and the response to treatment. Although F-18 FDG PET-CT is superior to conventional imaging techniques, it is only moderately sensitive in demonstrating lymph node metastasis preoperatively, and is inadequate for local staging of patients with endometrial cancer. In ovarian cancer, F-18 FDG PET-CT provides an accurate assessment of the extent of disease, particularly in areas difficult to assess for metastases by CT and MRI such as the abdomen and pelvis, mediastinum, and supraclavicular region. F-18 FDG PET-CT is a sensitive method of detecting pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodal disease in cervical cancer, and appears to be superior to MRI and CT despite the limitations in identifying small foci of disease. In the main, as elsewhere in patients with cancer, the value of PET-CT is in identifying and defining the extent of recurrent disease, in distinguishing between posttreatment fibrosis and recurrence, and possibly in monitoring response to therapy.
