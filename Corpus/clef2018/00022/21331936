PET and PET/CT in the management of thyroid cancer. The introduction of PET(-CT) has brought about a major paradigm shift in the management of thyroid carcinoma, especially from the diagnostic standpoint. From the viewpoint of patient management, the areas where it has made significant impact include the following: (1) the detection of disease focus in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma with elevated Tg levels and negative radioiodine scan. When localized disease is identified with F-18 FDG-PET-CT, surgery or focused radiotherapy could be utilized to eradicate the tumor (2) the localization of disease in patients of MTC with elevated serum calcitonin levels
