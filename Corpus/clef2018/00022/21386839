FOLFOX6 and bevacizumab in non-optimally resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer. In patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM) R0 resection significantly improves overall survival (OS).In this report, we present the results of a phase II trial of FOLFOX6+bevacizumab in patients with non-optimally resectable CLM. Patients received six cycles of FOLFOX6+ five of bevacizumab. Patients not achieving resectability received six additional cycles of each. A PET-CT was performed at baseline and again within 1 month after initiating treatment.From September 2005 to July 2009, 21 patients were enrolled (Male/Female: 15/6 median age: 65 years). An objective response (OR) was documented in 12 cases (57.1%FOLFOX6+bevacizumab does not increase postsurgical complications, yields high rates of resectability and pCR. Early changes in PET-CT seem to be predictive of longer PFS.
