The accuracy of FDG-PET/CT in early-stage cervical and vaginal cancers. [(18)F]fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron-emission tomography combined with integrated computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) is commonly used for advanced stage cervical cancer but its efficiency is discussed in early stage. The aim of this study was to evaluate false negative rate of FDG-PET/CT in early-stage cervical and vaginal cancer.Patients treated between 2005 and 2008 for stage IB1 cervical cancer and stage I vaginal cancer who underwent a FDG-PET/CT followed by a pelvic lymphadenectomy were studied.Eighteen patients were included with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy (16 cervical cancer, two vaginal cancer). The median age of patients was 41 years. Radical hysterectomy was performed for 16 patients, by a laparoscopic approach in 15 cases and by a laparotomic approach in one case. One patient had a simple hysterectomy and one had exclusive radiotherapy. No patient had pelvic or para-aortic fixation on FDG-PET/CT. Three patients have proven pelvic involvement and one had para-aortic metastases. The false-negative rate and negative predictive value of FDG-PET/CT were 17% and 83% respectively.The accuracy of FDG-PET/CT imaging in predicting the pelvic nodal status is very low in patients with early-stage cervical and vaginal cancer and is not able to replace surgical exploration.
