18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on positron emission tomography as a prognostic predictor in locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Metabolic activity assessed by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglocuse-positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET) reflects biological aggressiveness and prognoses in various tumors. The authors present a correlation between tumor metabolic activity and clinical outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Over a 3-year period (2005-2008), 135 locally advanced HCC patients were treated with localized concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT external beam radiotherapy at 45 grays for 5 weeks plus concurrent hepatic arterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil during the first and fifth week) followed by repetitive hepatic arterial infusional chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. Among them, the authors studied 107 who received (18)F-FDG-PET before CCRT. Maximal standardized uptake values (SUVs) of tumors were calculated.The median maximal tumor SUV was 6.1 (range, 2.4-∼19.2). Patients with low maximal tumor SUVs (<6.1) had a higher disease control rate than those with high maximal tumor SUVs (≥6.1) (86.8% vs 68.5%, respectively, P = .023). Both median progression-free survival (PFS 8.4 vs 5.2 monthsMetabolic activity may be useful not only in predicting prognosis and treatment responses, but also in establishing optimal treatment plans in locally advanced HCC.
