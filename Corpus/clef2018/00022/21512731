High maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) on PET scan is associated with shorter survival in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma. FDG-PET scan plays an important role in response assessment in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In this study, we evaluated the prognostic value of maximum standard uptake (SUVmax) on pretreatment PET scan in DLBCL. Among 169 patients with DLBCL newly diagnosed and treated with R-CHOP between 2003 and 2008, 110 patients who had undergone pretreatment PET scan in single institute using an identical protocol were reviewed and analyzed. SUVmax at the predominant lesion on PET scan and other patient characteristics were evaluated for their association with complete response (CR) rate, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The median SUVmax was 18.1 (2.0-36.4). There was no significant association between high SUV and other characteristics with the exception of PS ≥ 2 and Ki-67. Multivariate analysis revealed the independent association between high SUVmax and lower CR rate. The 3-year PFS rates in patients with SUV < 30 and those with SUV ≥ 30 were 78 and 51%, respectively (p = 0.06). The 3-year OS rates were 86 and 71%, respectively (p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis revealed that high SUVmax is a significant poor prognostic factor for both PFS and OS, independent of IPI. We showed the important prognostic value of pretreatment SUVmax of PET scan in DLBCL.
