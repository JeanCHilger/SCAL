Attempt of quantitative analysis of visual evaluation for (123)I-BMIPP myocardial scintigraphy images. We developed a new technique to quantitatively analyze visual evaluation single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Short axis tomograms and color scales were computer scanned. The scales were divided into 25 parts numbers of each hue pixel were scored 0-100%. Short-axis images were divided into eight equal partitions, numbers of hue pixels distributed in each partition were scored, and total scores were obtained. Each partition's radio-isotope (RI) accumulation index was calculated as partition score/highest score. For method validation, scintigrams from each left ventricular phantom part were divided into eight partitions and filled with (123)I-BMPP (10-100%). The error between theoretical and calculated concentrations was within 20% in the concentration range of â‰¥50%, suggesting a good correlation and indicating the method's validity.
