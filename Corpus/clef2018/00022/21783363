Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of derivatives of the β₁-adrenergic receptor antagonist HX-CH 44. Isopropyl- and fluoroisopropyl-amino derivatives of the β(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist 2-[4-[3-(tert-butyl-amino)-2-hydroxypropoxy]phenyl]-3-methyl-6-methoxy-4(3H)-quinazolinone ((±)HX-CH 44) were synthesized, including a concise and efficient preparation of the core, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-6-methoxy-3-methylquinazolin-4(3H)-one. In vitro binding assays showed that the fluorinated analog was selective towards β(1)-adrenergic receptors over β(2)-adrenergic and 5-HT(1A) receptors. An X-ray crystallographic characterization of the fluorinated analog is also reported.
