Fast-specific tomography imaging via Cerenkov emission. Development of more tumor-specific radiopharmaceuticals is not enough to understand the disease, we must study data modeling. Although fluoro-18-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography can map a multi-peak distribution of trace radioisotopes, optical tomography should also be able to redirect the distribution.Multi-view image acquisition of small animals injected with 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D: -glucose began with X-ray computed tomography scanning and Cerenkov luminescence imaging. After fusion processing, utilization of the geometric row scaling and L                            (1/2) regularization operator effectively generates in vivo Cerenkov luminescence tomography images with the SP(3) forward model.The identification is confirmed by the comparison between tumor-specific tomography from Cerenkov emission and the radioactivity measured in vitro.The proposed technique can quickly localize the mobility of radionuclides and uptake by organs, which provides an imaging methodology in oncology.
