Impaired myocardial flow reserve on rubidium-82 positron emission tomography imaging predicts adverse outcomes in patients assessed for myocardial ischemia. We evaluated the prognostic value of myocardial flow reserve (MFR) using rubidium-82 ((82)Rb) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients assessed for ischemia.The clinical value of MFR quantification using (82)Rb PET beyond relative myocardial perfusion imaging remains uncertain.We prospectively enrolled 704 consecutive patients 677 (96%) completed follow-up (median 387 days [interquartile range: 375 to 416 days]). Patients were divided into 4 groups: I, normal summed stress score (SSS) (<4) and normal myocardial flow reserve (MFR) (>2)For patients with a normal SSS and those with an abnormal SSS, there were significant differences in outcomes for hard events (cardiac death and myocardial infarction) between patients with MFR â‰¥2 and those with MFR <2 (I: 1.3% vs. II: 2% [p = 0.029] III: 1.1% vs. IV: 11.4% [p = 0.05]) and for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively). In the adjusted Cox model, MFR was an independent predictor of hard events (hazard ratio: 3.3MFR quantified using (82)Rb PET predicts hard cardiac events and MACE independent of the SSS and other parameters. Routine assessment of (82)Rb PET-quantified MFR could improve risk stratification for patients being investigated for ischemia.
