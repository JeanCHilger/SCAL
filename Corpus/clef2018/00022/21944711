Diagnosis and management of adrenal incidentaloma. The growing demand for imaging tests and the progressive aging of the population have led to a progressive increase in the detection of indeterminate adrenal lesions. Once an adrenal incidentaloma is detected, clinical and hormone tests together with a battery of imaging techniques (CT, MRI, PET/CTâ€¦) make it possible to determine the cause in most cases. In this article, we discuss the advantages and limitations of each technique. We show the imaging characteristics of the most common adrenal lesions and propose a diagnostic algorithm to enable their diagnosis.
