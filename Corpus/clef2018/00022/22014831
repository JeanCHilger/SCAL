Radiosynthesis of three [11C]ureido-substituted benzenesulfonamides as PET probes for carbonic anhydrase IX in tumors. Three ureido-substituted benzenesulfonamides 1a-c have been developed as potent inhibitors for carbonic anhydrase IX, which is overexpressed in hypoxic tumors. In this study, we labeled these unsymmetrical ureas 1a-c using [(11)C]phosgene ([(11)C]COCl(2)) as a labeling agent with the expectation that [(11)C]1a-c could become promising positron tomography probes for imaging carbonic anhydrase IX in tumors. The strategy for radiosynthesis of [(11)C]1a-c was to react hydrochloride of anilines 2a-c with [(11)C]COCl(2) to give isocyanate [(11)C]4a-c, followed by a reaction with 4-aminobenzenesulfonamide (3).
