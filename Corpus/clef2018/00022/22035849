Microsporidia in household dogs and cats in Iran a zoonotic concern. Microsporidia in dogs and cats is primarily caused by the obligate, intracellular parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi, which is a member of the phylum Microsporidia. The aim of the current study is the detection of this parasite in stool samples of small animals of Iran, by polymerase chain reaction. Microsporidia spp. was found in 31% (31/100) of dogs (E. cuniculi (18/100), Encephalitozoon bieneusi (8/100) and Encephalitozoon intestinalis (5/100)), and 7.5% (3/40) of the specimens obtained from cats were infected with E. bieneusi. Sequencing of PCR products confirmed these results. In conclusion, Microsporidia infection seems to be fairly common in pet animals of Iran, especially in dogs. This finding could indicate the importance of pet animals as zoonotic reservoirs of microsporidial human infections.
