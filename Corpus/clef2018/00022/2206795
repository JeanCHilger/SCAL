Local metabolic responses to cerebral ischemia. The brain is a highly differentiated organ, exhibiting a variety of local metabolic and hemodynamic responses to ischemia. Several analytical strategies are useful in characterizing these abnormalities: these include the direct assay of tissue metabolites topographic methods for depicting regional patterns of NADH, ATP, glucose, lactate, and pH
