Imaging of cervical pathology. A variety of benign and malignant entities affect the uterine cervix. These are discussed and illustrated. Cross-sectional and functional imaging can improve the accuracy of traditional clinical cervical cancer staging. Emphasis is placed on magnetic resonance imaging for initial staging and fused positron emission tomography-computed tomography for restaging and surveillance. The imaging appearance of benign cervical pathology is reviewed with ultrasonography as the first-line imaging modality and magnetic resonance imaging for problem solving in difficult cases.
