The nodal standard uptake value (SUV) as a prognostic factor in head and neck squamous cell cancer. The aim of present study is to evaluate the predictive and prognostic role of high [18F] fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) uptake of primary tumor and nodal metastasis in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (HNSCC).Between February 2006 and July 2010, we retrospectively evaluated 64 patients with primary HNSCC in an institutional imaging trial. All patients who underwent evaluation pretreatment FDG-positron emission tomography/computarized tomography (FDG-PET/CT) imaging and 33 (51%) had pre- and after treatment FDG-PET/CT imaging. All treatments were performed with curative intent. Abnormal FDG uptakes were analyzed using maximum standardized uptake values (SUVm). The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated with several prognostic factors such as pre-treatment SUVm and %change in SUVm.Tumor sites are nasopharynx (n=29, 45.3%), larynx (n=16, 25%), oropharynx (n=13, 20.4%) and hypopharynx (n=6, 9.4%). Median age was 58 (range: 16-87) and most patients (84.4%) had stage III/IV lesions. Objective response rate was 78.2%. The median primary tumor SUVm was 13.4 (range, 4.8-33.1), median nodal SUVm was 4.45 (range, 0-25.6) and median % change in SUVm was 74.1 (range, -61-100). On multivariate analysis, nodal SUVm and surgery remained significant predictors of DFS. There was no statistical significance found between survival and other factors.We have found that while nodal SUVm is prognostic for DFS, primary tumor SUVm and % change in SUVm are not.
