Lymph Node Staging with Choline PET/CT in Patients with Prostate Cancer: A Review. Due to its prevalence, prostate cancer represents a serious health problem. The treatment, when required, may be local in case of limited disease, locoregional if lymph nodes are involved, and systemic when distant metastases are present. In order to choose the best treatment regimen, an accurate disease staging is mandatory. However, the accuracy of conventional imaging modalities in detecting lymph node and bone metastases is low. In the last decade, molecular imaging, particularly, choline PET-CT has been evaluated in this setting. Choline PET represents the more accurate exam to stage high-risk prostate cancer, and it is useful in staging patients with biochemical relapse, in particular when PSA kinetics is high and/or PSA levels are more than 2â€‰pg/ml. The present paper reports results of available papers on these issues, with particular attention to lymph node staging.
