Positron emission tomography in seizure disorders. Positron emission tomography (PET) has been widely used in the study of seizure disorders. As a research tool, PET has been used to determine the pathophysiology of different seizures disorders, prognostic and diagnostic information, and the response to various interventions. PET imaging has also been used clinically to help with the detection of seizure foci. With the continued development of a large array of radiopharmaceuticals that can evaluate all of the components of different neurotransmitter systems as well as cerebral blood flow and metabolism, PET imaging will continue to play a key role in research and clinical applications for seizure disorders.
