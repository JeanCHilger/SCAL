Positron emission tomography response at the time of autologous stem cell transplantation predicts outcome of patients with relapsed and/or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma responding to prior salvage therapy. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is the standard treatment for relapsed and/or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma although half of patients relapse after transplantation. Predictive factors, such as relapse within 12 months, Ann-Arbor stage at relapse, and relapse in previously irradiated fields are classically used to identify patients with poor outcome. Recently, 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography has emerged as a new method for providing information to predict outcome. The aim of this study was to confirm the predictive value of positron emission tomography status after salvage therapy and to compare single versus tandem autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with relapsed and/or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma.We report a series of 111 consecutive patients with treatment-sensitive relapsed and/or treatment-refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma who achieved complete (positron emission tomography-negative group) or partial remission (positron emission tomography-positive group) at positron emission tomography evaluation after salvage chemotherapy and who underwent single or tandem autologous stem cell transplantation.Five-year overall and progression-free survival rates were 81% and 64%, respectively. There were significant differences in 5-year progression-free survival (79% versus 23% P<0.001) and 5-year overall survival (90% versus 55%, P=0.001) between the positron emission tomography-negative and -positive groups, respectively. A complete response, as determined by positron emission tomography evaluation, after salvage therapy predicted significantly better 5-year overall survival rates in both intermediate (91% versus 50%In patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma responding to prior salvage therapy, positron emission tomography response at time of autologous stem cell transplantation favorably influences outcome and enables identification of patients requiring single or tandem transplantation.
