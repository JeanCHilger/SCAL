Validity of simplified 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine uptake measures for monitoring response to chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer. Positron emission tomography using 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT) has been suggested as a means for monitoring response to chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of simplified uptake measures for assessing response to chemotherapy using [(18)F]FLT in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC).Fifteen LABC patients underwent dynamic [(18)F]FLT scans both prior to and after the first cycle of chemotherapy with fluorouracil, epirubicin or doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. The net uptake rate constant of [(18)F]FLT, K ( i ), determined by non-linear regression (NLR) of an irreversible two-tissue compartment model was used as the gold standard. In addition to Patlak graphical analysis, standardised uptake values (SUV) and tumour-to-whole blood ratio (TBR) were used for analysing [(18)F]FLT data. Correlations and relationships between simplified uptake measures and NLR before and after chemotherapy were assessed using regression analysis.No significant differences in both pre- and post-chemotherapy relationships between any of the simplified uptake measures and NLR were found. However, changes in SUV between baseline and post-therapy scans showed a significant negative bias and slope less than one, while TBR did not.In LABC, TBR instead of SUV may be preferred for monitoring response to chemotherapy with [(18)F]FLT.
