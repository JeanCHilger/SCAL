18F-FDG retention index and biologic prognostic parameters in breast cancer. To analyze the correlation between [(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-FDG) uptake assessed by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in breast tumors and histopathologic and immunohistochemical prognostic factors.Sixty-eight women with breast cancer were prospectively evaluated. PET/CT was requested in the initial staging previous to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (multicentric study).All the patients underwent a standard (18)F-FDG PET/CT followed by a delayed acquisition, 1 hour (PET-1) and 3 hours (PET-2) after FDG administration. Both examinations were evaluated qualitatively and semiquantitatively (SUV(max) values) in PET-1 (SUV-1) and in PET-2 (SUV-2). The percentage variation of the standard uptake values (retention index) between PET-1 and PET-2 was calculated.Clinical and metabolic stages were assessed according to TNM classification. All biologic prognostic parameters, such as the receptor status, p53 and c-erbB-2 expression, proliferation rate (Ki-67), and grading were determined from tissue of the primary tumor. Metabolic, clinical, and biologic parameters were correlated.A positive relationship was found between the SUV(max), tumor size, clinical, and metabolic stages. SUV-1 and SUV-2 values showed significant statistical correlation (P < 0.05) with PET stage and tumor size assessed by PET. On the contrary, the retention index showed relation with clinical stage (P < 0.05).When related to the biologic parameters, retention index showed the best results, with positive and significant relation (P < 0.05), with histologic grade, and Ki-67 and c-erbB-2 expression. Isolated SUV values only showed significant relation to Ki-67 expression.The retention index showed the best relation with biologic and clinical parameters compared with isolated SUVmax values for what could be a predictive marker of tumor biologic behavior.
