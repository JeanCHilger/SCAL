 Ghrelin is a 28-amino-acid peptide hormone that is produced and secreted mainly by the gastric mucosa and triggers the secretion of growth hormone (GH) from the pituitary by binding to the ghrelin receptor (previously known as the GH secretagogue receptor 1a or GHSR1a) (1). Although ghrelin is known to have several endocrine functions, investigators are interested in this molecule primarily because it is known to stimulate appetite, promote energy storage, and play a role in the development of obesity (1, 2). Therefore, the ghrelin/GHSR pathway is considered to be an important target for the treatment of obesity, cachexia, and anorexia (2, 3). However, ghrelin has a low stability while in circulation, and there is a lack of information regarding its
