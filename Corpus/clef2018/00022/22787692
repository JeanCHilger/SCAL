Activatable Alexa Fluor680-conjugated panitumumab and indocyanine green-conjugated trastuzumab cocktail The cocktail of activatable Alexa Fluor680 (Alexa680)-conjugated panitumumab (Pan) and indocyanine green (ICG)-conjugated trastuzumab (Tra) is a mixture of two self-quenched (SQ), activatable monoclonal antibody (mAb) probes (abbreviated as Pan-Alexa680 and Tra-ICG, respectively) that was developed by Sano et al. for multicolor optical imaging of breast cancer (1). mAbs are widely used to develop optical imaging probes because of their high specificity and affinity to target antigens. However, use of intact mAbs as imaging probes has some disadvantages, such as slow clearance from body, which results in high background and slow penetration of solid tumors (2, 3). To overcome this issue, activatable or “smart” fluorescent probes have been engineered to be silent (fluorescence quenching) but emit signal when or after binding with antigens in the tissue of interest (4, 5). Several photochemical mechanisms of fluorescence quenching and activation have been proposed in the literature, such as homo- (SQ) and hetero-Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), autoquenching, dimer formation, and photon-induced electron transfer (PeT) (2, 6, 7). Self-quenching of the fluorescence occurs when two excited fluorophores of the same molecule are close enough (<10 nm) to enable them to absorb energy from each other. Hetero-FRET refers to the quenching that occurs between two fluorophores from different molecules (a fluorophore and a quencher molecule). Autoquenching has been observed for some compounds, which can spontaneously induce a quenched state when conjugated with proteins. Autoquenching appears to be induced by the interactions between fluorophores and aromatic rings of amino acids. ICG is a dye that can be fully autoquenched when it is covalently conjugated with mAbs
