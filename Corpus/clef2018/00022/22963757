Allogeneic adipose-derived stem cells with low immunogenicity constructing tissue-engineered bone for repairing bone defects in pigs. The ideal cells for tissue engineering should have the following characteristics: easy obtainment, safety, immune privilege, the capability of self-renewal, and multipotency. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are a promising candidate. However, the immunogenicity of allogeneic mesenchymal  stem cells limits their long-term benefits. In this study, we introduced human cytomegalovirus US2/US3 gene into the ADSCs to decrease the expression of MHC I protein of ADSCs and reduce the activation of T-cells of the recipient animals. Moreover, the biosafety and biological characteristics  of ADSCs transfected with the US2/US3 genes (ADSCs-US2/US3) were similar to normal ADSCs. Then we took ADSCs-US2/US3 to construct a tissue-engineered bone for repairing bone defects in pigs and found that there were no great differences in repair effects or healing time between the allogeneic  ADSCs-US2/US3 group and the autologous ADSC group. These results suggest that allogeneic ADSCs-US2/US3 have the advantages of biological safety, low immunogenicity, and effective osteogenesis. Such barely immunogenic ADSCs will be crucial for the success of future tissue-regenerative approaches.
