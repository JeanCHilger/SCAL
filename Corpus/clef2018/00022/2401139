Primin standard patch testing: 5 years experience. From 1 November 1984 to 1 November 1989. 3075 patients (1949 female and 1126 male) were patch tested with the European standard series, including primin 0.01% pet. 57 positive reactions were obtained (1.8%). About 95% of the patients with positive patch tests were female. 60% of the patch-test-positive patients were above age 60 and 35% above 70 years. The test was negative in all under the age of 20 and rarely positive under the age of 35 years. Only 2 patients had probable patch test sensitization observed 8 and 14 days after application of the test material. 41% of the patients with positive reactions had current primula dermatitis at the time of patch testing. The frequency and high degree of current relevance justify inclusion of primin in the standard series, at least in certain geographical regions. The patch test concentration of 0.01% pet. seems to be correct.
