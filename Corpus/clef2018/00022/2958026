Comparison of the accumulation kinetics of L-(methyl-11C)-methionine and D-(methyl-11C)-methionine in brain tumors studied with positron emission tomography. Five patients with glioma were examined with positron emission tomography after the administration of 11C-L-methionine and at a following day with 11C-D-methionine. The rates of accumulation of the tracers were determined in the tumor and in the normal brain tissue according to a graphical technique of Patlak et coll. The accumulation rates for L-methionine were on the average 2.4 times higher than those of D-methionine in the tumors. The corresponding ration for normal brain tissue was 2.3. It is concluded that in this group of tumors without obvious blood-tumor-barrier breakdown, a stereospecific process with similar properties as in the normal brain tissue, is responsible for the accumulation of the labelled methionine.
