Regional cerebral blood flow changes in aging. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes during the aging process were studied, using 131Xe inhalation and emission computed tomography in 38 healthy, non-hypertensive, alert and active volunteers (23-65 years of age). The rCBF showed a slight but statistically non-significant negative correlation. As regards cerebrovascular resistance (CVR), significant correlation to aging was observed, and there was an increase of CVR after the forties compared with the twenties. This appeared to be due to the positive correlation of blood pressure to aging.
