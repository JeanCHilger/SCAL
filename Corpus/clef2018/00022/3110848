Effects of amphetamine on local cerebral metabolism in normal and schizophrenic subjects as determined by positron emission tomography. The effects of d-amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg PO) on regional cerebral glucose utilization were measured with Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Subjects included ten chronic schizophrenics and six controls who received amphetamine, and six chronic schizophrenics and nine controls who received placebo or no treatment. Amphetamine decreased glucose metabolism in all regions studied (frontal, temporal, and striatal) in normal and schizophrenic subjects. The metabolic effects of amphetamine were correlated with plasma level of the drug. Cortical atrophy was associated with a blunted metabolic response.
