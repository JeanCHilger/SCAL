Meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy in neuroblastoma--a comparison with conventional X-ray and ultrasound. To evaluate the accuracy of meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging in comparison with bone X-ray and ultrasound, 15 patients with histologically verified neuroblastoma were investigated using 123- or 131MIBG scintigraphy. 123MIBG and 131MIBG are used as the abbreviations for 123-iodine-labeled-MIBG and 131-iodine-labeled-MIBG, respectively. Either 7.4 MBq 131MIBG (n = 4) or 111-185 MBq 123MIBG (n = 11) was applied, and scans were performed 24 and 48 h PI. Anatomical orientation was provided in selected cases by single-photon emission CT or scintigraphy of other organs. X-ray procedures or ultrasound depicted 27 neuroblastoma manifestations (primary tumors and metastatic deposits) 24 of these (89%) were identified by MIBG scintigraphy. Of 42 primary neuroblastomas and metastatic deposits, 27 (64%) were detected by corresponding bone X-ray or ultrasound. The 15 neuroblastoma lesions depicted solely by MIBG scans were mainly (80%) situated in the skeletal system. Because of the pronounced physiological MIBG uptake by liver tissue, detection of intrahepatic or perihepatic tumor involvement is difficult. MIBG scintigraphy is a safe and noninvasive means of locating a wide range of neuroblastoma lesions. Its main diagnostic advantage in comparison with bone X-ray lies in the detection of bone marrow infiltration.
