Infarct size related to the distribution and site of coronary artery lesions studied by the unfolded map technique using single photon emission computed tomography. To assess the relative importance of the anatomical characteristics of the coronary artery distribution and the sites of the arterial stenoses in relation to infarct size, 21 patients with old myocardial infarction and angiographically-proven 90% or greater stenoses (AHA classification) of one of the major coronary arteries were studied. The infarct size was evaluated by a new quantitative method, the unfolded map, derived from single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Eleven patients had right coronary artery disease (Group RCA: segment 1 five patients and segment 2
