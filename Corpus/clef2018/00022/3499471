Single photon emission computed tomography of the heart: a functional image? Images of radioactive tracer uptake are mainly functional images since the tracer distribution may directly be related to the regional variations in function, such as myocardial perfusion in the case of thallium-201 single photon tomography. Combination of pictures obtained in different physiological conditions (stress-rest, for instance) enhance the functional aspects of these studies. For gated cardiac blood pool images, on the contrary, labelling of the circulating blood pool using technetium-99m provides morphological pictures of the heart chambers and function can only be derived from the dynamic analysis of the image sequence recorded at the successive phases of the cardiac cycle. The technique of 'thick slice' tomography preserves the relationship between count rates and local volumes of radioactive blood. Parametric imaging therefore applies to tomography as well as to plane projections. In the simplest case reconstruction of the extreme phases of the heart beat, end-diastole and end-systole may be sufficient. But to achieve more sophisticated functional analysis such as Fourier phase mapping, reconstruction of the whole cardiac cycle is necessary.
