Use of graphical techniques for error evaluation. Anatomic localization in functional (such as PET) imaging often requires a structural (such as CT or NMRI) study of the brain in the same plane. Some neuropsychiatric conditions make it difficult for a patient to hold his/her head immobile even when a rigid head holder is used. We studied the effect of tilt of the anatomic reference image, in this instance CT, relative to the functional image, here PET, on the quantification of receptor ligand concentration in anatomically defined regions of the brain.
