A review of the roles of pet animals in psychotherapy and with the elderly. A survey of case histories, anecdotal evidence and pilot studies shows that, as therapeutic adjuncts, pet animals facilitate rapport and otherwise enrich the treatment milieu. Similar evidence shows that pets enhance the lives of their owners in the community. Pet-facilitated psychotherapy (PFP) can increase social interaction, provide comfort and support, and reinforce feelings of independence. Replication and expansion of existing studies are recommended to further explore how pet animals may enrich the lives of members of psychiatric and geriatric populations.
