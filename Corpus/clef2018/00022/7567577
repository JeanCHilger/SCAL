Animal-assisted therapy in the intensive care unit. A staff nurse's dream comes true. This article presents an example of how one staff nurse was able to implement change in clinical practice on the basis of research. After reviewing the literature on AAT, I was able to implement this therapy for critically ill patients and families. Patient satisfaction surveys indicate that patients have benefited from this change. Patients report feelings of increased happiness, calmness, more feelings of love, and less loneliness. This example shows how staff nurses, a highly motivated and knowledgeable group, provide a fertile arena for bridging the research-practice gap.
