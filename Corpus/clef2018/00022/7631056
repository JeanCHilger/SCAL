Transplantation of fetal mesencephalic tissue in Parkinson's patients. Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who had become refractory to medical treatment underwent unilateral stereotactic transplantation of mesencephalic tissue obtained from 7- to 9-week-old postconception fetuses. Small pieces of tissue, less than 1 mm, were deposited in 9 sites in the putamen and 3 in the caudate. Patients were 4 men and 3 women and aged from 42 to 59 years (mean 50). Symptom durations were from 9 to 21 years (mean 14). The examinations were done at 3- to 4-month intervals pre- and postoperatively. Patients were examined for a minimum of 1 year postoperatively. The examinations consisted of neurological and general physical examinations, UCLA Parkinson's Disability Scale, Hoehn and Yahr rating and United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (PDRS), all in both 'on' and 'off' states. Video recordings and timed tests of a number of motor tests were performed. Patients also completed 7 consecutive days of hourly self-assessments prior to each visit. Fluorodopa PET scans were obtained pre- and 6 and 15 months postoperatively. The operations took place from mid-July 1992 to January 1993. Postoperative states have been free of complications. All have been on immunosuppressants. Levodopa was transiently decreased in the postoperative period, but raised to approximately the preoperative level thereafter. In late March 1993, 3 patients appeared to show modest improvement in the UCLA and UPDRS scales and in the patients' self-assessments.
