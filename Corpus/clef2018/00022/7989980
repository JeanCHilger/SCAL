Clinical validation of SPECT and CT/MRI image registration in radiolabeled monoclonal antibody studies of colorectal carcinoma. Registration methods combine the anatomic localizing ability of CT or MRI with SPECT images of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (Mabs), allowing the accurate staging of patients prior to surgery or following treatment.Twenty-four patients (15 males and 9 females, mean age 55 yr, range 29-70 yr) were studied with this technique. Ten patients had suspected colorectal cancer recurrence and were infused with 10 mCi of 131I-CC49 prior to staging laparotomy. Fourteen patients treated in a Phase I radioimmunotherapy study with 131I-CC49 were also studied. All patients underwent SPECT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis 5-7 days following infusion of Mab.Phantom studies demonstrated a 3.6-mm surface fitting mean accuracy of datasets for the liver and 1.8 mm for an intrahepatic tumor. In the presurgical group, SPECT and CT/MRI registration allowed more accurate identification of uptake abnormal sites. Areas of metastatic disease > 1 cm confirmed at surgery were found in six of nine patients with liver lesions and in two patients with extrahepatic (including one patient with pelvic) disease. In patients imaged following radioimmunotherapy, all lesions > 1.5 cm seen on CT/MRI were identified, and activity distribution in tumor and normal tissue could be more accurately assessed.Routine registration of SPECT and CT/MRI images is feasible and allows more accurate anatomic assessment of sites of abnormal uptake in radiolabeled Mab studies.
