Noradrenaline depletion in patients with coronary artery disease before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine and single-photon emission tomography. Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a noradrenaline analogue which can be used as a tracer to investigate the cardiac sympathetic nervous system. Regional ischaemia leads to noradrenaline depletion with functional denervation which can be demonstrated by reduced MIBG uptake. In order to evaluate the reversibility of ischaemia-associated damage to the sympathetic nervous system, neuronal scintigraphy with 123I-MIBG and myocardial rest and stress perfusion scintigraphy with technetium-99m sestamibi was performed in 16 patients with coronary artery disease before and 3-4 months after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Partial re-innervation occurred in five patients, the degree of stenosis of remaining lesions being estimated by repeat angiography to be below 40%. Unchanged MIBG defects could be confirmed in four patients with residual lesions of between 40% and 50%. Increased MIBG defects were shown in three patients with significant restenoses of more than 70%. In all patients the neuronal defects exceeded the ischaemia-induced or scar-associated perfusion defects. Three patients dropped out of this study: one for technical reasons, one due to emergency aortocoronary bypass surgery and one due to diabetic polyneuropathy. This investigation shows that the sympathetic nervous system is highly sensitive to ischaemia. Further studies need to be done to assess the conditions allowing re-innervation after PTCA.
