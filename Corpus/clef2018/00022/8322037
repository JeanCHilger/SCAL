Neuroimaging in schizophrenia research. Neuroimaging has advanced the study of brain structure and function in schizophrenia. Magnetic resonance imaging provides measures of whole brain and regional anatomy and cerebrospinal fluid volume. Functional methods have included the Xenon-133 technique for measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) positron emission tomography for assessing metabolism, CBF, and neuroreceptor functioning
