Monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) inhibitor therapy in Parkinson's disease: the degree and reversibility of human brain MAO B inhibition by Ro 19 6327. The possibility of slowing the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) with inhibitors of monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) has stimulated the development of new MAO B inhibitor drugs. Ro 19 6327 is a highly selective inhibitor of MAO B currently under clinical investigation. We used positron emission tomography (PET) and the MAO B tracer [11C]L-deprenyl to determine the degree and reversibility of human brain MAO B inhibition by Ro 19 6327 in six early Parkinson's disease patients who were treated with different doses of Ro 19 6327 (25 mg [n = 3], 50 mg [n = 2], and 100 mg [n = 1] 0.34 to 1.4 mg/kg) every 12 hours for 1 week. Each patient had three PET scans to assess baseline MAO B activity, degree of trough inhibition, and reversibility. A control group of four elderly normal subjects was scanned twice to assess reproducibility of repeated measures. Four of the patients showed reduction of MAO B concentration to 1% to 7% of baseline on doses of 0.43 mg/kg or greater, and the remaining two at 0.34 mg/kg showed significant but incomplete inhibition (10% to 21% of baseline in the global region and in the thalamus, basal ganglia, and mesencephalon). Thus, 0.4 mg/kg or greater of Ro 19 6327 given every 12 hours is the minimum dose necessary to provide > 90% inhibition of brain MAO B in patients with early PD. Brain MAO B activity returned to baseline values by 36 hours after drug discontinuation.
