Evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function using gated SPECT with 99mTc-MIBI. Development of 3 head SPECT system and 99mTc-labeled radiopharmaceuticals enable us to evaluate left ventricular systolic function on the basis of once gated SPECT routine. This study was focused on assessment of left ventricular diastolic function using 99mTc-MIBI gated SPECT data. Twenty nine patients with ischemic heart diseases underwent 99mTc-MIBI gated SPECT and 99mTc-HSAD ventriculographic assessment of left ventricular diastolic function within 1 month. Region of interests (ROI), simultaneously calculating counts per pixel within ROI, were placed over whole myocardium of 16 serial phasic images reconstructed from gated SPECT data, following selection of the central slice within short axial images. Then, 29 patients were classified into 3 patterns of phase count curve (normal, mixed, and delayed relaxation = diastolic dysfunction). Moreover, 1/3 Count Decreasing Fraction (1/3 CDF) was calculated on the same concept as 1/3 FF. The curve pattern showed significant differences between normal and abnormal group divided on the basis of established indices such as 1/3 FF and PFR, and 1/3 CDF has correlations with 1/3 FF (r = 0.61) and PFR (r = 0.58). We concluded that the new parameters drawn from 99mTc-MIBI gated SPECT data might be feasible for evaluation of diastolic function.
