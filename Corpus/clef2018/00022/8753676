Quantitative evaluation of neutral amino acid transport in cerebral gliomas using positron emission tomography and fluorine-18 fluorophenylalanine. To elucidate the mechanism of large neutral amino acid (LNAA) transport in cerebral gliomas and to evaluate the clinical usefulness of positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 fluorophenylalanine (18F-Phe), we examined 18 patients with cerebral glioma using dynamic PET and 18F-Phe. By employing two-compartment model analysis, the influx rate K1, the efflux rate k2 and the distribution volume (Vd) of 18F-Phe were estimated in tumour tissue and contralateral normal grey matter. 18F-Phe showed increased accumulation in tumour tissue regardless of the grade of malignancy in all patients. The rate of uptake of 18F-Phe in high-grade glioma was significantly higher than in low-grade glioma (P <0.05). However, it was difficult to evaluate the tumour grade only from the 18F-Phe accumulation in individual cases. Values of K1 and Vd were significantly increased in the tumour tissue. The K1 value of the tumour tissue tended to decrease with increasing LNAA concentration in plasma. Therefore, influx of 18F-Phe into tumour tissue is mainly related to the carrier-mediated active transport. It is concluded that PET with 18F-Phe is of clinical value for tumour detection rather than assessment of tumour malignancy.
