Relationships between cerebral regional blood flow velocities and volumetric blood flows and their respective reactivities to acetazolamide. The technique of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) is widely used for assessment of cerebral blood flow velocity. Whether measurement of changes in TCD velocity can be used for studying volumetric cerebral blood flow variations remains a matter of debate. We therefore investigated the relationship between flow velocity and volumetric cerebral blood flow before and during acetazolamide-induced vasodilation.The middle cerebral artery mean blood flow velocity (MV) measured by TCD and the corresponding regional and hemispheric cerebral blood flows assessed with 133Xe single-photon emission CT were measured in 52 unselected patients. Absolute values of flow and velocity before and after stimulation and their reactivity to acetazolamide were compared. When the correlation was statistically significant, the linearity of the relationship was tested.Absolute values of hemispheric cerebral blood flow were correlated with MV both before (r = .315, P = .02) and after acetazolamide (r = .436, P = .001), whereas regional cerebral blood flow was correlated with MV only after acetazolamide (before, r = .262, P = .06 after, r = .446, P = .001). All these relationships fitted a linear model. In contrast, there was no correlation between acetazolamide-induced relative increments of flow and velocity.Our results support a linear model describing the relationship between absolute values of flow and velocity when arterial section is the slope and anastomotic blood flow is the intercept. In contrast, relative increments in volumetric flow and velocity may be proportional only if anastomotic flow is negligible, ie, in subjects without cerebrovascular disease. We conclude that, for patients with cerebrovascular disease, TCD does not satisfactorily model cerebral vasoreactivity in terms of volumetric cerebral blood flow.
