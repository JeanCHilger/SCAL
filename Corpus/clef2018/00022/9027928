Temporal lobe dysfunction and correlation of regional cerebral blood flow abnormalities with psychopathology in schizophrenia and major depression--a study with single photon emission computed tomography. Studies of regional cerebral blood flow in both schizophrenic and depressed patients have yielded contradictory findings. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was used to compare brain-perfusion patterns in 17 patients with schizophrenia and 12 patients with major depression and to evaluate the relationship of the findings to psychopathology. The images were analyzed both visually and quantitatively. Twelve of the 17 schizophrenic patients and 8 of the 12 depressed patients showed a pathological blood flow pattern. Hypoperfusion of the left temporal lobe was observed in seven of the schizophrenic and five of the depressed patients. Five of the schizophrenic patients also had a hypoperfusion of the left frontal lobe. Separation of both diagnostic cohorts in two subgroups with pathological and normal cerebral blood flow patterns revealed significantly higher levels of symptomatology in the group with hypoperfusion in the SPECT image. The analysis of different cerebral regions revealed statistically significant temporal hypoperfusion was significantly related to positive symptoms in schizophrenia. Our data suggest that left-sided temporal lobe dysfunction is related both to schizophrenia and major depression. The localization of hypoperfusion seems to be associated with the type of psychopathology (positive vs. negative symptoms in schizophrenia). Thus, the results support the model of paralimbic and prefrontal dysfunction in both diseases.
