Effect of two dietary regimens on gingivitis in the dog. The effect of two commercially available dietary regimens on the development of gingivitis and the accumulation of dental plaque, calculus and stain in the dog were studied. One regimen consisted of feeding an oral hygiene chew and a standard dry diet. The other was based on a specifically designed oral care dry main meal. The study was conducted using 15 dogs in a two period, parallel cross-over design. Each period consisted of a one week pretest phase followed by a three week test phase. During the test phase, gingivitis and plaque were measured after one week and gingivitis, calculus, stain and plaque were measured after a further two weeks. Comparison of the two regimens showed that there were equal amounts of gingivitis, plaque and calculus by the end of the study. There was significantly more stain and significant loss in bodyweight when the main meal was fed. The role of dietary modification in the maintenance of periodontal health is discussed.
