Relation of direct assessment of cardiac autonomic function with metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging to heart rate variability in diabetes mellitus. Myocardial metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake predicts autonomic function in patients with diabetes mellitus and is significantly related to indexes reflecting sympathetic neural modulation of heart rate variability.
