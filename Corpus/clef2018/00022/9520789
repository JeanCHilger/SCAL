The role of tooth-brushing and diet in the maintenance of periodontal health in dogs. Tooth-brushing every other day did not maintain clinically healthy gingivae in dogs. The daily addition of a dental hygiene chew to a regimen of tooth brushing every other day reduced the gingivitis scores and reduced the accumulation of dental deposits (plaque, calculus and stain). Daily tooth-brushing should be the recommendation to the dog owner irrespective of dietary regimen. Providing a dental hygiene chew daily seems to give an added health benefit when tooth-brushing is less frequent, and provides the pet owner with a useful adjunct for homecare.
