Histological verification of positive fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose findings in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a new imaging modality used in the follow-up of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer if the results of (131)I scintigraphy are negative in spite of an elevated thyroglobulin level. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to estimate the value of FDG-PET regarding the operability of patients with positive findings. From January 1994 to October 1997, we investigated 60 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma by FDG-PET. Thirteen patients were operated on after positive findings. Most of these lesions were suspected of having lymph-node involvement or local recurrences in the thyroid bed. One patient showed a solitary distant metastasis in the scapula. Thirteen of 16 operations in these 13 patients confirmed the suspected involvement of thyroid cancer. The false-positive findings were caused by inflamed lymph nodes in two cases and benign thymus tissue in one case. We conclude that PET is a useful diagnostic tool to guide early surgical therapy in patients with (131)I negative differentiated thyroid carcinoma.
