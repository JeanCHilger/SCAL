Regional cerebral blood flow determination using 133Xe and a standard rotating gamma-camera. While most of the methods for quantitative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) determination in man requires expensive fast devices, a method is proposed using single photon emission computed tomography with a conventional rotating gamma camera and 133Xe inhalation. It is tested using a computer simulation of a cerebral exam and a simplified CBF map as a model. The results obtained show that this method is relevant and can be tested in clinical studies.
