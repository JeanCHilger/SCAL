Reversible perfusion defects on exercise tomographic thallium imaging in patients with and without collateral flow. A consecutive series of patients underwent exercise thallium imaging and coronary angiography that identified single-vessel right coronary artery disease. Redistribution in the left anterior descending territory was significantly associated with the presence of left-to-right collaterals, whereas collaterals were significantly less frequent in individuals who did not exhibit redistribution.
