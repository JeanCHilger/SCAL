Changes of cerebral blood flow during short-term exposure to normobaric hypoxia. Decreased arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO2) below a certain level presents a strong stimulus for increasing cerebral blood flow. Although several field studies examined the time course of global cerebral blood flow (gCBF) changes during hypoxia at high altitude, little was known about the regional differences in the flow pattern. Positron emission tomography (PET) with [(15)O]H2O was used on eight healthy volunteers to assess regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during short-term exposure to hypoxia corresponding to simulated altitudes of 3,000 and 4,500 m. Scans at the simulated altitudes were preceded and followed by baseline scans at the altitude of Zurich (450 m, baseline-1 and baseline-2). Each altitude stage lasted 20 minutes. From baseline to 4,500 m, gCBF increased from 34.4 +/- 5.9 to 41.6 +/- 9.0 mL x minute(-1) x 100 g(-1) (mean +/- SD), whereas no significant change was noted at 3,000 m. During baseline-2 the flow values returned to those of baseline-1. Statistical parametric mapping identified the hypothalamus as the only region with excessively increased blood flow at 4,500 m (+32.8% +/- 21.9% relative to baseline-1). The corresponding value for the thalamus, the structure with the second largest increase, was 19.2% +/- 16.3%. Compared with the rest of the brain, an excessive increase of blood flow during acute exposure to hypoxia is found in the hypothalamus. The functional implications are at present unclear. Further studies of this finding should elucidate its meaning and especially focus on a potential association with the symptoms of acute mountain sickness.
