Telematics techniques for image based diagnosis, therapy planning and monitoring. This paper is intended to describe and illustrate some of the actual use of telematics related techniques together with modern biomedical imaging capabilities for helping in diagnosis, as well as for the planning and monitoring of therapy. To this end, most current imaging modalities are initially introduced. Then it is shown how telematics related techniques are necessary to improve the outcome of current image-based protocols. Such techniques allow data, means, or competencies--which may intrinsically be of a complementary nature or distributed at many different locations--to be integrated together and transcend the simple sum of individual expectations. Examples of actual implementations are given in the fields of radio-oncology, neurosurgery and orthopedics. To conclude, the papers and posters presented in the corresponding session of the MIE'97 symposium are summarized to provide further telematics references for the reader.
