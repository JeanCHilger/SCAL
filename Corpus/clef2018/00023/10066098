Thallium-201 SPECT as response parameter for PCV chemotherapy in recurrent glioma. Combination chemotherapy with procarbazine, CCNU and vincristine (PCV) may be effective in patients with recurrent glioma. Response monitoring is mandatory, but radiological response evaluation is often difficult. We evaluated Thallium-201 (201Tl) SPECT as a response parameter in ten patients treated with intensive PCV chemotherapy for recurrent glioma. 201Tl-SPECT studies showed early changes (decreasing volume and intensity) in nine patients and these changes were more pronounced than radiological findings. 201Tl-SPECT results after completion of chemotherapy seemed to correlate with clininal findings during follow up. We conclude that 201Tl-SPECT may contribute to the assessment of response in patients treated with PCV chemotherapy for recurrent glioma.
