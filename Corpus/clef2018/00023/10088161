11C-acetate clearance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This study assessed 11C-acetate turnover (clearance) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Data were acquired by dynamic PET after the intravenous injection of 4.625 MBq.kg-1 body weight of 11C-acetate for 30 min. Tomograms were reconstructed and evaluated visually. A time-activity curve of the nasopharynx and neck was generated and the clearance rate of 11C-acetate from the nasopharynx in the slow phase and from NPC was calculated using 0.693/T1/2. Ten patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and nine normal subjects were studied. The clearance of 11C-acetate from the normal nasopharynx was rapid and biexponential, in contrast to the rapid uptake followed by extremely slow clearance in patients with NPC. The clearance rate (mean +/- S.D.) was 0.0074 +/- 0.0042 in NPC and 0.0263 +/- 0.0152 in controls in the slow phase, being significantly different between the two groups with no overlap. All nasopharyngeal carcinomas were clearly visualized, in contrast to no obvious retention in the normal nasopharynx. Our initial results indicate that 11C-acetate clearance can be used to differentiate nasopharyngeal carcinoma from a normal nasopharynx. This finding may lead to new applications of 11C-acetate in oncology.
