111In-labelled bleomycin complex for the differentiation of high- and low-grade gliomas. The aim of this study was to evaluate 111In-labelled bleomycin complex (111In-BLMC) SPET in the differentiation of high- and low-grade gliomas. Nineteen glioma patients, 14 with high-grade and five with low-grade tumours, were studied 1, 4 and 24 h after the injection of 111In-BLMC. In the high-grade glioma group, there was significant uptake of 111In-BLMC in 12 patients and no uptake in two patients based on the visual classification of SPET images at 4 and 24 h. In the low-grade glioma group, one patient had low uptake at 4 and 24 h, but the other four patients showed no visible uptake. The mean tumour to extracerebral circulation activity ratio (T/Cr) at 4 h was 0.13 +/- 0.10 (n = 5) in low-grade gliomas and 1.7 +/- 1.0 (n = 14) in high-grade gliomas. At 24 h the T/Cr ratios were 0.56 +/- 0.21 and 3.4 +/- 1.7, respectively. The mean tumour to contralateral normal brain activity ratios (T/Br) were 5.0 +/- 3.9 (4 h) and 3.0 +/- 2.8 (24 h) in low-grade gliomas, and 37.2 +/- 37.3 (4 h) and 8.3 +/- 8.2 (24 h) in high-grade gliomas. These higher T/Br ratios did not, however, result in improved differentiation between the two groups of gliomas at 4 h the T/Cr and T/Br ratios were of equal value, as two high-grade gliomas would have been misclassified as low-grade, but at 24 h the T/Br ratio resulted in more misclassifications. Our results show that 111In-BLMC can be used in the differentiation of high- and low-grade gliomas and that the selection of the reference area for calculating tumour to non-tumour ratios is important.
