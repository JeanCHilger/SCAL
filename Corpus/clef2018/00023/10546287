Breast procedures and imaging techniques. A variety of image-guided procedures and new imaging techniques are being used to supplement film-screen mammography and surgical biopsy in detection and evaluation of breast cancer. This article describes and evaluates several of these techniques, including image-guided needle procedures, galactography, magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy and positron emission mammography. Studies suggest these procedures may lead to more accurate characterization of breast masses and less surgery for breast cancer patients.
