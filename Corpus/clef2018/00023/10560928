Medial temporal lobe activation during episodic encoding and retrieval: a PET study. Recent neuroimaging studies have obtained evidence of activation in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) during episodic encoding and retrieval. On the basis of a meta-analysis of MTL activations in studies that used positron emission tomography (PET), Lepage et al. (Hippocampus 19988:313-322) suggested that episodic encoding tends to involve the anterior MTL, whereas episodic retrieval tends to involve the posterior MTL. In a meta-analysis of studies that used PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging, Schacter and Wagner (Hippocampus 1999
