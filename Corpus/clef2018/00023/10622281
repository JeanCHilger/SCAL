A selective radiobrominated cocaine analogue for imaging of dopamine uptake sites: pharmacological evaluation and PET experiments. (E)-N-(3-bromoprop-2-enyl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-4'-tolyl -nortropane or PE2Br, an analogue of cocaine was labelled with the positron emitter 76Br (T1/2=16 h) for pharmacological evaluation in the rat and PET investigation in the monkey. [76Br]PE2Br was obtained by electrophilic substitution from the tributylstannyl precursor with radiochemical yield of 80%. In vivo biodistribution studies of [76Br]PE2Br (20 MBq/nmol) in rats showed a high uptake in the striatum (2.2% ID/g tissue at 15 min p.i.). The striatum to cerebellum radioactivity ratio was 6 at 1 hour p.i. Striatal uptake of [76Br]PE2Br was almost completely prevented by pretreatment with GBR 12909, but citalopram and maprotiline had no effect, confirming the selectivity of the radioligand for the dopamine transporter. PET imaging of the biodistribution of [76Br]PE2Br in the baboon demonstrated rapid and high uptake in the brain (5% ID at 3 min p.i.). The striatal radioactivity concentration reached a plateau at 20 min p.i. (7% ID/100 mL). The uptake in the cortex and cerebellum was very low. A significantly higher uptake in the thalamus was observed. At 1h p.i., the striatum to cerebellum ratio and thalamus to cerebellum ratio were 8 and 1.9 respectively. In competition experiments the radioactivity in the striatum and the thalamus was displaced by 5 mg/kgof cocaine and 5 mg/kg of GBR 12909, but citalopram and maprotiline had no effect. These results showed that [76Br]PE2Br is in vivo a potent and selective radioligand suitable for PET imagingof the dopamine transporter.
