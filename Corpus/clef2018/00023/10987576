Pathophysiology of human epilepsy: imaging and physiologic studies. Recent advances in research into the pathophysiology of human epilepsies and in neuroimaging, especially magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, positron emission tomography and magnetoelectroencephalography, have resulted in improvements in the localization of both the epileptogenic tissue and functionally important areas. The ability to correlate functional disturbances and lesions has been clarified, which has led to a better understanding of plasticity and epilepsy.
