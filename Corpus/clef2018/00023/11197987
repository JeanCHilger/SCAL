Glucose metabolism of breast cancer assessed by 18F-FDG PET: histologic and immunohistochemical tissue analysis. Breast cancer is characterized by elevated glucose consumption resulting in increased uptake of 18F-FDG. However, tracer uptake varies considerably among tumors imaged with PET. This study compared histologic and immunohistochemical tissue analysis of breast carcinomas with preoperative FDG uptake assessed by PET to identify tumor characteristics that define the degree of tracer accumulation.FDG uptake in breast tumors was quantified by calculating standardized uptake values (SUVs) corrected for partial-volume effect and normalized to blood glucose level at the time of tracer injection. The histologic sections of 50 invasive and 6 noninvasive breast carcinomas were analyzed for histologic type, microscopic tumor growth pattern, percentage of tumor cells, presence of inflammatory cells, density of blood vessels, histopathologic grading, tumor cell proliferation (mitotic rate and antibody binding of MIB-1), expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors, and expression of the glucose transporter protein Glut-1.A positive correlation was found between FDG uptake and histologic tumor type (ductal vs. lobular P = 0.003), microscopic tumor growth pattern (nodular vs. diffuseHistologic and immunohistochemical tissue analysis was unable to sufficiently explain the variation of FDG uptake in breast cancer. The degree of metabolic changes after malignant transformation is most likely explained by a complex interaction between cellular energy demand and tumoral microenvironment. Therefore, FDG PET imaging may not be used to estimate tumor biologic behavior of breast cancer such as differentiation, histopathologic grading, cell proliferation, or axillary lymph node status.
