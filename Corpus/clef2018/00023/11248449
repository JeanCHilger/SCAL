Congestion bleedings of the face and cardiopulmonary resuscitation--an attempt to evaluate their relationship. Are any other factors besides the factor "cause of death" involved in the development of petechial hemorrhages (PET) of the head? The significance of the cause of death is well known, other factors have been rarely investigated in medical literature. Do they include cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), as has been claimed in several forensic publications?(a) 473 consecutive autopsy cases (without strangulation) evaluated by one examiner, which were appropriate for this investigation (b) analysis of 181 cardiac deaths (investigated by all physicians of our institute).Petechiae were found in 13.3% of all cases and were clearly dependent on the cause of death, up to 20% were found in burn victims, intensive-care patients and cardiac fatalities. Petechiae were more frequently observed in the middle age groups (>20%) than in old persons (<10%). The number of PET cases increased with body mass but was lower in extremely obese persons, a greater number of cases with PET was also observed with increasing heart weight. PET were observed in 11% of the deaths without CPR compared to 19% with CPR. This difference was predominantly caused by the subgroup "acute coronary death", especially if victims younger than 60 years were considered, whereas in many other causes of death no difference in the prevalence of PET with or without CPR could be observed.Besides the cause of death, other factors (age, body mass and possibly even heart weight) influence the development of petechiae. The hypothesis that CPR alone produces PET is not confirmed by our experience.
