Temporal lobe volume determined by magnetic resonance imaging in schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia. The volumes of the whole temporal lobe, the superior temporal gyrus and the corpus callosum were measured on magnetic resonance images from 13 patients with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD), 27 patients with schizophrenia, and 31 age- and sex-matched controls. Temporal lobe structures were traced on consecutive 1.2mm thick SPGR images. Both patient groups had smaller temporal lobes than normal volunteers, a difference that was more marked for the area outside the superior temporal gyrus than for the STG. Correcting for brain volume diminished differences between normal subjects and schizophrenia patients, but the differences between normal subjects and SPD patients remained. Normal volunteers and SPD patients showed significant correlations between the sagittal section area of the posterior portion of the corpus callosum, which carries temporal interhemispheric connections, and the white matter volume of the temporal lobe. While the sample size is modest, taken together, these results suggest that the psychopathological symptoms of SPD may be related to temporal gray matter loss with relatively intact white matter connectivity, while the cognitive and psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia may be related to temporal gray loss combined with disruption of normal patterns of white matter development.
