Acute effect of 3-(4-acetamido)-butyrril-lorazepam (DDS2700) on brain function assessed by PET at rest and during attentive tasks. The aim of this study was to assess, by positron emission tomography (PET), the effect on cerebral functional activity of a new lorazepam-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) conjugate [3-(4-acetamido)-butyrril lorazepam (DDS2700)]. Ten healthy volunteers were studied by PET and [18F]fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) under baseline conditions and following the administration of DDS2700. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by PET and 15O-water in three additional participants while they performed attentive tasks, before and after drug administration. DDS2700 induced a decrease in the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglu) in the thalamus (-17%), cerebellum (-11%) and caudate nucleus (-8%). The observed effects on glucose metabolism were probably related to the subjective sedation and tiredness reported by the participants. During the attentive tasks, rCBF increased in frontal and temporal regions associated with attentional processing of auditory material. These circuits were no longer active after DDS2700 administration, while rCBF increased in cingulate cortex, occipitoparietal regions, pons and cerebellum. These drug-induced activations might be directly related to intervening sleepiness and to the consequent effort in keeping attention focused on the tasks. The effects of DDS2700 on glucose metabolism at rest, and on rCBF during activation conditions, indicate a drug action on cerebral networks involved in alertness, vigilance and attention maintenance. PET assessment by [18F]FDG and water may provide complementary information in pharmacodynamic studies.
