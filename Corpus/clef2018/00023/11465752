Redistribution in I-123 N-isopropyl-p iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography in cerebrovascular disease and the effects of rehabilitation. We performed N-isopropyl-p (I-123) iodoamphetamine (IMP) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) on 28 patients with severe cerebrovascular disease before rehabilitation, and compared the degree of redistribution and the assessment of activities of daily living (ADL). We calculated a redistribution (RD) ratio in the central and peripheral parts of the lesions: RD ratio (c) and RD ratio (p). We classified the patients into four groups based on the degree of redistribution: complete: both RD ratio (c) and (p) > or = 75 peripheral: RD ratio (c) < 75, RD ratio (p) > or = 75
