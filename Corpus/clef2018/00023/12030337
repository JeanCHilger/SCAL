Long-term outcome of a residual scar from myocardial infarction after coronary artery bypass grafting: a 100-month study using myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. The prognosis for patients with a residual scar from myocardial infarction (MI) after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) has not been fully evaluated, so the present study retrospectively evaluated such patients with stress myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) at 100 months after CABG. The study group consisted of 24 subjects (23 males, 1 female mean age, 59+/-9 years) in whom CABG had been performed more than 100 months (mean follow-up period 135+/-25 months) previously. The 24 subjects were classified into 3 groups according to their summed stress score (SSS) and summed reversibility score (SRS) in the early period after CABG. Eight subjects with MI (SSS> or =2 and SRS<2) were classified into the group MI, 8 subjects with ischemic myocardium (SSS> or =2 and SRS> or =2) was classified into the group RE, and 8 subjects with normal perfusion (SSS<2 and SRS<2) was classified into group N. None of the subjects in group MI required revascularization. Cardiac events occurred in 4 of the group RE patients and all required revascularization. As to the SPECT scoring system, the long-term SSS of group MI (6.4+/-3.1) was not different from that in the early periods (4.3+/-4.0
