Myocardial perfusion after transcutaneous/percutaneous myocardial laser revascularization. The effectiveness of transcutaneous and percutaneous myocardial laser revascularization in patients with endstage coronary artery disease and angina refractory to pharmacological therapy has been proved by various studies. Angiogenesis associated with an improvement of microcirculation and myocardial perfusion may be responsible for the reduction of angina and the improved physical performance. Myocardial perfusion studies published so far are compared to our own results utilizing positron emission tomography before and after percutaneous myocardial laser revascularization.
