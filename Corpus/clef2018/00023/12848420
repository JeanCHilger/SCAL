Quantitative analysis for assessing regional function of liver by using 99mTc-GSA SPECT. In the present study, we developed quantitative index for evaluating regional liver function using 99mTc diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid galactosyl human serum albumin (GSA). A three head SPECT equipped with a low energy high resolution parallel hole collimator was used. Used pre-filter was Butterworth and axial images were reconstructed by a ramp filter without attenuation correction. Correlation between SPECT counts and net concentration of activity of radioisotopes was evaluated in basic consideration using LKS and Nine-Ball phantoms. SPECT Counts = 0.6 x RI concentration. There was a simple correlation among GSA receptor amounts (Cr), injected GSA amounts (S), free GSA amounts (Cf), and intra hepatic receptor ratio ((Cr ratio)). Cr = S - Cf. (Cr ratio) = Cr/S, 0 < (Cr ratio) < 1. Injected GSA amounts can be calculated from injected net RI counts. Free GSA amounts can be evaluated from counts of the heart. GSA receptor amounts can be assumed by performing SPECT three times in series. Regional GSA receptor amounts can be evaluated from the ratio between the region's counts and whole counts. In clinical SPECT images, we could evaluate the regional GSA receptor amounts before and after chemolipiodolization. In conclusion, our method is a simple quantitative index of analyzing regional GSA receptor amounts.
