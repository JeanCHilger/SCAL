Cerebral blood flow sensitivity to CO2 measured with steady-state and Read's rebreathing methods. The ventilatory response to carbon dioxide (CO2) measured by the steady-state method is lower than that measured by Read's rebreathing method. A change in end-tidal P CO2 (PET CO2) results in a lower increment change in brain tissue P CO2 (Pt CO2) in the steady-state than with rebreathing: since Pt(CO2) determines the ventilatory response to CO2, the response is lower in the steady-state. If cerebral blood flow (CBF) responds to Pt CO2, the CBF-CO2 response should be lower in the steady-state than with rebreathing. Six subjects undertook two protocols, (a) steady-state: PET CO2 was held at 1.5 mmHg above normal (isocapnia) for 10 min, then raised to three levels of hypercapnia, (8 min each 6.5, 11.5 and 16.5 mmHg above normal, separated by 4 min isocapnia). End-tidal P O2 was held at 300 mmHg
