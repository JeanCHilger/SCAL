Neuro-psychiatric aspects of chronic fatigue syndrome. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is easily differentiated from various neurological organic disorders by conventional clinical examinations. The most important disease for distinguishment from CFS is fibromyalgia syndrome, in which the prominent and cardinal feature is a deprivation of stage 4 slow wave sleep. Experimentally, the sleep disturbance in controls can induce general myalgia, muscle tender points, severe fatigue and stiffness on awakening. The EEG abnormality is slow alpha wave contaminants on slow wave background, which is identical to EEG of CFS. The results clearly imply that CFS is not a hysterical or psychogenic disease, and that fibromyalgia may be a central fundamental of CFS. Fibromyalgia, however, has distinct features such as no antecedent inflammatory process and no endemics. Therefore, the syndrome has features distinct from, in addition to common features to CFS. It is also very difficult to distinguish CFS from depression. The above-mentioned features can be observed in depression. Now, study of brain blood flow or metabolism by PET or SPECT can be a possible tool for establishment of the CFS identity.
