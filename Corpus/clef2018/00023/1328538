Effect of vigabatrin on striatal dopamine receptors: evidence in humans for interactions of GABA and dopamine systems. Vigabatrin is a specific gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase inhibitor. The clinical use of this drug in the treatment of epilepsy has been sporadically linked to the development of psychosis. Using 123I-IBZM, a specific dopamine D2 receptor ligand and single photon emission tomography (SPET), one month of treatment with vigabatrin was associated with a decrease in specific binding of 123I-IBZM to D2 receptors in the left hemisphere basal ganglia. This change may provide one explanation for the development of psychosis in vulnerable patients.
