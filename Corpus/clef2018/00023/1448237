Left ventricular ejection fraction and volumes calculated from dual gated SPECT myocardial imaging with 99Tcm-MIBI. Dual gated (DG) cardiac single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) studies at end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) were acquired in 27 ischaemic heart disease (IHD) patients after intravenous injection of 555-740 MBq 99Tcm-MIBI. Acquisition parameters were: 180 degrees from LPO to RAO, 32 projections, 64 x 64 matrix, 75 cardiac beats per projection, 80 ms at ED and 80 ms at ES for each cardiac cycle. A computer program was developed to calculate the ED and ES left ventricular (LV) volumes and LV ejection fraction (EF). The computational approach is interactive, semi-automatic and iterative with built-in visual quality control. Short axis slices are used with corresponding ED and ES slices processed as pairs from apex to base. Left ventricular cavity pixels are identified and summed on a slice-by-slice basis. Myocardial pixels are similarly identified. The computed LVEF and ED and ES volumes have been correlated with those from contrast ventriculography (CV). The mean calculated EF for 27 patients was 53.6 +/- 10.7% from DG SPECT versus 55.3 +/- 12.1% from CV (NS). The EF linear correlation coefficient was r = 0.97.
