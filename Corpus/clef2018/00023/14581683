Brain metabolic differences between sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease. This FDG-PET study with SPM99 compared 46 patients with sporadic Alzheimer disease (SAD) to 40 patients with familial AD (FAD) and to 35 matched controls. AD groups had equivalent metabolic (METglu) reductions in several cortical and limbic areas with respect to the controls. Patients with FAD showed decreased METglu in the posterior cingulate, parahippocampal, and occipital cortex as compared to the patients with SAD (p < 0.001). Genetic factors lead to phenotypic differences in AD.
