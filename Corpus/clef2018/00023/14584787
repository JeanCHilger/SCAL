A highly selective and sensitive fluorescent PET (photoinduced electron transfer) chemosensor for Zn(II). The naphthalimide derivative 1 was designed as a fluorescence PET sensor for Zn(II) 1 showed excellent selectivity for Zn(II) at pH 7.4, even in the presence of other competitive cations, the emission, being pH independent above pH 3.5, was switched on upon Zn(II) recognition.
