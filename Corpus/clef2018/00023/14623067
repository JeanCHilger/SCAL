Anatomical and functional brain variables associated with clozapine response in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine alleviates the symptoms of a significant proportion of treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients. Previous studies suggest that the response to clozapine may be associated with prefrontal and temporal anatomy as well as with prefrontal, basal ganglia and thalamic metabolism. A sample of 25 treatment-resistant (TR) schizophrenic patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) before and after treatment with clozapine. We investigated the association between changes in positive, disorganized, and negative schizophrenic syndromes with clozapine treatment and a set of cerebral variables that included total intracranial volume (ICV) hippocampal, dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPF) and temporal gray-matter volume and metabolism
