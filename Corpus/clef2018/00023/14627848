Pathology results in [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography of the thyroid gland. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate pathologically increased uptake of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in positron emission tomography (PET) results of the thyroid gland. Results of 18F-FDG PET and [99mTc]pertechnetate scintigraphy of the thyroid gland are shown, compared to each other and discussed. In a retrospective study 16 patients underwent whole-body 18F-FDG PET and [99mTc]pertechnetate scintigraphy of the thyroid gland within 3 weeks. In addition, an examination of the thyroid gland by using ultrasound and laboratory tests was carried out. The 18F-FDG PET studies were carried out on a dedicated whole-ring PET scanner. Eight patients had a pathological FDG uptake in the thyroid and a cold nodule in [99mTc]pertechnetate scintigraphy of the thyroid gland (in 7/8 cases histology showed malignancy). Five patients had an inhomogeneous FDG uptake in the thyroid gland and were suspected of thyroiditis in 18F-FDG PET (in 3/5 cases thyroiditis was confirmed). Three patients had an especially low FDG uptake compared to normal physiological FDG uptake (no malignancy). Results from studies using 18F-FDG represent a growing body of evidence showing the differentiation between malignant and benign disease: we saw many pathological results in the thyroid gland. High uptake of 18F-FDG in the thyroid gland suggests possible malignancy. Thyroiditis can only be suspected based upon the results of 18F-FDG PET. We conclude that 18F-FDG PET has a potential clinical impact for detecting possible malignant lesions of the thyroid gland, but further studies, in which a higher number of patients are evaluated, are necessary.
