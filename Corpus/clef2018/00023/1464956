Dual nuclides SPECT for ventilation and perfusion study. Dual nuclides SPECT using 81mKr and 99mTc-MAA for ventilation and perfusion study was performed in 24 subjects. Crosstalk of 81mKr to 99mTc-energy window was about 7.5% when ventilation and perfusion study were performed by 370 MBq of 81mKr gas and 185 MBq of 99mTc-MAA. Areas of low V/Q was significantly larger in SPECT study than in planar study, in 11 cases with various pulmonary diseases. High V/Q mismatches were also more clearly delineated in SPECT than in planar study. Dual nuclides SPECT study has advantages of obtaining V/Q distribution without movement artifacts and of simultaneous acquisition of ventilation and perfusion image. Area of high V/Q became larger in SPECT with crosstalk than in SPECT without crosstalk, but in the low V/Q area no significant difference was noted between SPECT with crosstalk and without crosstalk.
