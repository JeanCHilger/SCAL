Expression of Helicobacter pylori Hsp60 protein and its immunogenicity. To express Hsp60 protein of H pylori by a constructed vector and to evaluate its immunogenicity.Hsp60 DNA was amplified by PCR and inserted into the prokaryote expression vector pET-22b (+), which was transformed into BL21 (DE3) E.coli strain to express recombinant protein. Immunogenicity of expressed Hsp60 protein was evaluated with animal experiments.DNA sequence analysis showed Hsp60 DNA was the same as GenBank's research. Hsp60 recombinant protein accounted for 27.2% of the total bacterial protein, and could be recognized by the serum from H pylori infected patients and Balb/c mice immunized with Hsp60 itself.Hsp60 recombinant protein might become a potential vaccine for controlling and treating H pylori infection.
