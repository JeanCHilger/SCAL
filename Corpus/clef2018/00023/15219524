Usefulness of quantitative gated single-photon emission computed tomography to evaluate ventricular synchrony in patients receiving biventricular pacing. Quantitative gated single-photon emission computed tomography was performed in 10 patients before and shortly after (<1 month) receiving biventricular pacing (BVP). They were divided into 2 groups (responder and nonresponder groups) on the basis of clinical status and echocardiographic parameters 18 +/- 6 months later. In the responder group, left ventricular synchrony shortly after BVP improved significantly compared with that before BVP (p <0.05), but there was no change in the nonresponder group.
