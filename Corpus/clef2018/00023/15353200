Adhesion contact dynamics of primary hepatocytes on poly(ethylene terephthalate) surface. The design of bioartificial liver assist device requires an effective attachment of primary hepatocytes on polymeric biomaterials. A better understanding of this cell-surface interaction would aid the optimal choice of biomaterials. In this study, the adhesion contact dynamics of primary hepatocytes on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) surface with grafted poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and coated collagen is probed with confocal reflectance interference contrast microscopy (C-RICM) in conjunction with phase contrast microscopy. An increase of acrylic acid density from 0 to 12 nmole/cm2 raises both the root-mean-square surface roughness and amount of adsorbed collagen of PET surface. C-RICM demonstrates that hepatocytes form tight adhesion contacts upon seeding on both plain PET and PAA-grafted PET (both with collagen coating) despite the insignificant two-dimensional cell spreading. At two hours after cell seeding, the normalized contact area and adhesion energy of hepatocytes on 12 nmole/cm2 PAA-grafted-PET (with collagen coating) is 27% and 114% higher, respectively, than that on collagen coated plain PET. Interestingly, the growth kinetics of adhesion patch for hepatocyte on PAA-grafted PET with collagen coating is best fitted by R proportional to t0.5 and is significantly different from that on collagen coated plain PET, which is best fitted by R proportional to t0.25. Overall, this study demonstrates the modulation of biophysical response of adherent hepatocytes through the control of the biomaterial surface properties.
