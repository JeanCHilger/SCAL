CD20-negative large-cell lymphoma with plasmablastic features: a clinically heterogenous spectrum in both HIV-positive and -negative patients. Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) has been described as a rapidly progressive and almost invariably fatal CD20- VS38c+ diffuse large-cell lymphoma with plasmablastic features, almost exclusively involving the jaw and oral mucosa in HIV-positive patients.From 2001 to 2003 we evaluated 12 men with PBL, and report the pathology, clinical findings, treatment and outcome. Six of 12 were HIV-positive while among the others, one was post-renal transplant, one had ulcerative colitis and four had no known immunodeficiency.Tumor growth pattern, in general, showed cohesiveness and a starry-sky pattern the morphology varied from typical plasmablastic to centroblastic cells. Partial immunophenotypes were (+/total): CD138, 11 of 12 (91.7%)It appears that PBL are heterogenous in terms of clinical presentation and morphology. The outcome presented here is superior to that originally reported.
