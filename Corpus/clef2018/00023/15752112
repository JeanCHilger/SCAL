Is transmission of bacteria that cause halitosis from pets to humans possible? Bacteria that cause halitosis naturally colonize the animal's mouth. The possibility of transmission of these bacteria from pets to human is an intriguing question. Therefore, the possible correlation between halitosis and regular contact of dental patients with pet animals was the aim of the presented study.The study covered 84 patients suffering from halitosis and 40 healthy controls aged 20-62 years. Each person completed a questionnaire and was then examined for organoleptic score, volatile sulphur compounds (VSC) and evaluation of low molecular mass amines in saliva by a ninhydrin colorimetric reaction. Halitosis was diagnosed if the average level of VSC was 125 ppb and the organoleptic measurement using a 0-5 point scale was 2. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon's and chi-square tests.The results showed that among the halitosis group over 80% of patients had reported having pets in childhood and over 70% owned a pet at present. In the control group results are 47 and 40%, respectively. Analysis showed a significant correlation between frequency of halitosis and regular contact with pets at present (P < 0.001) or in childhood (P < 0.001).Pets (dogs, cats) owned in childhood or at present may transmit bacteria that cause halitosis.
