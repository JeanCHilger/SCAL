Meta-analysis of the diagnostic efficacy of FDG-PET in patients with suspected ovarian cancer recurrence. The aim of this paper was to perform a meta-analysis of the literature to evaluate the accuracy of FDG-PET in recurrence detection in patients with ovarian cancer.The search strategy consisted in identifying papers published between November 1972 and October 2003 indexed in MEDLINE and CANCERLITE. Inclusion criteria were publications that evaluated recurrence with FDG-PET in patients with ovarian carcinoma. Exclusion criteria were duplicated papers or those outdated by subsequent ones. The statistical analysis included 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of sensitivity (S), specificity (Sp) and natural logarithm of the odds ratio (Ln OR).Seventeen publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The S and Sp were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.93-0.96) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.46-0.85), respectively. The Ln OR presented global homogeneity and significant values in > 75% of the studies.According to our meta-analysis, FDG-PET has high S and intermediate Sp, with few false negative results. These preliminary findings suggest that FDG-PET may be an effective means of identifying patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.
