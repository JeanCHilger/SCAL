Positive exercise test and normal exercise myocardial perfusion SPECT. Clinical significance. To establish, in our area, the clinical significance of a normal exercise myocardial perfusion study, in patients with an ischemic response of the exercise test.A retrospective study was carried out in our Service for the last four years. We studied 45 patients (41 women and 4 men) with an ischemic response of the exercise test and normal myocardial perfusion SPECT, during a mean follow-up of 13,2 months. We considered the final clinical diagnosis according to clinical evolution, therapy outcome and coronary angiography results.The presence of positive exercise test and normal SPECT was predominant in women (93.3%). In 35 patients (77.8%), the final diagnosis was chest pain of probable non-coronary origin (not secondary to coronary artery disease): 18 patients were diagnosed of hypertensive cardiomyopathy, 3 of valvulopathy, 2 of vasospastic angina, 1 of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, 1 of microvascular angina, 1 of angina due to arrhythmia, and 9 patients diagnosed of atypical chest pain due to functional or non-cardiac origin. In 10 patients (22.2%), the final diagnosis was chest pain of probable coronary origin. We did not observe any major cardiac events (cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction) during the follow-up period.Patients with chest pain, positive exercise test and normal SPECT have an excellent prognosis within an intermediate follow-up period. 77.8% of patients were diagnosed of chest pain of non-coronary origin. The most common cause of non-coronary chest pain was hypertensive cardiomyopathy (51.4%), followed by functional or non-cardiac chest pain (28.6%).
