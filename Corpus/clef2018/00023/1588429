Cerebral blood flow and metabolism following superficial temporal artery to superior cerebellar artery bypass for vertebrobasilar occlusive disease. In order to clarify the effectiveness of extracranial-intracranial bypass operations in patients with vertebrobasilar occlusive disease, the authors used positron emission tomography to investigate the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism of eight patients undergoing superficial temporal artery (STA)-superior cerebellar artery (SCA) bypass procedures. In the preoperative studies, CBF in the region of the posterior fossa was low and the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) was high, the so-called "misery perfusion syndrome." Such changes were evident in both the posterior circulation and the anterior circulation regions. Postoperatively, there was a significant increase in CBF, a significant decrease in the OEF not only in the region of posterior circulation but also over the entire brain, and a disappearance of the uncoupling between CBF and oxygen metabolism. The STA-SCA bypass procedure is effective in improving CBF and metabolism in patients with vertebrobasilar occlusive disease.
