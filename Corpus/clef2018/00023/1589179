Radioimmunoscintigraphy of colorectal carcinoma with a 99Tcm-labelled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (BW 431/26). Radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) with BW 431/26 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) labelled with 99Tcm (962 MBq) has been performed in 64 patients with colorectal carcinoma, one of them with two independent tumours. The group consisted of 46 primary lesions, 15 pelvic recurrences and four suspected recurrences which were shown to be liver metastases. Imaging of liver was obtained in all patients, but surgical liver examination was performed in only 56 of them. Planar scans were obtained at 4 and 24 h postinjection. Tomographic images were also performed in five patients. The final diagnosis was confirmed in all patients by their clinical course and by findings at surgery and pathology. A comparative study between the RIS results and the final diagnosis gave a global sensitivity in primary tumours and pelvic recurrences of 59.7% with an accuracy of 59.0%. When rectal tumours were excluded, the results were 81.1 and 84.9%, respectively. In liver metastases the sensitivity was 50%, with an accuracy of 85.7% and a specificity of 100%. No correlation has been found between CEA serum levels and lesion detection. In conclusion, RIS is a useful technique for the study and localization of colorectal tumours, being also indicated in patients with normal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels and clinical suspicion of illness.
