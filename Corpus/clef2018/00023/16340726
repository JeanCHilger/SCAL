Characterization of 133Xe gas washout in pulmonary emphysema with dynamic 133Xe SPECT functional images. To characterize regional ventilation impairment of pulmonary emphysema using dynamic 133Xe single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) functional images, compared with other forms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Dynamic 133Xe SPECT was performed in 34 patients with emphysema and 15 patients with other forms of COPD. Three-dimensional voxel-based functional images of the half-clearance time (T1/2) mainly reflecting the initial rapid washout of 133Xe gas from the large airways, and of the mean transit time (MTT) reflecting 133Xe gas washout from the entire lungs, including the small airways and alveoli, were created based on an area-over-height method. T1/2 and MTT values were compared with the regional extent of low attenuation areas (%LAA) on density-mask computed tomography images and the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO).The MTT/T1/2 ratio in each lung in emphysema was significantly higher than that in other forms of COPD (1.60+/-0.74 vs. 1.21+/-0.26 P<0.01). In the selected unilateral lungs with similar T1/2 values, MTT values were also significantly higher in emphysema. MTT values in each lung showed a significantly closer correlation with the corresponding %LAA values compared with T1/2 values in emphysema (R=0.698, P<0.0001 vs. R=0.338, P<0.01MTT values are more critically affected in emphysema compared with other forms of COPD without significant alveolar destruction, and MTT and T1/2 values appear to be differently correlated with the regional extent of LAA between these two disorders. Direct comparison of regional T1/2 and MTT values on functional images may contribute to the demarcation of lung pathology of these two disorders.
