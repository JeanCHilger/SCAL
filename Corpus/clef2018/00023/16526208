Is Vojvodina a risk area for contact weed allergies?. After detecting erythema multiforme due to contact with weeds, dandelion (Taraxacum officinale, Compositae) and common chickweed (Stellaria media, Caryophyllaceae), which are ubiquitous plants in Vojvodina, and concerning properties of commercial screening allergens in detection of allergy to plants, we investigated contact allergy to dandelion and to common chickweed, using their extracts.Epicutaneous tests were performed using originally prepared ether extracts of these plants, 0.1% and 3% pet., in 263 individuals: 43 with extrinsic atopic dermatitis, 55 with allergic contact dermatitis, 118 with non-allergic chronic inflammatory skin diseases and 47 healthy adults.Our results have shown that testing with both extracts (both concentrations) represents a safe method, since no irritation or sensibilization occurred. The overall prevalence of allergy to dandelion extract was 1.14%, and for common chickweed extract 2.28%.Plant allergies (especially Compositae) cannot always be detected by standard screening allergens. Additional testing with dandelion extract can detect most cases, which is in agreement with our results. Isolation of essential oil from common chickweed proved the allergenic potential of this plant. The prevalence of detected allergy to dandelion as well as to common chickweed was higher than 1%.These ubiquitous weeds and high prevalence of detected allergies have included Vojvodina into a risk zone for getting contact sensitivity to dandelion and common chickweed. Dandelion extract should be considered for Compositae screening series and common chickweed extract for specific plant series in Vojvodina.
