Circulation time in man from lung to periphery as an indirect index of cardiac output. Circulation time (Ct) between lung and periphery may be a surrogate for cardiac output, estimated here, for the most part, as the time between taking a breath of nitrogen and peripheral detection of a desaturation pulse. Use of pulse oximetry involves an internal, instrument delay however, using the ear, we found shortening with exercise (12.1 +/- 0.37 sec, at rest
