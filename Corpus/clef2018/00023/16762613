Imaging of neuroendocrine tumors. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare neoplasms, which are characterized by the presence of neuroamine uptake mechanisms and/or peptide receptors at the cell membrane and these features constitute the basis of the clinical use of specific radiolabeled ligands, both for imaging and therapy. Radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) was the first radiopharmaceutical used to specifically depict and localize catecholamine-secreting tumors (pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, and neuroblastomas) and is still regarded as a first-choice imaging technique for diagnosis and follow-up in patients with malignant disease, MIBG scintigraphy is an essential step to select patients for (131)I-MIBG therapy. Scintigraphy with (111)In- or (99m)Tc-labeled somatostatin analogs has become the main imaging technique for NETs, particularly those expressing a high density of somatostatin receptors, such as gastroenteropancreatic tumors
