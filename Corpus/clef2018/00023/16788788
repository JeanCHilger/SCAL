Advancement of PET and PET/CT in prostate carcinoma. Functional imaging of prostate carcinoma was examined with the metabolic substrates 2-(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose, (11)C-methionine, (18)F-fluorodihydrotestosterone, (11)C-acetate and (11)C/(18)F-choline. Based on upregulated enzymes of phospholipid metabolism in prostate carcinoma, (11)C/(18)F-choline is preferentially incorporated into phosphatidylcholine of membrane lipids of prostate cancer cells. PET allows sensitive detection of the (11)C/(18)F-choline signal and PET/CT fusion imaging enables intraprostatic signal localisation. Most published studies report a high detection rate of prostate carcinoma with (11)C/(18)F-choline PET/CT. Differentiation of prostate carcinoma from benign hyperplasia and from focal chronic prostatitis may be difficult acute prostatitis accumulates (11)C/(18)F-choline with an intensity comparable to prostate carcinoma.
