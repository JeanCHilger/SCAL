Quantification of left ventricular regional functions using ECG-gated myocardial perfusion SPECT--validation of left ventricular systolic functions--. We have developed a program to quantify regional left ventricular (LV) function and wall motion synchrony using ECG-gated myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS). This preliminary study was undertaken to validate the use of this program for estimating regional LV systolic function.Patients were subjected to MPS by 99mTc-sestamibi at rest. The study included 20 patients who were confirmed to have a low probability of coronary artery disease (LPG low probability group), 19 heart disease patients who were examined by MPS and equilibrium radionuclide angiography (ERNA) (ERGThe values of the global EF and PER evaluated by this program correlated with those determined by ERNA (r = 0.76 and 0.58, respectively p < 0.005 and 0.01, respectively). The sensitivities of regional EF and PER for segmental wall motion abnormalities were 86.7% and 68.7%, respectivelyThe potential of this program to quantify the regional systolic function was validated.
