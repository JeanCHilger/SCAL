Genetic polymorphism of 15 STR loci in a Lhasa Tibetan population. The polymorphism distributions of 15 STR loci (D8S1179, D21S11, D7S820, CSF1PO, D3S1358, TH01, D13S317, D16S539, D2S1338, D19S433, VWA, TPOX, D18S51, D5S818 and FGA) were investigated in a Lhasa Tibetan population by multiplex PCR amplification using five fluorochromes (6FAM, VIC, NED, PET, LIZ). Gene frequency, discrimination power (DP), heterozygosity (H), polymorphism information content (PIC) and probability of paternity exclusion (EPP) were calculated, and all loci were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Results indicate that the gene frequency of these 15 STR loci is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The DP is at 0.7515 - 0.9599, H is at 0.5576 - 0.8538, PIC is at 0.5455 - 0.8458, and EPP is at 0.37550.8520. Cumulative DP of the 15 STR is 0.99999999, and cumulative EPP is 0.999999997. Therefore, these 15 STR loci can be used as genetic markers of in Lhasa Tibetan populations in anthropological studies, linkage analysis of genetic diseases, individual identification and paternity testing in forensic medicine.
