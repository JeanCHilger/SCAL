Noninvasive imaging of osteoclasts in parathyroid hormone-induced osteolysis using a 64Cu-labeled RGD peptide. Bone diseases are often a result of increased numbers of osteoclasts, or bone-resorbing cells. Bone metastases are a significant cause of morbidity in many types of cancer. An imaging agent targeting osteoclasts, which are upregulated in osteolytic lesions, may facilitate earlier follow-up in patients with osteolytic or mixed bone metastases. Osteoclasts express high levels of alpha(v)beta3 integrin, to which peptides containing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence are known to bind. We proposed that radiolabeled RGD peptides could be used to detect osteoclasts in lytic bone lesions.The cross-bridged macrocyclic chelator 4,11-bis(carboxymethyl)-1,4,8,11-tetraazabicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane (CB-TE2A) was conjugated to c(RGDyK) for radiolabeling with 64Cu (t(1/2), 12.7 h beta+, 17.4%Cu-CB-TE2A-c(RGDyK) was shown to have a 30-fold higher affinity for alpha(v)beta3 than for alpha(v)beta5. Osteoclasts were shown to specifically take up (64)Cu-CB-TE2A-c(RGDyK). However, bone marrow macrophages showed only nonspecific uptake. PTH treatment increased calvarial uptake of 64Cu-CB-TE2A-c(RGDyK), compared with uptake in mice receiving a sham treatment. In addition, calvarial uptake correlated linearly with the number of osteoclasts on the bone surface.These results suggest that 64Cu-CB-TE2A-c(RGDyK) selectively binds alpha(v)beta3 on osteoclasts and may potentially be used to identify increased numbers of osteoclasts in osteolytic bone diseases such as osteolytic bone metastasis and inflammatory osteolysis.
