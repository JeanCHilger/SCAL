Evaluation of drug-transporter interactions using in vitro and in vivo models. Drug transporters, including efflux transporters (the ATP binding cassette (ABC) proteins) and uptake transporters (the solute carrier proteins (SLC)), have an important impact on drug disposition, efficacy, drug-drug interactions and toxicity. Identification of the interactions of chemical scaffolds with transporters at the early stages of drug development can assist in the optimization and selection of new drug candidates. In this review, we discuss current in vitro and in vivo models used to investigate the interactions between drugs and transporters such as P-gp, MRP, BCRP, BSEP, OAT, OATP, OCT, NTCP, PEPT1/2 and NT. In vitro models including cell-based, cell-free, and yeast systems as well as in vivo models such as genetic knockout, gene deficient and chemical knockout animals are discussed and compared. The applications, throughput, advantages and limitations of each model are also addressed in this review.
