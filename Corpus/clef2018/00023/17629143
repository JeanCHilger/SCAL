Perfusion myocardial scintigraphy - SPECT with TC-99m MIBI in detection coronary artery desease in diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus is very frequent disease. The prevalence of coronary artery disease is higher in diabetic than in non-diabetic patients. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the main cause of morbidity and mortalitiy in patients with Diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to evaluate usfulnes of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in diabetic patients for detection of coronary artery disease.this study included 15 patients with verified diabetes mellitus. All patients were treated with oral hypoglicemic or insulin. Parameters observed for every patients were level of lipemia (cholesterol, triglycerides), family hystory of CAD, hystory of chest pain. All patients underwent sress/rest Tc-99m MIBI study. We have performed one day protocol. Exercise tolerance test were performing in all patients according to the Bruce protocol. 260MBq was injected intravenously at peak exercise. 740MBg was injected for the rest. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy was clasified as: 1. normal, 2. reversible defect or 3. irreversible defect.reversible perfusion defect we have found in 8 patients. The same patients had elevated glicemia, high level of lipemia 1 patient had fixed defect, without any previous known history for myocardial infarction. In 6 patients we could not see any significant defect during stress/rest scintigraphy.The frequency of abnormal myocardial perfusion scintigraphy suggest that this procedure can be very useful in the detection of high-risk diabetic patients.
