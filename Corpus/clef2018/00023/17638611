Structural and functional neuroimaging in mild-to-moderate head injury. Head injury is a major cause of disability and death in adults. Significant developments in imaging techniques have contributed to the knowledge of the pathophysiology of head injury. Although extensive research is available on severe head injury, less is known about mild-to-moderate head injury despite the fact that most patients sustain this type of injury. In this review, we focus on structural and functional imaging techniques in patients with mild-to-moderate head injury. We discuss CT and MRI, including different MRI sequences, single photon emission computed tomography, perfusion-weighted MRI, perfusion CT, PET, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional MRI and magnetic encephalography. We outline the advantages and limitations of these various techniques in the contexts of the initial assessment and identification of brain abnormalities and the prediction of outcome.
