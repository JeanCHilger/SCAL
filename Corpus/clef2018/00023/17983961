Cutting-edge brain imaging with positron emission tomography. A review of recent advances in brain imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) is presented in this article. Some properties of the high-resolution research tomograph are described as examples of state-of-the-art PET instrumentation. A summary of current research topics in image reconstruction and quantification is given, with emphasis on the requirements of brain dynamic imaging. A brief overview of image analysis methods is presented, together with some examples of the contributions of quantitative PET imaging to the current understanding of brain function and disease. PET findings must be evaluated in the context of clinical observations and complemented by other imaging modalities whenever possible to ensure a proper interpretation of the data.
