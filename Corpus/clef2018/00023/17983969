Imaging the neurochemistry of alcohol and substance abuse. Animal models of abuse and dependence have long suggested that chronic drug and alcohol exposure is associated with marked changes in neurochemistry. The development of PET and SPECT imaging now allows investigation of the effects of addiction on the neurochemistry of the human brain. This article reviews the literature of radiochemical imaging in cocaine, alcohol, heroin, methamphetamine, MDMA, and ketamine abuse and dependence.
