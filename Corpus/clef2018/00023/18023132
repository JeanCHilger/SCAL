Resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal carcinoma. Although pulmonary metastases from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) often represent systemic and uncontrolled tumour growth, in a number of patients lung disease is limited and the patient remains well. When the metastases can be removed, long term survival is a possibility, with 5- and 10-year survivals in the order of 44% and 25%. Chemotherapy, the only alternative treatment only very rarely leads to survival beyond 24 months. Pulmonary metastases which are suitable for resection are usually detected on chest radiography, especially when carried out during monitoring of patients. They are rarely a cause of symptoms and the majority of patients have otherwise healthy lungs. CT scans supplemented by PET scans usually confirm the diagnosis, but percutaneous biopsy is sometimes necessary to exclude a primary lung cancer. The criteria for resecting CRC pulmonary metastases are (1) the primary tumour is controlled or is controllable (2) complete resection is possible
