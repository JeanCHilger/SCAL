Cryptosporidiosis in zoo and pet birds. Cryptosporidiosis is recognized as a primary disease in commercially raised chickens, turkeys, and bobwhite quail. Little is known about cryptosporidial infections in zoo and pet birds, although, infections of the small intestines, proventriculus, respiratory tract, and kidneys have been reported. In the present study, we reviewed cases of cryptosporidial infections in zoo and pet birds submitted to the State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Auburn, Alabama for necropsy or histopathologic examination. We identified infections in cockatiels, white-lored euphonias, bronze mannikin finches, and Australian diamond firetailed finches. Infections in the cockatiels occurred mostly in the small intestine, but parasites were also observed in the esophageal glands, air sacs, and proventriculus of some birds. Separate cases of small intestinal and proventricular infections were identified in the white-lored euphonias. Cryptosporidial parasites were found only in the proventriculus of the bronze mannikin finches and Australian diamond firetail finches. No cases of renal cryptosporidiosis were observed. Co-pathogens or other disease conditions were present in all birds. The Cryptosporidium species responsible for causing proventricular infection in zoo and pet birds may be different from C. meleagridis and C. baileyi.
