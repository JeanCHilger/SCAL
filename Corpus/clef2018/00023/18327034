Laryngeal and hypopharyngeal carcinomas after (chemo)radiotherapy: a diagnostic dilemma. During recent years, (chemo)radiotherapy has evolved into a primary treatment modality for both early and advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal carcinomas. Head and neck surgeons will be concerned more frequently with patients presenting symptoms and signs suggesting recurrent tumor or complications of (chemo)radiotherapy.Analysis of histologic characteristics and tumor spread of recurrent carcinomas on whole-organ slices of salvage laryngectomy specimens showed that recurrent laryngeal carcinomas are often present with multiple tumor foci dispersed in different regions furthermore, they may develop beneath an intact mucosa. Only a few articles analyze the reliability of laryngoscopy and biopsy in detecting recurrences after (chemo)radiotherapy: the number of false negative biopsies is relatively high. The differentiation between radionecrosis and tumor recurrence is difficult by computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging in many cases. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging are promising diagnostic modalities to detect or exclude persistent or recurrent disease after (chemo)radiotherapy.Endoscopy with biopsy, computed tomography scan and conventional magnetic resonance imaging present several deficiencies in diagnosing recurrent disease after (chemo)radiotherapy. New imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography-computed tomography and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging show promising results, increasing the diagnostic efficacy.
