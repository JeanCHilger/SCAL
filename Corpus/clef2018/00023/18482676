(64)Cu]diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methyl-thiosemicarbazone) - a radiotracer for tumor hypoxi. Positron emission tomography scanning using the radiotracer-labeled copper (II)-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) has been proposed as a noninvasive method for evaluating tumor hypoxia. Tumor hypoxia results in a more aggressive tumor phenotype together with resistance to both radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A noninvasive technique for evaluation of tumor hypoxia is not currently available. Validation of this technique would provide clinicians with a tool for determining the most appropriate cancer therapy, prognostic information, and subvolume delineation for the radiotherapy dose escalation to the radioresistant hypoxic regions within a tumor. This review article describes the background to the development of this tracer, its proposed retention mechanism, biodistribution dosimetry and the preclinical and clinical studies to date. It outlines the potential use of this radiotracer for imaging in the field of oncology.
