Substituent effects on aryltrifluoroborate solvolysis in water: implications for Suzuki-Miyaura coupling and the design of stable (18)F-labeled aryltrifluoroborates for use in PET imaging. Whereas electron withdrawing substituents retard the rate of aryltrifluoroborate solvolysis, electron-donating groups enhance it. Herein is presented a Hammett analysis of the solvolytic lability of aryltrifluoroborates where log(k(solv)) values correlate to sigma values with a rho value of approximately -1. This work provides a predictable rubric for tuning the reactivity of boron for several uses including (18)F-labeled PET reagents and has mechanistic implications for ArBF(3)-enhanced ligandless metal-mediated cross coupling reactions with aryltrifluoroborates.
