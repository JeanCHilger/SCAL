Histological evaluation of the healing potential of the anterior cruciate ligament by means of augmented and non-augmented repair: an in vivo animal study. The purpose of this animal study was to investigate the healing potential of the anterior cruciate ligament following transaction at the femoral end, by means of both the augmented and the nonaugmented primary repair, focusing on the histological changes during a 12-month postoperative observation period with respect to necrosis and the loss of normal structures during the healing period. Twenty sheep were randomly assigned to nonaugmented primary ACL repair, or to augmented ACL repair using a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) band. At 2, 6, 16, 26 and 52 weeks postoperatively four sheep out of each group were sacrificed. Histological healing was achieved after 16 weeks for the augmented repair group and after 26 weeks for the nonaugmented repair group. The main difference between the two techniques was that the PET augmentation device protected the ligament from necrosis and ligamentization. In this group a consistently normal ligament was seen histologically during the entire postoperative observation period. The nonaugmented repaired ACLs underwent the processes of necrosis and ligamentization.
