CT guided 125I seeds implantation in treatment of local recurrent rectal cancer after surgery resection: analysis of 21 cases. To explore the clinical value of CT guided 125I seeds implantation in the treatment of local recurrent rectal cancer after surgery resection.Twenty-one patients with local recurrent rectal cancer after surgery, 12 males and 9 females, aged 47 (35-69), with the longest diameter of 4. 2 cm (3.4 - 6.4 cm), were treated by CT guided 125I radioactive seeds implantation according to treatment planning system (TPS) or Halarism's experienced function: mCi = Da x 5. Totally, 506 seeds, 24.1 for one patient on average, were implanted. All the patients received PET-CT scan 3 months after the treatment and were followed up for 12.5 months (7-22 months).Complete remission, partial remission, and no change were seen in 16, 3, and 2 patients respectively. All patients survived.CT guided 125I seeds implantation is an effective methods in the treatment of local recurrent rectal cancer after surgery resection.
