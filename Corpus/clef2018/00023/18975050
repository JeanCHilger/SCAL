Ductal carcinoma in situ: correlation between FDG-PET/CT and histopathology. The aim of this study was to determine if any correlation exists between tumor cell density and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET)/CT) for pure or predominant ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Subjects in this retrospective review comprised 11 patients who underwent FDG-PET/CT for DCIS. Pathological tumor cell density and FDG-PET/CT images were compared. A tumor background count density ratio of >1.5 was defined as the detectable range for DCIS.Pathological density of disease was high in eight patients, intermediate in one, and low in two. In all eight patients with a detectable intraductal component on PET/CT, the density of disease was classified as high. In three patients undetected by PET/CT, the density of disease was classified as intermediate or low. On statistical analysis, the correlation between the density of disease and tumor background count density ratio (TBCDR) on PET/CT was significant (<0.05), whereas the nuclear grade and Van Nuys grade were not significant. In the eight patients detected by PET/CT, the discrepancy between histopathological mapping and FDG-PET/CT mapping was >20 mm in four patients and represented underestimation in four patients who showed low density of disease in the peripheral area.Tumor cell density of intraductal carcinoma appears strongly correlated to detection by FDG-PET/CT.
