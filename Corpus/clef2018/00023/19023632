Use of positron emission tomography in surgery follow-up of esophageal cancer. Although the prognosis of patients with esophageal cancer has been improved by extended dissection, the incidence of recurrence still remains high. In esophageal cancer, positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) already demonstrated to be useful for initial staging and monitoring response to therapy. This prospective study compared the ability of FDG-PET and conventional imaging to detect early recurrence of esophageal cancer after initial surgery in asymptomatic patients.Between October 2003 and September 2006, 41 patients with esophageal cancer were included in a prospective study after initial radical esophagectomy. FDG-PET, thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT), abdominal ultrasonography, and endoscopy were performed every 6 months after initial treatment.Twenty-three patients had recurrent disease (56%), mostly within the first 6 months after surgery (70%). Despite two false-positive scans due to postoperative changes, FDG-PET was more accurate than CT (91% vs. 81%, p = 0.02) for the detection of recurrence with a sensitivity of 100% (vs. 65%), a specificity of 85% (vs. 91%), and a negative predictive value of 100% on a patient-by-patient-based analysis. For the detection of locoregional recurrence, FDG-PET was more accurate than CT (96.2% vs. 88.9%). FDG-PET was also more accurate than CT for the detection of distant metastases (92.5% vs. 84.9%), especially when involving either bones (100%) or liver (98.1%). A lower sensitivity of FDG-PET (57%) for the early detection of small lung metastases did not affect patient management (accuracy = 92.5%).FDG-PET appears to be very useful for the systematic follow-up of asymptomatic patients after esophagectomy with an initial scan performed 6 months after surgery.
