A survey of nuclear medicine services in Scotland 2004-2005. Audit Scotland has recommended that NHS boards should ensure that medical equipment performance information is used to assess whether the local area is making the best use of its medical equipment. A survey of nuclear medicine departments in Scotland was carried out to provide a benchmark.A questionnaire was sent to every nuclear medicine department in Scotland. Information requested included the amount, type and age of equipment and its service support. It also requested information to assess cost-effectiveness and quality measures such as waiting times.The response rate to the survey from the 21 nuclear medicine departments in Scotland was 100%. During 2004/2005, there were 71 426 nuclear medicine procedures carried out in Scotland, just over 14 per 1000 of population. A mean of 1619 procedures per imager was found. The mean number of procedures per whole time equivalent member of staff was found to be 499 and the mean cost per procedure, excluding radiopharmaceutical costs, was pound82. Relatively, long waiting times were found for bone scans, myocardial perfusion imaging and brain single-photon emission computed tomography.The survey shows that nuclear medicine activity in Scotland is higher than in the United Kingdom as a whole. The move from single-to dual-headed gamma cameras in recent years is demonstrated. The total number of staff employed in nuclear medicine departments in Scotland is only 143 whole time equivalent divided amongst several staff groups. Performance indicators have been identified and a report has been issued to participating departments enabling them to benchmark themselves as recommended by Audit Scotland.
