The synthesis and characterization of [(124)I]IMPY, a thioflavin-S derivative, in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. 6-[(124)I]iodo-2-(4'-N,N-dimethylamino)-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine ([(124)I]IMPY) was synthesized and characterized as a positron-emitting probe to identify Alzheimer's disease in transgenic mouse models. A significant reduction in radioactivity retention in the hippocampus and frontal cortex by co-incubation with nonradioactive IMPY was observed. Highly specific retention of radioactivity in beta-amyloid-rich regions of brain sections was also noted. This study demonstrated that [(124)I]IMPY was a promising probe for the mouse model and may be useful for positron emission tomography to image beta-amyloid plaques in the human brain.
