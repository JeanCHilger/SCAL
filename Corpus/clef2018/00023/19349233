A general method of Bayesian estimation for parametric imaging of the brain. We report a general method of Bayesian estimation that uses prior measurements to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of parametric images computed from dynamic PET scanning. In our method, the ordinary weighted least squares cost function is augmented by a penalty term to yield Phi(K,S)=minK{(C-f(K))(T)Omega(C)(-1)(C-f(K))+SPhi(K,S=0)(K-K)(T)Omega(K)(-1)(K-K
