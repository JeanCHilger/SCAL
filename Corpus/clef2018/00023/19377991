In vivo imaging of oligonucleotidic aptamers. In this chapter we present the methods developed in our laboratory for in vivo imaging of oligonucleotidic aptamers. These methods relate to (i) the labelling of aptamers with fluorine-18, a positron emitter, (ii) Positron Emission Tomography imaging of laboratory animals with [(18)F]aptamers and (iii) labelling with fluorescent dyes and optical imaging of aptamers in mice.
