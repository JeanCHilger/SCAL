Predictive value of 18F-FDG PET and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in patients with metastatic endocrine tumors. The treatment of metastatic neuroendocrine tumors depends on the aggressiveness of the disease. We wanted to know whether (18)F-FDG PET and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) can predict early disease progression and patient survival.We undertook a prospective study of patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumor diagnosed between September 2003 and January 2006. After obtaining signed informed consent from the patients, we performed CT, SRS, and (18)F-FDG PET and reviewed histologic data. CT was repeated every 3 mo to assess the risk of early progressive disease (first 6 mo), progression-free survival, and overall survival.Thirty-eight patients (mean age, 60 +/- 15 y) were included. Histologically, 4 patients had a high-grade and 34 a low-grade tumor. The results of (18)F-FDG PET and SRS were positive in 15 and 27 patients. The 2-y overall survival and progression-free survival were 73% and 45% 16 patients had early progressive disease. Most (18)F-FDG PET-positive patients had early progressive disease (14/15, vs. 2/23 (18)F-FDG PET-negative patients), and most SRS-negative patients had early progressive disease (9/11, vs. 7/27 SRS-positive patients)(18)F-FDG PET exhibits excellent predictive values for early tumor progression. (18)F-FDG PET and SRS results correlate with progression-free survival and overall survival even for histologically low-grade tumors. These explorations could be included in the initial work-up for metastatic neuroendocrine tumor.
