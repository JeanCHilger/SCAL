Application of the gingival contour plaque index: six-month plaque and gingivitis study. The Gingival Contour Plaque Index (GCPI) is a recently introduced and validated method of measuring plaque accumulation in dogs. It focuses on plaque accumulated along the gingival margin. Plaque accumulation in this area leads to gingival inflammation and, potentially, periodontitis. A 6-month plaque and gingivitis study was conducted to demonstrate the clinical research application of the GCPI, and to ensure that documented quantification of plaque-reducing efficacy could be related to a reduction in gingivitis. Advantages of the GCPI method are the ability to quantify plaque accumulation in an awake dog with fewer research personnel and more efficient time usage.
