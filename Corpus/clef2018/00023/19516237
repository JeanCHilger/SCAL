An up-to-date view on persistent idiopathic facial pain. Previously called atypical facial pain, persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP) is a common, but poorly defined entity. The cause of PIFP is unknown, but surgery or injury in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve could be reported as early event. Treatment is often unsatisfactory and quality research relating management of this condition is missing. Psychologi-cal distress is frequently observed in patients suffering from persistent idiopathic facial pain. The present review aims at presenting the available knowledge of this elusive orofacial pain condition.
