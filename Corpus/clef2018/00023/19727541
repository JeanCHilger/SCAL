Is (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography meaningful for estimating the efficacy of corticosteroid therapy in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis? Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is often misdiagnosed as pancreatic cancer (PC). Both conditions accumulate (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), so FDG positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is not discriminatory. This study aimed to evaluate the pattern of FDG accumulation, and the change in FDG uptake after steroid treatment in AIP and PC.We compared FDG-PET patterns between 18 patients with AIP and 20 patients with PC, and also evaluated the short-term changes in FDG uptake after steroid therapy.FDG uptake was observed in 88.9% in AIP and 90.0% in PC. FDG uptake in extra-abdominal lymph nodes was seen more frequently in AIP, and uptake in salivary glands, eyes and biliary ducts was seen only in AIP. Follow-up PET was performed in 6 AIP patients and in 3 PC patients. Changes in SUV(max) after steroid therapy were estimated within 1 week in 5 AIP patients and in all 3 PC patients, retrospectively. In 4 AIP patients, the change in SUV(max) was more than 10%. On the other hand, in PC, SUV(max) increased or remained almost unchanged (within 10%).FDG-PET pattern at baseline, and a decrease in FDG uptake after a short steroid trial can be useful for discriminating AIP from PC.
