Does diabetes mellitus predispose to increased fluid overload in peritoneal dialysis patients? Diabetic peritoneal dialysis patients have been reported to have faster peritoneal solute transport and may be at risk of reduced ultrafiltration volumes, leading to fluid overload.We audited multi-frequency bioimpedance data from 198 consecutive peritoneal dialysis patients (141 nondiabetics and 57 diabetics).Diabetic patients had increased body mass index (males 27 +/- 4 vs. 26 +/- 4 females 28 +/- 5 vs. 25 +/- 4Diabetic and nondiabetic patients had similar PET results, 24-hour net peritoneal ultrafiltration and blood pressure control. The ratio of ECW to TBW was greater in diabetic patients, and although this could be due to a loss of intracellular water, as albumin and C-reactive protein did not differ, it suggests that diabetic peritoneal dialysis patients have an expanded extracellular volume.
