Preoperative detection of cervical lymph node metastases in papillary thyroid cancer: a surgical perspective. Despite its relatively benign biological behavior, papillary thyroid cancer is frequently associated with cervical lymph node metastases at the time of diagnosis. These metastases have a limited impact on overall survival, but are recognized as a significant risk factor for locoregional recurrence of the disease. This may significantly alter quality of life, and may require further therapeutic interventions which may be associated with increased morbidity. Therefore, preoperative identification of cervical lymph node metastases is of particular importance and allows optimal and effective treatment at the time of initial surgery. Clinical examination remains important but lacks sensitivity. Neck ultrasonography is currently the most useful method to detect cervical lymphadenopathy. Fine-needle aspiration (for cytology and thyroglobulin measurement), usually under ultrasonographic guidance, may confirm the diagnosis of lymph node metastases. Other imaging methods (including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography) should be used selectively. A compartment-oriented cervical lymph node dissection should be performed at the time of thyroidectomy if preoperative evaluation reveals cervical lymphadenopathy.
