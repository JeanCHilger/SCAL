Comparison of technetium-99m teboroxime tomography with automated quantitative coronary arteriography and thallium-201 tomographic imaging. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) teboroxime is a new perfusion tracer that is highly extracted and rapidly cleared by the myocardium. To determine the feasibility of Tc-99m teboroxime imaging in the diagnosis of patients with suspected coronary artery disease, 30 patients underwent single photon emission computed tomography imaging with Tc-99m teboroxime (25.2 +/- 1 mCi) at peak exercise and again 60 min later at rest. All patients underwent either a thallium stress test (n = 26) or automated quantitative coronary arteriography (n = 25), or both, without intervening revascularization or infarction. Images were reviewed by two investigators who had no knowledge of clinical data. Coronary lesions with greater than or equal to 50% diameter narrowing by quantitative coronary arteriography were considered significant. Both thallium and Tc-99m teboroxime detected disease in all patients with two or three vessel disease. One vessel disease was detected with Tc-99m teboroxime in 9 of 10 patients and with thallium in 8 of 10 (p = NS). In patients without angiographically significant disease. Tc-99m teboroxime demonstrated normal perfusion in six of eight patients and thallium in three of five (p = NS). Overall, when presence or absence of disease detected by Tc-99m teboroxime or thallium was compared with quantitative coronary arteriography, there was no difference between Tc-99m teboroxime and thallium. These results suggest that Tc-99m teboroxime is comparable to thallium as an imaging agent. The rapid biologic half-life, 5.3 min, allows studies to be completed in 60 to 90 min.
