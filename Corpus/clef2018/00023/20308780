Osteopontin is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease and its levels correlate with cognitive decline. Inflammation is believed to play a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Osteopontin (OPN) is a molecule involved in macrophage recruitment and activation and implicated in neurodegeneration. In order to elucidate the role of OPN in AD, we evaluated its levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 67 AD patients, 46 frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients, and 69 controls. We found that OPN levels: i) are significantly increased in the CSF of AD patients ii) correlate with MMSE score
