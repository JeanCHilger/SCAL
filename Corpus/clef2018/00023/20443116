An exploratory pilot study into the association between microcirculatory parameters derived by MRI-based pharmacokinetic analysis and glucose utilization estimated by PET-CT imaging in head and neck cancer. To examine the feasibility of deriving quantitative microcirculatory parameters and to investigate the relationship between vascular and metabolic characteristics of head and neck tumours in vivo, using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging.Twenty-seven patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) underwent DCE-MRI and combined PET/CT imaging. DCE-MRI data were post-processed by using commercially available software. Transfer constant (K (trans)), extravascular extracellular blood volume (v (e)), transfer constant from the extracellular extravascular space to plasma (k (ep)) and iAUC (initial area under the signal intensity-time curve) were calculated. 3D static PET data were acquired and standardised uptake values (SUV) calculated.All microcirculatory parameters in tumours were higher than in normal muscle tissue (P ≤ 0.0019). Significant correlations were shown between k (ep) and K (trans) (ρ = 0.77), v (e) and k (ep) (ρ = -0.7), and iAUC and v (e) (ρ = 0.53). Significant correlations were observed for SUV(mean) and v (e) as well as iAUC (ρ = 0.42 and ρ = 0.66, respectively). SUV(max) was significantly correlated with iAUC (ρ = 0.69).The demonstrated relationships between vascular and metabolic characteristics of primary SCCA imply a complex interaction between vascular delivery characteristics and tumour metabolism. The lack of correlation between SUV and K (trans)/k (ep) suggests that both diagnostic techniques may provide complementary information.
