The use of cerebral activation procedures with single photon emission tomography. Single photon emission tomography allows the imaging of dynamic brain functioning. The use of cerebral activating procedures within the scan protocol enables investigation of the mechanisms involved in specific brain functions in health and disease. Activation studies involve the comparison of at least two data sets describing brain activity generated in conditions that differ for the specific function in question. When designing an activation study, decisions regarding methodology include: the nature of the activation regime, the tracer-ligand utilized, the SPET instrument and the manner of subsequent data analysis. These issues are discussed in this review, both theoretically and with reference to published studies. Means of activating particular cerebral structures and functions are reviewed, as are the limitations of the techniques with respect to temporal and spatial resolution and the potentially confounding nature of preconceived ideas regarding the mechanisms of brain function.
