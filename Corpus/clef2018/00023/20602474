Preoperative coronary artery revascularization and long-term outcomes following abdominal aortic vascular surgery in patients with abnormal myocardial perfusion scans: a subgroup analysis of the coronary artery revascularization prophylaxis trial. Abdominal aortic operations have the highest perioperative cardiac risk. To test the impact of preoperative coronary artery revascularization (PR) in this high-risk subset, a post hoc analysis was performed in patients undergoing aortic surgery within the Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis (CARP) trial.The study cohort was a subset of 109 CARP patients with myocardial ischemia on nuclear imaging randomized to a strategy of PR (N = 52) or no PR (N = 57) before their scheduled abdominal aortic vascular operation. The clinical indications for vascular surgery were an expanding aneurysm (N = 62) or severe claudication (N = 47). The composite end-point of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) was determined by an intention-to-treat analysis following randomization.The median time (Interquartiles) from randomization to vascular surgery was 56 (40, 81) days in patients assigned to PR and 19 (10, 43) days in patients assigned to no PR (P < 0.001). At 2.7 years following randomization, the probability of remaining free of death and nonfatal MI was 0.65 with PR and 0.55 with no PR [unadjusted P = 0.08, odds ratio = 1.67, 95% confidence interval (0.93, 2.99)]. Using a Cox proportional hazard model, predictors of the composite of death and nonfatal MI (odds ratio 95% confidence interval) were no PR (1.90In patients with an abnormal cardiac imaging before abdominal aortic vascular surgery, PR was associated with a reduced risk of death and nonfatal MI while anterior ischemia was an identifier of poor outcome independent of the revascularization status.
