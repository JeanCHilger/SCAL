Measured Temperature Dependence of Scintillation Camera Signals Read Out by Geiger-M체ller Mode Avalanche Photodiodes. We are developing a prototype monolithic scintillation camera with optical sensors on the entrance surface (SES) for use with statistically-estimated depth-of-interaction in a continuous scintillator. We opt to use Geiger-M체ller mode avalanche photodiodes (GM-APDs) for the SES camera since they possess many desirable properties for the intended application (SES and PET/MR imaging), they offer a thin attenuation profile and an operational insensitivity to large magnetic fields. However, one issue that must be addressed in using GM-APDs in an RF environment (as in MR scanners) is the thermal dissipation that can occur in this semiconductor material.Signals of GM-APDs are strongly dependent on junction temperature. Consequently, we are developing a temperature-controlled GM-APD-based PET camera whose monitored temperature can be used to dynamically account for the temperature dependence of the output signals. Presently, we aim to characterize the output-signal dependence on temperature and bias for a GM-APD-based scintillation camera.We've examined two GM-APDs, a Zecotek prototype MAPD-3N, and a SensL commercial SPMArray2. The dominant effect of temperature on gain that we observe results from a linear dependence of breakdown voltage on temperature (0.071 V/째C and 0.024 V/째C, respectively)
