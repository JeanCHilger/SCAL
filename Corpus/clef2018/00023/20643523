The spectrum of Castleman's disease: mimics, radiologic pathologic correlation and role of imaging in patient management. Castleman's disease (CD) is a rare benign lymphoid disorder with variable clinical course. The two principal histologic subtypes of CD are hyaline-vascular and plasma cell variants and the major clinicoradiological entities are unicentric and multicentric CD. Management of CD is tailored to clinicoradiologic subtype. In this review, we describe the CT, MR and PET/CT findings in Castleman's disease which can help suggest a diagnosis of CD as well as emphasize role of imaging in management of patients with CD.
