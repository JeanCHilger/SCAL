Comparison of the myocardial distributions of 201Tl and 99Tcm-MIBI on SPECT images. The distributions of 201Tl and 99Tcm-MIBI on stress images were quantitatively measured in a series of 15 patients presenting with documented coronary artery disease. Following two sequential, one-week apart, peak-exercise injections of either 74 MBq of 201Tl or 370 MBq of 99Tcm-MIBI, tomographic views of the myocardium were reconstructed and two thick, central short-axis sections were divided into nine sectors. A sector was considered as showing a defect if its relative activity was lower than 30, 40, 50 or 60% of the highest level of activity in the 18 sectors. Results demonstrate that there were more defects with 201Tl than with 99Tcm-MIBI. However, the difference disappeared if the inferior wall was not included. These results suggest that depth attenuation could be, at least partly, responsible for the higher rate of positive results observed in single photon emission computed tomography with 201Tl than with 99Tcm-MIBI.
