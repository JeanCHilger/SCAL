Radioimmuno positron emission tomography with monoclonal antibodies: a new approach to quantifying in vivo tumour concentration and biodistribution for radioimmunotherapy. Radioimmunodetection of tumours with monoclonal antibodies is becoming an established procedure. Positron emission tomography (PET) shows better resolution than normal gamma camera single photon emission tomography and can provide more precise quantitative data. Thus, in the present study, these powerful methods have been combined to perform radioimmuno PET (RI-PET). Monoclonal antibodies directed against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) an IgG, its F(ab')2 and a mouse-human chimeric IgG derived from it were labelled with 124I, a positron-emitting radionuclide with a convenient physical half-life of four days. Mice, xenografted with a CEA-producing human colon carcinoma, were injected with the 124I-MAb and the tumours were visualized using PET. The concentrations of 124I in tumour and normal tissue were determined by both PET and direct radioactivity counting of the dissected animals, with very good agreement. To allow PET quantification, a procedure was established to account for the presence of radioactivity during the absorption correction measurement (transmission scan). Comparison of PET and tissue counting indicates that this novel combination of radioimmunolocalization and PET (RI-PET) will provide, in addition to more precise diagnosis, more accurate radiation dosimetry for radioimmunotherapy.
