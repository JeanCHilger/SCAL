Sustained hyperoxia stabilizes breathing in healthy individuals during NREM sleep. The present study was designed to determine whether hyperoxia would lower the hypocapnic apneic threshold (AT) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Nasal noninvasive mechanical ventilation was used to induce hypocapnia and subsequent central apnea in healthy subjects during stable NREM sleep. Mechanical ventilation trials were conducted under normoxic (room air) and hyperoxic conditions (inspired PO(2) > 250 Torr) in a random order. The CO(2) reserve was defined as the minimal change in end-tidal PCO(2) (PET(CO(2))) between eupnea and hypocapnic central apnea. The PET(CO(2)) of the apnea closest to eupnea was designated as the AT. The hypocapnic ventilatory response was calculated as the change in ventilation below eupnea for a given change in PET(CO(2)). In nine participants, compared with room air, exposure to hyperoxia was associated with a significant decrease in eupneic PET(CO(2)) (37.5 ± 0.6 vs. 41.1 ± 0.6 Torr, P = 0.001), widening of the CO(2) reserve (-3.8 ± 0.8 vs. -2.0 ± 0.3 Torr, P = 0.03), and a subsequent decline in AT (33.3 ± 1.2 vs. 39.0 ± 0.7 Torr P = 001). The hypocapnic ventilatory response was also decreased with hyperoxia. In conclusion, 1) hyperoxia was associated with a decreased AT and an increase in the magnitude of hypocapnia required for the development of central apnea. 2) Thus hyperoxia may mitigate the effects of hypocapnia on ventilatory motor output by lowering the hypocapnic ventilatory response and lowering the resting eupneic PET(CO(2)), thereby decreasing plant gain.
