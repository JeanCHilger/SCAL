In vivo validation of free-space fluorescence tomography using nuclear imaging. The performance of small animal photonic imaging has been considerably improved since the development of fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (fDOT), which can reconstruct fluorescent probe distribution inside tissue. However, the quantification capabilities of this new technology are still a topic of debate, especially in comparison to classical nuclear imaging techniques. Here, we present a method to in vivo calibrate the quantity and localization of a probe provided by free-space fDOT (where no plate is compressing the mouse) with positron emission tomography (PET) and x-ray computed tomography, respectively. This methodology allowed us to demonstrate a strong linear correlation (R(2)=0.95) between fDOT and PET for probe concentrations ranging from 3 nM to 1 Î¼M in a deep-seated organ.
