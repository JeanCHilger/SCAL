Production of 34m Cl and 38 Cl via the (d,α) reaction on 36 Ar and nat Ar gas at 8.4 MeV. Production of (38)Cl and (34m)Cl via the (d, α) reaction on natural argon and (36)Ar reveal medical cyclotrons' ability to supply these isotopes in small quantities. (38)Cl provides an inexpensive developmental tool, while (34m)Cl is a positron emitter of interest in PET imaging. Production yields, cyclotron target development, cryo-recovery of enriched gases, and nucleophilic chemistry of a model compound are described.
