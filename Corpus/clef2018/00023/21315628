A positron emission tomography study of wind-up pain in chronic postherniotomy pain. Many neuropathic pain conditions are characterized by abnormal responses to noxious or innocuous mechanical stimulation, including wind-up pain. Whereas previous brain imaging studies have explored the cerebral correlates of hyperalgesia and allodynia, no studies are available on mechanical-induced wind-up pain in neuropathic pain patients. We therefore used positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the cerebral response pattern of mechanical wind-up pain in a homogenous group of 10 neuropathic pain patients with long-standing postherniotomy pain in the groin area. Patients were scanned in the following conditions: (1) rest (2) wind-up pain, induced by 2 Hz von Frey stimulation in the painful area
