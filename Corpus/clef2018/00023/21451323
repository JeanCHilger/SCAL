Investigation of staff finger doses during quality control of FDG production. The European Pharmacopoeia and Good Manufacturing Practice define a number of quality control tests that must be performed prior to the release of FDG. The aim of this study is to determine the finger dose received while performing these tests. The finger dose received by four staff members was measured using Unfors NED monitors placed at the tip of the index finger of both hands during routine quality control. A total of 18 readings were obtained for the dispensing of the quality control samples, bubble point test, thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography, endotoxin test, Kryptofix test, multi-channel analyzer test, pH and high performance liquid chromatography. The average total dose for the completion of all tests was 1,508 μSv for the left hand and 846 μSv for the right hand. As a result of the bubble point test, 54% and 43% of the total dose is received for the left and right hand, respectively. The pH test, high performance liquid chromatography and dispensing of the QC sample also contribute significantly to the total dose. Staff may need to be defined as classified radiation workers as a result of the finger dose received during routine quality control. Automation of the bubble point test and dispensing should be considered during the planning and design of any new cyclotron production facility.
