Role of Integrated PET/CT Fusion in Lung Carcinoma. Positron emission tomography has emerged as an important diagnostic tool in the management of lung cancers. PET is sensitive in the detection of lung cancer, but FDG (2-deoxy-2-18fluro-D-glucose) is not tumor specific and may accumulate in a variety of non-malignant conditions occasionally giving false negative result. The addition of CT to PET improves specificity foremost, but also sensitivity in tumor imaging. Thus, PET/CT fusion images are a more accurate test than either of its individual components and are probably also better than side-by-side viewing of images from both modalities. PET/CT fusion images are useful in differentiating between malignant and benign disease, fibrosis and recurrence, staging and in changing patient management to a more appropriate therapy. With analysis and discussion, it appears that PET/ CT fusion images have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to manage the patients with lung cancer and is contributing to our understanding of cancer cell biology and in the development of new therapies.
