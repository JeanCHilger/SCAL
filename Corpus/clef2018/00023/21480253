Diagnostic and therapeutic imaging for cancer: therapeutic considerations and future directions. As cancer treatment cost soar and the mantra for "personalized medicine" grows louder, we will increasingly be searching for solutions to these diametrically opposed forces. In this review we highlight several exciting novel imaging strategies including MRI, CT, PET SPECT, sentinel node, and ultrasound imaging that hold great promise for improving outcomes through detection of lymph node involvement. We provide clinical data that demonstrate how these evolving strategies have the potential to transform treatment paradigms.
