Animal assisted therapy in a long-term care nursing home. Animal assisted therapy sessions have been set up at the Bellevaux nursing home in Besan√ßon. The project has required a number of specific procedures and training courses to be put in place as well as the involvement of different departments. The sessions give real pleasure to the residents and produce interesting results.
