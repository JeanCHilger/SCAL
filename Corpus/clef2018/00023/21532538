The dynamic marker hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease and its implications for clinical imaging. In the last ten years the literature on Alzheimer's disease has focused on in vivo neurobiological changes. Extracellular beta-amyloid and intracellular hyperphosphorilated tau deposition are pivotal features and several authors have described their progression over time in pathological specimens. The revised criteria for Alzheimer's disease suggest that in vivo biomarkers reflecting neurobiological changes are useful for early diagnosis in the clinical practice. The most widely used biomarkers for the Alzheimer's disease are: Abeta42 and Tau levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) brain glucose hypometabolism detected by positron emission tomography (PET) using the 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG)
