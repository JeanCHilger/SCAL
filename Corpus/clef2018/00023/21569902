Thyroid: nuclear medicine update. Nuclear medicine has been used in the evaluation and treatment of benign and malignant thyroid disease since the discovery of iodine 131 ((131)I) in the 1930s. Although traditional methods of imaging are routinely used, recent advancements such as SPECT/CT and PET/CT have greatly enhanced the ability of nuclear medicine to accurately detect and localize. Guidelines for the management of thyroid cancer continue to evolve, treatment regimens selected should balance the long-term risk of disease recurrence and cumulative risks of radiation exposure, and physicians should be aware of these updates and guidelines when caring for patients with thyroid disease.
