Role of SPECT and SPECT/CT in the Surgical Treatment of Primary Hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in the outpatient population. This condition is usually the result of a single hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland. Targeted parathyroidectomy guided by intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring (IPM) through a small cervical incision has replaced traditional bilateral neck exploration (BNE) as the initial approach in the surgical treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism at many medical centers worldwide. Preoperative sestamibi-technetium 99m scintigraphy serves as an important prerequisite for successful targeted parathyroidectomy. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and CT fusion, however, is a recent imaging technique that provides a three-dimensional functional image with advanced contrast resolution to greatly improve preoperative localization of parathyroid tumors.
