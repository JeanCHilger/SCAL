Microvascular function is selectively impaired in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sarcomere myofilament gene mutations. The purpose of this study was to assess myocardial blood flow (MBF) using positron emission tomography in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) according to genetic status.Coronary microvascular dysfunction is an important feature of HCM, associated with ventricular remodeling and heart failure. We recently demonstrated the increased prevalence of systolic dysfunction in patients with HCM with sarcomere myofilament gene mutations and postulated an association between genetic status and coronary microvascular dysfunction.Maximum MBF (intravenous dipyridamole, 0.56 mg/kg Dip-MBF) was measured using (13)N-labeled ammonia in 61 patients with HCM (age 38 ± 14 years), genotyped by automatic DNA sequencing of 8 myofilament-encoding genes (myosin-binding protein C, beta-myosin heavy chain, regulatory and essential light chains, troponin T, troponin I, troponin C, alpha-tropomyosin, and alpha-actin). In 35 patients, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed.Fifty-three mutations were identified in 42 of the 61 patients (genotype positive 69%). Despite similar clinical profiles, genotype-positive patients with HCM showed substantially lower Dip-MBF compared with that of genotype-negative patients (1.7 ± 0.6 ml/min/g vs. 2.4 ± 1.2 ml/min/gPatients with HCM with sarcomere myofilament mutations are characterized by more severe impairment of microvascular function and increased prevalence of myocardial fibrosis, compared with genotype-negative individuals. These findings suggest a direct link between sarcomere gene mutations and adverse remodeling of the microcirculation in HCM, accounting for the increased long-term prevalence of ventricular dysfunction and heart failure in genotype-positive patients.
