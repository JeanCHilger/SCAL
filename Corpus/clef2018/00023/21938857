Cys-Asp-Cys-Arg-Gly-Asp-Cys-Phe-Cys/Cy5.5-Ferritin  Optical fluorescence imaging is increasingly used to monitor biological functions of specific targets in small animals (1-3). However, the intrinsic fluorescence of biomolecules poses a problem when fluorophores that absorb visible light (350–700 nm) are used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700–1,000 nm) detection avoids the background fluorescence interference of natural biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues. NIR fluorophores have a wider dynamic range and minimal background as a result of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. They also have high sensitivity, resulting from low fluorescence background, and high extinction coefficients, which provide high quantum yields. The NIR region is also compatible with solid-state optical components, such as diode lasers and silicon detectors. NIR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging is becoming a noninvasive alternative to radionuclide imaging in small animals (4, 5). Integrins are a family of heterodimeric, cell-surface glycoproteins that mediate diverse biological events involving cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions (6). Integrins comprise an α and a β subunit, and they are important for cell adhesion and signal transduction. The α
