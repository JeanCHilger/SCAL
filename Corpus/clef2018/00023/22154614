Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis, inflammatory aortic aneurysm, and inflammatory pericarditis--retrospective analysis of 11 case histories. Retroperitoneal fibrosis, inflammatory aortic aneurysm, and pericardial and mediastinal fibrosis are characterized by infiltration of immuno-inflammatory cells and deposition of thickened fibrous tissues. Several recent studies suggested that an immunoglobulin-G4 (IgG4)-related immunological mechanism may play a role in these diseases. By searching the clinical database of patients admitted to our department between 2000 and 2010, we summarized the clinical data of 11 patients who were diagnosed to have these disorders. The diagnoses were idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (8 cases), mediastinal and/or pericardial fibrosis (4 cases), inflammatory abdominal aneurysm (2 cases), and inflammatory coronary periarteritis (1 case). Hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were found in 45%, 36%, and 55%, respectively, in these patients, and they were all either current or former smokers. Two patients with pericardial involvement showed a rushed clinical course, resulting in in-hospital death. Serum levels of IgG were elevated in 67%, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor was elevated in 75%, when measured. Immunohistochemical analysis showed marked infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells in the pericardium in patients who died of constrictive pericarditis. Our data support the notion that immune-inflammatory mechanism, which might be IgG4-related sometimes, may play a role in idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis, inflammatory aortic aneurysm, and mediastinal/pericardial fibrosis, although clinical course may differ substantially.
