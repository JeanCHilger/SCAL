Utility of F-18 FDG PET/CT in screening for paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for the investigation of patients with suspected paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome (PNS).We reviewed the whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT studies (ordered by the neurology department) performed at our hospital between December 2005 and November 2010 27 cases (16 men, 11 womenOf the 27 patients, 6 (22%) had an abnormal FDG uptake. Of these 6 patients, 5 (19%) were histologically confirmed as having a malignancy. Of the 27 patients, 7 were tested for the presence of well-characterized paraneoplastic antibodies (anti-Hu, anti-Ri, anti-Yo) 1 had anti-Hu, but the patient did not have an abnormal FDG uptake or malignancy.PET/CT may be a useful screening tool for patients with clinically suspected PNS who do not exhibit well-characterized paraneoplastic antibodies. Therefore, we recommended that PET/CT should be performed for patients with clinically suspicious PNS regardless of the presence of well-characterized paraneoplastic antibodies.
