The role of myocardial viability assessed by perfusion/F-18 FDG imaging in children with anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. Although surgical treatments evolved, the short-term postoperative mortality is still high in children with anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), and long-term survivors may suffer from restrained functional recovery. Therefore, an optimal means in predicting postoperative reversal is demanded. In this study, we assess the utility of myocardial perfusion/F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) imaging in the evaluation of myocardial viability and postsurgery functional recovery in children with ALCAPA.A retrospective study was performed in 7 children with diagnosed ALCAPA who underwent myocardial perfusion/F-18 FDG imaging preoperatively. Global viability index was used to evaluate myocardial viability and was compared with the preoperative deviations of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) from age-matched healthy children and with the postoperative durations of intensive care.Children with more viable myocardium had less severe clinical symptoms. The viability index was correlated well with the preoperative deviations of LVEF (r = -0.98, P = 0.001) and LVEDD (r = 0.87, P = 0.02) and postoperative durations of intensive care hospitalization (r = 0.77, P = 0.04) and mechanical ventilation (r = 0.83, P = 0.02). LVEF and LVEDD reached normal range within 5 months in viable children, whereas incomplete reversal was observed in partial- and nonviable children.In children with ALCAPA, myocardial viability evaluated by perfusion/F-18 FDG imaging is related to the preoperative clinical manifestations and cardiac function. Additionally, it may predict functional recovery after surgical repair.
