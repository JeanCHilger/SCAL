ICM+: a versatile software for assessment of CSF dynamics. ICM+ software was introduced into the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Dynamics Laboratory, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK, in 2003. Since then 1,447 constant rate infusion tests and 123 overnight ICP monitoring sessions (using intraparenchymal bolt) were performed. Various configurations were used: ICP only (identification of CSF dynamics model and overnight ICP monitoring with analysis of compensatory reserve and B waves) ICP and arterial pressure (ABP
