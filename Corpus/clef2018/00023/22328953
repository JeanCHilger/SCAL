Osseous metastasis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma treated successfully with oxaliplatin, tegafur and leucovorin combination chemotherapy: a case report. Bone metastasis from cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is rare. We report a case of cutaneous SCC which was diagnosed by the presence of bone metastasis and treated with combination chemotherapy. A 53 year male had tissue contusion and persistent ulcer in the multiple regions of body for about 30 years and treat with Chinese Herbal Drugs in several hospitals, however, did not thorough cure. He was referred to our hospital for a dermatological examination in March 2009. Excisional biopsy and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan showed an invasive cutaneous SCC concomitant bone metastasis. Surgical treatment is limited, because of multiple cancerous ulcer and metastatic spreading. Therefore, we proceed to treat with oxaliplatin, tegafur and leucovorin (LV) combination chemotherapy and other adjuvant therapy. About 5 months following chemotherapy, the general situation of the patient was improved. Further cycle of chemotherapy resulted in complete disappearance of the tumor masses (confirmed by PET-CT). So far, there was no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis. This report indicates that the combination chemotherapy of oxaliplatin, tegafur and LV seems to have a considerable therapeutic effect for cutaneous SCC concomitant malignant bone metastasis.
