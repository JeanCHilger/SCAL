Zn2GeO4 and In2Ge2O7 nanowire mats based ultraviolet photodetectors on rigid and flexible substrates. Ternary metal oxide, Zn2GeO4, In2Ge2O7, have potential applications in many research areas. Using a single chemical vapor deposition method, high-quality single crystalline Zn2GeO4 nanowire (NW) mats and In2Ge2O7 NW mats were synthesized on a large scale. Nanowires mats based ultraviolet photodetectors were fabricated on rigid silicon substrates. By simply transferring the nanowire mats to a transparent adhesive PET tape, flexible photodetectors were also fabricated. Both the rigid and flexible photodetectors exhibited excellent photoconductive performance in terms of high sensitivity to the UV light, excellent stability and reproducibility, and fast response and recovery time.
