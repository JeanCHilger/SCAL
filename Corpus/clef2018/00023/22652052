Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel technetium-99m labeled phenylbenzoxazole derivatives as potential imaging probes for β-amyloid plaques in brain. Two uncharged (99m)Tc-labeled phenylbenzoxazole derivatives were biologically evaluated as potential imaging probes for β-amyloid plaques. The (99m)Tc and corresponding rhenium complexes were synthesized by coupling monoamine-monoamide dithiol (MAMA) and bis(aminoethanethiol) (BAT) chelating ligand via a pentyloxy spacer to phenylbenzoxazole. The fluorescent rhenium complexes 6 and 9 selectively stainined the β-amyloid plaques on the sections of transgenic mouse, and showed high affinity for Aβ((1-42)) aggregates (K(i)=11.1 nM and 14.3 nM, respectively). Autoradiography in vitro indicated that [(99m)Tc]6 clearly labeled β-amyloid plaques on the sections of transgenic mouse. Biodistribution experiments in normal mice revealed that [(99m)Tc]6 displayed moderate initial brain uptake (0.81% ID/g at 2 min), and quickly washed out from the brain (0.25% ID/g at 60 min). The preliminary results indicate that the properties of [(99m)Tc]6 are promising, although additional refinements are needed to improve the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.
