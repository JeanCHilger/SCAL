Risk stratification and prognostic assessment by myocardial perfusion-gated SPECT in patients with left bundle-branch block and low-intermediate cardiac risk. In high-risk patients with left bundle-branch block (LBBB), functional but not perfusion parameters yield incremental prognostic information. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prognostic value of gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in low-intermediate risk LBBB patients.One hundred seventy-six subjects underwent stress-rest dual-day protocol 99mTc sestamibi-gated SPECT and were dichotomized in two groups: without LBBB (Group 1, n = 86) and with LBBB (Group 2, n = 90). Patients were followed for 32 ± 18 months. Cox regression multivariate analysis was used to determine which variable was the best predictor of cardiac event. Event-free survival curves were computed by Kaplan-Meier method.Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy was abnormal in 32 and 60 patients for Groups 1 and 2, respectively (37 vs. 67 %, p < 0.001). In Groups 1 and 2, the mean summed stress score (SSS) was 3.7 ± 5.6 versus 6.7 ± 6.4, while the mean summed difference score (SDS) was 1.6 ± 2.5 versus 2.7 ± 3.3 (both p < 0.005) therefore 34 % of patients in Group 1 and 53 % of those in Group 2 presented myocardial ischemia. All functional parameters were significantly different between the two subsets (all p < 0.005). Follow-up was completed in 161 patients (92 %)This is the first study to assess the prognostic value of gated SPECT in patients with LBBB and low-intermediate cardiac risk. Both perfusion and functional data obtained by gated SPECT are different between patients with and without LBBB. However, SDS is the only predictor of events. Thus, the amount of reversible ischemia at gated SPECT has a discriminative power in stratifying the cardiac risk of LBBB population.
