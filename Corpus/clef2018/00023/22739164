Value of (18)F-FLT positron emission tomography/computed tomography in diagnosis and staging of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of (18)F-FLT positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in diagnosis and staging of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients and compare with CT. Thirty-six patients with DLBCL in our hospital from September 2008 to December 2009 were prospectively evaluated. All 36 patients underwent whole body and head (18)F-FLT PET/CT and CT (chest, abdomen cavity and pelvis) were studied before therapy. The maximal standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) of every single focus and the SUV(max) of aortic arch blood pool were measured and used to calculate the median T/MB value (tumor SUV(max)/mediastinal SUV(max)) of every patient. The results showed that the consistency of (18)F-FLT PET/CT and CT examinations in focus of DLBCL was 79.10%, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accurate rate of (18)F-FLT PET/CT were 96.65%, 100%, 100%, 61.11% and 96.82%, respectively, which were much higher than that of CT (85.44%, 57.14%, 96.70%, 21.05% and 83.64%). It is concluded that the (18)F-FLT PET/CT is a good means for DLBCL diagnosis and staging, which is more sensitive and specific than CT.
