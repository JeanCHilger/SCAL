Metabolomics evaluation of hydroxyproline as a potential marker of melamine and cyanuric acid nephrotoxicity in male and female Fischer F344 rats. Following kidney failure in domesticated pets in the US and kidney issues requiring hospitalization with some deaths in children in China, investigators determined the cause was adulteration of pet foods and baby formula with melamine. It has since been noted that exposure of rats to melamine and cyanuric acid forms melamine cyanurate crystals in the kidney leading to acute nephrotoxicity. This metabolomics study aimed to identify biomarkers of melamine and cyanuric acid-induced renal injury. Male and female Fischer 344 rats were fed a diet fortified with varying doses of melamine and cyanuric acid for 28 days. Analysis of urinary amino acids showed hydroxyproline was increased in both sexes in a manner consistent with the clinical chemistry and histopathology data most prominent when total urine output was taken into account. Furthermore, rats with the highest levels of urinary hydroxyproline were the only rats that exhibited fibrosis within the kidney. Clinical chemistry and histopathology indicated male rats were slightly more affected than female rats following dosing with the 120 and 180 ppm formulations
