Pre-transplant (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-based survival model in patients with aggressive lymphoma undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and autologous SCT. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) documented response after salvage chemotherapy has been reported to impact survival in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, especially diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) undergoing high dose chemotherapy and autologous SCT (HDC auto-SCT). We reviewed the impact of 19 different prognostic/predictive factors before salvage chemotherapy and post-salvage chemotherapy FDG-PET results in patients with aggressive lymphoma and developed an FDG-PET integrated model for post-HDC auto-SCT outcome. The Fine and Gray method for competing risk analysis and a regression model was used to assess the risk associated with different factors on outcome. Fifty-five patients had FDG-PET after salvage chemotherapy male 65%, female 45%, relapsed 55%, refractory 45%, DLBCL 82%, T cell lymphoma 18%, median age at auto-SCT 40 years, median follow-up 42.4 months. Multivariate analysis identified only positive FDG-PET (P=0.04) and mediastinal involvement (P=0.05) with higher hazard rate of disease-specific death (model P=0.008) but only positive FDG-PET (P=0.01) for disease-specific events (persistent, progressive or relapsed disease). Cumulative incidence of disease-specific death for patients with 0, 1 and 2 risk factors was 5, 30 and 62%, respectively (P=0.01). Our model is significant and showed an increasing risk of failure with mediastinal involvement and post-salvage positive FDG-PET.
