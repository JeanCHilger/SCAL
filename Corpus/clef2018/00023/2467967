The investigation of Alzheimer's disease with single photon emission tomography. Twenty patients satisfying standard clinical criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and six age-matched normal controls were studied using 99mTc hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime and single photon emission tomography. The AD patients had lower regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the temporal and posterior parietal lobes compared to controls. AD patients with apraxia and aphasia had lower rCBF in the lateral temporal and posterior parietal lobes than AD patients without these features. Within the AD group, correlations were found between neuropsychological tests and rCBF: praxis correlated with posterior parietal activity, memory with left temporal lobe activity and language with activity throughout the left hemisphere.
