Craniofacial injuries and cerebral tomographic scintigraphy using N-isopropyl-iodo-amphetamine 123 I-AMP. An investigation was done with N.-isopropyl-iodoamphetamine (123I AMP) in 20 patients: 10 patients with craniofacial injury and 10 patients without brain dysfunction or injury. Brain X ray computerized Tomography was normal. SPECT 123 I AMP detected functional defects related with traumatic impacts. Sensitivity is higher with SPECT than with CT Scan. The indications for the initial evaluation of head injury, and the relations with later sequelae i.e. post traumatic epilepsia and subjective syndrome are discussed.
