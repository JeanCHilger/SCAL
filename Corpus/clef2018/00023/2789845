Measurement of regional myocardial blood flow in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: application of the first-pass flow model using [13N]ammonia and PET. Positron emission tomography (PET) has become an important tool in the study of regional myocardial blood flow. The purpose of the present study was to measure regional myocardial blood flow using dynamic [13N]ammonia PET and the first-pass flow model. Thirteen patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and with a considerably thickened ventricular wall (25 mm or greater), were selected for the study in order to minimize errors due to spillover of radioactivity from blood to the myocardium and to the underestimation of myocardial activity caused by the partial volume effect. Arterial input function was determined by assigning a region of interest to the left atrial cavity on the PET images. Using left atrial and myocardial time-activity curves, regional myocardial blood flow was calculated using the first-pass flow model. Mean myocardial blood flow ranged from 47.8 to 76.5 ml/min per 100 g (63.0 +/- 9.4). Regional myocardial blood flow in the septum was significantly lower than in the anterior and lateral walls of the left ventricle (P less than .01). These results indicate the potential usefulness of dynamic PET in the measurement of regional myocardial blood flow in man.
