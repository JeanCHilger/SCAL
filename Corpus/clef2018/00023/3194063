Heterogeneous anterior-posterior metabolic patterns in dementia of the Alzheimer type. The parietal-frontal distribution of reductions of regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rCMRglc) was studied in 32 patients with mild to severe dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), using positron emission tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose, and was related to patterns of neuropsychological impairment. In moderate and severe DAT patients, one frontal association region, the premotor cortex, demonstrated significant metabolic reductions equivalent to reductions in the parietal association cortex, and the ratio of parietal to premotor rCMRglc had significantly greater variance than in controls. In moderately demented patients, parietal-premotor and parietal-prefrontal metabolic ratios correlated significantly with neuropsychological impairments. Disproportionate parietal hypometabolism was associated with more impairment of verbal comprehension, calculations, visuospatial construction, and immediate visuospatial memory span. Disproportionate frontal hypometabolism was associated with more impaired verbal fluency and attention. Longitudinal follow-up of 20 of the patients showed that parietal/frontal metabolic ratios and their correlated neuropsychological patterns were stable over time, as dementia severity worsened. These results indicate that in moderate to severe DAT patients, metabolic reductions in the premotor cortex are as severe as the reductions in the parietal association cortex. Moreover, the parietal-premotor distribution of metabolic reductions is variable and related to variable patterns of cognitive impairment.
