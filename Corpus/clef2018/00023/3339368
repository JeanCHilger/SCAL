Biochemical and autoradiographic study of cerebral protein synthesis with [18F]-and [14C]fluorophenylalanine. Fluorine-18-labeled ortho or para isomers of L-fluorophenylalanine were used in double-label experiments together with L-[3H]phenylalanine for amino acid incorporation into cerebral proteins of Mongolian gerbil brain. It was demonstrated by qualitative regional comparison of the 18F and 3H autoradiographic images that L-p-[18F]fluorophenylalanine is incorporated into proteins and exhibits a regional cerebral protein synthesis pattern. To a minor extent, L-p-fluorophenyl[3-14C]alanine and L-o-[18F]fluorophenylalanine are hydroxylated in vivo to form labeled tyrosine or tyrosine analogues that are incorporated into cerebral proteins as well. The advantage and validity of the application of L-p-[18F]fluorophenylalanine with positron emission tomography for noninvasive studies of cerebral protein synthesis in humans are evaluated on the basis of an experimental animal approach.
