Human-companion animal relationships and animal behavior problems. The compatibility of the social systems of humans and companion animals has facilitated the formation of a unique interspecific relationship. Some of the most common behavior problems that people have with their pets are a result of the type of relationship that has formed between them. In most cases, neither pet nor owner is exhibiting abnormal behavior rather, they are demonstrating normal species-typical behaviors that are unacceptable to the other species.
