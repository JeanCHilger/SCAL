Laboratory animal technicians. Their role in stress reduction and human-companion animal bonding. The physical and emotional well-being of laboratory animals is often dependent upon the knowledge and ability of the responsible technician. Management has the obligation to place only technicians who are well-trained, compassionate, and highly motivated in responsible positions of animal care and to recognize the legitimacy of, and strongly support, the emotional and behavioral needs of both technicians and animals.
