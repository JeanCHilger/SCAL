Computed tomography-guided stereotactic systems. CT stereotactic guidance systems of modern design provide the neurosurgeon with a precise methodology in approaching intracranial targets. These systems eliminate the potential inaccuracy of freehand approach, no matter how skilled the neurosurgeon. System software which requires no specialized computer expertise has been developed. To accommodate the many requirements of operative manipulation, a total operating system using both standard and innovative surgical instruments has been adapted to the BRW frame. Utilizing the imaging mode for localizing data alone, the system can be used with multiple imaging modes and in multiple locations. Thus, the system can be used for standard methods of functional neurosurgery utilizing ventriculography, new methods of functional neurosurgery using either combined ventriculography and CT or CT alone, and for newer modes of imaging including ultrasound for real-time monitoring of the target lesion during surgery, and target localization using positron emission tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance. It is our belief that CT-guided stereotactic systems could become a standard technique for approaching all intraparenchymal brain targets.
