Computed gamma-tomographic estimation of a hepatic weight index during liver regeneration. Single photon emission computed tomography was used to evaluate the total functioning liver mass and the regeneration process after partial hepatectomy. Serial tomographic sections were performed after infusion of 99m Technetium. In studies on dogs and in human beings, computed gammatomography enabled to calculate the liver mass with less than 10 p. 100 error. Hepatic regeneration was studied in 10 patients following resection of 46 to 84 p. 100 of the initial liver mass. The remaining liver mass increased rapidly postoperatively and doubled within 13 to 18 days. The regeneration process followed an exponential curve. Assessment of liver regeneration by this non-invasive technique should be of great help following partial hepatectomy.
