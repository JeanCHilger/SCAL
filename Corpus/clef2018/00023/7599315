Subunit interaction enhances enzyme activity and stability of sweet potato cytosolic Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase purified by a His-tagged recombinant protein method. The coding region of copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) cDNA from sweet potato, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. cv. Tainong 57, was introduced into an expression vector, pET-20b(+). The Cu/Zn-SOD purified by His-tagged technique showed two active forms (dimer and monomer). The amount of proteins of dimer and monomer appeared to be equal, but the activity of dimeric form was seven times higher than that of monomeric form. The enzyme was dissociated into monomer by imidazole buffer above 1.0 M, acidic pH (below 3.0), or SDS (above 1%). The enzyme is quite stable. The enzyme activity is not affected at 85 degrees C for 20 min, in alkali pH 11.2, or in 0.1 M EDTA and also quite resistant to proteolytic attack. Dimer is more stable than monomer. The thermal inactivation rate constant kd calculated for the monomer at 85 degrees C was 0.029 min-1 and the half-life for inactivation was about 28 min. In contrast, there is no significant change of dimer activity after 40 min at 85 degrees C. The enzyme dimer and monomer retained 83% and 58% of original activity, respectively, after 3 h incubation with trypsin at 37 degrees C, while those retained 100% and 31% of original activity with chymotrypsin under the same condition. These results suggest subunit interaction might change the enzyme conformation and greatly improve the catalytic activity and stability of the enzyme. It is also possible that the intersubunit contacts stabilize a particular optimal conformation of the protein or the dimeric structure enhances catalytic activity by increasing the electrostatic steering of substrate into the active site.
