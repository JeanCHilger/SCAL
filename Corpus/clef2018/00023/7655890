Striatal opioid receptor binding in Parkinson's disease, striatonigral degeneration and Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome, A [11C]diprenorphine PET study. The clinical differentiation of Parkinson's disease from the striatonigral degeneration (SND) type of multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome (SRO) may be difficult. This is reflected by a 20-25% misdiagnosis rate in clinicopathological series of cases labelled as 'Parkinson's disease' in life. The caudate and putamen contain a high density of opioidergic neurons and receptors which have a close anatomical and physiological relationship with the dopaminergic system. We used [11C]diprenorphine with PET to investigate striatal opioid receptor binding in groups of patients with clinically defined Parkinson's disease (n = 8), SND (n = 7) and SRO (n = 6), compared with normal controls (n = 8). There was no significant difference between mean ligand binding in the putamen and caudate of Parkinson's disease cases when compared with normals. Mean putamen, but not caudate, opioid receptor binding was significantly reduced in the SND group, when compared with normals. By contrast, in the SRO group, both mean caudate and putamen opioid receptor binding was significantly reduced when compared with both normal and Parkinson's disease groups. When considering the individual patients, none of the eight Parkinson's disease cases (0%), none of the seven SND cases (0%), but four of the six SRO cases (67%) had caudate opioid receptor binding that was > 2.5 SDs below the normal mean. Corresponding figures for putamen opioid receptor binding were: none of the Parkinson's disease cases (0%) three of the SND cases (43%)
