Serial change of 123I-BMIPP SPECT imaging during recovery from stunned myocardium after acute myocardial infarction--correlation with 201Tl and two-dimensional echocardiography. Using 123I-beta-methyl iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (123I-BMIPP), we investigated changes in myocardial fatty acid metabolism at recovery from stunned myocardium after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), correlation with recovery of regional wall motion and thallium-201 (201Tl) distribution in particular. The subjects were 15 patients who underwent successful reperfusion therapy after the first onset of AMI. None of the patients had multi-vessel disease or ischemic episode during their clinical course. Patients underwent 123I-BMIPP scintigraphy, 201Tl scintigraphy and two-dimensional echocardiography during the acute and chronic phases. Then, we compared regional wall motion with distribution of 123I-BMIPP and 201Tl. Regional wall motion and SPECT were evaluated by the established 16 segment model. In patients, showing serial improvement in regional wall motion, there was 80.0% (8/10) showed normal 201Tl distribution during the acute phase or normalized during the chronic phase. However, distribution of 123I-BMIPP normalized only in 10.0% (1/10) of this group. In examination of each segment that showed serial improvement in regional wall motion, 92.3% (24/26) of these segments showed normal distribution of 201Tl during the acute phase or normalized distribution during chronic phase, despite distribution of 123I-BMIPP improved in only 3.8% (1/26) of these segments. These indicate that, in the process of recovery from myocardial stunning after AMI, abnormal distribution of 123I-BMIPP continued longer than abnormal distribution of 201Tl.
