Report of a symposium on diagnosis and treatment of adult soft tissue sarcomas in the head and neck. A series of presentations and discussions was held during a symposium on the diagnosis and treatment of adult soft tissue sarcomas in the head and neck (HNSTS). The purpose of this meeting was to define guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of HNSTS. The results of this symposium are summarized and condensed in this report. Recommendations are made for diagnostic strategies and for treatment. Diagnostic efforts in PET scanning and dynamic MRI need to be expanded to detect early recurrences. Firm pathological diagnosis remains the basis for further treatment strategy. Wide surgical excision, if feasible, in combination with radiotherapy is the treatment of choice.
