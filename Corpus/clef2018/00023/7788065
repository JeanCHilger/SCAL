Neuroreceptor mapping with in-vivo imaging techniques: principles and applications. Functional imaging techniques can now be used to map neuroreceptor distribution in the living human brain. This permits direct investigation of neurochemical abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders and opens possibilities for the development of more specific pharmacological treatments for these conditions. This article reviews the basic principles of neuroreceptor imaging and recent research findings in the area.
