Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in heart transplant recipients with and without allograft atherosclerosis: a comparison of thallium-201 and technetium 99m sestamibi. Our objectives were to assess the comparative value of thallium-201 and technetium 99m sestamibi for the detection of cardiac allograft atherosclerosis and the left ventricular ejection fraction response to exercise in heart transplant recipients with and without allograft atherosclerosis. Allograft atherosclerosis is the critical factor limiting long-term survival in heart transplant recipients. Annual coronary angiography is invasive and expensive. A noninvasive test to detect allograft atherosclerosis would be clinically useful. Treadmill exercise testing followed by myocardial perfusion single-photon computed tomographic imaging was performed in 25 heart transplant recipients. All patients underwent coronary angiography. Group 1 (13 patients) had angiographic coronary artery disease group 2 (12 patients) did not. Eighteen patients underwent two exercise tests to equivalent work loads with thallium-201 and technetium 99m sestamibi
