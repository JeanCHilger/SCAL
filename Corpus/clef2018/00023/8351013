Single-photon emission computed tomographic investigation of patients with motor neuron disease. To investigate the correlation between involvement of the CNS in motor neuron disease (MND) and neuroimaging abnormalities, we studied 18 patients with MND by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and MRI. Patients were divided into four groups according to the results of SPECT. Group 1 consisted of four patients with reduced isotope uptake in the frontal lobe, including the motor area, and in the anterior part of the temporal lobe group 2 consisted of two patients with reduced isotope uptake in the motor area spreading to the adjacent frontal lobe
