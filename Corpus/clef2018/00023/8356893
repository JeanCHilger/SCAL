The pattern of regional cerebral blood flow during alcohol withdrawal--a single photon emission tomography study with 99mTc-HMPAO. Cerebral blood flow was investigated during alcohol withdrawal in 15 male alcoholics by single photon emission computerized tomography with 99mTc-HMPAO and compared with the results of a second study 3 weeks later when all symptoms of withdrawal had disappeared and when the patients had been free of medication for at least 1 week. Slice images were reconstructed parallel to the orbitomeatal plane, and tracer activity was analyzed in 8 regions of interest per hemisphere. During alcohol withdrawal a special pattern of cerebral blood flow distribution could be observed. Relative perfusion was elevated in both inferior temporal regions, whereas it was reduced in the superior temporal region of both hemispheres. The changes of cerebral blood flow distribution did not correlate with neuropsychological findings nor with the severity of withdrawal syndrome.
