Increased regional cerebral blood flow in inferior occipital cortex and cerebellum of early blind humans. Cerebral flow indices were measured in 7 early blind and 13 sighted persons twice, during a task of passive and of active touch. In the blind, inferior occipital and cerebellar indices were higher. But they were not significantly modified by the kind of tactile task.
