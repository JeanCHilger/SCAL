Regional cardiac sympathetic nerve dysfunction and the diagnostic efficacy of metaiodobenzylguanidine tomography in stable coronary artery disease. The present study endeavors to correlate regional myocardial sympathetic nerve dysfunction with reversible and persistent perfusion abnormalities and depressed regional wall motion, and to determine the diagnostic efficacy of radio-iodinated metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) tomography for detecting coronary artery disease. In 28 consecutive patients with stable coronary artery disease and 7 patients with atypical chest pain but no coronary stenosis, regional MIBG uptake was semiquantitatively evaluated in 13 left ventricular segments early (30 minutes) and late (4 hours) after injection. Regional MIBG uptake was reduced in 68 of 90 segments (76%) showing reversible perfusion abnormality and 72 of 81 segments (89%) showing persistent abnormality 4 hours after injection. Although the sensitivity and negative predictive values of late MIBG scanning for detecting myocardial perfusion abnormalities were relatively high (82% and 85%, respectively), the specificity, positive predictive value, and kappa value were low (63%, 57%, and 0.41, respectively). Right coronary lesions were detected by late MIBG scanning with a high sensitivity (85%) but a low specificity (41%). Conversely, the sensitivities for detecting lesions in the other 2 major left coronary arteries were low (55%). The overall diagnostic accuracy of late MIBG scanning was 66% and the positive and negative predictive values and kappa value were low 60%, 70%, and 0.31, respectively. Similarly, regional sympathetic dysfunction was observed in 42 of 49 asynergic segments (86%) on late MIBG scans, of which 32 segments were viable and 10 nonviable
