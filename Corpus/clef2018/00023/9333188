Open field activity and human interaction as a function of age and breed in dogs. Open field (OF) activity was studied in kennel reared purebred beagles from two separate colonies (2-13 years in age) and pound source mixed breed dogs (9 months to 10 years in age). Dogs were observed for 10 min sessions and records were taken of: locomotion, urination, sniffing, grooming, rearing, vocalizing, jumping frequencies and inactivity (16). Since dogs are uniquely social towards people, we also measured human interaction (HI), which recorded the same behaviors as during OF when a person was present in the room. Measures of exploratory behavior decreased as a function of age in pound source dogs in the OF test, but not in beagles from either colony. No breed differences were found between the young dogs. In the HI test, age effects were found in beagles but not pound source dogs. OF activity correlated with tests of cognitive function, but differences were found between the three groups. These findings indicate that OF activity is age-sensitive in dogs, but that breed and test conditions are also essential factors.
