Neuroimaging and neuropsychology of the striatum. Bridging basic science and clinical practice. Neuroimaging and neuropsychology are complementary disciplines that provide powerful means for assessing the structure and function of corticostriatal systems. Findings from four model basal ganglia disorders--OCD, TS, HD, and PD--are reviewed. This survey is intended as a vehicle for illustrating the breadth of current clinical and research applications, as well as the potential for future advances. The perspectives brought by neuroimaging and neuropsychology serve as a natural bridge from the basic neuroscience to the clinical practice articles in this issue.
