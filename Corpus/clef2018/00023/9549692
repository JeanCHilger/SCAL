Using the ACNP Proficiency Testing Program to develop critical thinking. American College of Nuclear Physicians. Critical thinking is cited as one of the essential skills for clinical practice. Educators need to be aware of barriers that may hinder the development of this skill in students and cultivate strategies to encourage it. This article describes one strategy to develop critical thinking.Students participated in a critical thinking exercise by imaging the American College of Nuclear Physicians (ACNP) Renal Imaging Proficiency Test Phantom, critiquing their results, and comparing their results to results collected nationally in other nuclear medicine facilities and the true values reported by the ACNP. Students were instructed to review pertinent imaging principles before discussing the imaging results. They also were supplied with a list of questions pertinent to the review.Students experienced the complexity of designing a SPECT imaging protocol and how the final results are affected by the choices made by the technologist. They learned the importance of and method for proper matrix selection, determination of pixel size and the necessity for quality control.The imaging exercise was a successful means of helping students connect clinical practice with theory through the use of critical thinking.
