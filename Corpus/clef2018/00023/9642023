Cerebral networks and functional brain asymmetry: evidence from regional metabolic changes during word repetition. Word repetition causes a significant bilateral metabolic increase in both superior temporal cortices. Frontal speech areas are less activated despite their presumable speech competence. We investigated in this study the relationship between frontal and temporal cortical areas during word repetition. We measured regional cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (CMRGI) in 15 normal subjects with positron emission tomography (PET) at rest and during word repetition. Significant correlations connected frontal and temporal areas of both hemispheres, notwithstanding their different levels of mean metabolic activation. The left planum temporale was a hub of significant interregional correlations, in contrast to its contralateral mate. This study indicates that an asymmetric network of significant connections orchestrates the speech-relevant cortical areas according to the actual needs of speech processing.
