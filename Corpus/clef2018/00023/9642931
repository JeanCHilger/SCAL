Regional cerebral blood flow measurements by a noninvasive microsphere method using 123I-IMP: comparison with the modified fractional uptake method and the continuous arterial blood sampling method. A noninvasive microsphere method using N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP), developed by Yonekura et al., was performed in 10 patients with neurological diseases to quantify regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Regional CBF values by this method were compared with rCBF values simultaneously estimated from both the modified fractional uptake (FU) method using cardiac output developed by Miyazaki et al. and the conventional method with continuous arterial blood sampling. In comparison, we designated the factor which converted raw SPECT voxel counts to rCBF values as a CBF factor. A highly significant correlation (r = 0.962, p < 0.001) was obtained in the CBF factors between the present method and the continuous arterial blood sampling method. The CBF factors by the present method were only 2.7% higher on the average than those by the continuous arterial blood sampling method. There were significant correlation (r = 0.811 and r = 0.798, p < 0.001) in the CBF factor between modified FU method (threshold for estimating total brain SPECT counts 10% and 30% respectively) and the continuous arterial blood sampling method. However, the CBF factors of the modified FU method showed 31.4% and 62.3% higher on the average (threshold
