SPECT brain blood flow changes with continuous ligand infusion during previously learned WCST performance. Performance of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and related brain-activation patterns reflect both task learning and execution. Normal subjects learned the WCST prior to performance during slow SPECT ligand infusion. Blood flow increased in bilateral inferior frontal, right middle and inferior parietal cortices. Activity decreased in hippocampi, temporal cortex, anterior cingulate and caudate.
