Nuclear medicine in primary bone tumors. Conventional radiography is the method of choice to diagnose a primary bone tumor but in many cases it is necessary to integrate it with nuclear medicine scintigraphy using several radionuclides, including 67Ga, 201Tl, 99mTc-MIBI and especially 99mTc-diphosphonates. Recently a new technique has been recently introduced, that is positron emission tomography with 2(18F) fluoro-2 deoxy-D-glucose as radiopharmaceutical.The specific purpose of this work is to show that nuclear medicine bone scanning is a very important method in the detection and diagnostic management of primary bone tumors. DIAGNOSIS, STAGING AND FOLLOW-UP: Three-phase bone scintigraphy, integrated with SPECT, is clinically useful to confirm the radiologic diagnosis of bone tumor. These techniques conveniently related to each other and to radiographic findings, can evaluate the tumor's local aggressiveness, often differentiating benign from malignant lesions, to monitor treatment efficacy, to permit total body scanning for the detection of recurrences. Nuclear medicine diagnostic techniques are not in competition with radiographic tools as CT and MRI which are highly sensitive in detecting even small lesions thanks to their excellent anatomical resolution. In questionable cases, we can integrate radiologic imaging with dynamic studies, in particular with FDG-PET, increasing the specificity of diagnosis and permitting more accurate follow-up.Patient management optimization needs the integration between dynamic nuclear medicine findings and the anatomical patterns provided by conventional radiology to increase imaging sensitivity and specificity. Equipe work is determinant to customize the diagnostic work-up to the individual patient's needs to reduce the cost of patient management avoiding useless examinations.
