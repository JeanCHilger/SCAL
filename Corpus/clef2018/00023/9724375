A comparative study of thallium-201 SPET, carbon-11 methionine PET and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET for the differentiation of astrocytic tumours. Thallium-201, carbon-11 methionine (MET) and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) have all been used to assess brain tumours. The aim of this study was to determine which of these tracers are of use for evaluating the histological grade and the extent of astrocytoma. 201Tl single-photon emission tomography (SPET), MET positron emission tomography (PET) and FDG PET were all performed in 23 patients (13 men, 10 women) with newly diagnosed astrocytic tumours [seven with astrocytoma (grade II), ten with anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III) and six with glioblastoma (grade IV)]. The 201Tl uptake of the tumours was evaluated by a lesion-to-normal region count ratio. Both MET and FDG uptake of the tumours was evaluated by a semiquantitative analysis using the standardized uptake value. 201Tl uptake was found to increase in rank order with histological grade and was significantly different among the three groups (grade II: 1.51+/-0.36 grade III: 2.58+/-1.50
