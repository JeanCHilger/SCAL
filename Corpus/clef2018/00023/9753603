On the relations among priming, conscious recollection, and intentional retrieval: evidence from neuroimaging research. Neurobiological distinctions among forms of memory have been investigated mainly from the perspective of lesion studies in nonhuman animals and experiments with human neurological patients. We consider recent neuroimaging studies of healthy human volunteers using positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that provide new information concerning the neural correlates of particular forms of memory retrieval. More specifically, we consider evidence indicating that priming, a form of implicit retrieval, is associated with decreased activity in various cortical regions. We also consider evidence suggesting that two components of explicit retrieval-intentional or effortful search and successful conscious recollection-are preferentially associated with increased activity in prefrontal and medial temporal regions, respectively.
