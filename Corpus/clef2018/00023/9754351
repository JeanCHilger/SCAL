-Bone tomoscintigraphy in osteoarticular pathology-. Bone single photon emission computed tomography is an effective method for demonstrating partial or total physeal arrest by the proportionality of osteoblastic activity in the physeal regions of interest. The technique complements computed tomography which is not precise in identifying progressive thinning of the physeal bar, and magnetic resonance imaging which does not demonstrate the progressive disappearance of the cartilaginous signal. The radionuclide examination may be a unique imaging method to differentiate between generaled delays in growth and complete fusion at the growth plate.
