Concurrent performance of two working memory tasks: potential mechanisms of interference. When two tasks are performed simultaneously, performance often deteriorates, with concomitant increases in reaction time and error rate. Three potential neurophysiological mechanisms behind this deterioration in performance have been considered here: (i) dual-task performance requires additional cognitive operations and activation of cortical areas in addition to those active during single-task performance (ii) two tasks interfere if they require activation of the same part of cortex
