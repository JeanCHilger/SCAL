Tracking and motion analysis of the left ventricle with deformable superquadrics. We present a new approach to analyse the deformation of the left ventricle of the heart based on a parametric model that gives a compact representation of a set of points in a 3-D image. We present a strategy for tracking surfaces in a sequence of 3-D cardiac images. Following tracking, we then infer quantitative parameters which characterize: left ventricle motion, volume of left ventricle, ejection fraction, amplitude and twist component of cardiac motion. We explain the computation of these parameters using our model. Experimental results are shown in time sequences of two modalities of medical images, nuclear medicine and X-ray computed tomography (CT). Video sequences presenting these results are on the CD-ROM.
