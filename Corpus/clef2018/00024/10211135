Cognitive deficit in schizophrenia and its neurochemical basis. Cognitive impairment is a central feature of schizophrenia and has been correlated with negative symptoms and impaired social functioning. There is a growing body of data suggesting that the so-called atypical antipsychotic drugs (e.g. clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine) are better at enhancing cognitive function than traditional neuroleptics. Preclinical studies of information processing using a pre-pulse inhibition model show that the mechanism of action of both olanzapine and clozapine for cognitive enhancement may involve glutamatergic/N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism. Using positron emission tomography, we have described the metabolic and neurochemical correlates of cognitive impairment induced by glutamatergic/NMDA antagonism. A better understanding of the underlying causes of cognitive impairment may contribute to elucidating the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the development of more efficacious treatments for this disorder.
