Immediate thallium re-injection after stress imaging for the detection of myocardial viability. Myocardial perfusion imaging with thallium is an established method to assess the presence of ischaemic and viable myocardium. Using planar imaging, images acquired 1 h after immediate thallium re-injection have been shown to be comparable to those of 3 h redistribution. The aim of this study was to clarify this using SPET. Twenty patients with chronic coronary artery disease with at least two perfusion defects on post-exercise images participated in this study. All patients received thallium re-injection after post-stress SPET and all had 1 h, 3 h and 24 h redistribution imaging. The thallium myocardial tomograms were divided into 14 segments for each patient. A total of 78 segments were studied. When the frequency of reversibility on 1 h, 3 h and 24 h redistribution images is compared, of the 78 SPET defects 18 (23.1%) showed reversibility by 1 h, 34 (43.6%) by combined 1 h and 3 h imaging (P < 0.05) and 50 (64.1%) by combined 1 h, 3 h and 24 h imaging (P < 0.05). Our results show that, compared to 3 h images, images acquired 1 h after immediate thallium re-injection underestimate the extent of viable myocardial segments and the incidence of late reversibility was not reduced by the immediate re-injection of thallium.
