Radiosynthesis of 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine: [(18)F]FLT for imaging of cellular proliferation in vivo. A reliable radiosynthesis of 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT) has been developed based on [(18)10 mCi (370 MBq) of radiochemically pure [(18)1 Ci/micromol (37 GBq/micromol) at EOS within 100 min and in 13% radiochemical yield (end of bombardment (EOB) 7% end of synthesis (EOS)). [(18)F]FLT has been designed as a new positron emission tomography imaging agent for visualizing cellular proliferation in vivo based on the metabolism of thymidine.
