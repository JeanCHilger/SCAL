Biologically stable [(18)F]-labeled benzylfluoride derivatives. Use of the [(18)F]-fluoromethyl phenyl group is an attractive alternative to direct fluorination of phenyl groups because the fluorination of the methyl group takes place under milder reaction conditions. However, we have found that 4-FMeBWAY showed femur uptake equal to that of fluoride up to 30 min in rat whereas 4-FMeQNB had a significantly lower percent injected dose per gram in femur up to 120 min. For these and other benzylfluoride derivatives, there was no clear in vivo structure-defluorination relationship. Because benzylchlorides (BzCls) are known alkylating agents, benzylfluorides may be alkylating agents as well, which may be the mechanism of defluorination. On this basis, the effects of substitution on chemical stability were evaluated by the 4-(4-nitro-benzyl)-pyridine (NBP) test, which is used to estimate alkylating activity with NBP. The effect of substitution on the alkylating activity was evaluated for nine BzCl derivatives: BzCl 3- or 4-methoxy (electron donation) substituted BzCl
