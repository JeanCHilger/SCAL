A possible role of the human cerebellum in conditioning of the jaw-opening reflex. The role of the human cerebellum in classical conditioning of the jaw-opening reflex was investigated using positron emission tomography (PET) in healthy subjects. The jaw-opening reflex was elicited by electrical stimulation of the right corner of the mouth (unconditioned stimulus, US). The conditioned stimulus was a tone preceding the US and coterminating with the US. Changes of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were correlated with the rate of conditioning per PET scan. Conditioning effects were present in one third of all subjects. In these subjects, a significant increase of rCBF in the ipsilateral, intermediate cerebellum was shown during ongoing conditioning. Thus, the intermediate cerebellum appears to be involved in classical conditioning of the jaw-opening reflex in humans.
