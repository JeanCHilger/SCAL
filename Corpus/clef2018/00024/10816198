Natural changes in peritoneal equilibration test results in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients: a retrospective, seven year cohort survey. We conducted a retrospective, 7 year cohort survey to examine the natural changes in peritoneal equilibration test (PET) results in patients with long-term uneventful continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Thirty-two (17 males, 15 females) patients on CAPD with two or more standard PETs performed more than 6 months apart, in the absence of peritoneal insult, were included. Changes and pattern of PET results were evaluated by the dialysate to plasma ratio of creatinine (D:P-cre), the fourth h dialysate to instilled glucose ratio (D4:Do) and ultrafiltration volume (UF, ml). The subgroups included high (H), high-average (HA), low-average (LA), or low (L) transporters with the dividing ratios (D:P-cre) of >0.81, >0. 65 to 0.81, >0.5 to 0.65, and <0.5, respectively. The median D:P-cre significantly decreased (p = 0.04), but neither the D4:Do nor the final median UF significantly decreased. The change in D:P-cre was strongly and inversely correlated with the initial D:P-cre value (r = -0.68 p < 0.05). A similar relationship was found between the change in the final D4:Do and the initial D4:Do (r = -0.752
