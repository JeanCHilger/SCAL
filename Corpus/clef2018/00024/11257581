In vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in drug development using positron-emission tomography. Positron-emission tomography (PET) is a sensitive technique that can be used to measure drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics non-invasively in target tissues of patients. Here we focus on the application of this technology to address some of the bottlenecks in drug development, including: elucidation of pathophysiology, evaluation of pharmacokinetics, proof of principle of mechanism, and assessment of efficacy and/or response to therapy.
