Review of the next generation of Alzheimer's disease therapeutics: challenges for drug development. 1. AD is believed to stem from dysfunctional cholinergic signaling in the regions of the brain associated with memory and cognition. 2. The occurrence of AD in afflicted individuals correlates with an increase in the accumulation of A beta-rich senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. 3. Currently, the only FDA-approved AD therapies are a group of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors which slow the turnover of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the synapse. 4. Many other compounds which target other aspects of the disease, such as reducing neuronal damage and limiting oxidation, are in clinical trials. These include monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) inhibitors, NSAIDs, antioxidants and estrogen, among others. 5. Recent research discoveries have more completely defined the molecular nature of AD, and are generating new approaches for treatment. One idea is to limit the ability of the protein tau to become phosphorylated in hopes that this will limit the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. 6. A separate approach that is being pursued is to prevent formation and accumulation of A beta plaques. This may be accomplished by either regulating gamma-secretase activity, or using anti-beta-amyloid antibodies to reduce the size of existing plaques. 7. Employing improved procedural and technological approaches during clinical trials, such as bridging studies, dynabridge studies and PET analysis, promises to streamline the drug development process. 8. The use of biomarkers and MRI analysis may be an effective means by which to identify the disease early. Consequently, early intervention treatment therapies may be an effective way of delaying onset of the disease. 9. Long term AD studies, particularly those focusing on the MCI population, are likely to provide statistically valid results using a smaller study population.
