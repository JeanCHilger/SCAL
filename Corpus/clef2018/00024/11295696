Reproducibility of Tl-201 and Tc-99m sestamibi gated myocardial perfusion SPECT measurement of myocardial function. We compared the reproducibility of thallium 201 and technetium 99m sestamibi (MIBI) gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) measurement of myocardial function using the Germano algorithm (J Nucl Med 199536:2138-47).Gated SPECT acquisition was repeated in the same position in 30 patients who received Tl-201 and in 26 who received Tc-99m-MIBI. The quantification of end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and ejection fraction (EF) on Tl-201 and Tc-99m-MIBI gated SPECT was processed independently with Cedars-Sinai QGS (Quantitative Gated SPECT) software. The reproducibility of the measurement of ventricular function on Tl-201 gated SPECT was compared with that of Tc-99m-MIBI gated SPECT. Correlation between the 2 measurements for volumes and EF was excellent for the repeated gated SPECT studies of Tl-201 (r = 0.928 to 0.986, P <.05) and Tc-99m-MIBI (r = 0.979 to 0.997, P <.05). However, Bland-Altman analysis revealed the 95% limits of agreement (2 SDs) for volumes and EF were narrower by repeated Tc-99m-MIBI gated SPECT (EDV 14.1 mL, ESV 9.4 mL, EF 5.5%) than by repeated Tl-201 gated SPECT (EDV 24.1 mL, ESV 18.6 mL, EF 10.3%). The root-mean-square values of the coefficient of variation for volumes and EF were smaller by repeated Tc-99m-MIBI gated SPECT (EDV 2.1 mL, ESV 2.7 mL, EF 2.3%) than by repeated Tl-201 gated SPECT (EDV 3.2 mL, ESV 3.5 mL, EF 5.2%).QGS provides an excellent correlation between repeated gated SPECT with Tl-201 and Tc-99m-MIBI. However, Tc-99m-MIBI provides more reproducible volumes and EF than Tl-201. Tc-99m-MIBI gated SPECT is the preferable method for the clinical monitoring of ventricular function.
