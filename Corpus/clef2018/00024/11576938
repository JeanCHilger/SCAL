Depressed cerebral oxygen metabolism in patients with chronic renal failure: a positron emission tomography study. To elucidate brain oxygen metabolism in uremic patients, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), oxygen extraction (rOEF), and oxygen metabolism (rCMRO(2)) were measured by positron emission tomography (PET) in 10 hemodialysis (HD) patients and 13 predialysis patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). Data were compared with 20 nonuremic patients (controls) without neurological abnormalities, congestive heart failure, history of cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, or symptomatic brain lesion on magnetic resonance imaging. In the hemisphere, rCMRO(2) in both HD (1.82 +/- 0.10 mL/min/100 g) and CRF patients (1.95 +/- 0.09 mL/min/100 g) showed significantly lower values compared with controls (2.23 +/- 0.05 mL/min/100 g P < 0.01). Hemispheric rCBF in HD (35.6 +/- 2.1 mL/100 g/min) and CRF patients (36.1 +/- 2.1 mL/100 g/min) was not different from controls (31.8 +/- 1.4 mL/100 g/min). Hemispheric rOEF in CRF patients (45.7% +/- 1.6%) was significantly greater than that in controls (40.5% +/- 1.2%
