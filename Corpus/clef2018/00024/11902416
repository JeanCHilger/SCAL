A comparison of eight grades of fat as broiler feed ingredients. Seven samples of feed- or pet food-grade fats (feed- and pet food-grade poultry greases, restaurant grease, white grease, animal/vegetable oil blend, palm oil, yellow grease) and one food-grade edible fat (soybean oil) were evaluated for quality and fatty acid composition. Active oxygen method (AOM) stability at 20 h ranged from 2 to 370 meq/kg iodine value from 78 to 130 g/100 g
