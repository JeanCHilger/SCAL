Age differences in phosphodiesterase type-IV and its functional response to dopamine D1 receptor modulation in the living brain: a PET study in conscious monkeys. The present study demonstrated the age-related changes in the striatal dopamine D1 receptor binding and its related cAMP second-messenger system in the living brains of conscious young (6.4 +/- 1.8 years old) and aged (19.5 +/- 3.3 years old) monkeys (Macaca mulatta) using positron emission tomography (PET). For quantitative analysis of D1 receptors, [11C]SCH23390 was used and phosphodiesterase type-IV (PDE-IV) activity, as an index of cAMP system, was estimated by two scans with R- and S-[11C]rolipram. Significant age-related decreases in D1 receptor binding were observed in the striatum and frontal cortex. Analysis of uptake of R- and S-[11C]rolipram indicated age-related decreases in PDE-IV activity showing 22.0 and 25.2% decreases in the striatum and frontal cortex, respectively, while no significant changes were observed in the cerebellum. With systemic preadministration of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (0.2, 0.6, and 2 mg/kg), the PDE-IV activities in the striatum and frontal cortex were dose-dependently suppressed in both age groups. However, the degree of suppression by SCH23390 was more marked in young than in aged monkeys. These results demonstrate that the striatal cAMP second-messenger system activity as well as its functional response to dopamine D1 antagonist showed age-related impairment in the brain.
