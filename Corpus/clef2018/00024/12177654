Significance of ST-segment morphology noted on electrocardiography during the recovery phase after exercise in patients with ischemic heart disease as analyzed with simultaneous dual-isotope single photon emission tomography. The significance of differences in electrocardiographic morphology that occur during the recovery phase after exercise has not been clarified. We investigated the relationship between postexercise electrocardiographic morphology and the pattern of residual ischemia measured at that time.Exercise dual-isotope single photon emission computed tomography was performed on 171 consecutive patients with chest pain syndrome. After injection of technetium-99m tetrofosmin at peak exercise and thallium-201 at 3 minutes after exercise, dual-isotope single photon emission computed tomographic images were obtained simultaneously. After cross-talk compensation, the extent of ischemia and its localization were measured at both peak exercise and after exercise.When 64 patients with angiographically and scintigraphically proven ischemic heart disease were grouped by morphology of ST-segment depressions at 3 minutes after exercise, 38 patients with the downsloping type had ischemia localized mainly to the middle and basal levels as compared with the more rapid resolution of ischemia in 12 patients with horizontal type and 14 patients with no ischemic electrocardiographic response (apical level 18.4% [7/38], 8.3% [1/12], and 0% [0/14], P = not significant, middle level 47.4% [18/38], 16.7% [2/12], and 7.1% [1/14], P <.01, basal level 57.9% [22/38], 33.3% [4/12], and 14.3% [2/14], P <.02, respectively) independent of the extent or localization of any ischemia noted during exercise (all levels, P = not significant).Electrocardiographic morphology during the recovery phase of exercise reflects the extent and localization of residual ischemia at that time independent of ischemic changes noted during exercise.
