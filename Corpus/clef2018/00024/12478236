Risk assessment of patients with known or suspected CAD using stress myocardial perfusion SPECT. Part II: Determining cost-effective test strategies. In this era of cost containment, each step of a testing protocol must be evaluated carefully for appropriateness and prognostic value. Exercise stress single-photon emission CT (SPECT) is finding a niche in the examination of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. When preceded by careful patient screening, stress SPECT, alone or combined with other testing, may prove to be a tool that is both cost-effective and clinically effective.
