Correlates of response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy in Alzheimer's disease. Cholinesterase inhibitors improve cognition and behaviour in some patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies that have focused on methods to predict response to anticholinesterase therapy and markers for response are reviewed. Among the possible predictors of improvement in cognitive outcomes are apolipoprotein genotype, pretreatment postural blood pressure drop, quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) and disease progression rate. Of these, qEEG profile after a single dose of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor was consistently found to be a good predictor of cognitive response. Studies have assessed baseline behavioural profiles and baseline single-photon emission computed tomographic profiles as possible predictors of improvement of behavioural symptoms of AD, but these require further study. Possible markers of response during drug treatment include red blood cell cholinesterase inhibition, cerebrospinal fluid monoamine measurement, pupillary response and platelet amyloid precursor protein analyses. Although they, too, require further study, the analysis of platelet amyloid precursor protein may have value as a correlate of the putative disease-modifying effects of long-term treatment. Studying correlates of response may help to elucidate the mechanism of action of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
