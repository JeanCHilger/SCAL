Transendocardial, autologous bone marrow cell transplantation for severe, chronic ischemic heart failure. This study evaluated the hypothesis that transendocardial injections of autologous mononuclear bone marrow cells in patients with end-stage ischemic heart disease could safely promote neovascularization and improve perfusion and myocardial contractility.Twenty-one patients were enrolled in this prospective, nonrandomized, open-label study (first 14 patients, treatment last 7 patients, control). Baseline evaluations included complete clinical and laboratory evaluations, exercise stress (ramp treadmill), 2D Doppler echocardiogram, single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion scan, and 24-hour Holter monitoring. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were harvested, isolated, washed, and resuspended in saline for injection by NOGA catheter (15 injections of 0.2 cc). Electromechanical mapping was used to identify viable myocardium (unipolar voltage > or =6.9 mV) for treatment. Treated and control patients underwent 2-month noninvasive follow-up, and treated patients alone underwent a 4-month invasive follow-up according to standard protocols and with the same procedures used as at baseline. Patient population demographics and exercise test variables did not differ significantly between the treatment and control groupsThus, the present study demonstrates the relative safety of intramyocardial injections of bone marrow-derived stem cells in humans with severe heart failure and the potential for improving myocardial blood flow with associated enhancement of regional and global left ventricular function.
