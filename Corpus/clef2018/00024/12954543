18F]fluorodopa uptake in the upper brainstem measured with positron emission tomography correlates with decreased REM sleep duration in early Parkinson's diseas. Sleep disturbances are common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have shown alterations of polysomnographic sleep parameters in PD, such as overall diminution of slow-wave and REM sleep duration, absence of muscle atonia during REM and increased occurrence of periodic leg movements during sleep. The pathogenesis of sleep dysregulation in PD is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine relations of abnormal polysomnographic sleep parameters and the dopaminergic function of the striatum and the upper brainstem measured with the use of positron emission and magnetic resonance tomography in 10 early-stage PD patients with a history of sleep disturbances. Our data demonstrated a significant inverse correlation of absolute and percentage REM sleep duration with the mesopontine [18F]6-fluorodopa (FDOPA) uptake in PD patients. Therefore, the results point to a REM inhibiting effect of increased monaminergic transmission within the upper brainstem in early-stage PD. This finding emphasises the pathophysiological significance of a disturbed neurotransmitter equilibrium in the rostral brainstem for REM sleep alterations in PD.
