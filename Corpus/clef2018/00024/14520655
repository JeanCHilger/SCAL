Subthalamic nucleus stimulation affects a frontotemporal network: a PET study. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has become an effective strategy in the treatment of motor symptoms in advanced Parkinson's disease. However, clinical studies have shown that DBS can affect verbal fluency. Seven Parkinson's disease patients with bilateral DBS of the STN were studied with positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the effects of STN stimulation on regional cerebral blood flow during a verbal fluency task. Activation of the right orbitofrontal cortex and verbal fluency-associated activation within a left-sided frontotemporal network were decreased during STN stimulation compared with the OFF state. Our results offer an explanation for the commonest neuropsychological side effect of STN stimulation and show that STN stimulation affects a frontotemporal network during a fluency task.
