Synthesis of the 7alpha-cyano-(17alpha,20E/Z)-[125I]iodovinyl-19-nortestosterones: potential radioligands for androgen and progesterone receptors. We report the preparation of the 7alpha-cyano derivative of the isomeric (17alpha,20E/Z)-[125I]iodovinyl-19-nortestosterones (IVNT) together with their binding affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) and their biodistribution in two different animal models. The cyano group was introduced at the 7alpha-position by hydrocyanation of 4,6-estradien-17beta-ol-3-one with diethylaluminum cyanide. Selective protection of the A-ring enone system as the dienol ether followed by ethynylation and deprotection under base and acid hydrolysis condition gave 7alpha-cyano-17alpha-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone. The stannyl derivatives were prepared by addition of tri-n-butylstannyl hydride and converted stereospecifically to the corresponding [125I]iodovinyl analog using [125I]NaI and H2O2. The [125I]iodovinylsteroids were intravenously administered to male rats and estrogen-primed immature female rats and tissue uptake was measured up to 6h post-injection. Co-administration of NLP-004 or ORG-2058, highly selective ligands for the progesterone receptor, to the female rats did not affect uterus uptake of the 125I-ligands. However co-injection of testosterone to DES-primed male rats induced a marked increase in prostate uptake of the 20Z-isomer of 7alpha-cyano-[125I]-IVNT. The relative binding affinity (RBA) of either 7alpha-cyano-(17alpha,20E/Z)-IVNT isomer for the AR is low (RBA=4 and 3, respectively, versus 100 for 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)), suggesting the absence of a possible role of the AR in the localization process. These findings contrast previously reported data for the analogous 7alpha-methyl-[125I]-IVNT where co-administration of testosterone was shown to result in a 50% drop in prostate uptake. These data indicate that the addition of an electron withdrawing 7alpha-cyano group to 123I-labeled nortestosterone derivatives does not improve their potential to serve as SPECT agents for the imaging of AR densities in the prostate.
