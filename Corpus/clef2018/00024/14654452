Monitoring and the controlled processing of meaning: distinct prefrontal systems. Distinct prefrontal regions are specialized for the controlled processing of semantic information. We have dissociated components of this system used in semantic decision-making across different perceptual conditions. Nineteen subjects were presented with auditory word sequences, on which they made semantic or syllabic decisions, while neural activity was measured using PET. Contrasting the semantic with syllabic tasks, there was activation within left rostral prefrontal cortex (RPFC) when the stimuli were presented as clear speech, reducing when the stimuli were presented in acoustically degraded form. In contrast, activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was observed with the degraded stimuli, an effect that inversely correlated with accuracy on the task. We have thus demonstrated two prefrontal systems where activity is differentially modulated by the "quality" of information held in working memory. This dissociation is likely to represent an alteration in the type of cognitive operations employed during task performance, where left RPFC is activated during extensive semantic elaboration and right DLPFC is recruited as the monitoring demands, associated with items held in working memory, increase. The function of these separate systems is integrated during the performance of verbal problem-solving tasks although they are differentially sensitive to stimulus degradation.
