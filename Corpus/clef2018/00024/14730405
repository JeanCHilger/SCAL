Database of normal human cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, cerebral oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen measured by positron emission tomography with 15O-labelled carbon dioxide or water, carbon monoxide and oxygen: a multicentre study in Japan. Measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) by positron emission tomography (PET) with oxygen-15 labelled carbon dioxide (C(15)O(2)) or (15)O-labelled water (H(2)(15)O), (15)O-labelled carbon monoxide (C(15)O) and (15)O-labelled oxygen ((15)O(2)) is useful for diagnosis and treatment planning in cases of cerebrovascular disease. The measured values theoretically depend on various factors, which may differ between PET centres. This study explored the applicability of a database of (15)O-PET by examining between-centre and within-centre variation in values. Eleven PET centres participated in this multicentre study seven used the steady-state inhalation method, one used build-up inhalation and three used bolus administration of C(15)O(2) (or H(2)(15)O) and (15)O(2). All used C(15)O for measurement of CBV. Subjects comprised 70 healthy volunteers (43 men and 27 women
