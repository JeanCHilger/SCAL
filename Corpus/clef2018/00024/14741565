18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose transport kinetics as a function of extracellular glucose concentration in malignant glioma, fibroblast and macrophage cells in vitr. FDG-PET is used to measure the metabolic rate of glucose. Transport and phosphorylation determine the amount of hexose analog that is phosphorylated and trapped. Competition occurs for both events, such that extracellular glucose concentration affects the FDG image. This study investigated the effect of glucose concentration on the rate of FDG accumulation in three cell lines. The results show that extracellular glucose concentration has a greater impact on the rate of FDG accumulation than the relative abundance of GLUT transporter subtypes.
