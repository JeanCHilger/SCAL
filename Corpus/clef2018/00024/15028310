FDG-PET for the pre-operative evaluation of colorectal liver metastases. This study assesses the accuracy of routine whole body fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in the pre-operative staging of patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM).A prospective study of patients referred for hepatic resection was undertaken. Patients were staged by spiral CT and FDG-PET. The results of these investigations were considered independently.Twenty-eight patients had confirmed CLM. Eleven patients had solitary CLM 10 of whom were correctly identified by both modalities. In the remaining 17 patients, 10 had multiple CLM and seven had extrahepatic disease. FDG-PET detected all lesions (sensitivity 100%, specificity 91%). CT incorrectly diagnosed solitary CLM in five patients and failed to detect extrahepatic disease in four patients (sensitivity 47%, specificity 91%). FDG-PET resulted in altered management for 12 patients of whom seven avoided inappropriate surgery.FDG-PET is more sensitive and specific for pre-operative staging of CLM. FDG-PET confers clinical benefit through altered patient management.
