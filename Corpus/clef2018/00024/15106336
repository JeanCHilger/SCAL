Three dimensional MRI. Three-dimensional(3D) MRI is discussed in the present and future clinical application. The newly reconstructed 3D MRI have been widely utilized as a routine examination, and 3D MRA have been substituted for cerebral angiograms in some diseases. The parallel image with multiple phased-array coils can improve time resolution and reduce MRI artifacts. Fusion of 3D anatomical MRI with CT, various functional MRI, SPECT, and PET results in precise diagnosis and improves the accuracy in navigational neurosurgery and stereotactic radiosurgery. High-field 3-tesla MRI can be clinically used, but its role on 3D MRI is not clear. As the data of 3D MRI and multi detector-row CT increases, it becomes the major problem how to restore and protect these data.
