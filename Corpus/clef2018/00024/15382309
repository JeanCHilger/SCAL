Imaging for esophageal tumors. Carcinoma of the esophagus must be staged accurately before a treatment plan is initiated, and imaging studies play a major role in this process. Imaging for esophageal carcinoma involves evaluation of the locoregional extent of the tumor and distant metastatic disease. A CT scan of the chest and upper abdomen provides the most comprehensive information about esophageal carcinoma however, accurate assessment of the depth of primary tumor invasion and lymph node status remains limited, even with newer generation scanners. Endoscopic US is a user-dependent modality that has emerged as a highly accurate technique in experienced hands to evaluate the depth of penetration of esophageal tumors, but its ability to detect metastatic lymph nodes is less impressive, leading some investigators to perform confirmatory needle aspiration of suspicious nodes. FDG-PET is a physiologic examination that is the subject of intense investigation in patients who have esophageal carcinoma. Preliminary studies have suggested that FDG-PET can detect otherwise radiographically occult distant metastatic disease in these patients, and changes in FDG uptake might correlate with the response to therapy. These findings need to be confirmed in larger studies. More sophisticated technology continues to be developed for imaging carcinoma of the esophagus, which will more than likely affect staging algorithms in the future.
