Mapping brain structure and personality in late adulthood. Cerebral gray matter (GM) volume decreases in normal aging with a parallel increase in intracranial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume. There is considerable interindividual variation in these changes, and the consequences of age-related GM shrinkage and CSF expansion are unclear. The present study examined whether late adulthood brain structural differences are related to differences in temperament and character. Personality structures of 42 healthy aged adults (mean age 60 years) were examined together with global and regional GM, CSF, and white matter (WM) volumes calculated from structural magnetic resonance images using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). A positive relationship was seen between GM volume at the border of the temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices, and self-transcendence, a character personality trait that reflects mature creativity and spiritualism. The relationship remained significant after a conservative correction for multiple comparisons and it was seen both using uncorrected raw values and after a correction for the effects of age and sex. The results suggest that high self-transcendence, which has adaptive advantages in the later part of life, is associated with relatively greater temporal cortical GM volumes.
