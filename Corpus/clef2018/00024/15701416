Simple devices for dispensing [18F]FDG. High dose [18F]FDG is prepared routinely using an automated synthesizer. Accordingly, an automated dispenser is needed to dispense [18F]FDG at the desired dose while reducing the operator's radiation exposure, and no dispenser capable of vial-to-vial and vial-to-syringe dispensing in one system is commercially available. Here, we describe simple devices for the vial-to-vial and vial-to-syringe dispensing of [18F]FDG.
