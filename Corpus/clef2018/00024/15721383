Liposome-mediated suicide gene therapy in humans. The LIPO-HSV-1-tk gene transfer system was developed for a 3-day pump application in a first prospective Phase I?II clinical study. Eight patients suffering from recurrent glioblastoma multiforme were treated intratumorally on the basis of convection-enhanced delivery using the nonviral vector system. It was possible to identify the target tissue together with assessment of vector distribution and gene product expression, as well as the metabolic effect of ganciclovir treatment, noninvasively, by the combination of magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography as a multimodal molecular imaging system. The therapy was well tolerated without major side effects. In two of eight patients, we observed a greater than 50% reduction of tumor volume and in six of eight patients focal treatment effects. The noninvasive visualization of therapeutic effects on tumor metabolism and documentation of gene expression will be important for the further successful development and implementation of patient individual gene therapy.
