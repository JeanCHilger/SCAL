The relationship between myocardial blood flow and glucose uptake in ischemic canine myocardium determined with fluorine-18-deoxyglucose. The relationship between myocardial blood flow as a marker of severity of ischemia and exogenous glucose utilization was examined following occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in 10 fasted, anesthetized, open-chest dogs. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was injected 10 min after the onset of ischemia and serial blood samples were obtained to measure FDG in plasma. Tracer-labeled microspheres, used to measure myocardial blood flow (MBF), were injected 10 and 40 min postocclusion. After the last microsphere injection, the heart was arrested and removed rapidly. Tissue samples of the left ventricle were obtained, weighed and FDG counts were determined. Two days later, the same samples were assayed for radioactivity from the tracer-labeled microspheres and blood flow was calculated. Thus, FDG uptake and MBF measurements were made in the same tissue samples. When normalized for variations in blood flow, there were no significant differences in FDG uptake between the subendocardial and subepicardial halves of the tissue samples. FDG uptake was relatively high and uniform in normal myocardium, paralleling the pattern of MBF. In ischemic myocardium, however, FDG uptake and MBF did not vary in parallel. In tissue samples with MBF reduced by up to 80% from control levels, relative FDG uptake increased such that absolute FDG uptake remained at normal or near normal levels. In samples with more severe ischemia, FDG uptake decreased precipitously with additional decrements in MBF. We propose that sufficient glycolytic flux may be sustained to maintain cellular viability when perfusion is above the threshold value. Below the threshold, however, irreversible changes may be initiated.
