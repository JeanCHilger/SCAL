Establishment and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against an octahedral gallium chelate suitable for immunoscintigraphy with PET. As a prerequisite for preparing bispecific antibody conjugates containing anti-tumor and anti-metal chelate binding sites that can be used for pretargeted immunoscintigraphy, monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) have been raised against an octahedral metal chelate synthetized from gallium (Ga) and the hexadentate ligand N,N'bis[2-hydroxy 5-(ethylene beta carboxy) benzyl] ethylenediamine N,N' diacetic acid (Ga-HBED-CC). With use of the Farr assay, binding studies with the 67Ga-labeled chelate and three clones of anti-chelate Mabs showed that none of the Mabs were able to precipitate more than 50% of the Ga-chelate, suggesting an enatiomerism of the Ga-chelate and a sensitivity of the Mabs to either one or the other chelate enantiomer. This could be confirmed by comparing the circular dichroism spectra of the Ga-chelate fractions that passed affinity columns containing the Mabs immobilized on sepharose without retention. With use of a Ga-HBED-CC enantiomer, whole-body retention in mice, preinjected with the corresponding anti-metal chelate Mab of ca. 70% ID, was measured compared to 2.1% retention in mice not preinjected with the Mab. Due to the high affinity of chelate-to-Mab binding in vivo, bispecific antibody conjugates prepared from the fragments of the anti-Ga-chelate Mab might be suitable for pretargeted immunoscintigraphy with the short-lived positron-emitter 68Ga.
