Functional brain imaging of symptoms and cognition in schizophrenia. The advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography has provided novel insights into the neural correlates of cognitive function and psychopathological symptoms. In patients with mental disorders, cognitive and emotional processes are disrupted. In this chapter, we review the basic methodological and conceptual principles for neuroimaging studies in these patients. By taking schizophrenia as an example, we outline the cerebral processes involved in the symptoms of this disorder, such as auditory hallucinations and formal thought disorder. We also characterize the neural networks involved in their emotional and cognitive dysfunction.
