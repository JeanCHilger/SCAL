The role of SPECT/CT with 99mTc-MDP image fusion to diagnose temporomandibular dysfunction. The objective of this study was the evaluation of Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography with Technetium 99m Methylene Diphosphonate (SPECT with 99mTc-MDP) and computed tomography (CT), simultaneously acquired image in diagnosis of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction.A prospective study was conducted with 33 patients, 29 female and 4 male, all of then presenting signs and/or complaints suggestive of temporomandibular dysfunction. SPECT/CT with 99mTc-MDP was performed in all patients and imaging results compared with final diagnosis and clinical outcome.The correlation of signs and symptoms with SPECT/CT imaging showed sensitivity 100%, specificity 90.91%, and accuracy 96.97%.SPECT/CT with 99mTc-MDP coregistered imaging fusion is a suitable method of temporomandibular dysfunction diagnosis, due to the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy observed.
