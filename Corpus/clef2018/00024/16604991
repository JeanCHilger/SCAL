Current imaging of solid renal masses. More than 40% of solid renal masses are incidentally discovered by ultrasound examinations. Computed tomography (CT) remains the cornerstone investigation for characterization and assessment of the extent of renal tumors, it is complementary to ultrasound. MR imaging is an adjunctive method reserved as a problem-solving technique for indeterminate masses by ultrasound and CT. PET-CT has a great potential role in the staging of renal cancer.
