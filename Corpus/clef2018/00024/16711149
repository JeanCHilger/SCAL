Diagnosis and follow-up of vasculitis: usefulness of imaging. Vasculitides are due to inflammation of the vessel wall. There is a definite advantage in visualizing the inflammatory process within blood vessels without resorting to invasive procedures. A variety of non-invasive imaging techniques is now becoming available to investigate patients with vasculitis. These include ultrasonography, MRI coupled to angiographic sequences, PET, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Their role is being evaluated and their characteristics exploited to address issues specific to each vasculitis. Thus, cardiac IRM should be considered in patients with ANCA-negative Churg-Strauss syndrome. Moreover, PET could be useful from investigate a subgroup of patients suffering from giant-cell arteritis. However, to validate these techniques, prospective studies in large cohorts of patients are needed.
