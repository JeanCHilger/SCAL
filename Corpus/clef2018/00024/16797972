Clinical molecular imaging with positron emission tomography. Molecular imaging allows for the in vivo evaluation of targeted molecules and biological processes in man. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a highly sensitive and quantitative molecular imaging modality, whose utility in clinical and experimental medicine is increasing by the day. In this article, the principles of PET and its currently accepted applications in oncology, such as cancer staging, treatment response assessment and as a prognostic marker are reviewed. Further, the evolving role of PET in areas of oncology such as radiotherapy treatment planning, anti-cancer drug development and the evaluation of patho-physiological processes which drive a cell into neoplastic activity is discussed.
