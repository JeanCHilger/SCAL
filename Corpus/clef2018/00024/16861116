New clinical imaging modalities in prostate cancer. In all prostate cancer disease states, exciting novel imaging technology is being tested that may affect the future care of our patients. New US, MRI, and nuclear medicine techniques are improving both the ability to stage patients and to follow treatment-related changes. See Table 3 for a summary of these novel imaging techniques. Important issues still need to be resolved, including standardizing patient populations within trials, demonstrating the reproducibility of these techniques between different centers, and understanding how information gained from these techniques should influence patient care. We eagerly await answers to these questions.
