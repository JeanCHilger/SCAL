Assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction using long-axis systolic function is independent of image quality: a study of tissue Doppler imaging and m-mode echocardiography. Quantitative assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is technically difficult in patients with poor image quality (IQ). Mitral annulus velocity assessed by pulsed tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and mitral annulus motion assessed by M-mode echocardiography has been shown to correlate with LVEF. Furthermore, mitral annulus sites are easy to identify even in patients with poor IQ. The purpose of this study was to determine whether these methods are useful for estimating LVEF in patients with poor IQ.One hundred ten patients underwent TDI and M-mode echocardiography simultaneously. Mitral annulus velocity and mitral annulus motion were obtained from each of the four mitral annulus sites. Mean mitral annular peak systolic velocities (Sm) and mean mitral annular motions (MAM) were calculated by averaging at each site. IQ was defined according to a previous report.Both Sm and MAM were successfully measured in all patients. Mean Sm and mean MAM correlated with LVEF. These correlations were observed not only in patients with good IQ (p < 0.001, r = 0.61 for mean Sm p < 0.001, r = 0.61 for mean MAM) or fair IQ (p < 0.001, r = 0.58 for mean SmAssessment of long-axis systolic function by TDI and M-mode echocardiography enables estimation of LVEF even in patients with poor IQ.
