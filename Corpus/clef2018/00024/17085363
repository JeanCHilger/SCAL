Neuroimaging in late-life depression. Late-life depression may be associated with vasculopathy. Neuroimaging has been a critical tool in exploring the relationship between this form of depression and vascular factors. Magnetic resonance imaging has been the most widely used tool, but there is potential to use other structural imaging techniques as well as functional neuroimaging methodologies. Neuroimaging may potentially be utilized at some point as a biomarker for late-life depression, thus helping with diagnosis and guiding treatment.
