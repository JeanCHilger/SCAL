Transcranial Doppler estimation of cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular conductance during modified rebreathing. Clinical transcranial Doppler assessment of cerebral vasomotor reactivity (CVMR) uses linear regression of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) vs. end-tidal CO(2) (Pet(CO(2))) under steady-state conditions. However, the cerebral blood flow (CBF)-Pet(CO(2)) relationship is nonlinear, even for moderate changes in CO(2). Moreover, CBF is increased by increases in arterial blood pressure (ABP) during hypercapnia. We used a modified rebreathing protocol to estimate CVMR during transient breath-by-breath changes in CBFV and Pet(CO(2)). Ten healthy subjects (6 men) performed 15 s of hyperventilation followed by 5 min of rebreathing, with supplemental O(2) to maintain arterial oxygen saturation constant. To minimize effects of changes in ABP on CVMR estimation, cerebrovascular conductance index (CVCi) was calculated. CBFV-Pet(CO(2)) and CVCi-Pet(CO(2)) relationships were quantified by both linear and nonlinear logistic regression. In three subjects, muscle sympathetic nerve activity was recorded. From hyperventilation to rebreathing, robust changes occurred in Pet(CO(2)) (20-61 Torr), CBFV (-44 to +104% of baseline), CVCi (-39 to +64%), and ABP (-19 to +23%) (all P < 0.01). Muscle sympathetic nerve activity increased by 446% during hypercapnia. The linear regression slope of CVCi vs. Pet(CO(2)) was less steep than that of CBFV (3 vs. 5%/Torr P = 0.01). Logistic regression of CBF-Pet(CO(2)) (r(2) = 0.97) and CVCi-Pet(CO(2)) (r(2) = 0.93) was superior to linear regression (r(2) = 0.91, r(2) = 0.85
