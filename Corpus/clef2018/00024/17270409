Formulation and development of hydrodynamically balanced system for metformin: in vitro and in vivo evaluation. The objective of the present study was to develop a hydrodynamically balanced system of metformin as a single unit floating capsule. Various grades of low-density polymers were used for the formulation of this system. They were prepared by physical blending of metformin and the polymers in varying ratios. The formulation was optimized on the basis of in vitro buoyancy and in vitro release in simulated fed state gastric fluid (citrate phosphate buffer pH 3.0). Effect of various release modifiers was studied to ensure the delivery of drug from the HBS capsules over a prolonged period. Capsules prepared with HPMC K4M and ethyl cellulose gave the best in vitro percentage release and were taken as the optimized formulation. By fitting the data into zero order, first order and Higuchi model it was concluded that the release followed zero order release, as the correlation coefficient (R(2) value) was higher for zero order release. It was concluded from R(2) values for Higuchi model that drug release followed fickian diffusion mechanism. In vivo studies were carried out in rabbits to assess the buoyancy, as well as the pharmacokinetic parameters of the formulation using gamma scintigraphy. The formulation remained buoyant during 5h of study in rabbits. The comparative pharmacokinetic study was performed by administration of the optimized HBS capsules and immediate release capsules, both with radiolabeled metformin, using gamma counter. There was an increase in AUC in optimized HBS capsules of metformin when compared with immediate release formulation.
