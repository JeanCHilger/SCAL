Acute coronary syndromes involving the right side of the heart are associated with increased mortality, a complex clinical course, and lengthy hospitalization, as well as with frequent mechanical and electrical complications. It is important that the signs and symptoms associated with the spread of ischemic disease to the right heart chambers are recognized so that the patient can be given appropriate treatment, which can improve short-term and long-term prognosis. The purpose of this review was to summarize key aspects of the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of this condition.
