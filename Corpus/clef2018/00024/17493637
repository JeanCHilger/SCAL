Evaluation of brain perfusion SPECT using an easy Z-score imaging system (eZIS) as an adjunct to early-diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. The eZIS allows computer-assisted statistical analysis of brain perfusion SPECT images. We evaluated the diagnostic value of brain perfusion SPECT using eZIS in patients with various neurodegenerative diseases at a very early stage, within one year from onset.SPECT using eZIS was performed for patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD,), idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) and vascular Parkinsonism (VP), multiple systemic atrophy of the cerebellar type (MSA-C), cortical cerebellar atrophy (CCA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).Decreased rCBF was observed in the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus and parietal cortex in AD in the frontal gyrus and insula in FTDA specific rCBF pattern was observed for each disease using eZIS analysis, consistent with previous reports. Our results showed eZIS can be easily used as an adjunct to early-diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases in any hospital.
