Imaging in genitourinary cancer from the urologists' perspective. It is well established that advances in imaging may lead to early cancer detection, more accurate tumour staging and consequently adequate treatment, better monitoring of the disease and enhanced surveillance for recurrences after treatment. This manuscript reviews the current use of imaging in genitourinary cancer and explores the impact of imaging findings in clinical management. Additionally, an effort has been made to present the emerging imaging modalities and also their possible role in diagnosis and treatment of these cancers.
