Imaging studies in the diagnosis and management of vasculitis. The term vasculitis encompasses a number of distinct clinicopathologic disease entities. Final diagnosis should be supported by histologic study in most cases. However, different imaging modalities offer the potential for an early visualization of inflammatory vascular abnormalities, provide some diagnostic clues, and allow for an adequate assessment of therapeutic response. This review discusses recent advances in imaging techniques and refinements in vascular imaging methods, as well as a brief mention of research modalities that are increasingly used in studies of pathogenesis or in the assessment of disease progression.
