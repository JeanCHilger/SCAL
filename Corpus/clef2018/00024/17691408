The role of spinal cord stimulation in the management of patients with brain tumors. High grade gliomas (HGG) have decreased blood flow resulting in hypoxia, limited access by chemotherapeutic agents, and reduced radiation-sensitivity. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used successfully in the treatment of pain and ischemic syndromes. The present article summarizes our investigations into the effects of SCS in patients with HGG. Before their scheduled radio-chemotherapy, 23 patients with HGG were assessed pre- and post-SCS using several evaluation techniques: (1) transcranial Doppler (TCD) for middle cerebral artery blood flow (2) color Doppler for common carotid artery blood flow
