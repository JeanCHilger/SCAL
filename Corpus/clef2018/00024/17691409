Dorsal column stimulation for persistent vegetative state. Dorsal column stimulation (DCS) is described as a therapy for persistent deterioration of consciousness. The mechanism of its effect has not yet been elucidated. Various other methods, such as deep brain stimulation of the CM-p f complex, vagus nerve stimulation, and musical functional therapy, are being investigated as potential treatments of this problem. We present our series of DCS for persistent vegetative state and review the potential mechanisms of action and the relevant literature.
