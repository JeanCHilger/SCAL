The International Harmonization Project for response criteria in lymphoma clinical trials. Clinical trials are critical to the development of newer and more effective treatments. Standardized response criteria are essential to assess and compare the activity of various therapies within and among studies and to facilitate the evaluation of new treatments by regulatory agencies. The International Harmonization Project developed revised guidelines with the goal of improved comparability among studies, leading to accelerated new agent development resulting in the rapid availability of improved therapies for patients who have lymphoma. Modifications of these recommendations are expected as new information and improved technologies become available.
