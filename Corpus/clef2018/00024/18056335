L-type amino acid transporters LAT1 and LAT4 in cancer: uptake of 3-O-methyl-6-18F-fluoro-L-dopa in human adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. Expression of system L amino acid transporters (LAT) is strongly increased in many types of tumor cells. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that (18)F-labeled amino acids, for example, 3-O-methyl-6-(18)F-fluoro-L-dopa ((18)F-OMFD), that accumulate in tumors via LAT represent an important class of imaging agents for visualization of tumors in vivo by PET.(18)F-OMFD uptake kinetics, transport inhibition, and system L messenger RNA expression were studied in vitro in human adenocarcinoma (HT-29), squamous cell carcinoma (FaDu), macrophages (THP-1), and primary aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and in vivo in the corresponding mouse tumor xenograft models.Uptake of (18)F-OMFD in all cell lines tested was mediated mainly by the sodium-independent high-capacity LAT. We found higher uptake in FaDu cells (V(max), 10.6 +/- 1.1 nmol/min x mg of cell protein) and in the corresponding FaDu tumor xenografts than in the other cells and corresponding xenograft models studied. Quantitative messenger RNA analysis revealed that tumor cells and xenografts have a higher expression of LAT1 than do HAEC and THP-1 macrophages. However, only in the FaDu tumor model did an increased (18)F-OMFD uptake seem to be explained by increased LAT expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated a high expression of LAT4, a recently identified LAT.Our findings support the hypothesis that (18)F-OMFD is a tracer for visualization of tumor cells. (18)F-OMFD particularly seems to be a suitable tracer for diagnostic imaging of amino acid transport in poorly differentiated squamous cell head and neck carcinoma with increased LAT1 and LAT4 expression.
