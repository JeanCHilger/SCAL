Memory mechanisms in the processing of words and word-like symbols. Modern functional imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) provide the opportunity to examine in some detail the implementation of mental activities in the human brain. Using measurements of changes in local brain blood flow obtained with PET as a marker of changes in local neuronal activity we have examined the processing of single words and word-like symbols. These studies reveal the very distributed, modular nature of this implementation and provide some preliminary insights into the role of memory mechanisms in the process.
