Potential impact of noncontrast computed tomography as gatekeeper for myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography in patients admitted to the chest pain unit. We investigated the ability of coronary artery calcium (CAC) to predict a normal adenosine stress rubidium-82 (Rb-82) myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography (PET) in patients admitted to the chest pain unit. Eighty-four consecutive patients (33 men mean age 62 +/- 14.8 years) with low to intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease were included. A single noncontrast computed tomogram under shallow breathing was obtained for attenuation correction and to assess the presence of CAC. This was followed by a rest and adenosine stress dynamic Rb-82 emission PET. Computed tomography and PET images were interpreted independently. There was a high prevalence of risk factors (80% hypertension, 30% diabetes, 38% hypercholesterolemia, 13% smoking)
