Preoperative evaluation of pelvic masses with combined 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography. To prospectively evaluate the diagnostic value of combined 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose position emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) to discriminate malignant or borderline malignant tumors from benign pelvic masses.A prospective study of 30 women with suspected ovarian cancer who presented from July 2006 through August 2007. Selection was based on evidence from ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and rising tumor marker levels. All patients underwent FDG-PET/CT prior to standard debulking surgery for a pelvic mass.The sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET/CT to detect malignant or borderline malignant pelvic tumors were 71.4% and 81.3%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET/CT to detect ovarian cancer were 100% and 85.0%, respectively. The maximum standardized uptake value in borderline tumors was significantly lower compared with malignant tumors, but not significantly different compared with benign tumors.FDG-PET/CT had a high diagnostic value in differentiating between malignant and benign tumors, and a low diagnostic value in differentiating between borderline malignant and benign tumors.
