The thalamus and schizophrenia: current status of research. The thalamus provides a nodal link for multiple functional circuits that are impaired in schizophrenia (SZ). Despite inconsistencies in the literature, a meta analysis suggests that the volume of the thalamus relative to that of the brain is decreased in SZ. Morphometric neuroimaging studies employing deformation, voxel-based and region of interest methodologies suggest that the volume deficit preferentially affects the thalamic regions containing the anterior and mediodorsal nuclei, and the pulvinar. Postmortem design-based stereological studies have produced mixed results regarding volume and neuronal deficits in these nuclei. This review examines those aspects of thalamic circuitry and function that suggest salience to SZ. Evidence for anomalies of thalamic structure and function obtained from postmortem and neuroimaging studies is then examined and directions for further research proposed.
