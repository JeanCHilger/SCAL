Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of coronary artery disease: SPET and PET. In this article, the role of nuclear cardiology modalities in the diagnosis and follow-up of ischemic coronary artery disease in respect of myocardial perfusion and determination of left ventricular ejection fraction are reviewed. Single photon emission tomography (SPET) and positron emission tomography (PET) techniques are applied for imaging of myocardial perfusion and evaluation of global and regional wall motion and contractility. These techniques could be applied with physiological or pharmacological stress and show different properties when compared to other imaging modalities mostly depending on anatomical details. Diagnostic value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and incremental value of SPET or PET/CT (computerized tomography) hybrid imaging is considered. Nuclear cardiology techniques may provide useful prognostic information besides their diagnostic use.
