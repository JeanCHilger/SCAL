Small molecule receptors as imaging targets. The aberrant expression and function of certain receptors in tumours and other diseased tissues make them preferable targets for molecular imaging. PET and SPECT radionuclides can be used to label specific ligands with high affinity for the target receptors. The functional information obtained from imaging these receptors can be used to better understand the systems under investigation and for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. This review discusses some of the aspects of receptor imaging with small molecule tracers by PET and SPECT and reviews some of the tracers for the receptor imaging of tumours and brain, heart and lung disorders.
