Tumour length measured on PET-CT predicts the most appropriate stage-dependent therapeutic approach in oesophageal cancer. To compare the accuracy of determining the most appropriate treatment approach based on a visual analysis on combined PET-CT, based on a visual analysis on PET (reviewed side-by-side with CT) and based on tumour length measurements (on PET and PET-CT). Tumour length, SUV, and the length-SUV index (length x SUV) were assessed (on PET and PET-CT) in benign oesophageal lesions (reflux oesophagitis n = 29), in potentially curable stages of oesophageal cancer (Tis
