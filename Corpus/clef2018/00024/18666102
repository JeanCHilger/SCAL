Evaluation of MRI models in the measurement of CMRO2 and its relationship with CBF. The aim of this study was to investigate the various MRI biophysical models in the measurements of local cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) and the corresponding relationship with cerebral blood flow (CBF) during brain activation. This aim was addressed by simultaneously measuring the relative changes in CBF, cerebral blood volume (CBV), and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI signals in the human visual cortex during visual stimulation. A radial checkerboard delivered flash stimulation at five different frequencies. Two MRI models, the single-compartment model (SCM) and the multicompartment model (MCM), were used to determine the relative changes in CMRO(2) using three methods: [1] SCM with parameters identical to those used in a prior MRI study (M = 0.22 alpha = 0.38)
