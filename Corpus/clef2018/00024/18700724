Seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in a district of Assam, India. Toxoplasmosis is one of the important zoonoses of man and has been known to cause serious problems particularly in females. A study on seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis was undertaken amongst the human population in Assam to determine the level of exposure of the population to the infection by using commercial ELISA kits. Of the 241 sera belonging to different age groups, sex and religion and having varying levels of exposure to the animals examined, 23 (9.54%) were positive for toxoplasmosis. No significant difference in the prevalence amongst males and females was observed. Some occupational groups like veterinarians, pet keepers and farmers were found to infect more frequently. Although the overall prevalence rate of toxoplasmosis was relatively low, higher prevalence rate of toxoplasmosis amongst the exposed groups warrants due care by these groups when they are handling the animals.
