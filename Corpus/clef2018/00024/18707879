Synthesis and evaluation of indolinyl- and indolylphenylacetylenes as PET imaging agents for beta-amyloid plaques. Two new phenylacetylene derivatives, 5-((4-(2-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)phenyl)ethynyl)indoline 8 and 5-((4-(2-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)phenyl)ethynyl)-1H-indole 14, targeting beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques have been prepared. In vitro binding carried out in tissue homogenates prepared from postmortem AD brains with [(125)I]IMPY (6-iodo-2-(4'-dimethylamino-)phenyl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine) as the radioligand indicated good binding affinities (K(i)=4.0 and 1.5nM for 8 and 14, respectively). Brain penetration of the corresponding radiofluorinated ligands, evaluated in the normal mice, showed good initial brain penetration (4.50 and 2.43% ID/g (injected dose/gram) for [(18)F]8 and [(18)F]14 at 2min after injection) with moderate to low washout rates from the brain (1.71% ID/g at 2h and 2.10% ID/g at 3h, respectively). Autoradiography and homogenate binding studies demonstrated the high specific binding of [(18)F]14 to the Abeta plaques however, [(18)F]8 showed low specific binding. These preliminary results identified that indolylphenylacetylene, 14, may be a good lead for further structural modification to develop a useful Abeta plaque imaging agent.
