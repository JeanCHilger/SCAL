Changes in glucose metabolism due to aging and gender-related differences in the healthy human brain. Using [(18)F]fluoro-deoxy-glucose-PET, we studied relative metabolic changes due to age- and gender-related differences in the brain of 126 healthy subjects from their twenties to seventies. We used a data-extraction technique, the three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSP) method, to measure metabolic changes with fewer effects of regional anatomic variances. Simple regression analysis revealed significant age-related increases in relative metabolic values in the parahippocampal and amygdala regions in both sexes in their twenties to forties, and significant age-related decreases in both sexes in their fifties to seventies. Relative values in the frontal lobe showed significant age-related decreases in both sexes in their twenties to forties, but these effects were not seen in subjects in their fifties to seventies. Significant gender differences in correlation coefficients of relative values with age were shown in the parahippocampal, primary sensorimotor, temporal, thalamus and vermis regions in subjects in their 20s to 40s, but disappeared in subjects in their twenties to forties, but were not apparent in subjects in their fifties to seventies except in the vermis. Males in their twenties to sixties and females in their fifties showed significant laterality in relative values in the temporal lobes. Our study demonstrated age- and gender-related differences in glucose metabolism in healthy subjects.
