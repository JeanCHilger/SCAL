Early tumor drug pharmacokinetics is influenced by tumor perfusion but not plasma drug exposure. Pharmacokinetic parameters derived from plasma sampling are used as a surrogate of tumor pharmacokinetics. However, pharmacokinetics-modulating strategies do not always result in increased therapeutic efficacy. Nonsurrogacy of plasma kinetics may be due to tissue-specific factors such as tumor perfusion.To assess the impact of tumor perfusion and plasma drug exposure on tumor pharmacokinetics, positron emission tomography studies were done with oxygen-15 radiolabeled water in 12 patients, with 6 patients undergoing positron emission tomography studies with carbon-11 radiolabeled N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]acridine-4-carboxamide and the other 6 with fluorine-18 radiolabeled 5-fluorouracil.We found that tumor blood flow (mL blood/mL tissue/minute) was significantly correlated to early tumor radiotracer uptake between 4 and 6 minutes [standard uptake value (SUV)4-6 rho = 0.79Tumor perfusion is a key factor that influences tumor drug uptake/exposure. Tumor vasculature-targeting strategies may thus result in improved tumor drug exposure and therefore drug efficacy.
