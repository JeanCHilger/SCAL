Within-subject comparison of striatal D2 receptor occupancy measurements using [123I]IBZM SPECT and [11C]Raclopride PET. Antipsychotic-induced D2 receptor occupancy values tend to be lower when measured with [(123)I]IBZM SPECT than with [(11)C]Raclopride PET. To clarify this issue, D2 receptor occupancy was measured in the same subjects using both techniques. Twenty patients with schizophrenia on monotherapy with risperidone (n=7 3-9 mg/d), olanzapine (n=5
