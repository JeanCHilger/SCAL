A review of Doppler sonography for the assessment of tumour vascularity. During the past decade, the vascular biology of cancer has become a highly interesting research field. To assess tumour vascularity and perfusion, various strategies such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography have been investigated. Over the last years, important advances have taken place in the Doppler technology which dramatically improved its ability to evaluate the vascular system, even small and deep vessels. Doppler sonography provides a non-invasive means to assess the extent and morphology of tumour vascularity. This information is clinically important regarding diagnosis, prognosis and response to treatment, particularly in connection with the development of novel angiogenesis inhibitors. This article describes the different Doppler technologies most commonly used in human and experimental animal oncology. Based on in vivo tumour models and extensive clinical experience in humans, their significance and potential clinical applications are illustrated. First clinical reports in veterinary medicine are also reviewed.
