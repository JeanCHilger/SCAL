18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography and positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging of malignant pleural mesothelioma. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is the most common primary pleural tumor and its incidence is rising. Its diagnosis, staging and response assessment are challenging for imaging. Integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/CT increases the accuracy of overall staging in patients with mesothelioma and improves the selection of patients for curative surgical resection. It is particularly useful in identifying occult distant metastases. It may be used to predict prognosis and to assess the metabolic response to therapy.
