Normal thoracic and abdominal distribution of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG) in adult cats. Positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-deoxy-2-[18sF]fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG) is an important imaging modality for diagnosis and staging of human neoplastic disease. The purpose of this study is to describe the normal is 18FDG uptake in adult cats. Six adult healthy female cats were used. Cats were sedated and then injected intravenously with 74.0 +/- 13.0 (mean +/- SD) MBq of 18FDG. General anesthesia was induced and cats were placed in ventral recumbancy on the PET scanner's bed. Static images using multiple bed positions were acquired approximately 60-90 min after injection. A transmission scan was acquired at each bed position utilizing a 57Co point source to perform attenuation and scatter correction. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn over the liver, right and left renal cortices, left ventricular wall, and wall of ascending and descending colonic segments. Standardized uptake values (SUV) were calculated using an established formula. Kidneys and intestinal tract had relatively intense uptake of 18FDG liver activity was intermediate
