Evolving techniques to evaluate ejaculatory function. Recent findings in the physiology and neurobiology of ejaculation have expanded our understanding of male sexual function and have allowed the development of new instruments to investigate ejaculatory and orgasmic disorders.The evidence-based definition of lifelong premature ejaculation has set a model in the evaluation and treatment outcome of sexual dysfunction. New instruments to objectively assess arousal, orgasm and the expulsion phase of ejaculation such as functional MRI, dynamic pelvic ultrasound, PET scans and validated questionnaires have lead to a better understanding of sexual dysfunction in men. Animal models, developments in neurobiology and clinical experience have transformed a purely psychoanalytical approach to ejaculatory and orgasmic function into a novel multidisciplinary, scientifically sound and evidence-based discipline of medicine.Ejaculation is an integral part of normal sexual function. Ejaculatory dysfunction is common and may cause substantial disruption to the quality of a patient's life. A better understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, neuroscience and genetics of ejaculatory and orgasmic function will eventually lead to the development of new, effective methods of treatment of disorders of ejaculation and orgasm in men.
