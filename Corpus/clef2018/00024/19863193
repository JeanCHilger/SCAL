Radiolabeling of lipid-based nanoparticles for diagnostics and therapeutic applications: a comparison using different radiometals. Radiolabeling of nanoparticles (NPs) has been performed for a variety of reasons, such as for studying pharmacokinetics, for imaging, or for therapy. Here, we describe the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of DTPA-derivatized lipid-based NP (DTPA-NP) radiolabeled with different radiometals, including (111)In and (99m)Tc, for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), (68)Ga for positron emission tomography (PET), and (177)Lu for therapeutic applications. PEGylated DTPA-NP with varying DTPA amounts, different composition, and size were radiolabeled with (111)In, (177)Lu, and (68)Ga, using various buffers. (99m)Tc-labeling was performed directly and by using the carbonyl aquaion, [(99m)Tc(H(2)O)(3)(CO)(3)](+). Stability was tested and biodistribution evaluated. High labeling yields (>90%) were achieved for all radionuclides and different liposomal formulations. Specific activities (SAs) were highest for (111)In (>4 MBq/mug liposome), followed by (68)Ga and (177)Lu for (99m)Tc, high labeling yields and SA were only achieved by using [(99m)Tc(H(2)O)(3)(CO)(3)](+). Stability toward DTPA/histidine and in serum was high (>80 % RCP, 24 hours postpreparation).). Biodistribution in Lewis rats revealed no significant differences between NP in terms of DTPA loading and particle composition
