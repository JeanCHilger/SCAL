Regional cerebral blood flow in patients with alcohol-related dementia: a SPECT study. The purpose of this study was to investigate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes using 1110 MBq of Tc-99m ECD SPECT in alcohol-related dementia (ARD) patients. Twenty-five patients with ARD and 22 healthy control subjects were included in the study. Mini-Mental Status Examination was applied to the patients and controls. The ARD patients showed drastically reduced rCBF in the frontal cortices, basal ganglia, and thalami. The results indicate that ARD is associated with hypoperfusion in both cortical and subcortical regions. These findings support previous studies suggesting the association with both cortical and subcortical neuropathology in ARD patients.
