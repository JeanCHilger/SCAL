Reduced parahippocampal and lateral temporal GABAA-[11C]flumazenil binding in major depression: preliminary results. Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been related to both a dysfunctional gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) system and to hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). Although GABA has been suggested to inhibit HPA axis activity, their relationship has never been studied at the level of the central GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor in depressed patients or in relation to antidepressant treatment.Eleven depressed outpatients were compared, before and after treatment with citalopram, with nine age-matched healthy controls. The subjects were scanned using the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [(11)C]flumazenil ([(11)C]FMZ). Parametric voxel-by-voxel Logan plots were compared with methods based on regions of interest (ROI), to provide volume of distribution (V(T)) and binding potential (BP(ND)) values. Plasma GABA levels were determined and a dexamethasone-corticotropin releasing hormone (DEX-CRH) test was performed.In MDD, parametric voxel-by-voxel Logan plots showed bilateral reduced [(11)C]FMZ binding in the parahippocampal gyrus and right lateral superior temporal gyrus (p uncorrected < or =0.001). In the temporal area, [(11)C]FMZ binding showed a strong inverse correlation with HPA axis activity. Plasma GABA did not discriminate MDD from controls, but correlated inversely with [(11)C]FMZ binding in the right insula. Following treatment with citalopram, voxel-based analysis revealed reduced binding in the right lateral temporal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.The bilateral reduction in limbic parahippocampal and right temporal [(11)C]FMZ binding found in MDD indicates decreased GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex affinity and/or number. The inverse relationship between GABA(A) binding in the temporal lobe and HPA axis activity, suggests that HPA axis hyperactivity is partly due to reduced GABA-ergic inhibition.
