Simulated microgravity affects growth of Escherichia coli and recombinant beta-D-glucuronidase production. Effects of simulated microgravity (SMG) on bacteria have been studied in various aspects. However, few reports are available about production of recombinant protein expressed by bacteria in SMG. In this study growth of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pET-28a (+)-pgus in double-axis clinostat that could model low shear SMG environment and the recombinant beta-D-glucuronidase (PGUS) expression have been investigated. Results showed that the cell dry weights in SMG were 16.47%, 38.06%, and 28.79% more than normal gravity (NG) control, and the efficiency of the recombinant PGUS expression in SMG were 18.33%, 19.36%, and 33.42% higher than that in NG at 19 degrees C, 28 degrees C, and 37 degrees C, respectively (P < 0.05).
