Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of (18)F-labelled S-fluoroalkyl diarylguanidines: Novel high-affinity NMDA receptor antagonists for imaging with PET. Two S-[(18)F]fluoroalkylated diarylguanidines were synthesized and evaluated in vitro as potential tracers for imaging of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) with positron emission tomography (PET). [(18)F]1 and [(18)F]10 were synthesized by [(18)F]fluoroethylation and [(18)F]fluoromethylation of the thiol precursor 6, respectively. [(18)F]1 is a promising candidate NMDAR PET tracer, with low nanomolar affinity for the NMDA PCP-site, high selectivity and moderate lipophilicity.
