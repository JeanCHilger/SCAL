Combined striatal binding and cerebral influx analysis of dynamic 11C-raclopride PET improves early differentiation between multiple-system atrophy and Parkinson disease. Striatal dopamine D(2) receptor (D2R) PET has been proposed to differentiate between Parkinson disease (PD) and multiple-system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P). However, considerable overlap in striatal D(2) binding may exist between PD and MSA-P. It has been shown that imaging of neuronal activity, as determined by metabolism or perfusion, can also help distinguish PD from MSA-P. We investigated whether the differential diagnostic value of (11)C-raclopride PET could be improved by dynamic scan analysis combining D2R binding and regional tracer influx.(11)C-raclopride PET was performed in 9 MSA-P patients (mean age +/- SD, 56.2 +/- 10.2 y disease duration, 2.9 +/- 0.8 yUsing conventional BP values, we correctly classified 65.5% (all values given with cross-validation) of 29 cases only. The combination of BP and R(1) information increased discrimination accuracy to 79.3%. When healthy controls were not included and patients only were considered, BP information alone discriminated PD and MSA-P in 84.2% of cases, but the combination with R(1) data increased accuracy to 100%.Discriminant analysis using combined striatal D2R BP and cerebral influx ratio information of a single dynamic (11)C-raclopride PET scan distinguishes MSA-P and PD patients with high accuracy and is superior to conventional methods of striatal D2R binding analysis.
