Application of algebraic iterative reconstruction in imaging reconstruction of SPECT. By comparing routine FBP with algebraic iterative reconstruction, this study exploit the effect of the two SPECT reconstruction techniques on the ratio of Target/Background (T/B) and image noise. The result of research on model and clinical cases showed that the technique of OSEM could increase T/B ratio by 1.5% (heart), 3.3% (bone), 1.4% (brain). No obvious difference in image noise existed between OSEM and FBP. Compared with FBP, OSEM could improve T/B value in bone focus more significantly. Under the same injection dosage, OSEM could increase the speed of image collection by more than one time without changes in image quality and T/B ratio. The result suggested that function and clinical application of SPECT would significantly improved by substituting routine FBP with OSEM.
