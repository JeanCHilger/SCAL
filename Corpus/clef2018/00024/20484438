Feasibility of 18F-sodium fluoride PET/CT for imaging of atherosclerotic plaque. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence, distribution, and topographic relationship of vascular (18)F-sodium fluoride uptake and arterial calcification in major arteries.Image data obtained from 75 patients undergoing whole-body (18)F-sodium fluoride PET/CT were evaluated retrospectively. Arterial radiotracer uptake and calcification were analyzed qualitatively and semiquantitatively.(18)F-sodium fluoride uptake was observed at 254 sites in 57 (76%) of the 75 study patients, and calcification was observed at 1,930 sites in 63 (84%) of the patients. Colocalization of radiotracer accumulation and calcification could be observed in 223 areas of uptake (88%). However, only 12% of all arterial calcification sites showed increased radiotracer uptake.Our data indicate the feasibility of (18)F-sodium fluoride PET/CT for the imaging of mineral deposition in arterial wall alterations. (18)F-sodium fluoride PET/CT may provide relevant information about the morphologic and functional properties of calcified plaque.
