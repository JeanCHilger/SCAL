Effect of electroconvulsive therapy on brain 5-HT(2) receptors in major depression. Brain serotonin(2) (5-hydroxytryptamine(2) 5-HT(2)) receptors were considered potential targets for therapeutic efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), but pre-clinical studies showed that electroconvulsive shock up-regulates 5-HT(2) receptors in contrast to antidepressant medications, which down-regulate brain 5-HT(2) receptors. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies in individuals with depression confirmed that antidepressant medications reduce brain 5-HT(2) receptors, but the effects of ECT on these receptors in individuals with depression are unknown.To determine if a course of ECT alters brain 5-HT(2) receptors in individuals with depression and whether such changes correlate with improvement in symptoms.Fifteen people with major depression, refractory to antidepressant therapy and referred for a course of ECT, had an [18F]setoperone scan during baseline drug-free washout period and another after a course of ECT. We assessed changes in brain 5-HT(2) receptors with ECT and their relationship to therapeutic outcome.Widespread reduction in brain 5-HT(2) receptors was observed in all cortical areas with changes slightly more prominent in the right hemisphere. There was a trend for correlation between reduction in brain 5-HT(2) receptors in right parahippocampal gyrus, right lingual gyrus and right medial frontal gyrus, and improvement in depressive symptoms.Unlike in rodents, and similar to antidepressants, ECT reduces brain 5-HT(2) receptors in individuals with depression. The ability of ECT to further down-regulate brain 5-HT(2) receptors in antidepressant non-responsive individuals may explain its efficacy in those people with antidepressant refractory depression.
