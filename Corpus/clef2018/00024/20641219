PEGylated 4-[ Integrins belong to the seven transmembrane protein receptor families, and the receptor is composed of an α (24 forms) and a β (8 forms) subunit that can associate in different combinations to produce at least 24 types of heterodimeric molecules as described by Bandyopadhyay and Raghvan (1). The integrin receptor activity is influenced by the type of constitutive α and β subunit combination, and, depending on the combination, the receptor can promote cell adhesion to fibronectin, laminins, or collagens (2). Among the various types of integrin receptors, the α
