1-(2-Chlorophenyl)- Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, are potent psychoactive drugs used for their sedative and anxiolytic properties (1, 2). There are two types of benzodiazepine receptors, which have been identified as the central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. The central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) is found exclusively in the central nervous system on the membranes of neurons and is coupled to the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor/chloride channel (3). In contrast, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is a mitochondrial protein found in brain and peripheral tissues (adrenal gland, heart, lung, kidney, and testis) (4, 5). The brain has lower levels of PBR than do the peripheral tissues. Both glial cells and macrophages contain high levels of PBR (6-8). Increased PBR expression after brain injury or neuroinflammation is associated with microglial activation, such as occurs with the neuronal damage accompanying several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy.
