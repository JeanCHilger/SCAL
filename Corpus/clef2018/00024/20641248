 The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a cell-surface glycoprotein with a molecular weight of ~100 kDa. It is expressed predominantly in the prostate and has also been detected in other tissues such as the kidney, the proximal small intestine, and the salivary glands. Minimal expression has also been observed in the brain (1). It is believed that PSMA plays an important role in the progression of prostate cancer, glutamatergic neurotransmission, and in the absorption of folate (2). This glycoprotein is specifically upregulated several-fold in prostate cancers (PCAs), metastatic disease, and hormone-refractory PCAs because androgen levels inversely modulate PSMA levels (3). Interestingly, PSMA also has an elevated expression in the neovasculature of solid tumors, but is absent in normal neovasculature and prostate cancers tumors (4). Although its function in the prostate is unknown, in the central nervous system PSMA metabolizes
