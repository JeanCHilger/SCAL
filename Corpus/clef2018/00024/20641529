 The occurrence of colon and rectal cancer is influenced by genetic, nutritional, environmental, and occupational factors (1). Surgical removal of rectal cancer is considered to be the most common treatment for this ailment, and the additional use of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is known to improve treatment outcomes (2). However, in spite of the available treatments, recurrence and metastasis of the cancer primarily determine the success of long-term care and quality of life for these cancer patients (3, 4). Early detection of the cancer and its recurrence or metastasis could help devise a suitable treatment regimen and prolong patient survival with a suitable quality of life. After treatment, the patients usually undergo periodic computed tomography (CT) scans or fibrocolonoscopy as well as invasive procedures such as ultrasonography or CT-guided needle biopsy to monitor for any recurrence of the disease, but these procedures do not always detect recurrent disease lesions (5). Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a tumor-associated antigen that is secreted into the serum of rectal cancer patients, and its level is monitored after treatment to detect possible recurrence of the cancer. Although these tests have a high specificity, they lack the sensitivity to accurately detect disease recurrence (6, 7). To improve the sensitivity of the test to detect CEA for radioimmunoguided surgical treatment of the cancer, investigators developed the monoclonal antibody (MAb) CL-58, which is directed against the CEA, and they radiolabeled it with radioactive iodine (
