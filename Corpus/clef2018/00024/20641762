1-[ Liposomes may be characterized as artificial vesicle-like structures possessing an inner hydrophilic core surrounded by one or more outer hydrophobic bilayer membrane(s) that are composed of various natural or synthetic lipids, including phospholipids (1). Liposomes are used as drug delivery vehicles because the hydrophilic core can entrap a variety of compounds such as anti-cancer, anti-fungal, or photoactive drugs, or even nucleic acids and their derivatives for gene therapy (2-4). Therefore, it is important to evaluate the distribution of these drug delivery vesicles in an
