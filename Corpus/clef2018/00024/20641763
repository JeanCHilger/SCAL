. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common neoplastic condition detected in the men and women of the United States. In 2008 it is estimated that ~150,000 individuals will be diagnosed with this disease and that it will result in the death of nearly one third of the patients (1). Most of the patients who have this cancer die because it metastasizes to the liver, and early screening of the neoplasm would help devise a suitable and favorable treatment for the patient (2). The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved radioimmunoscintigraphic agents that are based on monoclonal antibodies for the imaging of colorectal cancers, but these agents have limitations because of incomplete penetration in tumors as a result of their large molecular size and prolonged blood circulation (3, 4). A smaller IgG1-derived Fab’ fragment derived from a murine antibody has been shown to have better tumor penetration, more rapid blood clearance, reduced accumulation in nontarget tissue, and high clinical utility because the Fab’ fragment was reported to have superior imaging properties compared to the conventional diagnostic modalities (5). This indicates that a smaller radiopharmaceutical is a superior diagnostic agent with suitable pharmacodynamic properties. In addition, it has been shown that radiolabeled peptides are extremely useful for the imaging and radiotherapy of neuroendocrine and pulmonary tumors (6, 7). Among the various labeled peptides, the
