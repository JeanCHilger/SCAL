 Although the main role of insulin is considered to be the regulation of glucose transport and metabolism, insulin is known to influence directly or indirectly a variety of other metabolic processes in the cell such as protein synthesis, DNA transcription, and RNA translation in that insulin receptors are found in almost all cell types (1). Because insulin plays a key role in the regulation of these important processes, it has been associated with conditions such as diabetes, obesity, heart disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and even cancer (2-5). The insulin amino acid sequence appears to be well conserved throughout the animal kingdom, and there is a difference of less than five amino acids between the human, bovine, and porcine molecules. In addition, insulin from these mammals is known to have an invariant location of three disulfide bonds (6). Insulin was initially purified mainly from bovine and porcine sources for the treatment of humans, but because of high demand insulin is now available commercially as a recombinant form expressed in either
