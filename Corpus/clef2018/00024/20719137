The Value of (18)F-FDG PET in Predicting the Prognosis of NSCLC.. (18)F-FDG PET has been widely applied in the diagnosis, treatment evaluation and following up of NSCLC. But the usefulness of PET in the prognosis predicting of NSCLC is uncertain. The purpose of the study is to investigate the value of (18)F-FDG PET in the prognosis of NSCLC.The value of SUV of primary and metastasis lesions to the prognosis of NSCLC were analyzed.SUV of primary lesions, all the metastasis lesions and hilar and/or mediastinal metastatic lymphnodes were (6.3+/-3.2), (4.3+/-3.1) and (4.6+/-3.4) respectively. Overall survival (OS) of patients whose SUV of primary lesions>= 7 and< 7 ones were 26.1 and 38.7 months (P =0.02). OS of patients whose SUV of lymphnodes metastasis>= 5 and< 5 ones were 17.0 and 28.9 months (P <0.001). Kaplen-Meier survival analysis revealed that SUV of primary lesions>= 7, SUV of lymphnodes metastasis>= 5, cancer stage, pathological status of tumor, differentiation of tumor, receiving surgery or not, numbers of organs that had metastasis, lymphnodes metastasis positive or not in PET scan, bone metastasis positive or not in PET scan were prognostic factors of NSCLC. Multivariate analysis suggested that tumor metastasis positive or not at PET scan, receiving surgery or not and the differentiation status was well-differentiated or not are independent prognostic factors of NSCLC patients.SUV of primary lesions and hilar and/or mediastinal lymphnodes in newly diagnosed NSCLC can be prognostic factors for NSCLC patients.
