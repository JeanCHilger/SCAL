Novel matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor [18F]marimastat-aryltrifluoroborate as a probe for in vivo positron emission tomography imaging in cancer. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), strongly associated pathogenic markers of cancer, have undergone extensive drug development programs. Marimastat, a noncovalent MMP inhibitor, was conjugated with FITC to label cellular metalloproteinase cancer targets in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro. Punctate localization of active transmembrane MMP14 was observed. For molecular-targeted positron emission tomography imaging of syngeneic 67NR murine mammary carcinoma in vivo, marimastat was (18)F-labeled using a shelf-stable arylboronic ester conjugate as a captor for aqueous [(18)F]fluoride in a novel, rapid one-step reaction at ambient temperature. [(18)F]Marimastat-aryltrifluoroborate localized to the tumors, with labeling being blocked in control animals first loaded with >10-fold excess unlabeled marimastat. The labeled drug cleared primarily via the hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal tract, with multiple animals imaged in independent experiments, confirming the ease of this new labeling strategy.
