Functional imaging: role for the diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of Parkinson's disease. Functional imaging is a tool that has been long restricted to research programs. However, the availability of ¹²³I-Ioflupane SPECT imaging has developed its' clinical utilization with a risk of misuse. There is room for improvement for the differential diagnosis between idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes and the measure of brain glucose metabolism with PET might fill this gap in the future. Conversely, functional imaging is still a major tool for the evaluation of new experimental therapeutic strategies in PD, especially for those aiming at restoring or protecting striatal dopaminergic innervation.
