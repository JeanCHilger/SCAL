Cerebrospinal fluid tau protein levels and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we aimed to compare cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau(181)) and positron emission tomography with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) in the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) under clinical conditions.In a cross-sectional, blinded, single-center study, we examined a sample of 75 unselected memory clinic patients with clinical diagnoses of dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT n = 24), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCIp-tau(181) and FDG-PET were comparable in separating DAT from controls (sensitivity: 67 vs. 79% specificity: 91% for both) and patients with other dementias (sensitivity: 71 vs. 79%FDG-PET and CSF p-tau(181) levels are able to discriminate DAT in heterogeneous and unselected samples with a high accuracy. CSF p-tau(181) might be somewhat superior for a sensitive detection of patients with MCI.
