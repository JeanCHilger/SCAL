Ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis in dogs and cats. In the time since canine ehrlichiosis due to Ehrlichia canis was first described in 1935 and first recognized in the United States in 1962, many key advances have been made in our understanding of the diversity of the rickettsial organisms responsible for ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis in dogs and, occasionally, cats, the vectors capable of transmitting these agents, and the role these organisms play as both important veterinary pathogens and zoonotic disease agents. Despite considerable progress in the field, much remains to be learned regarding mechanisms contributing to pathogenesis, effective treatment modalities, and prevention strategies that best protect pet health. This article highlights current understanding of the transmission, diagnosis, and management of ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis in dogs and cats.
