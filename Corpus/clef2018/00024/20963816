Test-retest variability of [¹¹C]raclopride-binding potential in nontreatment-seeking alcoholics. Knowledge of the reproducibility of striatal [¹¹C]raclopride (RAC) binding is important for studies that use RAC PET paradigms to estimate changes in striatal dopamine (DA) during pharmacological and cognitive challenges. To our knowledge, no baseline test-retest data exist for nontreatment-seeking alcoholics (NTS). We determined the test-retest reproducibility of baseline RAC binding potential (BP(ND) ) in 12 male NTS subjects. Subjects were scanned twice with single-bolus RAC PET on separate days. Striatal RAC BP (BP(ND) ) for left and right dorsal caudate, dorsal putamen, and ventral striatum was estimated using the Multilinear Reference Tissue Method (MRTM) and Logan Graphical Analysis (LGA) with a reference region. Test-retest variability (TRV), % change in BP(ND) between scan days, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used as metrics of reproducibility. For MRTM, TRV for striatal RAC binding in NTS subjects was ±6.5% and ±7.1% for LGA. Average striatal ICCs were 0.94 for both methods (P < 0.0001). Striatal BP(ND) values were similar to those reported previously for detoxified alcoholics. The results demonstrate that baseline striatal RAC binding is highly reproducible in NTS subjects, with a low variance similar to that reported for healthy control subjects.
