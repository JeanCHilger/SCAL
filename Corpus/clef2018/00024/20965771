Para-aortic lymphadenectomy in advanced-stage cervical cancer: standard procedure in 2010?. With tumour size, node involvement is the most important prognosis factor in advanced stage cervical cancer. Para-aortic (PA) disease is observed in 15 to 30% of these patients. CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not efficient enough to detect these lesions and PET CT have false negatives. Surgical staging is useful to detect carcinosis associated and to adapt therapy (radiotherapy fields are extended if PA nodes are involved). Laparoscopy was crucial to develop this staging because its morbidity associated to chemoradiotherapy is limited. If prognosis impact of PA lymphadenectomy is well established, therapeutic impact is still discussed. The systematic extension of this staging to pelvic nodes that are included in the basic radiotherapy fields is debated because it does not modify therapeutic management and is morbid. Radiotherapy progress, especially with boost and combination to MRI (MRIT), will impact on future therapeutic management.
