Carcinoid tumors. The authors review the most important clinical aspects of carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumors originating in neuroendocrine cells are rare, usually slowly-growing neoplasms, however, they may present as aggressive and rapidly progressing tumors. Epidemiologic data indicates that their prevalence is gradually increasing, which may be explained, at least in part, by the development and wider use of advanced diagnostic methods. A considerable proportion of patients with neuroendocrine tumors are symptom-free, whereas others may have carcinoid syndrome or symptoms of other endocrine syndromes. Early diagnosis may be established by the measurement of biochemical markers (serum chromogranin A, urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) and advanced localization methods. A considerable number of patients are diagnosed at the late stages of the disease in these cases surgical cure is not possible but surgical and/or interventional radiologic procedures which reduce tumoral mass should be still considered. The most effective drugs for symptomatic treatment of carcinoid tumors are somatostatin analogues
