PET/CT characteristics of isolated bone metastases in hepatocellular carcinoma. To compare the prognostic implications and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) characteristics of isolated bone metastasis secondary to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with those of HCC metastases to bone and other sites.This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Extrahepatic metastases were diagnosed in 257 patients with HCC by using dual-tracer (carbon 11 [(11)C] acetate and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]) PET/CT. Metastatic bone lesions were identified with visual inspection and semiquantitative assessment and confirmed with histopathologic examination and/or supported by findings at other radiologic examinations or serial PET/CT.The frequency of bone metastasis from HCC was 19% (49 of 257 patients eight patients had histopathologic proof and 41 had imaging proof). Metastasis isolated to bone (group 1, 30 of 257 patients [12%]) was more common than metastasis to bone and other sites (group 2, 19 of 257 patients [7%]). At lesion-based analysis of group 1 (71 index lesionsIsolated bone metastasis from HCC may not be as uncommon as previously believed. The detection of these metastases can be significantly enhanced with (11)C acetate PET compared with FDG PET alone. Identification of this group of patients also seems to have prognostic importance.
