Preclinical evaluation of DO3P-AME-DO3P: a polyazamacrocyclic methylene phosphonate for diagnosis and therapy of skeletal metastases. A phosphonate derivative 10'-bis(acetamido)-ethane-bis[1,4,7-tri(methylene phosphonic acid)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane] (DO3P-AME-DO3P), was synthesized with 90% yield in high purity. It was labeled with (99m)Tc in 97.5% efficiency and specific activity of 112-250 MBq/μmol. The binding affinity of (99m)Tc-DO3P-AME-DO3P towards bone minerals was tested in vitro by using hydroxy apatite as a bone model with absorption of 93% during the first hour of the experiment. Receptor binding assay on human bone cell line SAOS-2 demonstrated K(d) value of 1.07 nM. Cell binding studies of DO3P-AME-DO3P on osteoblasts and osteoclasts cells performed in vitro displayed preferential affinity of the compound towards osteoclast (167.95 ± 3.56% dose/mg protein). The serum stability of (99m)Tc complex was found to be 96.8% after 24 h. Blood kinetics of (99m)Tc-DO3P-AME-DO3P performed on normal rabbits showed fast clearance with t(1/2)(F) = 15 min ± 0.014 min and t(1/2)(S) = 4 h 3 min ± 0.09 min. Biodistribution studies carried out in normal BALB/c mice showed bone-to-blood ratio of 20 and bone-to-muscle ratio of 33. The bone tissue demonstrated highest concentration of bound radioactivity with 10.73% ID/g at 1 h post injection. The protonation and stability constants were determined by pH-potentiometry titrations. The stability constants of DO3P-AME-DO3P with Lu(III), Sm(III), and Ho(III) were 19.7, 21.8, and 20.2 determined by "out of cell" method. The excellent bone seeking properties of DO3P-AME-DO3P make it a candidate of choice for SPECT imaging and preferential uptake of the compound in osteoclasts in comparison to osteoblasts BMM and BMC can be used to understand the pathway of pathogenesis of osteoporosis and skeletal metastases.
