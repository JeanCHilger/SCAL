Metabolic remodelling in human heart failure. In addition to the typical abnormalities in myocardial structure and function, it is well established that the cardiac metabolism is abnormal in patients with heart failure (HF). Insulin resistance is a common co-morbidity in HF patients and also modulates cardiac metabolism in HF. The notion that an altered myocardial metabolism may contribute to the disease pathogenesis and optimizing it may serve therapeutic purposes underscores the importance of identifying the metabolic characteristics of HF patients. In this paper, the literature on the metabolic changes in human HF is reviewed, and the effects of metabolic modulators on patients with HF are discussed.
