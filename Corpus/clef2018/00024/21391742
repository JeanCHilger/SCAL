Prediction of survival and cancer recurrence using F-18 FDG PET/CT in patients with surgically resected early stage (Stage I and II) non-small cell lung cancer. The aim of the current study was to investigate the prognostic value of SUV(max) in patients with completely resected early stage (stage I and II) NSCLC. A retrospective review identified 76 patients with surgically resected early (stage I and II) NSCLC who received F-18 FDG PET/CT at diagnosis of cancer. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and survival curves stratified by age, sex, mediastinal lymph node involvement, SUV(max), and TNM staging were generated for estimation of overall survival and disease free survival (DFS). Independent predictive factors for survival were determined using Cox proportional hazard model. For overall survival, the median survival of the patients with tumor SUV(max)≤ 6.7 was 48.9 months and was significantly longer than the patients with tumor SUV(max)>6.7 (Log rank test, Χ²=18.01, p5.9. The median survival of the patients with tumor SUV(max)≤ 5.9 was 31.7 months (Log rank test, Χ²=16, p=0.0001). In conclusion, high FDG uptake measured by F-18 FDG PET/CT might have a prognostic value for overall survival and DFS in surgically resected early stage (stage I and II) NSCLC even after stratified by pathologic stages.
