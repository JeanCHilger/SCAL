Interrelationship between myocardial perfusion imaging, coronary calcium score, and endothelial function in asymptomatic diabetics and controls. Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death among diabetics, and silent ischemia is a major concern in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).To detect the prevalence of ischemia in diabetics by myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), and compare it to a control group without DM but with coronary risk factors, as well as to explore the relationship between silent ischemia, endothelial dysfunction, and coronary calcium, 59 patients (Group I) and 42 controls (Group II) were included. All underwent clinical and laboratory evaluations, gated MPI, brachial artery vasodilation measured by ultrasonography, and coronary calcium score (CCS).Twenty diabetics showed perfusion defects, vs seven controls (P = .04). There was no significant difference between both groups regarding the brachial artery vasodilator responsiveness: 4.49% ± 4.26% (diabetics) vs 4.70% ± 4.98% (controls). Mean CCS was 74 in diabetics vs five in controls (P = .01). The only risk factor significantly associated with an abnormal MPI was the presence of diabetes (P = .03). In the whole population of patients and in diabetics, the abnormal endothelium-dependent vasodilation, the CCS >100, and the cholesterol/HDL ratio >4, showed an OR >1. CCS exhibited the higher OR among the whole population: OR 2.15 [95% CI 0.42-10.99] while for diabetics it was the cholesterol/HDL ratio: OR 3.95 [95% CI 0.71-21.84].Reversible perfusion defects and coronary calcium are more frequent in diabetics. CCS, abnormal endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and cholesterol/HDL ratio higher than 4, showed an association with perfusion abnormalities in asymptomatic diabetics.
