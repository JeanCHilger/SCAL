PET and SPECT in brain tumors and epilepsy. Molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of patients with brain tumors and epilepsy. The clinical uses of FDG are discussed, as well as the research applications of novel PET tracers. Where applicable, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is also discussed.
