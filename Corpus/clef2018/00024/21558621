CD20 antigen imaging with ¹²⁴I-rituximab PET/CT in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Visualization of the CD20-antigen expression could provide a tool to localize sites of inflammation and could be of additive value in the diagnosis, and subsequently, in the treatment follow-up of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab (Mabthera®), was radiolabeled with ¹²⁴Iodine. We report the first results of I¹²⁴-rituximab PET/CT in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.Eligible patients received 50 MBq ¹²⁴I-rituximab. Wholebody PET/CT imaging was performed at 10 min, 24 h, 48 h and 72-96 h post injection. Images were evaluated primarily on a visual basis and were correlated with disease activity as determined by physical examination and clinical measures.Joints with visually detectable targeting of ¹²⁴I-rituximab were observed in 4 out of 5 evaluable patients. Only the images at 24 h and later showed accumulation in joints, indicating that the visualized signal represented active targeting of rituximab to the CD20 antigen. Several images showed CD20 positive B-cell infiltration in joints which were clinically normal, while a few clinically diagnosed arthritis localizations were not visualized. This discrepancy suggests that infiltration of CD20 positive B-cells in synovium is a phenomenon that is at least partially independent of clinical inflammation. The level of uptake in joints was generally low, representing less than 0.5% of the injected dose.We have shown the feasibility of CD20 antigen imaging using ¹²⁴I-rituximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Further research is needed to elucidate the clinical significance of demonstrated B-cell infiltration in rheumatic joints.
