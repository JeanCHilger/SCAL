Protons safely allow coverage of high-risk nodes for patients with regionally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Our objective was to determine if protons allow for the expansion of treatment volumes to cover high-risk nodes in patients with regionally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. In this study, 5 consecutive patients underwent external-beam radiotherapy treatment planning. Four treatment plans were generated for each patient: 1) photons (x-rays) to treat positron emission tomography (PET)-positive gross disease only to 74 Gy (XG) 2) photons (x-rays) to treat high-risk nodes to 44 Gy and PET-positive gross disease to 74 Gy (XNG)
