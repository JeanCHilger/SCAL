Anti-UV activity of Lentinus edodes mycelia extract (LEM). Using our recently established simple method for evaluating protective activity from ultraviolet ray injury (referred to as 'anti-UV activity'), the effectiveness of various antioxidants and plant extracts was investigated.HSC-2 human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells were exposed to UV irradiation (wavelength: 253.7 nm, 6 J/mÂ²) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS(-)) containing various concentrations of samples and then incubated for 48 hours in regular culture medium to determine the viable cell number by the MTT method.Among the representative antioxidants, sodium ascorbate showed the most potent anti-UV activity, whereas catalase and N-acetyl-L-cysteine were inactive. Lentinus edodes mycelia extract (LEM) showed comparable anti-UV activity to sodium ascorbate. Hot water extracts of green tea and coffee, and PET-bottled of green tea extract showed slightly less, but noticeable anti-UV activity. On the other hand, hot water extracts of black tea and Jasmine tea, and PET-bottled of oolong tea, barley tea and Kohki tea were inactive. LEM was separated by gel filtration chromatography into four fractions from high to low molecular weight: polysaccharide, large and small lignin-carbohydrate complexes, and sugars. Anti-UV activity was shown by the lignin-carbohydrate fractions, but not the polysaccharide and sugar fractions. LEM, at high concentration, slightly enhanced the anti-UV activity of sodium ascorbate.LEM may be applicable as a UV-protective agent.
