NMF-SVM based CAD tool applied to functional brain images for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. This paper presents a novel computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technique for the early diagnosis of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and support vector machines (SVM) with bounds of confidence. The CAD tool is designed for the study and classification of functional brain images. For this purpose, two different brain image databases are selected: a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) database and positron emission tomography (PET) images, both of them containing data for both Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy controls as a reference. These databases are analyzed by applying the Fisher discriminant ratio (FDR) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for feature selection and extraction of the most relevant features. The resulting NMF-transformed sets of data, which contain a reduced number of features, are classified by means of a SVM-based classifier with bounds of confidence for decision. The proposed NMF-SVM method yields up to 91% classification accuracy with high sensitivity and specificity rates (upper than 90%). This NMF-SVM CAD tool becomes an accurate method for SPECT and PET AD image classification.
