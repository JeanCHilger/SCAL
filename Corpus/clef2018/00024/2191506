Cardiac positron emission tomography--current status and future perspectives. Positron emission tomography (PET) permits the non-invasive examination of myocardial metabolism. At present, combined imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism are used to distinguish viable myocardium from scar tissue, which is particularly important for deciding on therapeutic interventions. In the future, further indications for PET imaging are foreseeable, with refined imaging techniques and development of new tracer substances. Tracers for assessment of adrenergic and muscarinic myocardial receptor density, as well as new positive markers of myocardial ischemia are currently being explored. Labeled amino acids are being employed for assessment of protein metabolism. Finally, C-11 acetate as a tracer of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity and myocardial oxygen consumption has been suggested for clinical use in initial studies in man.
