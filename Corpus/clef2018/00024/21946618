Building PET research collaborations. Collaborations help to stimulate scientific research by sharing of expertise, knowledge, equipment, and research products. Cooperation benefits multicentre positron emission tomography (PET) trials by speeding up recruitment, allowing larger studies to be performed and making it feasible to recruit sufficient patients to study atypical tumour types. Mechanisms are being developed to encourage UK PET centres to collaborate with other UK centres, industrial partners, and PET centres in other countries. This editorial explores these different types of collaboration, highlighting interesting opportunities, potential issues that may be encountered, and three areas where the NCRI PET Research Network are trying to promote group effort.
