¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT imaging of the pancreas: spectrum of diseases. Since the introduction of integrated positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT), it has a great impact on the field of oncology. Comparing to other conventional scanners, only PET/CT is capable of providing important information on accurate detecting, staging/restaging, and post-therapeutic monitoring of many cancers. Many studies have demonstrated that PET/CT changes the management in approximately 30% of all cancer patients. Because 2-((18)F)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is a nonspecific tracer, understanding the PET/CT limitations and pitfalls for various pancreatic conditions can lead to more accurate interpretation of PET/CT images, which ultimately would impact patient care. As a result, it is important for radiologists and other clinicians to familiarize themselves with a wide spectrum of pancreatic PET/CT findings simulating cancer from benign entities.
