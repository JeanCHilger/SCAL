Relationship of haemodialysis therapy duration and cardiac adrenergic system function assessed by iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging in haemodialysed nondiabetic patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship of haemodialysis therapy duration with the function of the cardiac adrenergic system in nondiabetic patients.Thirty haemodialysed male patients were enrolled in this study all patients were evaluated by myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and after dynamic stress, with the assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at rest and after stress and summed stress score (SSS). Single photon emission computed tomography and planar iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy were also performed in all the patients. Semiquantitative analysis of iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial uptake was expressed as the routine heart-to-mediastinum ratio (HMR): 15 min [early HMR (eHMR)] and 4 h [delayed HMR (dHMR)] post administration as well as the washout rate. Twenty-four hours of Holter studies were carried out and heart rate variability was evaluated.Significant correlations (Spearman's tests) were found between the duration of haemodialysis treatment and the following ratios: eHMR (P=0.03 r=-0.378), dHMR (P=0.04The duration of haemodialysed patients appears to be an important factor influencing the cardiac sympathetic nervous system.
