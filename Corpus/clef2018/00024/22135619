A paired-comparision of the Multifunction Cardiogram (MCG) and sestamibi SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) to quantitative coronary angiography for the detection of relevant coronary artery obstruction (≥70%) - a single-center study of 116 consecutive patients referred for coronary angiography. An analysis of the US National Cardiovascular Data Registry has revealed that only 38% of patients referred for coronary angiography after non-invasive coronary testing have relevant coronary obstruction (CO) (≥70%) of one or more coronary arteries.A single-center trial was undertaken in 165 consecutive, symptomatic patients with either known or suspected coronary disease and/or valve disease(VHD) who agreed to undergo cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography if stress myocardial perfusion imaging was abnormal. A total of 116 patients with abnormal SPECT MPI tests, persistent chest pain, or significant VHD underwent final analysis. An MCG coronary obstruction (CO) score of ≥ 4.0 was considered indicative of relevant CO (≥70%) in one or more coronary arteries. Angiographic results were finalized by consensus of two angiographers.CO (≥70%) was present in 53 of 116 patients (46%). The MCG CO score was significantly higher for patients with relevant CO (5.4 ± 1.9 vs. 2.5 ± 1.9). The MCG correctly classified 103 of the 116 patients (89%) enrolled in the study as either having or not having CO (≥70%) (sensitivity- 91% specificity- 87%The MCG was shown in this paired-comparison trial with SPECT MPI to safely and accurately identify patients with relevant CO (≥70%) prior to catheterization.
