Invasive mediastinal staging of non-small-cell lung cancer: a clinical practice guideline. In non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc), invasive mediastinal staging is typically used to guide treatment decision-making. Here, we present clinical practice guideline recommendations for invasive mediastinal staging in nsclc patients who have been staged T1-4, N0-3, with no distant metastases.Draft recommendations were formulated based on the best available evidence gathered by a systematic review and a consensus of expert opinion. The draft recommendations underwent an internal review by clinical and methodology experts, and an external review by clinical practitioners through a survey assessing the clinical relevance and overall quality of the guideline. Feedback from the internal and external reviews was integrated into the clinical practice guideline.In general, most clinical experts agreed with the guideline, approving it for methodologic rigour. More than 80% of the surveyed practitioners gave it a high quality rating. The expert reviewers also provided written comments, with some of the suggested changes being incorporated into the final version of the guideline.In the clinical practice guideline, invasive mediastinal staging of nsclc is recommended in all cases except those involving patients with normal-sized lymph nodes, negative combine positron-emission tomography and computed tomography, and peripheral clinical stage 1A tumour. When performing mediastinoscopy, 5 nodal stations (2R/L, 4R/L, and 7) should routinely be examined.
