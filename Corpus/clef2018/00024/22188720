Glucose metabolism and gray-matter concentration in apolipoprotein E ε4 positive normal subjects. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 is known as a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated the prevalence of imaging abnormalities suggestive of AD in cognitively normal ApoE ε4 carriers using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Forty-five cognitive normal ApoE ε4 allele carriers and 45 noncarriers underwent both FDG positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 90 normal database sets were generated for the individual 45 ε4 carriers and 45 noncarriers. Mean z-scores in the predefined AD-specific regions of interest (ROI) were calculated for each ε4 carrier and noncarrier using the individually defined normal database. The prevalence of AD-like hypometabolism and atrophy in the ε4 carriers was 8.9% and 17.7%, respectively, and did not differ significantly from those in the noncarriers (8.9%, 8.8%). The majority of ε4 carriers showed preserved FDG uptake or gray matter concentration.
