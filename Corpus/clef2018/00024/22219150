Radioisotope therapy of bone metastases. Radionuclide therapy has been an integral part of systemic treatment of patients with advanced and disseminated cancer for 50 years. Specific radioisotopes (b- or a-emitters) with selective concentration at sites of bone cancer damage are used in the treatment. Radioisotopes are an important addition to the armamentarium of clinicians who take care of patients with advanced cancer and painful cancer bone metastases (especially osteoblastic and mixed type). They offer a high degree of efficacy with minimal toxicity and simple administration, fulfilling the fundamental criteria for palliative treatment that should combine minimal patient discomfort and toxicity with maximal clinical effect.
