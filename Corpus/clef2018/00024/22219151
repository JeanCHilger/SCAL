Bone metastases diagnosis possibilities in studies with the use of 18F-NaF and 18F-FDG. Scintigraphy of the skeletal system is performed mainly with the use of 99mTc-MDP. There are other radiopharmaceuticals showing affinity to bone lesions: 99mTc-MIBG, 201Tl, 131I (in the case of papillary or follicular thyroid cancers), and 99mTc (V) DMSA (in the case of medullary cancer). Currently, positron emitted radioisotopes are also used in clinical practice. It seems that 18F-NaF/PET is a highly sensitive and specific modality for detection of metastases and other bone lesions. Certain data concerning the role of 18F-FDG, 18F-choline, or 68Ga-DOTATATE can be found. The aim of this article is to review the role of 18F-NaF and 18F-FDG in diagnosis of bone metastases.
