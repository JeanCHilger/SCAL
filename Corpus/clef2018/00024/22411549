Clinical course and pathology in rats (Rattus norvegicus) after experimental cowpox virus infection by percutaneous and intranasal application. Recently, several cases of human cowpox virus (CPXV) infections were reported in France and Germany, which had been acquired through close contact with infected pet rats. The animals exhibited respiratory signs or skin lesions and died shortly after purchase. After natural infection of white rats with CPXV in the USSR in 1978, a peracute pulmonary form, a milder dermal form, and a mixed form exhibiting features of both have been described. To the best of the authors' knowledge, 3 experimental cowpox virus infection studies using rats have been performed to date however, neither results of histomorphological examinations nor immunohistochemical analyses have yet been reported in rats after experimental infections. To investigate the impact of the infection route on the clinical course, the development of lesions, and tropism, rats were infected intradermally, intranasally, or by a combination of both routes. The authors found a correlation between clinical manifestation, pathology, and infection routes. Intradermal and contact exposure yielded a mild dermal form, characterized by the development of vesiculopustular dermatitis. In contrast, intranasally infected animals died peracutely, showing severe dyspnea. Occasionally, a combination of the dermal and the respiratory form occurred after intranasal infection. Immunohistochemically, CPXV antigen was detected in the epithelial and mesenchymal cells of the upper respiratory tract and affected skin lesions and rarely in mesenchymal cells of lymph nodes. This is the first histomorphological and immunohistochemical analysis of CPXV in rats after experimental infection.
