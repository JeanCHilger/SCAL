Quantitative phosphor imaging autoradiography of radioligands for positron emission tomography. Imaging using phosphor screens have increasingly been employed for the analysis of radioactive samples in molecular biology, pharmacology, and receptor autoradiography. The major advantages of phosphor screens compared to radiation sensitive film are their greatly increased sensitivity, reducing exposure times with at least one order of magnitude, and their increased linear dynamic range. These features make phosphor screens ideal for imaging short-lived radionuclides, where exposure times are limited, such as (11)C and (18)F widely used to label radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET). Phosphor imaging can also considerably reduce exposure times for weak Î²-particle emitters such as (3)H. In this chapter, we present methods for the characterization and evaluation of novel PET radioligands using quantitative phosphor imaging autoradiography.
