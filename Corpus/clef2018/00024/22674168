Dynamic in vivo imaging of receptors in small animals using positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging technique with the potential to image and quantify receptors in vivo with high sensitivity. PET has been used extensively to study major neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and benzodiazepine in humans as well as proving to be a very powerful tool to accelerate development and assessment of existing and novel drugs. With the recent development of dedicated PET scanners for small animals, such as the microPET, it is now possible to perform functional imaging in small animals such as rodents at high resolution. This will allow the study of animal models of disease and longitudinal studies in these models to monitor disease progression or effect of treatment in the same animal. Furthermore, the complete pharmacokinetics of a drug as well as pharmacodynamic information can be obtained in a single animal. Thus, small animal imaging will significantly reduce the number of animals needed for this type of experiment as well as reducing the effect of inter-animal variation. Experimental protocols in small animal imaging potentially can be very labor intensive. In this chapter, we discuss methods and practical aspects related to this type of experiment using the microPET system.
