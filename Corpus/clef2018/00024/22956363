Performance of a semiconductor SPECT system: comparison with a conventional Anger-type SPECT instrument. The performance of a new single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanner with a cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) solid-state semiconductor detector (Discovery NM 530c D530c) was evaluated and compared to a conventional Anger-type SPECT with a dual-detector camera (Infinia).Three different phantom studies were performed. Full width at half maximum (FWHM) was measured using line sources placed at different locations in a cylindrical phantom. Uniformity was measured using cylindrical phantoms with 3 different diameters (80, 120, and 160 mm). Spatial resolution was evaluated using hot-rod phantoms of various diameters (5, 9, 13, 16, and 20 mm). Three different myocardial phantom studies were also performed, acquiring projection data with and without defects, and evaluating the interference of liver and gallbladder radioactivity. In a clinical study, the D530c employed list-mode raw data acquisition with electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated acquisition over a 10-min period. From the 10-min projection data, 1-, 3-, 5-, 7- and 10-min SPECT images were reconstructed.The FWHM of the D503c was 1.73-3.48 mm (without water) and 3.88-6.64 mm (with water), whereas the FWHM of the Infinia was 8.17-12.63 mm (without water) and 15.48-16.28 mm (with water). Non-uniformity was larger for the D530c than for the Infinia. Truncation artifacts were also observed with the D530c in a Φ160 mm phantom. The contrast ratio, as defined by myocardial defect/non-defect ratio, was better for the D530c than for the Infinia, and the influence from liver and gallbladder radioactivities was less. Quantitative gated SPECT (QGS) software demonstrated significant differences between data captured over a 10-min period, relative to those acquired over periods of <5 min there was no difference between ejection fractions calculated using data capture for periods ≥5 min (p < 0.05).The D530c is superior to the Infinia, with regard to both spatial resolution and sensitivity. In this study, these advantages were confirmed by the myocardial phantom and in a clinical setting, using the QGS software.
