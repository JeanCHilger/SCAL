EEG correlates of spontaneous self-referential thoughts: a cross-cultural study. The default mode network (DMN) has been mostly investigated using positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and has received mixed support in electroencephalographic (EEG) studies. In this study, after sLORETA transformation of EEG data, we applied group spatial independent component analysis which is routinely used in fMRI research. In three large and diverse samples coming from two different cultures (Russian and Taiwanese), spontaneous EEG data and retrospective questionnaire measures of subject's state, thoughts, and feelings during the EEG registration were collected. Regression analyses showed that appearance of spontaneous self-referential thoughts was best predicted by enhanced alpha activity within the DMN. Diminished theta and delta activity in the superior frontal gyrus and enhanced beta activity in the postcentral gyrus added to the prediction. The enhanced alpha activity prevailed in the posterior DMN hub in Russian, but in the anterior DMN hub in Taiwanese participants. Possible cross-cultural differences in personality and attitudes underlying this difference are discussed.
