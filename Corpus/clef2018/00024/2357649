Regional cerebral glucose metabolism in Turner syndrome. Regional cerebral glucose metabolism was examined in females with Turner syndrome, a sex chromosome abnormality. Previous studies have found a visual/spatial cognitive anomaly in these women but, to date, no abnormalities in brain structure or function have been associated with the condition. In the present study, decreases in regional metabolism were found in the occipital and parietal cortex. The involvement of the occipital cortex, although consistent with the observed cognitive anomalies, has not been suggested previously as an area dysfunction. Because the occipital cortex is a primary sensory cortex, the reduction of glucose metabolism in the parietal cortex may reflect a lack of innervation from the occipital cortex. Besides insight into the functional specialization of the brain, these findings are also consistent with previous reports on animals regarding the effects of estrogen in brain maturation.
