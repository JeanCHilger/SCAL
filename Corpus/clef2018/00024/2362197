Myocardial clearance kinetics of technetium-99m-SQ30217: a marker of regional myocardial blood flow. SQ30217 is a new, technetium-99m-(99mTc) labeled perfusion agent introduced for cardiac imaging. To evaluate the myocardial tracer kinetics, 99mTc-SQ30217, was injected intracoronarily in open-chested dogs under baseline conditions and after administration of intravenous (i.v.) dipyridamole. Myocardial first-pass retention fraction averaged 0.90 +/- 0.04. Clearance of the tracer occurred in a biexponential manner. Sixty-seven percent of retained activity cleared with a half-time of 2.3 +/- 0.6 min, while the residual activity demonstrated slow clearance. The clearance rate of the rapid phase correlated with myocardial blood flow (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001). Myocardial SQ30217 clearance rate following i.v. injection as determined by dynamic imaging with tomography (SPRINT) averaged 21 +/- 4 min and increased to 13 +/- 4 min following dipyridamole. Thus, 99mTc-SQ30217 is a promising flow tracer with high initial myocardial retention and rapid tissue clearance, which allow repeated flow determinations within short time intervals using advanced SPECT technology.
