Epidemiologic study of insecticide exposures, obesity, and risk of bladder cancer in household dogs. A case-control study of household dogs was conducted to determine if exposure to sidestream cigarette smoke and chemicals in the home, use of topical insecticides, and obesity are associated with the occurrence of bladder cancer. Information was obtained by interview from owners of 59 dogs with transitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder and 71 age- and breed size-matched control dogs with other chronic diseases or neoplasms. Bladder cancer risk was unrelated to sidestream cigarette smoke and household chemical exposures. Risk was significantly increased by topical insecticide use (OR = 1.6 for 1-2 applications per year and OR = 3.5 for greater than 2 applications per year chi 2 trend
