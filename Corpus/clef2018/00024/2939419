Cardiac radionuclide tomography with gamma emitters. Two types of radioisotope tomography have been developed: single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography. Tomography of the heart meets with several problems due to the mobility and obliquity of that organ and to the heterogeneity of surrounding tissues. Compared with planar tomography, myocardial tomography with thallium 201 improves the detection of ischaemic and sub-ischaemic areas in myocardial infarction and chronic coronary disease. In spite of some technical limitations, tomography with labelled red cells is very helpful to determine pre-operative size and location of aneurysms.
