Positron emission tomography in patients with glioma. A predictor of prognosis. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have been performed using 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose in 29 adult subjects with primary brain tumors. Seventy-two percent of the patients were treated previously. The glucose metabolic state in the lesions was increased in 16 patients, and was normal or decreased in 13 patients. The hypermetabolic tumors tended to behave in a more malignant fashion. Patients with hypermetabolic tumors had a median survival of 7 months after PET scan, compared to 33 months for those with hypometabolic lesions. Among the high-grade glioma patients, the PET results separated them into a good prognosis group (hypometabolic, with 78% 1-year survival) and a poor prognosis group (hypermetabolic, with a 29% 1-year survival after PET). These results suggest that glucose metabolic studies may provide an independent measure of the aggressiveness of a brain tumor, and may supplement pathologic grading.
