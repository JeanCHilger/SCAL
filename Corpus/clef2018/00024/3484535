Distribution of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in experimental animals studied by postiron emission tomography and whole body autoradiography. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is a selective potent neurotoxin which has induced a syndrome similar to parkinsonism both in man and in monkeys. At autopsy degeneration of pigmented nerve cells in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra has been confirmed. The regional distribution of intravenously administered 1-(11C-methyl)-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (11C-MPTP) in the brain of Rhesus monkeys was studied by positron emission tomography and the whole body distribution in mice was documented by autoradiography and by impulse counting of selected tissues. A very rapid and high uptake of 11C-MPTP derived radioactivity was seen in areas corresponding to striatum and midbrain, including the substantia nigra area. No elimination from these regions was seen during the study period of 2 h. The uptake was in the order of 7-8 times the homogenous distribution of the radioactivity in the monkey. The uptake was generally high also in other regions of the brain, but there some elimination could be distinguished. Pretreatment of the monkey with spiperone, a selective dopamine receptor antagonist, did not alter uptake nor the kinetics of the 11C-MPTP derived radioactivity. Thus 11C-MPTP does not have a high affinity for postsynaptic dopamine receptors. A remarkably high uptake of 11C-MPTP derived radioactivity was seen in the eye of the monkey. The selective uptake of radioactivity in the eye was also confirmed in pigmented but not in albino mice. The melanin affinity of MPTP may cause high intracellular concentrations of the compound or its metabolites in the melanin containing nerve cells in substantia nigra, which may explain the serious vulnerability of these neurons to MPTP.
