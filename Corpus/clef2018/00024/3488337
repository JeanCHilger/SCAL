Dynamic PET data analysis. A general method for estimating the precision of parameters resulting from the use of various experimental designs (rate of injection and rate of tomographic data collection) in emission tomography studies is proposed. The sensitivity matrix of the study model and an estimate of the statistical uncertainty of the tomographic data are used to compute the covariance matrix of the parameters. The determinant of this covariance matrix (proportional to the total volume of uncertainty of the model parameters) serves as a criterion to be minimized. The method is applied to a three-compartment, three-transfer rate constant for glucose metabolism using dynamic positron emission tomography, and a comparison of various current protocols is made with simulated data. The results show that higher rates of injection and higher rates of tomographic data collection at early times lead to smaller statistical uncertainties for the estimates of rate constants. However, for the range of rate constants encountered in practice, differences are insignificant when an initial scan duration less than 30 s is used, without regarding the injection duration.
