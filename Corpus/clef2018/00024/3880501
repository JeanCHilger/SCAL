SPECT study of the fluid distribution in the intra-abdominal space during intraperitoneal treatment of ovarian cancer. Only limited progress has been achieved in the treatment of ovarian cancer, the most common fatal gynaecological malignancy. Peritoneal dialysis with drugs known to be effective in ovarian cancer and large intraperitoneal fluid volumes (Belly Bath) have been used. The two critical determinants for a successful intraperitoneal chemotherapy programme are: (1) complete accessibility of the drug to all tumour-bearing areas and (2) drug penetration into the residual tumour masses. We show that the scintigraphic technique in tomographic mode after administration of MAA-99Tcm-containing dialysate is a valuable adjunct for evaluation of patients undergoing intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
