Diagnostic promise of positron tomography. Cardiac positron tomography offers promise as a diagnostic tool with attributes permitting characterization of regional myocardial biochemistry and perfusion in quantitative terms. Its availability should facilitate the detection, localization, and characterization of metabolic sequelae of ischemia and impaired perfusion. Its power to elucidate intermediary metabolism in vivo should help clarify the pathogenesis and promote early detection of differentiation of specific cardiomyopathic processes, currently unrecognizable except in terms of end-stage functional and morphologic criteria. Its quantitative characteristics are amenable to sequential application and should facilitate objective evaluations of interventions designed to maintain or improve biochemical integrity in jeopardized myocardium in patients with ischemic heart disease.
