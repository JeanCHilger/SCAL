Positron emission tomography in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease. Positron emission tomography has grown rapidly from a little-understood research tool into an exciting noninvasive method for the clinician to evaluate myocardial perfusion, metabolism, and cell-membrane function. There are three radionuclides that are currently being used widely in cardiac positron emission tomography. These are nitrogen-13 ammonia, rubidium-82, and fluorine-18 fluordeoxyglucose. Nitrogen-13 ammonia and rubidium-82 are used to assess the severity and location of coronary artery disease, while fluorine-18 fluordeoxyglucose can identify impaired but viable myocardium, thus aiding in the subsequent management of these patients.
