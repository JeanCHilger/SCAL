Inhomogeneous exercise uptake and accelerated washout of a radioiodinated fatty acid analogue in syndrome X. A SPECT study of the left ventricle. Myocardial metabolism in exercise was determined by studying 21 syndrome X patients and 14 healthy volunteers with an aromatic fatty acid analogue IPPA and a gamma camera. We developed criteria for visual semiquantitative assessment of relative segmental radiotracer uptake and washout, and tested a new computer program for quantitative evaluation. One volunteer (7%) and 12 patients (57%) showed visually inhomogeneous uptake (p = 0.006, chi 2-test) in SPECT polar tomograms after a maximal ergometry test. Images in none of the volunteers and seven patients (33%) gave the impression of a slowed regional washout (p = 0.057). Only six patients (29%) had a normal radial polarogram. Patients with irregular coronary angiograms (showing 'slow flow' or minor sclerosis) and those with chest pain during the IPPA exercise test had a very low frequency of normalcy, but this was not significant. Total washout was higher in patients than in the reference population, as the exercise to rest activity ratio was 1.36 SD 0.13 versus 1.25 SD 0.11 in computerized quantitation (p = 0.015, t-test). Washout did not correlate with age, sex or exercise heart rate. Regarding computerized analysis of uptake and slow washout, the number of deviant segments was not significantly higher in patients than in reference population. Semiquantitative and quantitative analysis correlated in the assessment of uptake, but not in the assessment of washout. Possible reasons for the discrepancy are discussed. Conclusions of this study are not straightforward. Syndrome X was associated with inhomogeneous IPPA uptake, which is not at variance with the theory of microvascular dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
