Quantitative analysis of 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy by myocardial uptake using a phantom. To evaluate the quantitative analysis of 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy, total injected dose measured by first pass (FP) method (TFP) was compared with that measured by phantom method using an acrylic phantom in 45 patients with cardiac disease. Heart per mediastinum ratio (H/M) was compared to myocardial uptake calculated with TFP. The total injected dose measured using the phantom in which the syringe was set in depth of 3.5 cm (Tpham) was correlated with TFP (r = 0.73, p = 0.0001). When Tpham was corrected by body weight (c-Tpham), c-Tpham showed better correlation with TFP. MU calculated by TFP (MU-FP) was well correlated with MU by c-Tpham (MU-pham) (r = 0.94, p = 0.001). These results indicate that phantom method is sufficient to substitute for FP method. Though H/M was correlated with MU-FP (p < 0.001), the interpatient variation was relatively large. Then the analysis by H/M is insufficient to substitute for the myocardial uptake. It is though to be enough to use the phantom method on daily routine work, since this method is accurate and easy to quantitate the myocardial uptake of MIBG taking a short time.
