Functional imaging in relation to parkinsonian syndromes. Parkinsonism is a feature not only of Parkinson's disease but also of many other diseases affecting basal ganglia function. Functional imaging (PET and SPECT) can demonstrate the various resting patterns of disruption of regional cerebral blood flow, metabolism, and neuropharmacology associated with different parkinsonian disorders. 18F-dopa PET also has the potential to detect subclinical dysfunction of dopaminergic terminals in at-risk subjects. Finally, functional imaging can help us understand the nature of the networks involved in performing different motor tasks, and can reveal how these networks malfunction in the presence of bradykinesia or parkinsonian tremor.
