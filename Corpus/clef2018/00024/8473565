Spontaneous neoplasia in the ferret (Mustela putorius furo). Thirteen spontaneous tumours in ferrets from two laboratory breeding colonies are described, including two types not previously reported in this species, namely, uterine teratoma and neurilemmoma. The literature on tumours in laboratory and domestic ferrets is comprehensively reviewed from the first reported case in 1950. Only 20 cases were reported from 1950 to 1979, nearly all from laboratory or zoological collections. In the following 10 years more than 170 further cases were reported, about half of them in domestic pet ferrets. A review of the limited literature on tumours in related species reveals substantial incidences in black-footed ferrets and ranch mink allowed to live out their lifespan, and isolated cases in polecats and at least eight other species of Mustelidae.
