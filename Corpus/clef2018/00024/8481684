The human/animal bond as a correlate of family functioning. This study investigated whether selected family characteristics are predictive of family functioning. The intent was to examine whether family cohesion and adaptability could be predicted from the characteristics of family education, income, marital status, and level of pet attachment. A survey research design was used to distribute questionnaires to families in therapy in six southeastern states. Findings indicated that 15% of the variance in family adaptability could be significantly (p < .05) accounted for by the combination of family education, income, marital status, and pet attachment. However, variance in family cohesion could not be significantly accounted for by this combination of variables. Family pet attachment was significantly (p < .05) correlated with both family adaptability and family cohesion. Clinical practice implications of these findings for nurses and other health care professionals are discussed, and recommendations for future studies are identified.
