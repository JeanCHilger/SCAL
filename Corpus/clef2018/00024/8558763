I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine cardiac scintigraphy in patients with an implanted permanent pacemaker. T1 scintigraphic abnormalities have been reported in patients with an implanted permanent pacemaker, but little is known about the MIBG scintigraphic findings in such patients. This study was performed to assess the MIBG scintigraphic findings in patients with an implanted permanent pacemaker, and to test the hypothesis that imaging characteristics of MIBG scintigraphy differ according to its mode. Twelve patients (4 men and 8 women, mean age: 72.4 +/- 9.5 years), who had undergone the implantation of a permanent pacemaker for bradyarrhythmias, underwent MIBG scintigraphy. The patients were divided into VVI pacemaker and DDD pacemaker groups. The tomograms were divided into nine segments and the MIBG defect in each segment scored on a scale ranging from 0 (normal uptake) to 3 (no uptake). Total MIBG defect scores were generated by summing the scores for the nine segments in each patient. MIBG scintigraphic abnormalities were found in ten of the twelve patients. The six patients with the VVI pacemaker manifested MIBG scintigraphic abnormalities. These MIBG scintigraphic abnormalities were observed in all segments, particularly in the posterior segments. The mean total defect score of the VVI group was higher than that of the DDD group (14.8 +/- 9.8 vs 3.0 +/- 3.5, respectively p < 0.05). Therefore, we conclude that despite several limitations of the study, MIBG scintigraphic abnormalities occur in patients with implanted permanent pacemakers, and that such abnormalities are more prominent with the VVI than DDD pacemaker.
