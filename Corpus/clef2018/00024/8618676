A positron emission tomography study of primary orthostatic tremor. Primary orthostatic tremor (OT), a clinical syndrome in which a rapid (14 to 16 Hz), regular lower limb tremor causes unsteadiness on standing, may be associated with a postural upper limb tremor of similar frequency. We used H2 15O PET to analyze the abnormal pattern of cerebral activation associated with the postural upper limb tremor in four patients with primary OT. Patients had regional cerebral bloodflow (rCBF) measured during involuntary tremor while maintaining a posture with their outstretched right upper limb and again at rest. Tremor was associated with abnormal bilateral cerebellar and contralateral lentiform and thalamic activation. These findings were evident on group analysis of pooled PET data after transformation into standard stereotactic space and in single subjects when PET images were coregistered with structural MRI of the brain. At rest, cerebellar blood flow was significantly increased bilaterally in OT when compared with age- and sex-matched controls. We have previously demonstrated similar abnormal bilateral cerebellar activation in essential and writing tremors and conclude that abnormal bilateral overactivity of cerebellar connections is a common feature of tremulous disorders.
