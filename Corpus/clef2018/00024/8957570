Simultaneous observation of regional cerebral blood flow and event-related potential during performance of an auditory task. Reduced amplitude of the P300 component has been reported consistently in patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. It is unclear, however, how such patients' cognitive dysfunction is related to their P300 abnormality. Further basic knowledge regarding neural substrates for P300 generation is required for gaining an understanding of the pathological significance of the P300 amplitude reduction. To determine the brain structures involved in P300 generation, we observed the event-related potential and the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 10 normal subjects performing an oddball discrimination of pure tones. The rCBF value was assessed quantitatively with the aid of single photon emission computed tomography using technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime. During the task performance, significant activation was observed in the posterior superior temporal and inferior parietal regions of the right hemisphere. In addition, positive correlation of the task-related increase in rCBF with the simultaneously recorded P300 amplitude was observed in the right but not the left posterior superior temporal region. These findings indicate that activation of the right non-verbal auditory area might modulate P300 generation during pure-tone discrimination.
