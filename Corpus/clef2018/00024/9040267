Stress echocardiography using adenosine combined with nitroglycerin-dobutamine in the detection of viable myocardium in patients with previous myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to assess the value of adenosine (A) and the combination of nitroglycerin (N) with dobutamine (D) stress echocardiography (SE) in the identification of viable myocardium. The clinical and electrocardiographic (ECG) effects of both tests were also evaluated. Fifty-two coronary artery disease patients, aged 56.4 +/- 8 years, with left ventricular dysfunction due to a previous myocardial infarction (mean ejection fraction: 49 +/- 8%) were included in the study. Cardiac catheterization was performed in all patients before A (140 micrograms/kg/minute for five minutes) and the combination of N with D (5-10 micrograms/kg/minute) stress echocardiography. On the echocardiogram, the left ventricle was divided into 16 segments and wall motion was graded semiquantitatively from 1 (normal) to 4 (dyskinesia). The echocardiographic index was also estimated. A segment was considered viable during A infusion when resting asynergy showed deterioration of one grade or more. In contrast, segmental viability was considered to be present during the combination of N with D infusion when resting asynergy showed improvement of one grade or more. A thallium 201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with reinjection was performed as reference standard for the identification of viable myocardium. Stress echocardiography during infusion of A was associated with short-duration angina attacks in 3 (5.8%) patients and transient complete atrioventricular (AV) block in 1 (1.9%), whereas during the combination of N with D infusion, 6 (11.5%) patients experienced ventricular bigeminy lasting for a short period. ST segment elevation greater than 1 mm was recorded in those leads having a Q wave, in 19 (36.5%) patients. In 10 of these 19 (52.6%), viable myocardium was present in SPECT, as it was in 33 patients (63.5%) having no ST segment elevation (P = NS). Of a total of 832 segments that were graded during A-SE, 276 exhibited resting asynergy and the remaining 556 had normal motion and thickening at rest. The echocardiographic index during A infusion increased from 1.52 +/- 0.22 to 1.71 +/- 0.24 (P < 0.001), whereas during D and N infusion it decreased from 1.53 +/- 0.31 to 1.30 +/- 0.42 (P < 0.001). With SPECT considered as the gold standard for the identification of viable myocardium, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of A-SE in detecting viable myocardium were 54%, 86%, 65% and 80%, respectively. The respective values for the combination of nitroglycerin with D-SE were 91%, 89%, 78%, and 96%, respectively. Stress echocardiography during A, and the combination of N with D, constitute safe methods in the identification of viable myocardium. The detection of ST segment elevation in the ECG leads with a Q wave during the combined infusion of nitroglycerin and dobutamine is not related to the presence of viable myocardial tissue. The A-SE provide moderate diagnostic accuracy, while the combination of N with D during SE is much superior in detecting viable myocardium.
