A color spot test for the detection of Kryptofix 2.2.2 in [18F]FDG preparations. A color spot test is described that can confirm the absence of Kryptofix 2.2.2 in 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) in less than 5 min. Pretreated strips of plastic-backed silica gel 60 thin-layer chromatographic medium, saturated with iodoplatinate reagent, are over-spotted with separate droplets of final product [18F]FDG and Kryptofix standard solutions. A blue-black circular spot is clearly visible at Kryptofix concentrations as low as 2 micrograms/mL.
