Radiolabeled somatostatin analog scintigraphy in oncology and immune diseases: an overview. [111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-octreotide is a new radiopharmaceutical with a great potential for the visualization of somatostatin receptor-positive tumors, granulomas, and diseases in which activated leukocytes play a role. The overall sensitivity of [111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-octreotide scintigraphy to localize neuroendocrine tumors is high. In several neuroendocrine tumor types, inclusion of somatostatin receptor imaging in the localization or staging procedure may be very rewarding, either in terms of cost-effectiveness, patient management, or quality of life. In our opinion, this holds true for patients with carcinoids, gastrinomas, paragangliomas, small-cell lung carcinoma, and selected cases of patients with insulinomas. The value of [111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-octreotide scintigraphy in patients with other tumors, such as breast cancer, malignant lymphomas, or in patients with granulomatous diseases, has to be established.
