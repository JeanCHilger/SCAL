Fluorodeoxyglucose whole-body positron emission tomography in colorectal cancer patients studied in routine daily practice. To evaluate the routine clinical value of attenuation-corrected whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in colorectal cancer, a total of 59 patients who were referred for evaluation of suspected or proven colorectal cancers were studied.Positron emission tomography scans were recorded using a Siemens ECAT Exact 921/47.Median follow-up after the positron emission tomography study was 11 (mean, 12.3 range, 1-21) months. According to computed tomography, coloscopy, and ultrasound, we recorded eight apparently false-positive results. During later follow-up, however, three of those cases, which were negative with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, sonography, or laparoscopy, turned out to be true-positive instead. In 3 patients, a primary colorectal cancer was suspectedA whole-body positron emission tomography scan provides optimum conditions to locate metastatic lesions that might not be seen otherwise. There is a trend showing that positron emission tomography diagnostics as a consequence of early increased tumor markers is a highly sensitive combination, because computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were not as sensitive in early recurrences. Positron emission tomography, as performed in daily clinical practice, proved to be a powerful diagnostic tool in our subset of colorectal cancer patients.
