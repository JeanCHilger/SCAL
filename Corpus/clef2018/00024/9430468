Distinction between hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia and malignant liver lesions using technetium-99m-galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin. Distinction between hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and malignant liver lesions is essential because of the different therapy strategies, since FNH can be managed conservatively. The aim of this study was to describe the imaging pattern of FNH using the hepatocyte receptor ligand 99mTc-galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin 99mTc-NGA) and to assess the value of this receptor imaging agent in the differentiation of FNH from malignant liver lesions.Twelve consecutive patients with histologically confirmed FNH were investigated. The FNH-lesions were asymptomatic and incidentally found by ultrasonography. Nine patients with histologically verified hepatocellular carcinomas and three patients with liver metastases spread from gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas served as controls.All FNH lesions showed normal or even increased uptake of 99mTc-NGA. Whereas malignant liver lesion-to-normal liver ratios amounted to 0.4 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- s.d.), FNH lesion-to-normal liver ratios were 1.7 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- s.d.).The receptor imaging agent 99mTc-NGA with concurrent use of SPECT is useful in the differential diagnosis of FNH and malignant hepatic tumors.
