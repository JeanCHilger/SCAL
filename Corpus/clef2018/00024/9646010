Therapeutic drug monitoring of clozapine treatment. Therapeutic threshold value for serum clozapine concentrations. It has been suggested that the minimum effective serum clozapine concentration for an acceptable clinical response (threshold value) is about 400 micrograms/L. This article argues against the use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) as a tool to obtain clozapine concentrations of > or = 400 micrograms/L in the individual patient from the start of clozapine treatment. The following arguments are presented: (i) because of a great interindividual variability of the clozapine concentration to dose ratio (C/D) it can be calculated that extremely high daily doses (900 to 1800 mg/day) would be necessary in 15% of patients to obtain a clozapine concentration of 400 micrograms/L (ii) doses of 200 to 300 mg/day are commonly used in Central Europe. although about 80% of the patients can be expected to have clozapine concentration < 400 micrograms/L
