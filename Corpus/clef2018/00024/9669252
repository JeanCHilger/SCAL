T wave normalization in infarct-related electrocardiographic leads during exercise testing for detection of residual viability: comparison with positron emission tomography. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of exercise-induced T wave normalization (TWN) in infarct-related electrocardiographic leads (IRLs) for detection of residual viability in the infarct area.The meaning of exercise-induced TWN on IRLs is not yet well understood. Recent reports suggest that TWN during dobutamine echocardiography could indicate the presence of viable myocardium.We evaluated 40 consecutive patients with a recent acute myocardial infarction and negative T waves in at least two IRLs. All patients underwent exercise testing positron emission tomography (PET) with nitrogen-13 ammonia and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucoseTwenty-four patients showed exercise-induced TWN: 18 at a work load < or =50 W (group la) and 6 at a work load > or =75 W (group 1b) 16 patients did not show TWN (group 2). On the PET study, viability in the infarct area was present in 17 patients (94%) from group la, in only 1 (16%) from group 1b and in 4 (25%) from group 2 (p < 0.0001). The sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of exercise-induced TWN, in comparison with residual viability, were, respectively, 82%, 67%, 75% for TWN at every work load and 77%, 94%, 85% for TWN at a work load < or =50 W. Moreover, the sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of TWN at the low work load were higher for anterior infarctions (87% and 88%, respectively).Exercise-induced TWN on IRLs at low work loads is a sensitive and specific index for the presence of residual viability in the infarct area. Sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of this sign are higher for anterior infarctions.
