Neuroreceptor imaging: new developments in PET and SPECT imaging of neuroreceptor binding (including dopamine transporters, vesicle transporters and post synaptic receptor sites). Positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography have been used to measure receptor concentration and function through the use of a variety of radiotracers and data analysis techniques. Changes in presynaptic function and postsynaptic receptor concentration reflect both loss due to disease and compensatory responses.
