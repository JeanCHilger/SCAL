Preclinical development and current status of the fluorinated 2-nitroimidazole hypoxia probe N-(2-hydroxy-3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)-2-(2-nitro-1-imidazolyl) acetamide (SR 4554, CRC 94/17): a non-invasive diagnostic probe for the measurement of tumor hypoxia by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging, and by positron emission tomography. Hypoxia occurs to a variable extent in a vast majority of rodent and human solid tumors. It results from an inadequate and disorganized tumor vasculature, and hence an impaired oxygen delivery. A probe for the non-invasive detection of tumor hypoxia could find important utility in the selection of patients for therapy with bioreductive agents, anti-angiogenic/anti-vascular therapies and hypoxia-targeted gene therapy. In addition, tumor hypoxia has been shown to predict for treatment outcome following radio- or chemotherapy in human cancers, the underlying mechanism for which may involve hypoxia driving genetic instability and resulting tumor progression. Beyond oncology, utility can also be envisaged in stroke, ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, arthritis and other disorders. Design, validation, preclinical development and current status of a fluorinated 2-nitroimidazole, N-(2-hydroxy-3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)-2-(2-nitro-l-imidazolyl) acetamide (SR 4554, CRC 94/17), which has been rationally designed for the measurement of tumor hypoxia by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging (MRI), are reviewed. Application in positron emission tomography (PET) detection is also proposed. Design goals were: (i) a nitro group with appropriate redox potential for selective reduction and binding in hypoxic tumor cells (ii) hydrophilic/hydrogen bonding character in the side chain to limit nervous tissue penetration and prevent neurotoxicity
