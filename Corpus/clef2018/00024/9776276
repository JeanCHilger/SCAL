Significance of nonuniform attenuation correction in quantitative brain SPECT imaging. The purposes of this study were to develop a method for nonuniform attenuation correction of 123I emission brain images based on transmission imaging with a longer-lived isotope (i.e., 57Co) and to evaluate the relative improvement in quantitative SPECT images achieved with nonuniform attenuation correction.Emission and transmission SPECT scans were acquired on three different sets of studies: a heterogeneous brain phantom filled with 1231 to simulate the distribution of dopamine transporters labeled with 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-123I-iodophenyl)tropane (123I-beta-CIT) nine healthy human control subjects who underwent transmission scanning using two separate line sources (57Co and 123I)For the heterogeneous brain phantom, the uniform attenuation correction had errors of 2%-6.5% for regions corresponding to striatum and background, whereas nonuniform attenuation correction was within 1%. Analysis of 123I transmission images of the nine healthy human control subjects showed differences between uniform and nonuniform attenuation correction to be in the range of 6.4%-16.0% for brain regions of interest (ROIs). The human control subjects who received transmission scans only were used to generate a curvilinear function to convert 57Co attenuation values into those for 123I, based on a pixel-by-pixel comparison of two coregistered transmission images for each subject. These values were applied to the group of patients and healthy control subjects who received transmission 57Co scans and emission 123I scans after injection of 123I-beta-CIT. In comparison to nonuniform attenuation correction as the gold standard, uniform attenuation with the ellipse drawn around the transmission image caused an approximately 5% error, whereas placement of the ellipse around the emission image caused a 15% error.Nonuniform attenuation correction allowed a moderate improvement in the measurement of absolute activity in individual brain ROIs. When images were analyzed as target-to-background activity ratios, as is commonly performed with 123I-beta-CIT, these outcome measures showed only small differences when Parkinson's disease patients and healthy control subjects were compared using nonuniform, uniform or even no attenuation correction.
