Fatty acid imaging with 123I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-9-R,S-methylpentadecanoic acid in acute coronary syndrome. 123I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-9-R,S-methylpentadecanoic acid (9-MPA) has recently been developed as a tracer for myocardial fatty acid uptake. The aim of this study, which was performed as part of a phase III clinical trial of 9-MPA, was to test the usefulness of 9-MPA for the assessment of myocardial viability in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).Fifteen patients with ACS who had undergone direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were examined. Myocardial SPECT with 9-MPA and 99mTc-sestamibi and low-dose dobutamine echocardiography were performed within 2 wk after onset. The 9-MPA images were obtained 10 and 60 min after tracer administration, and sestamibi imaging was begun 60 min after the injection. The left ventricle was divided into 9 segments, and 9-MPA and sestamibi uptake were scored from 0 (normal) to 3 (no activity) in each segment. Lower uptake of 9-MPA than of sestamibi was defined as a mismatch. Myocardial segments showing improvement in wall motion during low-dose dobutamine infusion (5-10 microg/kg/ min) were considered viable.The 9-MPA images were of high quality for all patients. Myocardial uptake of 9-MPA was lower in ischemic myocardium than in nonischemic myocardium (58.2%+/-14.2% versus 91.9%+/-6.5%, P<0.0001). Clearance of 9-MPA from ischemic myocardium was slower than that from nonischemic myocardium (10.2%+/-11.7% versus 19.1%+/-5.9%, P<0.01). A mismatch was seen in 10 of 15 patients, and 18 of 20 (90%) mismatched segments were defined as viable by dobutamine echocardiography. Conversely, 18 of 20 (90%) matched segments did not show any improvement in function during dobutamine stimulation (P<0.0001). Uptake of 9-MPA in nonviable segments was lower than that in dysfunctional but viable segments (P<0.05), and 9-MPA clearance from nonviable segments was slower than that from viable segments (P<0.05).The imaging characteristics of 9-MPA for SPECT are excellent, allowing noninvasive assessment of myocardial fatty acid uptake. Myocardial imaging with 9-MPA may reveal impaired fatty acid uptake in dysfunctional but viable myocardium and thus provide useful information for clinical decision making in ACS.
