A system for continuous production and infusion of [15O]H2O for PET activation studies. A system for continuous production and infusion of [15O]H2O has been designed for Positron Emission Tomography brain activation studies. The infusion system consists of two Horizon Nxt infusion pumps, a four-port-two-position valve and a sterile 50 ml vial. The line and the back check valve between the furnace and the reservoir were heated in order to reduce vapor condensation in the line. The variation of the production of [15O]H2O was < 1%. The activity delivered as measured by scanner counts varied < 2% during the steady state period. The system has been demonstrated to be capable of delivering activity over a wide range of conditions.
