Cognitive impairment and the brain dopaminergic system in Parkinson disease: [18F]fluorodopa positron emission tomographic study. To investigate the role of the brain dopaminergic system in cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).We studied 28 patients with PD and 16 age-matched healthy control subjects using [18F] fluorodopa (fluorodopa F 18) positron emission tomography. Patients with PD showed a variable degree of cognitive impairment, which was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination and detailed neuropsychologic assessment, including tests sensitive for frontal lobe function.[18F] Fluorodopa uptake was reduced in the putamen (to 36% of the control mean P<.001), the caudate nucleus (to 61% of the control meanReduced [18F]fluorodopa uptake in PD in the caudate nucleus (and frontal cortex) is related to impairment in neuropsychologic tests measuring verbal fluency, working memory, and attentional functioning reflecting frontal lobe function. This indicates that dysfunction of the dopamine system has an impact on the cognitive impairment of patients with PD. However, our results do not exclude the possibility of more generalized cognitive impairment in PD, the pathophysiology of which is probably different and more generalized.
