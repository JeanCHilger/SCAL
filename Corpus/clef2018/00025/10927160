MR contrast media for myocardial viability, microvascular integrity and perfusion. Cardiovascular imaging requires an appreciation of rapidly evolving MR imaging sequences as well as careful utilization of intravascular, extracellular and intracellular MR contrast media. At the present time, clinical studies are restricted to the use of extracellular MR contrast media. MR imaging has the potential to noninvasively measure multiple parameters of the cardiovascular system in a single imaging session. Recent advances in fast and ultrafast MR imaging have considerably enhanced the capability of this technique, beyond the assessment of left ventricular wall motion and morphology into visualization of the coronary arteries and measurement of blood flow. During the course of the last several years, multiple strategies for imaging viable myocardium have been developed and validated using MR contrast media. Contrast enhanced dynamic MR imaging provides information regarding microvascular integrity and perfusion. Because these information can be provided noninvasively by MR imaging, repeated measurements can be performed in longitudinal studies to monitor the progression or regression of myocardial injury. Similar studies are needed to examine the effects of newly developed cardioprotective therapeutics. Development of suitable intravascular MR contrast medium may be essential for visualization of the coronary arteries and interventional therapies. MR imaging may emerge as one-stop-shop for evaluating the heart and coronary system. This capability will make MR imaging cost-effective in the first decade of this millennium.
