Regional cerebral blood flow distributions in normal volunteers: dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI compared with 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT. Relative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) at rest was measured in 44 volunteers using both dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI and (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT on the same day.In MRI, a Gd-DTPA-BMA contrast agent bolus (0.3 mmol/kg body wt) was monitored with a simultaneous dual FLASH pulse sequence (time resolution 1.5 s). MRI-based rCBF images were calculated by singular value decomposition-based deconvolution of the measured tissue concentration-time curve with an arterial input function from a small artery within the imaging slice. In the SPECT investigation, 900 MBq of (99m)Tc-HMPAO was injected intravenously. Relative rCBF in gray matter in the thalamus and in frontal white matter was determined.The ratio of relative rCBF in gray matter to relative rCBF in white matter was 2.21 +/- 0.57 using MRI and 2.24 +/- 0.54 using SPECT (mean +/- SD).Relative rCBF maps from DSC MRI and (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT showed good agreement, and the MRI-based rCBF ratio correlated with the corresponding SPECT-based ratio (r = 0.79, p < 0.0000006).
