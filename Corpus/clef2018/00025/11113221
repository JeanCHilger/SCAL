Subtraction peri-ictal SPECT is predictive of extratemporal epilepsy surgery outcome. To determine whether localization of extratemporal epilepsy with subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered with MRI (SISCOM) is predictive of outcome after resective epilepsy surgery, whether SISCOM images provide prognostically important information compared with standard tests, and whether blood flow change on SISCOM images is useful in determining site and extent of excision required.The value of SISCOM in predicting surgical outcome for extratemporal epilepsy is unknown, especially if MRI findings are nonlocalizing.SISCOM images in 36 consecutive patients were classified by blinded reviewers as "localizing and concordant with site of surgery," "localizing but nonconcordant with site of surgery," or "nonlocalizing." SISCOM images were coregistered with postoperative MRI, and reviewers visually determined whether cerebral cortex underlying the SISCOM focus had been completely resected, partially resected, or not resected.Twenty-four patients (66.7%) had localizing SISCOM, including 13 (76.5%) of those without a focal MRI lesion. Eleven of 19 patients (57.9%) with localizing SISCOM concordant with the surgical site, compared with 3 of 17 (17.6%) with nonlocalizing or nonconcordant SISCOM, had an excellent outcome (p < 0.05). With logistic regression analysis, SISCOM findings were predictive of postsurgical outcome, independently of MRI or scalp ictal EEG findings (p < 0.05). The extent of resection of the cortical region of the SISCOM focus was significantly associated with the rate of excellent outcome (100% with complete resection, 60% with partial resection, and 20% with nonresection, p < 0.05).SISCOM images may be useful in guiding the location and extent of resection in extratemporal epilepsy surgery.
