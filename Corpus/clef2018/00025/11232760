Myocardial dysfunction and adrenergic innervation in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. In this study we assess the mechanisms of exercise-induced left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in asymptomatic patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) without coronary artery disease. Fourteen patients and 10 volunteers were enrolled. LV volume, LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and end-systolic wall stress were calculated by two-dimensional echocardiography at rest and during isometric exercise. Myocardial iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy was performed to assess adrenergic cardiac innervation. Diabetic subjects were classified into group A (n=7), with an abnormal LVEF response to handgrip (42 +/- 7%), and group B (n=7), with a normal response (72 +/- 8%). Baseline LVEF was normal in both group A and B patients. In group A patients, the LV circumferential wall stress-LVEF relation showed an impairment in LVEF disproportionate to the level of LV after load. No significant changes in LVEF occurred during dobutamine, whereas post-extrasystolic potentiation (PESP) significantly increased LVEF (60 +/- 6% vs 74 +/- 6%,p < 0.001) PESP at peak handgrip normalized the abnormal LVEF (42 +/- 7% vs 72 +/- 5%, p < 0.001)
