Interpreting PET and fMRI measures of functional neural activity: the effects of synaptic inhibition on cortical activation in human imaging studies. Human brain imaging methods such as postiron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging have recently achieved widespread use in the study of both normal cognitive processes and neurological disorders. While many of these studies have begun to yield important insights into human brain function, the relationship between these measurements and the underlying neuronal activity is still not well understood. One open question is how neuronal inhibition is reflected in these imaging results. In this paper, we describe how large-scale modeling can be used to address this question. Specifically, we identify three factors that may play a role in how inhibition affects imaging results: (1) local connectivity (2) context
