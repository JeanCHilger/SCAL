Multiple supratemporal sources of magnetic and electric auditory evoked middle latency components in humans. The supratemporal sources of the earliest auditory cortical responses (20-80 ms) were identified using simultaneously recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data. Both hemispheres of six subjects were recorded two or three times in different sessions in response to 8000 right-ear 1 kHz pure tones stimuli. Four components were identified: Pa (28 ms), Nb (40 ms), and two subcomponents of the Pb complex, termed Pb1 (52 ms) and Pb2 (74 ms). Based on MEG data, the corresponding sources were localized on the anatomy using individual realistic head models: Pa in the medial portion of Heschl's gyri (H1/H2) Nb/Pb1 in the lateral aspect of the supratemporal gyrus (STG)
