Artificial neural network Radon inversion for image reconstruction. Image reconstruction techniques are essential to computer tomography. Algorithms such as filtered backprojection (FBP) or algebraic techniques are most frequently used. This paper presents an attempt to apply a feed-forward back-propagation supervised artificial neural network (BPN) to tomographic image reconstruction, specifically to positron emission tomography (PET). The main result is that the network trained with Gaussian test images proved to be successful at reconstructing images from projection sets derived from arbitrary objects. Additional results relate to the design of the network and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussians in the training sets. First, the optimal number of nodes in the middle layer is about an order of magnitude less than the number of input or output nodes. Second, the number of iterations required to achieve a required training set tolerance appeared to decrease exponentially with the number of nodes in the middle layer. Finally, for training sets containing Gaussians of a single width, the optimal accuracy of reconstructing the control set is obtained with a FWHM of three pixels. Intended to explore feasibility, the BPN presented in the following does not provide reconstruction accuracy adequate for immediate application to PET. However, the trained network does reconstruct general images independent of the data with which it was trained. Proposed in the concluding section are several possible refinements that should permit the development of a network capable of fast reconstruction of three-dimensional images from the discrete, noisy projection data characteristic of PET.
