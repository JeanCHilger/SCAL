Optimal 3-dimensional method for right and left ventricular fourier phase analysis in electrocardiography-gated blood-pool SPECT. To overcome some of the limitations imposed by planar imaging, we aimed to optimize the use of first harmonic Fourier phase analysis (FPA) in electrocardiography-gated blood-pool single photon emission computed tomography (GBPS) by comparing different quantitative, 3-dimensional methods.Three groups of patients who underwent GBPS were evaluated: group 1, 8 patients with no heart disease group 2, 10 patients with left ventricular diseaseThe hybrid or cylindrical method for the left ventricle and the spherical method for the right ventricle with fixed thresholding are the optimal methods for FPA in GBPS.
