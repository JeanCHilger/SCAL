Breast cancer imaging: the future. Imaging technology has changed rapidly over the last four decades. This is especially true in the area of breast cancer. While anatomic delineation of breast tumors was considered a crowning achievement of the late 20th century, most recently the major focus has shifted toward physiologic and even molecular level tumor detection. The goals of imaging are threefold: (1) the earliest possible detection of primary breast tumors, (2) correlation of imaging results with other clinical parameters to assess disease biology, and (3) accurate staging and follow-up after treatment. Among the newer imaging technologies to be discussed here are digital mammography, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), power Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), isotope imaging: methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI) and positron emission tomography (PET).
