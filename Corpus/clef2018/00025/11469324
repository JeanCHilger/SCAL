Food aroma partition between packaging materials and fatty food simulants. By means of thermal desorption experiments, the partition equilibrium (partition coefficient, K) was analysed for six food aroma components (d-limonene, n-decane, ethyl caproate, phenylethanol, n-hexanol and hexanal) between three sealable pollymer films suitable for direct food contact (ultra-low density polyethylene, ULDPE ionomer, ION
