Age-related changes of dopamine D1-like and D2-like receptor binding in the F344/N rat striatum revealed by positron emission tomography and in vitro receptor autoradiography. To clarify age-related changes in dopamine D1-like and D2-like receptor binding in the striatum, positron emission tomography (PET) and in vitro receptor autoradiography (in vitro ARG) were performed using F344/N rats of various ages (6, 12, 18, and 24 months). In the PET study, [11C]SCH23390 and [11C]raclopride were used to image dopamine D1-like receptors and dopamine D2-like receptors, respectively, while [3H]SCH23390 and [3H]raclopride were used for the in vitro ARG study. With PET, we calculated the binding potential (= k3/k4, Bmax/Kd) of [11C]SCH23390 and [11C]raclopride in the striatum according to the curve fitting (CF) and the Logan plot (LP) methods. The binding potential of [11C]SCH23390 in the striatum demonstrated significant decrease as a function of age (max. decrease -26%) by the LP method, while this was not observed in the data analyzed by the CF method. In contrast, the binding potential of [11C]raclopride in the striatum decreased significantly with age by both the CF (max. decrease -28%) and the LP (max. decrease -36%) methods. However, no significant difference by either method was observed in rats between 6 and 12 months old using either ligand. In the in vitro ARG study, the specific binding (fmol/mg tissue) of [3H]SCH23390 and [3H]raclopride in the striatum were determined. Both [3H]SCH23390 and [3H]raclopride binding declined considerably with age as noted by comparing 12, 18, and 24-month-old rats against those 6 months old (max. decrease -29% and -31%, respectively). The substantial difference in binding shown in 12-month-olds in comparison with 6-month-olds using either ligand with in vitro ARG was in contrast with the PET results. These distinctions between the PET and the in vitro ARG studies may be attributed to the receptor microenvironment created under these experimental conditions. The results indicate that PET with LP analysis is useful in obtaining age-related changes of D1-like and D2-like receptor binding in the striatum of living rats.
