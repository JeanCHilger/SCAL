Residues of ochratoxin A in pet foods, canine and feline kidneys. The occurrence of ochratoxin A (OTA) in canned (26 samples) as well as dry pet foods (17 samples) for cats and dogs was investigated. In addition, 26 feline kidney samples with or without kidney alterations were surveyed for OTA-residues. The separation and detection of OTA was carried out by an isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography system based on reversed phase with fluorescence detection. After homogenization and extraction steps, immuno-affinity columns were applied for sample clean up. OTA could be detected in 47% (n=40) of the pet food samples. Those found positive contained generally low amounts of OTA (0.1-0.8 microg/kg original substance). Higher levels were only detected in two pet food samples (3.2 and 13.1 microg/kg toxin, respectively). Low concentrations of ochratoxin A could also be found iIn tissue of cat kidneys, with 16 of the analysed kidneys (n=26) being positive. The concentration levels were between 0.35 and 1.5 microg/kg OTA in tissue. No relation between pathological findings and ochratoxin levels in feline kidneys could be assessed.
