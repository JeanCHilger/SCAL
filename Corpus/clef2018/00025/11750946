A computational model of oxygen transport from red blood cells to mitochondria. A computational model of oxygen transport from red blood cells to mitochondria with subsequent reaction to water is presented. This computational model consists of a five region convection-diffusion-reaction mathematical model which is solved using a standard numerical time-split method. The unique feature of this mathematical model is the treatment of the red blood cells and the plasma as two separate flows. The numerical method is second order accurate overall. This computational model is useful for analyzing residue data from positron emission tomography or data from multiple indicator dilution curves.
