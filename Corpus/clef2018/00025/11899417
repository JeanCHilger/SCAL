Detection of occult disease in breast cancer using fluorodeoxyglucose camera-based positron emission tomography. An isolated increase of blood tumor marker CA 15.3 in breast cancer is considered a sensitive indicator for occult metastatic disease but by itself is not sufficient for initiating therapeutic intervention. We investigated the potential of camera-based positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to detect clinically occult recurrences in 132 female patients (age, 35-69 years) treated for breast cancer, all presenting with an isolated increase in blood tumor marker CA 15.3 without any other evidence of metastatic disease. FDG results were correlated to pathology results or to a sequentially guided conventional imaging method. One hundred nineteen patients were eligible for correlations. Positive FDG scans were obtained for 106 patients, including 89 with a single lesion and 17 with 2 or more lesion. There were 92 true-positive and 14 false-positive cases, 10 of which became true positive within 1 year. Among the 13 negative cases, 7 were false negative and 6 were true negative. Camera-based PET using FDG has successfully identified clinically occult disease with an overall sensitivity of 93.6% and a positive predictive value of 96.2%. The smallest detected size was 6 mm for a lymph node metastasis (tumor to nontumor ratio, 4:2). FDG camera-based PET localized tumors in 85.7% of cases suspected for clinically occult metastatic disease on the basis of a significant increase in blood tumor marker. A positive FDG scan associated with an elevated CA 15.3 level is most consistent with metastatic relapse of breast cancer.
