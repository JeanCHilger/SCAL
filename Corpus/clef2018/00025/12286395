Population education in the USA. By the late 1960s, universities and private organizations began to develop population education programs and courses in the wake of the warning of demographer Philip M. Hauser about the lack of demographic information in the school curriculum.  In the early 1970s, the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare provided limited funding for teacher training workshops and classroom materials.  Baltimore City's district wide population education program proved successful in 1975 after 10 years of work, population education materials were adopted in the official social studies curriculum, and this model was accepted later by other school systems.  In 1979 not quite 15 US colleges and universities taught population issues at graduate-level training or by offering workshops and materials.  By the mid-1970s, universities and private organizations were conducting conferences and workshops for secondary school teachers.  In the 1970s, these included the Center for Information on America.  Environment-Population Education Services, Planned Parenthood, Population Institute, Population Reference Bureau (PRB), the World Bank, and Zero Population Growth (ZPG).  In the 1970s and early 1980s various other organizations contributed to population educations, e.g. the University of Cincinnati by organizing institutes, the National Catholic Educational Association representing 8200 schools ZPG with teacher-training workshops, and PRB with meaningful materials for students and teachers.  The state of population education in 1992 means that PRB staff lead 15-30 workshops each year and provide workshop materials for teachers.  ZPG emphasizes hands-on learning.  Pet Net, a network of volunteer teacher trainers leading workshops, and ZPG staff conducted 88 workshops in 1991.
