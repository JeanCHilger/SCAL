Post-mortem brain tissue cultures from elderly control subjects and patients with a neurodegenerative disease. Aging may be viewed as a progressive loss of normal biological function. Due to complex genetic and environmental interactions, the sequence of functional impairment shows a high degree of individual variability. In humans life style and health care have an additional influence on the aging process. To study aging and age-related disorders of the human nervous system, brain tissue that has undergone aging and pathological alterations can provide valuable study material. Recently, we have shown that adult human postmortem brain tissue can be cultured and experimentally manipulated. This approach permits the study of cellular aspects of human neuronal aging and neurodegenerative processes and complements those existing research methods such as in vivo imaging (MRI, PET, etc.) and fixed or frozen postmortem brain tissue examination.
