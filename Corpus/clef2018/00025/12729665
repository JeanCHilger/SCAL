Facile synthesis of [11C]edrophonium and its analogues as new potential PET imaging agents for heart acetylcholinesterase. [11C]Edrophonium and its analogues have been synthesized for evaluation as new potential positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents for heart acetylcholinesterase. The tracers were prepared by N-[11C]methylation of precursors using [11C]methyl triflate and isolated by solid-phase extraction (SPE) purification procedure in 50-65% radiochemical yields.
