Multistate outbreak of monkeypox--Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, 2003. CDC has received reports of patients with a febrile rash illness who had close contact with pet prairie dogs and other animals. The Marshfield Clinic, Marshfield, Wisconsin, identified a virus morphologically consistent with a poxvirus by electron microscopy of skin lesion tissue from a patient, lymph node tissue from the patient's pet prairie dog, and isolates of virus from culture of these tissues. Additional laboratory testing at CDC indicated that the causative agent is a monkeypox virus, a member of the orthopoxvirus group. This report summarizes initial descriptive epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data, interim infection-control guidance, and new animal import regulations.
