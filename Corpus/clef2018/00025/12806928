Investigation on zoonoses among veterinary technicians. We conducted a survey on how much veterinary clinics staff, mostly veterinary technicians, know about zoonosis and how extensively they inform pet owners of ways to prevent zoonosis. The number of people who took part in the survey was 1,057. The ratio of people who said their knowledge on zoonosis is "neither sufficient nor insufficient" was 53.8%, which is larger than the ratio of people who replied "sufficient" or "insufficient." The percentage of those who said their way of giving information on zoonosis to pet owners is "neither sufficient nor insufficient" was 52.4%. The ratios of people who knew about Spirometra erinacei, Dipylidium canium or Giardia lamblia were 64.7%, 73.6% and 57.6%, respectively. The longer they worked, the more they knew about Cryptosporidium spp. (20.1%), Hymenolepis nana (31.8%), Echinococcus spp. (45.7%), Ancylostoma spp. (73.3%), Dirofilaria immitis (80.5%), Toxoplasma gondii (82.4%), and Toxocara canis (86.5%). It seems that systematic continuing education and opportunities to acquire new knowledge are not sufficient for those working in veterinary clinics, and this needs to be corrected.
