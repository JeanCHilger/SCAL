Imaging methods for evaluating brain function in man. Imaging of brain function and neurotransmission is an important bridge between basic and clinical research. Regional cerebral energy metabolism and blood flow are normally coupled to regional cerebral function. Positron tomography (PET) studies of cerebral glucose metabolism and blood flow, single photon tomography (SPECT) and MRI studies of cerebral perfusion, have been used to image cerebral development and aging in man. The sensitivity, temporal resolution, spatial resolution and lack of radiation have led to the widespread utilization of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) and MRI perfusion techniques. PET and SPECT methods for studying cerebral neurotransmission include studies of dopaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, opiate and GABAergic neurotransmission in man. Studies of cerebral neurotransmission in man have helped to delineate the mechanisms of action of antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs, the diagnosis and progression of Parkinson's disease, and to evaluate neuroprotective drugs. The strengths, limitations, and application of these modalities are reviewed. The application of these methods to cerebral development and aging are briefly discussed.
