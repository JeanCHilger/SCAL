Regional distribution of human cerebral vascular mean transit time measured by positron emission tomography. Cerebral vascular mean transit time (MTT) characterizes the cerebral circulation. MTT has been measured in humans by carotid angiography, x-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). However, regional distribution of MTT has not been investigated in detail. Thus, we investigated regional distribution of normal human MTT. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were measured by PET with H(2)(15)O and (11)CO, respectively, in each of 10 normal subjects. MTT was calculated as MTT = CBV/CBF. MTT for cerebral cortical regions was 3.2 to 4.4 s. These values were in accord with MTT measured by carotid angiography, CT, and MRI. Considered regionally, MTT was longest in the temporooccipital cortex, and shorter in the cerebellum, thalamus, and putamen, than in all other regions. These regional differences in MTT that are inversely proportional to cerebral perfusion pressure might relate to regional differences in cerebral vascular tone. Simulation studies showed that errors in CBF and thus MTT caused by regional differences in regional tracer appearance time, distribution volume, and gray-white matter mixing were negligible.
