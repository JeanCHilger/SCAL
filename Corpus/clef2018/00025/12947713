Comparison of the radioiodine thyroid uptake of diagnostic dose and therapeutic dose in patients with hyperthyroidism. To compare early kinetics of diagnostic dose 131I with that of therapeutic dose.Thyroid Uptake Ratio (TUO) measurements of diagnose method on SPECT in 108 patients after oral administration 131I.The TUO of diagnostic dose was similar to that of therapeutic dose at 24 hours after the patients had take 131I (P > 0.05).Radioiodine thyroid uptake of diagnostic dose is consistent with that of therapeutic dose at 24 hours after oral administration of 131I.
