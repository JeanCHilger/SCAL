Combined transmission and (99m)Tc-sestamibi emission tomography for localization of mediastinal parathyroid glands. Although parathyroid scintigraphy using (99m) Tc-sestamibi is considered the best preoperative localization method for hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue it lacks the anatomical details required for successful, minimal invasive surgery of ectopic parathyroid lesions. This study presents the role of combined SPECT/X-ray-CT imaging in a single device for localization of mediastinal parathyroid glands.(99m) Tc-sestamibi SPECT/X-ray-CT was performed by gamma camera-mounted anatomical X-ray tomography (GMAXT GE Medical systems, Millenium VG with Hawkeye) in four patients with ectopic parathyroid glands (two patients with primary, two with persistent secondary hyperparathyroidism). The device contains an X-ray tube and a set of detectors that rotate around the patient combined with a gamma camera. For comparison with GMAXT addition-ally high resolution computed tomography images of the neck and mediastinum were performed.Correct preoperative localization was achieved. The parathyroid glands were located in the anterior mediastinum. High resolution computed tomography could not provide further details. Three patients were operated by a minimal invasive open and one patient by a transsternal approach because of concomitant aortic valve replacement.(99m)Tc-sestamibi/X-ray-CT fusion imaging in a single device can accurately localise ectopic or supernumerary mediastinal parathyroid tumours in primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Morbidity,radiation exposure, time, and costs are reduced by avoiding multiple diagnostic examinations and minimal invasive parathyroid surgery becomes possible.
