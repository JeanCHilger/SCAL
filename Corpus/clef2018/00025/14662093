An overview of contemporary nuclear cardiology. Myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a widely utilized noninvasive imaging modality for the diagnosis, prognosis, and risk stratification of coronary artery disease. It is clearly superior to the traditional planar technique in terms of imaging contrast and consequent diagnostic and prognostic yield. The strength of SPECT images is largely derived from the three-dimensional, volumetric nature of its image. Thus, this modality permits three-dimensional assessment and quantitation of the perfused myocardium and functional assessment through electrocardiographic gating of the perfusion images.
