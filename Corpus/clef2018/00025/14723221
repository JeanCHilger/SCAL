Information technology at the Department of Nuclear Medicine. The Department of Nuclear Medicine because of its scope does much more work with computers, data and communication technologies than other departments in the hospital. Finding an efficient and user-friendly way of collecting and handling data, presenting them to the rest of the hospital and storing them in archives is one of the important tasks currently being addressed. This article concentrates on a discussion of the features of data flow between the department and the hospital and the organization of data at the department. A possible solution of an information system dealing with text data and images is presented on the example of the Department of Nuclear Medicine-PET Centre located in the Na Homocle Hospital in Prague.
