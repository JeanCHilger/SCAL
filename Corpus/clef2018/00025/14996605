Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of myocardial perfusion and viability in congenital and acquired pediatric heart disease. This study examined the feasibility and potential clinical utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of myocardial perfusion (first-pass contrast enhancement) and viability (myocardial delayed enhancement) in 30 patients with congenital and acquired pediatric heart disease. Good agreement was found between MRI evaluation of myocardial perfusion and viability and analysis of segmental wall motion as well as coronary angiography (n = 10) and single photon emission computed tomography (n = 6).
