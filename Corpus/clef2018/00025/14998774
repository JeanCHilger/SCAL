In vivo monitoring of cellular transplants by magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. Cellular loss is a common pathological observation in many disease conditions. Recent evidence that these cells can be replaced has generated huge excitement over possible clinical applications. The use of stem or progenitor cells, which can differentiate into site-appropriate phenotypes required to "repair" the damaged tissue, has already demonstrated potential in animal models, but many aspects of this novel treatment strategy require further elucidation. Most importantly, the monitoring of the safety of cellular transplants in patients remains a challenge. Traditional histological methods do not address the dynamic nature of transplant-induced recovery and highlight the necessity of in vivo imaging to probe the survival, migration and functional consequences of transplanted cells. This paper reviews how non-invasive imaging technology can be used to serially assess intact living organisms in order to visualise and monitor cellular transplants.
