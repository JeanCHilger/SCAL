Positron-emission tomography for head and neck cancer. Positron-emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging technology that has the potential to improve the staging and detection of tumor compared to more conventional morphologic imaging techniques. It is a noninvasive technique that can expose molecular processes in cells and biological characteristics of tumors. The use of PET for staging and early detection of recurrent or residual disease may allow additional intervention with more aggressive treatments that could improve outcomes for individual patients. Optimal scanning is very dependent on the technique of image acquisition and available technology. The most promising technological development is combination CT PET scanners that will allow exact anatomical correlation with areas of increased tracer uptake. New tracers may allow quantification of cellular processes such as apoptosis or hypoxia as well as identification of tumors that may respond to certain targeted therapies. This may enable tailoring treatment to molecular characteristics and improved outcomes for patients. This review summarizes the available literature for PET in patients with head and neck cancer.
