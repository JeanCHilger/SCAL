Practice and future aspects of nuclear cardiology. The field of nuclear cardiology has demonstrated sustained growth in recent years owing to its increasingly recognized value for clinical applications and patient management. Computer advances in this field have allowed the technology of ECG-gated SPECT to become a routine part of nuclear cardiology. In our laboratory, myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function during stress (bicycle exercise or dobutamine infusion) were analyzed in a single examination by means of gated SPECT. This procedure has the potential to provide comprehensive information with which to evaluate patients with ischemic heart disease. 123I-BMIPP is a branched-chain free fatty acid, and its distribution could provide useful information about metabolic function in patients with ischemic heart disease (including minor infarction). The solid-state gamma camera 2020 tc Imager is now commercially available and has been clinically applied. The lightweight and compact design of the camera allows mobility of the unit between departments and floors. This technique would be useful for assessing left ventricular function under emergency conditions. In this paper, the techniques of examinations are described, and potential assessments are addressed. We look forward to further advances in nuclear cardiology for the accurate diagnosis and management of patients with various cardiac diseases.
