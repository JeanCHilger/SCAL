Positron emission tomography in orthopedics. Musculoskeletal infections are often a diagnostic dilemma as most of the currently available diagnostic modalities lack the specificity needed to make an accurate diagnosis of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has shown great accuracy in this capacity. This paper reviews the history of PET scanning, its associated physiology, and evidence supporting its use in the diagnosis of musculoskeletal infection.
