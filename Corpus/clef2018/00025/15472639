Incremental prognostic value of left ventricular function by myocardial ECG-gated FDG PET imaging in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The purpose of this study was to determine the independent value of left ventricular (LV) functional parameters derived from gated fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) to predict prognosis in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing myocardial viability assessment.We studied 90 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease and low LV ejection fraction (26% +/- 7%) undergoing gated FDG PET to assess myocardial viability for potential revascularization. The primary endpoint for this analysis was the occurrence of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or worsening heart failure (HF) to New York Heart Association class IV. During follow-up (22 +/- 14 months), 21 patients had an event (17 died, 4 had myocardial infarctions, and 4 had worsening HF). On Cox regression analysis, the event-free survival rate at 2 years was lower for patients with an end-diastolic volume (EDV) of 260 mL or greater (relative risk, 2.7 P = .014), end-systolic volume (ESV) of 200 mL or greater (relative risk, 2.5LV functional parameters determined by gated FDG PET have incremental prognostic value over viability information in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Our data suggest that patients with residual viability and advanced cardiac remodeling are at high clinical risk. In these patients the apparent survival benefit of revascularization may not be associated with a measurable improvement in HF symptoms.
