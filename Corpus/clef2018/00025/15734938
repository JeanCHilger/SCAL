Normal FDG distribution patterns in the head and neck: PET/CT evaluation. To retrospectively evaluate the distribution of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the head and neck region with combined positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with no known abnormality in this region.The institutional review board allowed a retrospective review of PET/CT images obtained in 78 patients with non-head and neck cancer and waived the requirement for informed consent. The accumulation of FDG in 11 normal head and neck structures was visually and quantitatively assessed retrospectively. Positive rate percentage (PRP) was defined as the sum of the percentages of patients with grade 2 and grade 3 tracer uptake intensity. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated for quantitative analysis. Mean SUVs were compared between the male and female patients by using the unpaired t test, and the correlation between FDG uptake and patient age was assessed by using the Pearson correlation coefficient test.Intense tracer uptake was usually seen in the palatine tonsils (PRP, 98% mean SUV, 3.48), soft palate (PRP, 96%Intense FDG uptake was usually observed in the palatine tonsils, lingual tonsils, and soft palate, whereas uptake in the major salivary glands was variable.
