Tl-201 washout rate in remote normal regions in patients with prior myocardial infarction and left ventricular remodeling. Myocardial characteristics of remote normal regions in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and left ventricular (LV) remodeling have not been fully elucidated. Thus, we investigated this issue from the viewpoint of myocardial Tl-201 dynamics.In 14 patients with prior anterior MI, 10 with inferior MI, and 14 age-matched patients with atypical chest pain served as controls exercise stress Tl-201 SPECT and cardiac catheterization were performed. Tl-201 washout rate was calculated for 8 myocardial segments, and LV end-diastolic volume index was obtained as a parameter of LV remodeling. LV end-diastolic volume index was greater in anterior MI patients than in control patientsReduced Tl-201 washout rates in remote normal regions are found in patients with anterior MI and LV remodeling. Subclinical myocardial ischemia during exercise in remote normal regions exists and may be related to the pathologic condition of such LV walls.
