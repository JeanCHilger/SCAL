Evaluation of intraperitoneal pressure and the effect of different osmotic agents on intraperitoneal pressure in children. To establish intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) in a relatively large pediatric study group and to study the effects of a 3.86% glucose solution and a 7.5% icodextrin solution on IPP during a 4-hour dwell.IPP was measured with the patient in a supine position. The intraperitoneal volume (IPV) was 1200 mL/m2 with a 1.36% glucose solution. The influence of dialysis solutions was obtained by performing two 4-hour peritoneal equilibration tests (PETs) with 3.86% glucose and 7.5% icodextrin as test solution, using an IPV of 1200 mL/m2 and dextran 70 as volume marker. IPP was measured at two consecutive time points (t = 0 and t = 240 minutes). Transcapillary ultrafiltration, net ultrafiltration, and marker clearance were calculated.IPP was established in 30 patients with median age of 4.5 years (range 1.0 - 14.9 years). Influence of dialysis solutions on IPP was studied in 9 children with median age of 4.2 years (range 1.7 - 10.9 years) and median treatment period of 12 months (range 5.6 - 122.3 months).Mean IPP was 12.0 +/- 6.5 cm H2O. Significant relations were found between the change in IPP and transcapillary ultrafiltration and body surface area during the PET with 3.86% glucose. No relations were seen during the PET with icodextrin.IPP was established in a large pediatric study group and was similar to previously published values of IPP in a small number of patients. Differences in fluid kinetics have different effects on the change in IPP during a 4-hour dwell period.
