Naming of newly learned objects: a PET activation study. The present study tracked the naming-related brain activity by positron emission tomography (PET) when successfully learned unfamiliar objects were named. Ten Finnish-speaking subjects participated in the study. Prior to the PET scan, each subject underwent a 4-day long training period in which 40 names of rare unfamiliar objects were taught. The stimulus categories were as follows: unfamiliar but real objects for which both the name and the definition were given during training, only the name was given, no information was given. In addition, familiar objects and visual noise patterns were used. The unfamiliar items mainly represented ancient domestic tools unknown to modern-day people. As semantic support did not affect the PET results, all trained items were pooled together. The trained objects vs. familiar objects contrast revealed rCBF increases in the left inferior frontal cortex (Broca's area), the left anterior temporal area, and the cerebellum. Likewise, the trained objects vs. unfamiliar objects (for which no information was given) contrast revealed more extensive left frontal (roughly Broca's area) and cerebellar rCBF increases, while anterior temporal activation was bilateral. Familiar objects, contrasted with both visual noise patterns and a rest condition, elicited activation increases in expected areas, i.e., bilateral occipital regions and the fusiform gyrus. Our results indicate that the naming of newly learned objects recruits more extensive brain areas than the naming of familiar items, namely a network that includes left-dominant frontotemporal areas and cerebellum. Its activity is tentatively related to enhanced lexical-semantic and lexical-phonological retrieval, as well as associative memory processes.
