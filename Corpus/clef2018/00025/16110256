An evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer. Technology has revolutionized the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic malignancy. Previously, staging of disease was accomplished by exploratory laparotomy. Now, however, tumor size, lymph node and vascular involvement and the presence of metastases can be reliably assessed prior to operation using a widely available series of diagnostic tests, facilitating a preoperative assessment of tumor resectability. Appropriate use of these tests often spares patients with unresectable disease the need for operative intervention. As part of our staging algorithm we routinely employ a combination of clinical suspicion, a high-resolution helical CT scan and a serum CA 19-9 level. Endoscopic ultrasonography is useful in the patient in whom CT findings are equivocal, or in whom a tissue diagnosis is desired. Laparoscopy is reserved for patients with suspected advanced disease despite imaging findings to the contrary. Using this strategy, pancreatic malignancy may be diagnosed as expeditiously and as cost-effectively as is possible given current technology.
