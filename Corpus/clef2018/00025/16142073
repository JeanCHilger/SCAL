Endocrine pancreas. Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PET) are characterised by their hormone synthesis capability and can be associated with an hereditary syndrome-related cancer. Imaging must be adapted to the clinical and biological findings. Functioning PET are most frequently small with early symptoms. The challenge for imaging is to localize the tumor. Non-functioning PET frequently are large and malignant with metastases at the time of diagnosis. The imaging of PET is multidisciplinary with the association of morphological imaging (CT and MRI), endoscopic imaging (endoscopic US) and metabolic imaging (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and PET-imaging).
