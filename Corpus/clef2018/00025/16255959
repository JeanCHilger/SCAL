Changes of blood coagulative and fibrinolytic systems and functions of pulmonary vascular endothelium in patients with pulmonary thromboembolism. To explore the changes of blood coagulative and fibrinolytic systems and functions of pulmonary vascular endothelium in patients with pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE).Twenty patients with acute massive PTE, 40 patients with acute non-massive PTE and 40 control subjects without PTE were included in the study. D-Dimer (D-D), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor1 (PAI-1), plasma protein S (Ps), plasma protein C (Pc), thrombomodulin (TM), anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) and homocysteine (Hcy) were measured by the method of ELISA. Antithrombin-III (AT-III) activity was measured by chromo-substrate method.The levels of D-D, t-PA, PAI-1, and TM were (1.46 +/- 0.62) mg/L, (11.4 +/- 6.9) microg/L, (88.2 +/- 27.5) microg/L, (6.8 +/- 1.1) microg/L respectively in patients with acute massive PTE and (0.92 +/- 0.27) mg/L, (6.6 +/- 1.5) microg/L, (60.1 +/- 26.1) microg/L, and (6.30 +/- 1.50) mg/L in patients with acute non-massive PTE. The levels of both PET groups were significantly higher than those of the control subjects [(0.38 +/- 0.10) mg/L, (4.7 +/- 1.4) microg/L, (35.7 +/- 9.2) microg/L, (3.0 +/- 0.5) microg/L and P < 0.05]. The levels of AT-III were (86.0 +/- 11.8)% in patients with acute massive PTE and (90.1 +/- 9.0)% in patients with acute non-massive PTE. The levels of AT-III in both groups were significantly lower than those of the control subjects, which were (102.6 +/- 9.2)% (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 respectively). The levels of ACA-IgG, IgM and IgA in patients with acute massive PTE and non-massive PTE were also significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05).Imbalance of blood coagulation and fibrolytic systems and pulmonary vascular endothelium damage occur in patients with PTE.
