In vivo studies of unlabeled and radioiodinated rhodamine-123. Radioiodinated rhodamine-123 (Rh123), potential tumor imaging agent, was injected in mice bearing experimentally-induced tumors to investigate its tissue distribution. Some accumulation of radioactivity was found in tumors most of it cleared rapidly from the blood after injection. Also, the radioiodinated Rh123 had metabolized to water-soluble species which was excreted in urine and feces. Unlabeled Rh123, on the other hand, accumulated only marginally in the tumors. However, it was found to accumulate significantly in the heart
