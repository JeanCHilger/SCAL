Training protocol for feline renal transplantation, using rat vascular anastomosis. Renal transplantation (RTx) has been a potential treatment for renal failure in pet cats. We developed a training protocol for the microsurgical skills required for feline RTx using rat vessels, which are the same size as the feline renal artery and vein. Using interrupted sutures, the transected abdominal aorta was reestablished in an end-to-end fashion. Venous anastomosis was performed with a continuous running suture in an end-to-side fashion between the portal vein and inferior vena cava. In the arterial anastomotic model, technical errors were checked by postoperative hemorrhaging. Those failures in the venous anastomotic model, technical errors were confirmed by the rat's death. Histological examinations of the epithelialization at the anastomotic site were evaluated in both groups. After training, nine cases of feline RTx were performed safely, using an adequate microsurgical technique.
