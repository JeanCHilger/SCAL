Role of ventral striatal dopamine D1 receptor in cigarette craving. Several theories of cigarette craving suggest that dopaminergic function in the ventral striatum plays an important role. The objective of this study was to determine correlations between craving-related brain activation and dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) binding in smokers.Twelve smokers and 12 nonsmoking controls underwent [(15)O]H(2)O-positron emission tomography activation study and D1R-binding study using [(11)C]SCH 23390, and the correlations between receptor binding and cue-induced regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes were assessed. Consecutive D1R-binding changes were examined during a period of 6 months of postsmoking abstinence in five smokers.Cue-induced activation was observed in the left ventral striatum including the nucleus accumbens in smokers. D1R binding in the ventral striatum showed a negative relationship with cue-induced craving and rCBF changes. D1R binding was significantly low in smokers, and there was a trend of increase after smoking abstinence.D1R binding and cue-induced rCBF changes in the ventral striatum suggest the important role of D1R in this region in cigarette craving.
