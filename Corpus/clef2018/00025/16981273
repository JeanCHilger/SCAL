Factors associated with H. pylori epidemiology in symptomatic children in Buenos Aires, Argentina. To determine prevalence of H pylori infection in symptomatic children in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and to investigate factors associated with H pylori positivity.A total of 395 children with upper gastrointestinal symptoms referred to the Gastroenterology Unit of the Children Hospital "Sor Maria Ludovica" were evaluated for the presence of H pylori by the (13)C-Urea Breath Test ((13)C-UBT). A questionnaire was applied to the recruited population.Prevalence of H pylori infection was 40.0% in this population (mean age 9.97 +/- 3.1 years). The factors associated with H pylori positivity were number of siblings (P < 0.001), presence of pet cats (P = 0.03) and birds (P = 0.04) in the household, and antecedents of gastritis among family members (P = 0.01). After multivariate analysis, number of siblings [Odds ratio (OR) = 1.39 95% CI, 1.20-1.61] and contact with pet cats (OR = 1.76The prevalence of H pylori infection in children with upper gastrointestinal symptoms in Argentina was similar to that reported in developed countries.
