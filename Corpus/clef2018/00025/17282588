Development of a radiation therapy open-source platform. Although several industrial radio-therapy planning solutions presently exist, most of them do not cover the customer needs sufficiently. The aim of this project is to develop an open source radio-therapy planning system that would offer the ground work for individual customer solutions. During the first stage of the project we concentrate on the development of a visualisation module, since it is required for other parts such as dose calculation and beam modelling. The visualisation module will feature 2D and 3D visualisation of CT-, MRI- and PET DICOM images, registration of the images using Normalised Mutual Information, 2D and 3D visualisation of the matched images as well as 2D and 3D user interaction. In this paper an outline for our system is presented as well as a registration module, which is the first part of the visualisation module.
