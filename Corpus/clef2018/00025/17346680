Metabolic and behavioral deficits following a routine surgical procedure in rats. To test the hypothesis that functional metabolic deficits observed following surgical brain injury are associated with changes in cognitive performance in rodents, we performed serial imaging studies in parallel with behavioral measures in control animals and in animals with surgical implants. Memory function was assessed using the novel object recognition (NOR) test, administered 3 days prior to and 3, 7, 14 and 56 days after surgery. At each time point, general locomotion was also measured. Metabolic imaging with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) occurred 28 and 58 days after surgery. Animals with surgical implants performed significantly worse on tests of object recognition, while general locomotion was unaffected by the implant. There was a significant decrease in glucose uptake after surgery in most of the hemisphere ipsilateral to the implant relative to the contralateral hemisphere. At both time points, the most significant metabolic deficits occurred in the primary motor cortex (-25% p<0.001), sensory cortex (-15%, p<0.001) and frontal cortex (-12%
