Our experiences with measurement of new potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of latent forms of myocardial ischemia. The need for a laboratory marker of myocardial ischemia has been alluded to for at least the last decade.The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic importance of the myosin light chain-1 (MLC-1), clusterin and Reg-Ialpha in patients with suspected myocardial ischemia.A group of 176 at high-risk for myocardial ischemia subjects was evaluated and divided into two subgroups using myocardial SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) - individuals with and without signs of myocardial ischemia. Laboratory markers in venous blood were repeatedly examined in all subjects: a) immediately prior to SPECT: C-reactive protein, Haemoglobin, Hematocrite, Lactate, MLC-1, Clusterin, Reg-Ialpha b) at subjective maximum: Hb, Htc, lactate, MLC-1, Clusterin, Reg-Ialpha c) 30 min after stress levels reached their peak: MLC-1, Clusterin, Reg-Ialpha and d) 60 min after peak stress levels: MLC-1, Clusterin, Reg-Ialpha.Patients were divided into subgroups according to their positive and negative SPECT results (positive: n = 37 negative: n = 139). MLC-1 values were different for all 4 blood collections. An increase in MLC-1 > 2.2 mg/l showed 64 % sensitivity and 88 % specificity for the diagnosed presence of myocardial ischemia (AUC 0.81High diagnostic efficacy of detectable MLC-1 was shown for the diagnosis of latent myocardial ischemia. Measurement of serum Clusterin or Reg-Ialpha did not sufficient for the diagnosis of latent myocardial ischemia.
