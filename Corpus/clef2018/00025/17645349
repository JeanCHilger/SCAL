A thiol-reactive fluorescence probe based on donor-excited photoinduced electron transfer: key role of ortho substitution. We designed and synthesized a novel thiol-reactive fluorescence probe based on the BODIPY fluorophore. The fluorescence of this probe is strongly quenched by donor-excited photoinduced electron transfer (d-PeT) from BODIPY to maleimide, but after reaction with thiol, the fluorescence of BODIPY is restored, affording a 350-fold intensity increase.
