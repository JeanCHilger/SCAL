11C-L-methionine positron emission tomography in the clinical management of cerebral gliomas. Positron emission tomography (PET) using L-[methyl-(11)C]-methionine (MET) is the most popular amino acid imaging modality in oncology, although its use is restricted to PET centers with an in-house cyclotron facility. This review focuses on the role of MET-PET in imaging of cerebral gliomas. The biological background of tumor imaging with methionine is discussed with particular emphasis on cellular amino acid transport, amino acid utilization in brain, normal metabolism of methionine, and its alterations in cancer. The role of MET-PET in clinical management of cerebral gliomas in initial diagnosis, differentiation of tumor recurrence from radiation injury, grading, prognostication, tumor-extent delineation, biopsy planning, surgical resection and radiotherapy planning, and assessment of response to therapy is also reviewed in detail.
