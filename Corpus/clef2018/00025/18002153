A computational model of rat cerebral blood flow using non-uniform rational B-splines. Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS) surfaces can be used for a computer simulation of shapes. Some anatomical models of human or animal structures have been recently developed on that basis. We used positron-emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) data for NURBS modeling of anatomical structures and isotope uptake in the rat brain. Our simplified model of the rat cerebral blood flow is the first step in a larger project aiming a simulation of PET scans in small animals followed by its validation in vivo.
