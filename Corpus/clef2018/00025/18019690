F18-FDG-PET evaluation of patients for resection of colorectal liver metastases. Liver resection is the only treatment which offers long-term survival for patients with colorectal liver metastases. However, the significant mortality and morbidity associated with hepatectomy makes accurate patient selection paramount. Current staging by CT and MRI has limitations, with these modalities delivering a sensitivity and specificity of only 70-80%. Thus some patients may be deprived of long-term survival, and others subjected to futile surgery.We report our experience of the influence of F18-FDG-PET scanning in the management of 31 consecutive patients with colorectal liver metastases referred for liver resection.F18-FDG-PET scanning detected liver and pulmonary metastases with a sensitivity of 96% and 100% respectively, in comparison to corresponding figures of 70% and 83% for CT. Furthermore, the sensitivity of F18-FDG-PET scanning in identifying extra-hepatic and extra-pulmonary disease was 100% in comparison to 20% for CT. Overall, F18-FDG-PET scanning resulted in a significant alteration of management in 29% of patients.F18-FDG-PET scanning has an important clinical impact on the management of patients being considered for resection of colorectal liver metastases.
