National study of the gastrointestinal parasites of dogs and cats in Australia. The prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in Australian pet dogs and cats was largely unknown prior to this study. Current recommendations for the prophylactic treatment of parasites in Australia are based on studies conducted 20-30 years ago. A total of 1400 canine and 1063 feline faecal samples were collected from veterinary clinics and refuges from across Australia. The overall prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in dogs and cats was 23.9% (CI 21.7-26.1) and 18.4% (CI 16.1-20.7), respectively. Overall Giardia was the most prevalent parasite in dogs (9.3% CI 7.8-10.8) followed by hookworm (6.7% CI 5.4-8.0). Isospora felis was the most prevalent parasite in cats (5.6% CI 4.2-7.0), followed by Toxocara cati (3.2% CI 2.1-4.3). In conclusion the prevalence of intestinal helminths in Australian pet dogs and cats is low. Consequently, consideration should be given to the future use of anthelmintics and continued emphasis on pet owner education as means of preventing infection.
