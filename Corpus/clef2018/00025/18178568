Effects of disease duration on the clinical features and brain glucose metabolism in patients with mixed type multiple system atrophy. To study the effect of disease duration on the clinical, neuropsychological and [(18)F]-deoxyglucose (FDG) PET findings in patients with mixed type multiple system atrophy (MSA), this study included 16 controls and 37 mixed-type MSA patients with a shorter than a 3-year history of cerebellar or parkinsonian symptoms.
