Evaluation of the product-specific standard input function for the IMP-ARG method. To confirm the previous reports demonstrating the difference in the octanol extraction fractions between the currently available two N-isopropyl-4-iodoamphetamine (123I) products (IMP(A) and IMP(B)), we newly developed the standard input function for IMP(B) in 19 healthy volunteers and compared it with the established standard input function, which has been originally generated with IMP(A). The octanol extraction fractions of IMP(B) were stable from 5 minutes to 16 minutes post injection and significantly higher than those of IMP(A). The mCBFs calculated with IMP(B) by using the established standard input function for IMP(A) tended to be higher than those with the combination of IMP(A) and the established standard input function though the difference was not significant. When measured with IMP(B) combined with the correspondent standard input function, mCBFs were identical to those calculated with IMP(A) with the established standard input function, suggesting that the appropriate standard input function should be used according to the product used.
