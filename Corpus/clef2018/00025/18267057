PET in cervical cancer--implications for 'staging,' treatment planning, assessment of prognosis, and prediction of response. The use of functional imaging techniques such as fluorodeoxyglucose- positron emission tomography and positron emission tomography- computed tomography to manage patients with cervical cancer is constantly increasing. Current roles include pretreatment staging and diagnosis of recurrent disease. Reports have also shown its ability to predict survival based on pre- and posttherapy scans. These techniques are not fool-proof, however, and reports of both false-negative and false-positive scans document some limitations. Future studies must further elucidate their exact roles in the management of this disease process.
