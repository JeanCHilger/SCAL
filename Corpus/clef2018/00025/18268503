Anxiety is associated with reduced central serotonin transporter availability in unmedicated patients with unipolar major depression: a [11C]DASB PET study. Serotonergic dysfunction may contribute to negative mood states in affective disorders. Some in vivo imaging studies showed reduced availability of serotonin transporters (5-HTT) in the brainstem and thalamus of patients with major depression. We tested the hypothesis that 5-HTT availability is reduced in unmedicated unipolar patients with major depression compared to healthy control subjects matched for gender, age, genotype and smoking status. Availability of 5-HTT was measured in vivo with positron emission tomography and [(11)C]-3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile (DASB) in the midbrain, thalamus and amygdala. DASB binding was correlated with the severity of depression (Beck's Depression Inventory), anxiety (Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and personality traits (Temperament and Character Inventory). Patients with major depression displayed reduced 5-HTT availability in the thalamus (P=0.005). In patients, low serotonin transporter availability correlated with high anxiety (thalamus: r=-0.78, P=0.004 midbrain: r=-0.78, P=0.004
