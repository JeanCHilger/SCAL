Long-term clinical and positron emission tomography outcome of fetal striatal transplantation in Huntington's disease. Two patients with moderate Huntington's disease (HD) received bilateral fetal striatal allografts. One patient demonstrated, for the first time, increased striatal D2 receptor binding, evident with 11C-raclopride positron emission tomography, and prolonged clinical improvement over 5 years, suggesting long term survival and efficacy of the graft. The other patient did not improve clinically or radiologically. Our results indicate that striatal transplantation in HD may be beneficial but further studies are needed to confirm this.
