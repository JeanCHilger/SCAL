Advance prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) using (99m)Tc-ECD SPECT brain blood flow imaging. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is considered as a precursor state of Alzheimer disease (AD). SPECT brain blood flow imaging was investigated in MCI and it's relevance to the prognosis of MCI was evaluated in an attempt define the characteristics of brain blood flow imaging of MCI (amnestic MCI aMCI) converting to AD.Ninety-two patients over 60 years old with amnesia were studied. (99m)Tc-ECD SPECT brain blood flow examinations of the subject under drug-free conditions were conducted and imaging was analyzed according to the first clinical diagnosis. Patients given a diagnosis of MCI on the first clinical diagnosis, were examined again after 2 years and the SPECT imaging before 2 years previously was classified and analyzed.Of them, there were 35 MCI patients, converting of 13 AD patients (37.1% aMCI), 10 MCI patients (28.6%The hypoperfusion of the precuneus in aMCI, and the hypoperfusion of the right frontal lobe (DLPFC, dorsal-anterior cingulate) in dMCI were characteristic brain blood-flow abnormalities. We believe (99m)Tc-ECD SPECT brain blood flow imaging to be useful in the diagnosis of aMCI and in the early detection of depression.
