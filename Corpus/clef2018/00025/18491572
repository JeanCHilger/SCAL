Cost-effect clinical analysis in choice of methods of coronary heart disease diagnosis. To select optimal methods of coronary heart disease (CHD) diagnosis in patients with different CHD probability using cost-effect analysis.The trial included 102 patients admitted to hospital because of suspected CHD. The initial CHD probability was determined according to G.A. Diamond table. CHD diagnosis was made with application of Holter ECG monitoring (88 patients), treadmill test (67 patients), dobutamine stress echocardiography (echo-CG, 31 patients), stress single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT, 30 patients), multislice computed tomography (MSCT) with contrast study of coronary arteries (14 patients). Non-invasive tests were followed by coronaroangiography. The cost-effect method was used for analysis of the above methods cost efficacy.MSCT specificity was 96%, specificity of the other methods - 70-75%. SPECT was most sensitive (96%), Holter ECG monitoring was the least sensitive (49%). Efficacy of all the diagnostic tests was maximal in moderate probability of CHD. In spite of its moderate specificity and sensitivity, treadmill test was the cheapest and, therefore, most cost effective in all the groups. Specification of CHD probability by 1% required 17.4 roubles in low risk groups, 9.4 and 24.7 roubles in moderate and high risk, respectively.CHD diagnosis should be started with treadmill test.
