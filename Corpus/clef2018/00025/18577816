Quantification of regional myocardial blood flow using first-pass multidetector-row computed tomography and adenosine triphosphate in coronary artery disease. The feasibility of using cardiac multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) technology in the quantitative assessment of myocardial blood flow (MBF) using the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) load technique was investigated in the present study.The study group comprised 14 patients (11 men, 3 women, age range 52-79 years, mean age 69.2 years) who underwent cardiac cine MDCT using the ATP-load technique. MBF was estimated from the slope of the linear regression equation with Patlak plots analysis. The overall average MBF was 1.83+/-0.62 ml . g(-1) . min(-1). Mean MBF in territories with stenosis on coronary angiography was 1.19+/-0.36 ml . g(-1) . min(-1) and 2.06+/-0.54 ml . g(-1) . min(-1) (p<0.01) in territories without stenosis. The average MBF in territories with moderate to severe ischemia on myocardial perfusion scintigraphy was 1.32+/-0.14 ml .g(-1 ). min(-1 )and 1.95+/-0.64 ml . g(-1) . min(-1) (p<0.01) in territories without ischemia.MDCT can be used to quantify MBF using first-pass dynamic data.
