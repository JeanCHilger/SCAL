Impact of whole-body 18F-FDG PET on diagnostic and therapeutic management of Medical Oncology patients. Most studies evaluating positron-emission tomography (PET) impact on decision making are based on questionnaires sent to referring physicians, with low response rates and potential bias. Studies directly evaluating influence of PET on routine management of Medical Oncology patients are scarce.We retrospectively studied all patients evaluated by whole-body (18)F-FDG PET during 1 year in a Haematology/Oncology Department. We collected information regarding indication, PET results, modification of diagnostic and therapeutic management and adequacy of therapeutic changes.One hundred consecutive patients having PET were evaluated. Diagnostic strategy was modified in 63% of patients (30% avoiding biopsy). Therapeutic management was modified by PET in 34% of cases: changes were classified as adequate in 30% and as inadequate in 4% of patients.Our study shows a major impact of PET in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of cancer patients and supports its introduction as a routine diagnostic tool in Medical Oncology.
