The effects of medications on myocardial perfusion. Antianginal and lipid-lowering medications may modify the results of stress myocardial perfusion imaging. Several studies have shown the beneficial potential of these agents in suppressing myocardial ischemia in patients with known coronary artery disease. The effects of nitrates, calcium-channel blockers, beta-blockers, and statins on myocardial perfusion imaging are likely attributable to changes in myocardial blood flow and myocardial oxygen supply-demand ratio. This comprehensive review examines relevant experimental and clinical published data. Technical issues in image interpretation specific to myocardial perfusion imaging and implications of use of cardiac medications to results of myocardial perfusion imaging are discussed.
