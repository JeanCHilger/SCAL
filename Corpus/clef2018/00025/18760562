Total laparoscopic radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients with Ib1 stage cervical cancer: analysis of surgical and oncological outcome. To evaluate safety, feasibility and oncological outcome of total laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (TLRH) in patients with early invasive cervical cancer.Data of patients with Ib1 cervical cancer who underwent TLRH were prospectively collected. Inclusion criteria were: good general condition, tumor size <3 cm, and no evidence of lymph node metastases in imaging study (MRI and/or CT and/or PET). Radical hysterectomy was performed with a PlasmaKinetic tissue management system. Adjuvant therapy was administered according to surgical risk factors.Between September 2001 and October 2007 107 patients underwent laparoscopic radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Conversion to laparotomy was necessary in 6 patients. Median number of resected pelvic lymph nodes was 26. Median blood loss was 200 ml and median duration of surgery was 305 min. Minor intraoperative complications were registered in two patients, while five patients needed a second surgery for postoperative complications. Thirteen patients had microscopic nodal metastasis. A total of 24 patients received adjuvant therapy. After a median follow-up of 30 months 11 patients had a recurrence survival rate is 95%.Total laparoscopic radical hysterectomy, in experienced hands, has to be considerate an adequate and feasible surgical technique. Considering historical data the oncological outcome can be considered comparable to patients treated with laparotomy, as the relapse rate in our population was 11% and the overall survival good.
