Imaging in cutaneous melanoma. Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is a common malignancy and imaging, particularly lymphoscintigraphy (LS), positron-emission tomography with 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG-PET), ultrasound, radiography computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging have important roles in staging and restaging, surgical guidance, surveillance and assessment of recurrent disease. This review aims to summarize the available data regarding these and other imaging modalities in CM and provide the basis for subsequent formulation of guidelines regarding the use of imaging in CM. PubMed and Medline searches were performed and reference lists from publications were also searched. The published data were reviewed and tabulated. There is level I evidence supporting the use of LS and sentinel lymph node biopsy in nodal staging for CM. There is level III evidence demonstrating the superiority of ultrasound to palpation in the assessment of lymph nodes in CM. There is level IV evidence supporting FDG-PET in American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III/IV and recurrent CM and that FDG-PET/CT may be superior to FDG-PET. Level IV evidence also supports the use of CT in the same group of patients and the role of CT appears to be complementary to FDG-PET. Various imaging modalities, especially LS/sentinel lymph node biopsy and FDG-PET/CT, add incremental information in the management of CM and the various modalities have complementary roles depending on the clinical situation.
