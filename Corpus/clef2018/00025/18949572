The occurrence of the feline "Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum" in dog in China confirmed by sequence-based analysis of ribosomal DNA. In the present study, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to detect haemoplasmas (haemotropic bacteria) in 40 clinically healthy pet dogs in Foshan city, Guangdong Province, China, and one dog was found positive. Comparison of its 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence with relevant sequences showed that the isolated haemoplasma had greater sequence identity to feline species "Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum" (99%) than to "Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum" (95%). This result, for the first time, indicates the presence of the feline "Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum" in Chinese dogs and it represents the first survey of its kind in China by using PCR assay. The results indicated that dog may represent one of the hosts for the feline "Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum".
