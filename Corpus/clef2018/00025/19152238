Is there a future role for immunoscintigraphy in the diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma? Immunoscintigraphy combines the advances in immunology and nuclear medicine to target tumor sites. Visualization of colorectal carcinomas is based on different monoclonal antibodies and their fragments against tumor-associated antigens labeled with gamma emitting radionuclides which accumulate in the tumor tissue due to their interaction with corresponding antigens. Available data on the role of immunoscintigraphy in detection of recurrence and metastases of colorectal carcinomas are reviewed. Despite a variety of investigations related to the application of immunoscintigraphy in diagnostics of colorectal cancer, using different radiolabeled immunoreactive agents and imaging methods there has not been a consensus among the investigators regarding the best modality of the method, including the specific radiopharmaceutical for this purpose. Some general conclusions concerning potentials of immunoscintigraphy in such diagnostics, including expectancy of the newly developed SPECT/CT systems, are suggested. The possibilities of PET imaging of colorectal carcinomas using monoclonal antibodies labeled with positron emitting radionuclides, as well as of the radioimmunoguided surgery and radioimmunotherapy are also discussed.
