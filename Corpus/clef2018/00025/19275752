Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of recombinant human calcyphosine. Human calcyphosine was cloned into the pET-28a vector and highly expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The protein was purified and crystallized. The crystal diffracted to 2.8 A and belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2, with the unit cell parameters a=70.39 A, b=132.02 A, c=46.20 A.
