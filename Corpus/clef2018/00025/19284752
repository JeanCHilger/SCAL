Evaluation of (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP) as a potential PET radiotracer for monitoring tumor multidrug resistance. In this study, we evaluated the potential of (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP) (DO3A-xy-TPEP = (2-(diphenylphosphoryl)ethyl)diphenyl(4-((4,7,10-tris(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecan-1-yl)methyl)benzyl)phosphonium) as a PET (positron emission tomography) radiotracer for noninvasive monitoring of multidrug resistance (MDR) transport function in several xenografted tumor models (MDR-negative: U87MG MDR-positive: MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, KB-3-1, and KB-v-1). It was found that (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP) has a high initial tumor uptake (5.27 +/- 1.2%ID/g at 5 min p.i.) and shows a steady uptake increase between 30 and 120 min p.i. (2.09 +/- 0.53 and 3.35 +/- 1.27%ID/g at 30 and 120 min p.i., respectively) in the MDR-negative U87MG glioma tumors. (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP) has a greater uptake difference between U87MG glioma and MDR-positive tumors (MDA-MB-231: 1.57 +/- 0.04, 1.00 +/- 0.17, and 0.93 +/- 0.15
