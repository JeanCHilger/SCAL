The current state of positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) allows the construction of functional images, and has research and clinical applications particularly in cardiology, oncology and the neurological sciences. In the next 5 years PET scanners will become more available to clinicians, while methodological refinements should lead to exciting breakthroughs, especially in our understanding of neurology and psychiatry.
