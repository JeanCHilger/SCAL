The immunohistochemical expression of cyclin B1 is associated with higher SUV in 18F-FDG-PET in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Initial results. to study the expression of cyclin B1 and its possible relationship with the maximum SUV in FDG-PET and MIB1 expression in patients with NSCLC.49 patients (15 adenocarcinomas, 27 squamous cell carcinomas and 7 bronchoalveolar carcinomas) were included in this study the immunohistochemical expression of cyclin B1 was determined using the tissue-array technique. Each PET was performed 60 minutes after the i.v. administration of 350-518 MBq of FDG on an Advance system (GE) in 2D acquisition mode.cyclin B1 expression was detected in 40 out of 45 cases. The SUV values were higher (p=0.04) in the cyclin B1+ cases than in the negative cases (16.4+/-8.1 vs 10.9+/-6.2). Cyclin B1 expression and SUV values were not correlated with the clinical stage. The expression of cyclin B1+ correlated positively (p<0.0001) with that of MIB1. After univariate analysis, only the cellular proliferation was a prognostic factor (p=0.037).our results suggest that there is a direct correlation between cyclin B1 expression and max-SUV values in the PET of NSCLC patients. When the association of cyclin B1 with positive MIB1 is also considered, our results support the role of cell proliferation in FDG uptake by the tumour.
