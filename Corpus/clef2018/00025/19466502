SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging with prone-only acquisitions: correlation with coronary angiography. Recent evidence suggests that combining supine and prone acquisitions during stress-gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPS) improves detection of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), though the additional imaging time required may not be feasible in routine clinical practice. MPS with prone-only acquisitions is occasionally performed in many laboratories, though little is known about the ability of modern MPS with prone-only acquisitions to detect obstructive CAD. Our goal was to assess the ability of MPS with prone-only acquisitions to detect obstructive CAD as determined by coronary angiography.We studied 386 patients referred for MPS with either recent coronary angiography or a low pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease. All rest and stress images were obtained exclusively in the prone position. The sensitivity of prone-only MPS was 88% for detecting > or =50% coronary artery stenosis and 92% for detecting > or =70% coronary artery stenosis as determined by coronary angiography. Normalcy rate for prone-only MPS in patients with low probability for CAD was 95%, and normalcy rates did not significantly differ among coronary artery distributions.The findings of this study suggest that MPS using prone-only acquisitions is a reasonable diagnostic option for the detection of ischemia due to obstructive coronary artery disease.
