Evaluation of 18fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography in iodine scan negative, differentiated thyroid cancer recurrence. Follow up of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer is based upon anatomical imaging, thyroglobulin assay and functional imaging in the form of iodine uptake scanning. A significant cohort of such patients have rising thyroglobulin levels but negative iodine scans. In this group, 18fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans have been commonly employed. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of such investigation.The sensitivity of 18fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography for detecting recurrence of differentiated thyroid cancer was calculated from a retrospective review of scan results from patients with iodine scan negative recurrence.Eighteen patients with rising thyroglobulin levels underwent 18fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography scanning. Fourteen patients had negative (and four equivocal) whole body iodine scintigraphy scans. Of these 14, six patients had a positive 18fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan, giving a sensitivity of 42.9 per cent.When assessed in the clinical setting and restricted to patients with negative iodine scans, the sensitivity of 18fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography was found to be lower than in previous case series.
