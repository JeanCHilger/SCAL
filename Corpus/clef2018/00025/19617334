11C-methionine PET of acute myocardial infarction. Tissue uptake of l-[methyl-(11)C]-methionine ((11)C-methionine) has been used to monitor amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis. We examined whether (11)C-methionine was retained in areas of myocardial infarction after successful reperfusion.Nine patients with infarction in the left anterior descendent region underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary artery intervention within 24 h and (201)Tl SPECT, (18)F-FDG PET, and (11)C-methionine PET within 2 wk of infarction onset. The standardized uptake values of the infarcted area and of the normal area were measured.The (11)C-methionine images showed increased uptake in the infarcted area, whereas the (201)Tl SPECT and (18)F-FDG PET images showed decreased uptake. The highest accumulation of (11)C-methionine in the infarcted area was observed during the early phase of AMI.(11)C-methionine uptake is elevated in infarcted areas and may reflect the early acute phase of damage healing, that is, the initial process of remodeling.
