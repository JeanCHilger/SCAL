Value of stress myocardial perfusion scanning in diagnosis of severe coronary artery disease in liver transplantation candidates. The significant potential for perioperative and late cardiovascular complications makes careful preoperative cardiac risk assessment imperative in liver transplantation candidates.To determine the sensitivity and specificity of myocardial perfusion scanning for detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) in liver transplantation candidates.We prospectively evaluated 93 liver transplantation candidates. Patients with known CAD were excluded. All patients, regardless of symptoms and risk factors, underwent myocardial perfusion scanning and coronary angiography.Results of myocardial perfusion scanning were abnormal in 64 patients (68.8%) and normal in 29 patients (31.2%). Of patients with abnormal scans, only 6 (9.4%) had severe CAD at coronary angiography. None of the 29 patients with normal perfusion scans and the 24 patients with fixed defects had severe CAD however, 6 of 40 patients (15.0%) with reversible perfusion defects had severe CAD at coronary angiography (P = .005). Alcoholic liver disease, reversible perfusion defects at myocardial perfusion scanning, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly associated with CAD. Defining reversible perfusion defects as a sign of ischemia, and fixed defects and normal perfusion as nonischemic, myocardial perfusion scanning had 100% sensitivity but 61% specificity for severe CAD. The test's accuracy was low (38%).The results of reversible perfusion defects on myocardial perfusion scanning were sensitive but not specific for CAD in liver transplantation candidates. The high number of false-positive results decreased the test's accuracy.
