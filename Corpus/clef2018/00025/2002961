Quantitative evaluation of four 99Tcm colloids for bone marrow scintigraphy using single photon emission computed tomography. Colloids used for bone marrow scintigraphy are also taken up in the liver and spleen. The liver activity in particular hampers interpretation of the study. In this study, four small-sized commercial colloids labelled with 99Tcm were compared for bone marrow uptake relative to the liver, spleen and background activity. Three human albumin colloids (Microlite, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co Solco Nanocoll, Solco Nuclear
