Experience with 123I-Iodobenzamide in the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and Parkinson-plus disease. To perform a descriptive analysis of the clinical and diagnostic implications of (123)I-IBZM SPECT in the patients studied in our center for movement disorders suggestive of Parkinson-Plus Disease (PP).(123)I-IBZM SPECT was performed in 46 patients referred from the movement disorders consultation due to suspicion of PP. According to their symptoms, they were distributed into 3 groups: 35 patients had atypical symptoms (AS) for Parkinson's Disease, 2 showed no response to standard therapy (NR) and 9 presented both factors (AS, NR). The results of SPECT were only assessed qualitatively.The (123)I-IBZM supported the diagnosis of PP in 15(42.9%) out of the 35 patients with AS. The (123)I-IBZM was pathological in one of the two NR patients. Regarding the third group of patients (AS+NR), the (123)I-IBZM was pathological in 6 cases (66.7%). In 95.7% of our sample (44 patients), AS with or without NR was the main factor leading to suspicion of PP and the (123)I-IBZM was altered in only 47.7% (22 patients). Of these 22 cases, the final diagnosis was PP (with high positive predictive value) in 20(91%).The study with (123)I-IBZM is useful in the clinical practice because it provides objective diagnostic information with implications for the treatment and prognosis of patients with suspicion of PP.
