Diagnostic performance of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging fusion images of gynecological malignant tumors: comparison with positron emission tomography/computed tomography. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) and PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fusion images for gynecological malignancies.A total of 31 patients with gynecological malignancies were enrolled. FDG-PET images were fused to CT, T1- and T2-weighted images (T1WI, T2WI). PET-MRI fusion was performed semiautomatically. We performed three types of evaluation to demonstrate the usefulness of PET/MRI fusion images in comparison with that of inline PET/CT as follows: depiction of the uterus and the ovarian lesions on CT or MRI mapping images (first evaluation) additional information for lesion localization with PET and mapping images (second evaluation)For the first evaluation, the score for T2WI (4.68 +/- 0.65) was significantly higher than that for CT (3.54 +/- 1.02) or T1WI (3.71 +/- 0.97) (P < 0.01). For the second evaluation, the scores for the localization of FDG accumulation showing that T2WI (2.74 +/- 0.57) provided significantly more additional information for the identification of anatomical sites of FDG accumulation than did CT (2.06 +/- 0.68) or T1WI (2.23 +/- 0.61) (P < 0.01). For the third evaluation, the three-point rating scale for the patient group as a whole demonstrated that PET/T2WI (2.72 +/- 0.54) localized the lesion significantly more convincingly than PET/CT (2.23 +/- 0.50) or PET/T1WI (2.29 +/- 0.53) (P < 0.01).PET/T2WI fusion images are superior for the detection and localization of gynecological malignancies.
