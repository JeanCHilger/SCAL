FDG-PET scans in patients with lymphoma. Lymphoma comprises a complex set of diseases, including Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin subtypes. An expected goal of management is chronic disease control over decades in most patients with indolent subtypes, and cure is a realistic target for aggressive histologies, including Hodgkin lymphoma. Making methods available to better assess prognosis and to more specifically tailor therapy toward individual subtypes is a priority. Positron emission tomography using the tracer (18)fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG-PET) has become a valuable tool in the care of patients with lymphoma it contributes information on staging and response assessment that has the potential to affect and improve patient care. This imaging modality is also being explored as an early response assessor, potentially allowing early prediction of an individual's response to a specific therapy. This information ultimately may lead to modifications of treatment to improve efficacy or reduce toxicity. Although FDG-PET offers valuable information, it is important to recognize its limitations as well as areas that require further exploration in order to optimally integrate its use into the clinical management of lymphoma patients.
