Development of the research on the application of chlorotoxin in imaging diagnostics and targeted therapies for tumors. Precisely locating tumors always proves to be difficult. To find a molecule that can specifically bind to tumor cells is the key. Recently, chlorotoxin (CTX) has been proved to be able to bind to many kinds of tumor cells. The CTX receptor on the cell surface has been demonstrated to be matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Many researchers have combined CTX with other molecules, including 131I, Cy5.5, iron oxide nanoparticles coated by polyethylene glycol (NP-PEG), and so on, and thus synthesized various types of probes that can be detected by gamma-camera, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). With these methods, the binding degree of CTX could be assessed. These studies demonstrated that CTX has a highly specific binding ability, high stability, and security. CTX could also inhibit or kill the tumor cells. A nonviral nanovector has been developed for gene therapy. As a result, it gradually develops into a new method of diagnosis and targeted therapy of tumors. This article reviews the current progress on CTX including the origin, chemical construction, the mechanism of binding with tumor cells, and the application to tumor imaging diagnosis and therapy.
