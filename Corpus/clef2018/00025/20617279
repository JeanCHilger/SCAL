Procedure guidelines for whole-body 18F-FDG PET and PET/CT in children with malignant diseases. The purpose of these guidelines is to offer the nuclear medicine and the appropriate interdisciplinary team a framework for performing and reporting positron emission tomography (PET) and the combination with computed tomography (PET/CT) in children with malignant diseases mainly using the radiopharmaceutical 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose (FDG). These guidelines are based on the recent guidelines of the Paediatric Committee of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) (57) and have been translated and adapted to the current conditions in Germany. The adaptation of CT-parameters using PET/CT in children is covered in a more detailed way than in the EANM guideline taking into account that in Germany already a good portion of PET examinations is performed using an integrated PET/CT-scanner. Furthermore, a CT-scan without adoption of the CT acquisition parameters would result in a not tolerably high radiation exposition of the child. There are excellent guidelines for FDG PET and PET/CT in oncology published by the German Society of Nuclear Medicine (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Nuklearmedizin, DGN) (42) and EANM (4). These guidelines aim at providing additional information on issues particularly relevant to PET and PET/CT imaging in children. These guidelines should be taken in the context of local and national current standards of quality and rules.
