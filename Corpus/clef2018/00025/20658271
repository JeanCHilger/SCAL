Structural epicardial disease and microvascular function are determinants of an abnormal longitudinal myocardial blood flow difference in cardiovascular risk individuals as determined with PET/CT. The aim of this study was to determine whether epicardial structural disease may affect the manifestation of a longitudinal decrease in myocardial blood flow (MBF) or MBF difference during hyperemia in cardiovascular risk individuals, and its dependency on the flow increase.In 54 cardiovascular risk individuals (at risk) and in 26 healthy controls, MBF was measured with (13)N-ammonia and PET/CT in mL/g/min at rest and during dipyridamole stimulation. Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTA) was performed using a 64-slice CT of a PET/CT system. Absolute MBFs during dipyridamole stimulation were mildly lower in the mid-distal than in the mid-LV myocardium in controls (2.20 ± .51 vs 2.29 ± .51, P < .0001), while it was more pronounced in at risk with normal and abnormal CTA (1.56 ± .42 vs 1.91 ± .46 and 1.18 ± .34 vs 1.51 ± .40 mL/g/min, respectively, P < .0001), resulting in a longitudinal MBF difference that was highest in at risk with normal CTA, intermediate in at risk abnormal CTA, and lowest in controls (.35 ± .16 and .22 ± .09 vs .09 ± .04 mL/g/min, respectively, P < .0001). On multivariate analysis, log-CCS and mid-LV hyperemic MBF increase, indicative of microvascular function, were independent predictors of the observed longitudinal MBF difference (P ≤ .004 by ANOVA).Epicardial structural disease and microvascular function are important determinants of an abnormal longitudinal MBF difference as determined with PET/CT.
