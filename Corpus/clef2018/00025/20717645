Imaging diagnostics of large vessel vasculitis. At present non-invasive imaging is of paramount importance in the diagnostic evaluation of large vessel vasculitis. For evaluation of the cranial and extracranial aortic branches color coded sonography is the method of choice, whereas CT and MRI are useful in assessing the thoracic aorta. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging allows direct visualization of the extent of vascular inflammation. To date the diagnostic benefit of combined PET and morphological imaging (PET-CT) as well as the value of imaging procedures in order to assess disease activity and therapy control remain unclear.
