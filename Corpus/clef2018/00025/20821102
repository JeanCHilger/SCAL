Evaluation of a real-time semiconductor dosimeter and measurement of finger dose in nuclear medicine departments. In this study, the nuclear medicine staff wore one finger dosimeter placed at the base of the index finger of the working hand. When a physician injected radioisotope drugs, the finger dose was 22.4 microSv, that for radiological technologists handling (99m)Tc was 29.6 microSv/day (consultation period 20 days), that for a physician injecting (18)F-FDG-PET drugs was 51.3 microSv (right finger 53.9 microSv, left finger 47.2 microSv), that for pharmacists' assay of FDG was 31.5 microSv, and that for radiological technologists positioning patients was 1.9 microSv. The largest value (94.1 microSv) was observed in physicians in the case of aspiration of a delivered drug. The finger dosimeter provides an effective solution for radiation protection procedures and follow-up. All the above staff members are on rotation and do not constantly handle radioactivity throughout the year.
