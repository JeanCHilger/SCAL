The utility of F-18 FDG PET/CT in the evaluation of pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. To assess the utility of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) in evaluating pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN).We included 31 patients with pancreatic IPMN who underwent F-18 FDG PET/CT and multidetector CT (MDCT). Each pancreatic lesion was classified as benign or malignant. On PET, the maximal standardized uptake value was measured in each pancreatic lesion.PET/CT was superior to MDCT in diagnosing malignant IPMN. All 22 concordant results gave accurate diagnoses. Of 9 discordant results, MDCT misdiagnosed 7 IPMNs, whereas PET/CT misinterpreted 2. Malignant IPMNs showed significantly higher maximal standardized uptake values (mean ± standard deviation, 6.7 ± 3.6) than benign IPMNs (mean ± standard deviation, 2.1 ± 1.0) (P < 0.001).F-18 FDG PET/CT outperformed MDCT in detecting malignant IPMN.
