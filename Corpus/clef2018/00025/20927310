Frontal Dysfunction Underlies Depression in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A FDG-PET Study. Depression is a very common symptom in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and in those with clinically evident AD. Moreover, MCI individuals with depression show a higher conversion rate to clinical AD than those without depression. This study aimed to elucidate the functional neuroanatomical substrate of depression in MCI.Thirty-six patients were recruited from a University Hospital-based cohort 18 of these subjects had MCI with depression (MCI_D)MCI_D showed lower glucose metabolism in the right superior frontal gyrus than MCI_ND. There was a significant negative correlation between HRSD score and glucose metabolism at the same frontal region for overall MCI subjects. When compared with CN, both MCI_D and MCI_ND showed decreased glucose metabolism in the precuneus, while MCI_D had, in addition, reduced metabolism in other diffuse brain regions.Given previous observations on depression in AD, our results suggest that functional disruption of the frontal region, known to be associated with primary or other secondary depression, underlies depression in preclinical AD as well as clinically evident AD.
