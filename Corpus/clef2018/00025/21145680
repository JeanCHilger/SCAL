18F-FDG PET, combined FDG-PET/CT and MRI for evaluation of bone marrow infiltration in staging of lymphoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Evaluation of bone marrow infiltration is an essential step in the staging of lymphoma. The accuracy of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET), combined (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing bone marrow involvement of lymphoma has never been systematically assessed, and the present systematic review was aimed at this issue.MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library and some other databases, from January 1995 to July 2010, were searched for initial studies. All the studies published in English or Chinese relating to the diagnostic value of (18)F-FDG PET, PET/CT and MRI for patients with bone marrow involvement of lymphoma were collected. We extracted data to calculate sensitivity, specificity, SROC curves and AUC and to test for heterogeneity. The statistic software called "Meta-Disc 1.4" was used for data analysis.In 32 included studies, PET/CT had the highest pooled sensitivity, 91.6% (95%CI: 85.1, 95.9) and highest pooled specificity, 90.3% (95%CI: 85.9, 93.7). PET/CT also had the highest pooled DOR, 68.89 (95%CI: 15.88, 298.92). The AUC of PET, PET/CT, and MRI were 0.9430, 0.9505 and 0.8764. There was heterogeneity among studies and no evidence of publication bias.PET/CT was a highly sensitive and specific modality in diagnosing patients with bone marrow involvement in lymphoma. Compared with MRI and PET alone, PET/CT can play important roles in the staging of lymphoma.
