Myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography in asymptomatic diabetics. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most important cause of mortality in diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus (DM) due to autonomic neuropathy leads to asymptomatic CAD. Hence, it is important to screen the patients with DM for CAD.To study the prevalence of asymptomatic CAD by Myocardial Perfuision SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) (MPS) in diabetics.This prospective study included 88 asymptomatic patients (58 males and 30 females) of Type 2 DM of more than 5 years duration in the age group of 40-65 years. Risk factors like hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, family history of CAD and Body Mass Index > or = 25 kg/sq.m were assessed. All these patients underwent MPS study as two day standard protocol. Thirty eight patients underwent invasive Coronary Angiography (CAG) and stenosis greater than 50% was considered significant.Abnormal perfusion was detected in 38 (43%) diabetics and 4 (11%) controls. A total of 81 perfusion defects were identified (19 fired and 62 reversible). CAG showed significant coronary stenosis in 26 (68.4%), insignificant in 8 (21%) and no stenosis in 4 (10.6%) patients. A total of 114 coronaries were analysed, significant stenosis in 67 (58.8%) coronaries, 21 (18.4%) had insignificant lesions and 26(22.8%) were normal. In comparison to CAG, MPS had sensitivity of 86.6% and specificity of 51%.The Myocardial Perfusion SPECT is a sensitive diagnostic tool to identify ischemia in asymptomatic diabetics. MPS can be used as screening test for risk stratification. It has a prognostic value in predicting the outcome of CAD and can be useful for long-term follow up too.
