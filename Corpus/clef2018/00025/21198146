Optical imaging of reporter gene expression using a positron-emission-tomography probe. Reporter gene∕reporter probe technology is one of the most important techniques in molecular imaging. Lately, many reporter gene∕reporter probe systems have been coupled to different imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and optical imaging (OI). It has been recently found that OI techniques could be used to monitor radioactive tracers in vitro and in living subjects. In this study, we further demonstrate that a reporter gene∕nuclear reporter probe system [herpes simplex virus type-1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) and 9-(4-(18)F-fluoro-3-[hydroxymethyl] butyl) guanine ([(18)F]FHBG)] could be successfully imaged by OI in vitro and in vivo. OI with radioactive reporter probes will facilitate and broaden the applications of reporter gene∕reporter probe techniques in medical research.
