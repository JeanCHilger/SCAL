Radiation dosimetry of 82Rb in humans under pharmacologic stress. (82)Rb is used with PET for cardiac perfusion studies. Using human biokinetic measurements, in vivo, we recently reported on the resting-state dosimetry of this agent. The objective of this study was to obtain (82)Rb dose estimates under stress.(82)Rb biokinetics were obtained in 10 healthy volunteers (5 male, 5 female mean age ± SD, 33 ± 10 yThe highest mean organ-absorbed doses under stress were as follows: heart wall, 5.1, kidneys, 5.0, lungs, 2.8, and pancreas, 2.4 μGy/MBq (19, 19, 10.4, and 8.9 mrad/mCi, respectively). The mean effective doses under stress were 1.14 ± 0.10 and 1.28 ± 0.10 μSv/MBq using the tissue-weighting factors of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, publications 60 and 103, respectively.Appreciable differences in source-organ biokinetics were observed for heart wall and kidneys during stress when compared with the previously reported rest study. The organ receiving the highest dose during stress was the heart wall. The mean effective dose calculated during stress was not significantly different from that obtained at rest.
