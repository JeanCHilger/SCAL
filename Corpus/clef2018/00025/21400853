Prognosis of acute encephalopathy. The prognosis in children with acute encephalopathy who were achieved rehabilitation in our rehabilitation center was presented. Main sequelae was motor disturbance 25%, mental deterioration 90%, higher cortical dysfunction 80% and epilepsy 70%. The patients were divided into 5 groups according to the clinical courses at the onset: cases with metabolic disorders, cases with cytokine storms, cases with status convultics, cases with severe refractory status epilepticus, and cases with the main symptom of decreased consciousness. Typical cases of each group were showed with their brain MRI and single photon emission cerebral tomography (SPECT). In cases with metabolic disorders and cytokine storms, the sequelae were generally severe. In cases with status convulticus, main sequelae was mental deterioration. In cases with severe refractory status epileptics, most contraversial problem was epilepsy. In cases with the main symptom of decreased consciousness, higher cortical dysfunction was the main problem.
