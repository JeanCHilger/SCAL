Isomerism of [64Cu-NOTA-Bn]-labeled radiotracers: separation of two complex isomers and determination of their interconversion energy barrier using ion pair chromatography. The model complex [(64)Cu((S)-p-NH(2)-Bn-NOTA)](-) ([(64)Cu]1) was used to study the isomerism of [(64)Cu-NOTA-Bn]-labeled radiotracers. Two complex isomers [(64)Cu]1a and [(64)Cu]1b, which were formed at a ratio of 1:9 during the complexation of [(64)Cu]Cu(2+) with (S)-p-NH(2)-Bn-NOTA, were separated using ion pair chromatography. To study the interconversion, the nonradioactive complex isomers Cu1a and Cu1b were separated and thermally treated at 90 Â°C in both ammonium acetate solution and deionized water. A faster interconversion rate was observed for both isomers with lower concentrations of ammonium ions. At the end of reaction, the thermodynamic Cu1a to Cu1b equilibrium ratio was 6:94. The particular energy barriers of the interconversion for Cu1a and Cu1b were 130 kJ mol(-1) and 140 kJ mol(-1). Spectrophotometric measurements with Cu1a and Cu1b revealed two isomers adopting different geometrical configurations.
