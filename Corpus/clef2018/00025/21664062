Imaging for stereotactic spine radiotherapy: clinical considerations. There is growing interest in the use of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for spinal metastases. With the need for accurate target definition and conformal avoidance of critical normal structures, high-quality multimodal imaging has emerged as a key component at each stage of the treatment process. Multidisciplinary collaboration isÂ necessary to optimize imaging protocols and implement imaging advances into routine patient care.
