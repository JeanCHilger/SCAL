High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU): our experience in the treatment of prostate cancer relapsing after radiotherapy. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment in patients with local prostate cancer recurrence after radiotherapy. From February 2009 to June 2010, 14 patients with prostate cancer recurrence after radiotherapy were selected for HIFU treatment all patients had a positive TRUS-guided biopsy and the absence of distant metastases was confirmed by computer tomography, PET choline or bone scintigraphy. We classified all patients in 3 groups using D'Amico's classification: 4 patients high risk (PSA >20 ng/ml - 8≤ Gleason Score≤ 10 - clinical stage≥T2c), 8 patients intermediate risk (10 <PSA≤20 ng/ml - Gleason Score=7 - clinical stage=T2b), and 2 patients low risk (PSA≤10 ng/ml - Gleason Score≤6 - clinical stage=T1c-T2a). Progression was defined using Stuttgart definition (PSA>PSAnadir+1.2ng/ml) or after adjuvant therapy introduction. All complications were recorded. Of the 14 patients selected, 12 patients underwent HIFU treatments
