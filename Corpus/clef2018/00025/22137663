Association between sRAGE, esRAGE levels and vascular inflammation: analysis with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and its diverse ligands play a pivotal role in the development of cardiovascular disease. Soluble forms of RAGE (sRAGE), including the splice variant endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE), may neutralize AGE-RAGE mediated vascular damage by acting as a decoy. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a novel imaging technique for detecting vascular inflammation.We examined vascular inflammation measured using FDG-PET in 41 type 2 diabetes patients and 41 healthy control subjects in the right carotid artery. Vascular (18)F-FDG uptake was measured as the blood-normalized standardized uptake value (SUV), known as the target-to-background ratio (TBR). In addition, their relationship with carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), estimated GFR (eGFR), and other cardiovascular risk factors was evaluated.Both mean and maximum TBR values were significantly higher in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to healthy subjects. After adjusting for age and gender, sRAGE levels were significantly correlated with both mean and maximum TBR values, but not with CIMT values. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that maximum TBR values were independently associated with sRAGE levels in addition to HbA1c and eGFR.Circulating sRAGE showed significant association with TBR values measured using FDG-PET, which reflect vascular inflammation.
