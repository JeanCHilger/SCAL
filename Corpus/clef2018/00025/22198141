Extradural tumors. Approximately 50-60% of spinal tumors are extradural and depending on the origin and location are classified into tumors of the vertebrae, tumors of the epidural space and primarily extraspinal tumors growing into the spine. Presenting complaints include back pain and weakness as well as myelopathy and radiculopathy due to compression of the spinal cord or the nerve roots, respectively. Imaging of extradural tumors mostly requires both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Extradural masses and infiltration of the cord can be depicted by MRI and CT depicts osteolytic and osteosclerotic lesions and the extent of osseous involvement. Bone scintigraphy is often helpful in detecting metastases and characterizing osteoid osteomas.
