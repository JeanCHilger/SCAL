Intrabullous ventilation in pulmonary emphysema:  assessment with dynamic xenon-133 gas SPECT. Intrabullous ventilation in patients with pulmonary emphysema (PE) was cross-sectionally evaluated using dynamic xenon-133 gas single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Fifty-two patients with PE with a total of 109 bullae of more than 4 cm in maximum diameter underwent xenon-133 gas SPECT. The real xenon-133 gas half-clearance time (T1/2) at each bulla was compared with that at the surrounding lung in the same lobe. The emphysema subtype of the surrounding lung was classified into centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal on computed tomography (CT).All bullae except for one in all patients showed xenon-133 gas wash-in. Of the 108 bullae with wash-in, 95 (87.9%) bullae in 46 (88%) patients showed marked xenon-133 gas retention with a T1/2 beyond 110 s (mean: 184 s ± 91). The surrounding lungs of these bullae also showed marked retention with a T1/2 of greater than 100 s (mean: 174 s ± 82), and the majority (N=92, 96.8%) were centrilobular or panlobular on CT. The remaining 13 (12.0%) bullae in six (11%) patients showed minimal retention with a T1/2 of less than 80 s (mean: 62 s ± 11), regardless of no significant difference in size compared with the bullae with marked retention. All the surrounding lungs of these bullae except for one also showed minimal retention with a T1/2 of less than 70 s (mean: 60 s ± 18), which was significantly less compared with that of the bullae with marked retention (P<0.0001), and the majority (N=11, 84.6%) were paraseptal with or without an interstitially fibrotic change and predominantly located at the lower lung lobe on CT. The T1/2 of the 108 bullae with xenon-133 gas wash-in was significantly correlated with that of the surrounding lungs (r=0.884, P<0.0001).Intrabullous ventilation in patients with PE appears to depend on the ventilation status of the surrounding lung, and bullae with the surrounding lungs of paraseptal-type emphysema tend to show minimal air trapping. Xenon-133 gas SPECT is useful for assessment of the interaction between intrabullous and surrounding lung's ventilation, which is difficult on CT.
