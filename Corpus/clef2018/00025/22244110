Molecular epidemiology of mycobacteriosis in wildlife and pet animals. The ecology of mycobacteria is shifting in accordance with environmental change and new patterns of interaction between wildlife, humans, and nondomestic animals. Infection of vertebrate hosts throughout the world is greater now than ever and includes a growing prevalence in free ranging and captive wild animals. Molecular epidemiologic studies using standardized methods with high discriminatory power are useful for tracking individual cases and outbreaks, identifying reservoirs, and describing patterns of transmission and are used with increasing frequency to characterize disease wildlife. This review describes current features of mycobacteriosis in wildlife species based on traditional descriptive studies and recent molecular applications.
