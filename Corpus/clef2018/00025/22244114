Diagnosis of mycobacterial infections in the exotic pet patient with emphasis on birds. The term “mycobacteriosis” encompasses a variety of infectious diseases of animals caused by bacteria of the genus Mycobacterium, which are chronic and debilitating diseases. More than 35 Mycobacterium spp can cause mycobacteriosis. The wide range of possible clinical signs and physical exam findings can make the antemortem diagnosis inconsistent and challenging. Proper sample collection and test modality in relation to the state of the disease process are essential. Clinicians can determine a presumptive diagnosis of mycobacteriosis, but the definitive etiologic diagnosis of mycobacteriosis relies on the correct identification of the mycobacteria through microbiological and molecular diagnostic methods.
