Mycobacterial infections in reptiles. Mycobacteriosis is an important disease worldwide. Although commonly associated with higher vertebrates, including humans, it has been reported in only a handful of reptile cases. The purpose of this article is to review the literature as it relates to mycobacteriosis in reptiles. Knowledge of the epidemiology of this disease can be useful to veterinarians working with these animals, especially when working on a diagnosis and making recommendations to clients regarding the need for case follow-up to rule in or rule out the potential presence of these pathogens in pet reptiles and best handling practices to minimize their exposure.
