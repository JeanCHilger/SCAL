Young women with cold-activated brown adipose tissue have higher bone mineral density and lower Pref-1 than women without brown adipose tissue: a study in women with anorexia nervosa, women recovered from anorexia nervosa, and normal-weight women. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is associated with depletion of body fat, loss of bone mineral density (BMD), and impaired thermogenesis. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is lower in obese individuals and decreases during aging. Recent studies have suggested a link between BAT and bone metabolism.Our objective was to investigate the presence and quantity of BAT in patients with AN, recovered AN (AN-R), and normal-weight controls and to study the relationship between BAT and BMD and body composition and investigate hormonal predictors of BAT.This was a cross-sectional study at a clinical research center.Patients included 15 women: five with AN (mean age 30 ± 6.3 yr), five AN-R, and five healthy nonobese controls of comparable age.Cold-activated BAT was determined by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography. BMD of total-body, spine, and hip, fat and lean mass was determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Single-slice magnetic resonance imaging at L4 was done for abdominal fat compartments, and preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1), T₃, and T₄ were measured.Within the AN group, one of five in the AN-R group, two of fiveYoung women with AN have low cold-activated BAT, which may be due to impaired BAT thermogenesis. Young women with BAT have higher BMD and lower Pref-1 compared with women without BAT, suggesting that BAT may be involved in the regulation of stem cell differentiation into the bone lineage at the expense of adipogenesis.
