Neurobiological status at initial presentation predicts neuropsychological functioning in early onset anorexia nervosa at four-year follow up. This study explores whether neurobiological status (indexed by regional cerebral blood flow) at initial presentation predicts neuropsychological status at four-year follow up in a sample of children with early onset anorexia nervosa. Neuropsychological assessment was conducted on 15 females four years after their initial treatment, and matched controls. At follow up there were significant differences between subgroups (based on neurobiological status at initial presentation) and matched controls in long-term visual memory and cognitive inhibition. This study offers preliminary evidence that neurobiological abnormalities at initial presentation predict neuropsychological status at follow up, suggesting a distinct neurodevelopmental subtype of early onset anorexia nervosa.
