Quantitative analysis of perfusion studies: strengths and pitfalls. Tools for automated quantification of myocardial perfusion are available to nuclear cardiology practitioners and researchers. These methods have demonstrated superior reproducibility with comparable diagnostic and prognostic performance, when compared with segmental visual scoring by expert observers. A particularly useful application of the quantitative analysis can be in the detection of subtle changes or in precise determination of ischemia. Some challenges remain in the routine application of perfusion quantification. Multiple quantitative parameters may need to be reconciled by the expert reader for the final diagnosis. Computer analysis may be sensitive to imaging artifacts, resulting in false positive scans. Perfusion quantification may require site specific normal limits and some degree of manual interaction. New software improvements have been proposed to address some of these challenges.
