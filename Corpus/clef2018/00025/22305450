Radiological evaluation of adrenal incidentalomas: current methods and future prospects. Incidental adrenal lesions are very common. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) all have a role to play in characterizing adrenal lesions. The purpose of this review is to discuss the rationale behind both established and emerging imaging techniques. We also discuss how to follow up incidentally found lesions.
