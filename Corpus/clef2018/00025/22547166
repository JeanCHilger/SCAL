Hodgkin lymphoma in patients with HIV infection: a review. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is one of the most common types of non-AIDS-defining tumors in the HIV-infected. Its incidence however seems to have increased under highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). HIV-HL is a different entity from HL in HIV-negative subjects with a poorer prognosis that is associated with tumor-subtype, EBV-infection, and "B" symptoms. Despite the aggressive nature of the disease, clinical outcome has improved with combination therapies including appropriately timed antiretroviral strategies and the quality of supportive care-notably the use of hematopoietic growth factors. More intensive chemotherapy regimens with or without autologous stem cell transplantation appear to improve survival. Functional imaging such as positron emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG-PET) may help guide treatment strategy and minimize long-term toxicity.
