Radiosynthesis of [11C]SNAP-7941--the first PET-tracer for the melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1). The melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) system is a new target to treat human disorders. Our aim was the preparation of the first PET-tracer for the MCHR1. [(11)C]SNAP-7941 is a carbon-11 labeled analog of the published MCHR1 antagonist SNAP-7941. The optimum reaction conditions were 2 min reaction time, ≤25°C reaction temperature, and 2 mg/mL precursor (SNAP-acid) in acetonitrile, using [(11)C]CH(3)OTf as methylation agent. [(11)C]SNAP-7941 was prepared in a reliable and feasible manner with high radiochemical yields (2.9±1.6 GBq 11.5±6.4% EOB, n=15).
