Small bowel metastases from melanoma: does videocapsule provide additional information after FDG positron emission tomography? Finding small bowel metastases of melanoma can be important because surgical removal of unique small bowel metastasis of melanoma could improve survival. In this study, we evaluated if capsule endoscopy provides additional information after Pet CT has been performed. In this series of 9 patients collected from 3 university centers, capsule endoscopy influenced the therapeutic decision (to perform or not a surgical segmental resection) in 2/9 patients. All metastatic lesions were found in the proximal bowel. Capsule identified jejunum metastases in one case while Pet CT was negative, and identified metastases while Pet CT result was not conclusive. In one case PET CT identified mesenteric metastases while capsule was negative. SBCE influenced therapeutic decision in 2/9 patients concerning the decision of performing small bowel resection or not. In 1 patient SBCE changed the stage of the disease without affecting medical therapeutic strategy. The prognosis of patients with positive PET and/or capsule findings is very limited (2/3 died within the year). In selected patients, capsule endoscopy can provide complementary information once PET CT has been performed.
