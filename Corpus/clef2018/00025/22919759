Preparation of the monoclonal antibody against human Bocavirus VP2 protein. To express and purify HBoV VP2 protein, and the monoclonal antibody against HBoV VP2 protein was prepared with hybridoma technique.The HBoV VP2 cloned into vector pET-30a was expressed in E. coil. After purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, the BALB/c mouse was immunized with purified protein as antigen. The positive hybridoma cells were screened with hybridoma technique and ELISA assay. Isotype and titer of the monoclonal antibody were detected.The recombinant HBoV VP2 protein was expressed and purified, and then the monoclonal antibody was obtained with hybridoma technique. The titer of the IgG monoclonal antibody was up to 1:4 x 10(5).Monoclonal antibody against recombinant HBoV VP2 protein was prepared and the antibody titer was high. This work may provide a new method in rapid diagnosis and study of HBoV.
