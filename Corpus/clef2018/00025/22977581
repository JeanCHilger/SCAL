Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the testicle and bilateral adrenals detected by (18)F-FDG PET/CT. Lymphoma, particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, may occur in sites other than the lymph nodes, i.e., extranodal lymphoma, which occurs in approximately 40% of total lymphoma cases. However, simultaneous detection of multiple extranodal involvements at presentation is quite uncommon. Here, we report a rare case of a 55-year-old Chinese man with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the left testicle and bilateral adrenals as determined by (18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging. FDG PET/ CT has been successfully employed for lymphoma diagnosis, initial staging, restaging and therapy follow-up. It is useful for assessing both nodal and extranodal involvements. In the present case of lymphoma with involvement of the testicle and bilateral adrenals, (18)F-FDG PET/CT played an important role in the diagnosis and assessment of therapeutic response.
