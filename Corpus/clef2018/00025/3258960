Cerebral blood flow in patients with thalamic hemorrhage--Part 1: Serial changes of cerebral blood flow in conservatively treated patients. Serial changes of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in nine patients with thalamic hemorrhage are studied. Measurement of CBF was performed in 3 times (acute, subacute and chronic stage) by the 133 Xe inhalation method using rapidly rotating single photon emission CT (SPECT, Tomomatic 64). The outcome was judged at 16 weeks from onset according to the activities of daily life. All patients divided into two groups (good group and poor group) [Result] 1. Serial changes in mean hemispheric CBF (mCBF) of both hematoma and nonhematoma side between good group and poor group. Between two groups, the significant difference was observed only in hematoma side was 77% CBF in acute stage and it was gradually improved in subacute stage. mCBF of nonhematoma side was normal value in all stage. In poor group, mCBF of hematoma side was 64% CBF in acute stage and it was slightly improved in chronic stage (70% CBF). Slice 2 mCBF of nonhematoma side was 69% CBF in acute stage and it was improved in subacute (74% CBF) and chronic (78% CBF) stage. 2. Serial changes in regional CBF (rCBF)--H (hematoma area).A (anterior area of hematoma).L (lateral area of hematoma).P (posterior area of hematoma) of hematoma side between good group and poor group. Between two groups, the significant differences were observed in rCBF-H.L.P on subacute stage and rCBF-P on chronic stage. Serial changes in rCBF were similar to those in slice 2 mCBF of hematoma side. 3. Serial changes in rCBF-H.A.L.P of nonhematoma side between good group and poor group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
