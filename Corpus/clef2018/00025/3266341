Neurophysiological aspects of auditory hallucinations. 99mTc-(HMPAO)-SPECT investigations in patients with auditory hallucinations and normal controls--a preliminary report. In a symptom-oriented study 17 patients suffering from chronic auditory hallucinations were investigated by means of 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT and compared with healthy controls. The results confirm the relative frontal hypoactivity in junction with a relative hyperactivity in the basal ganglia and mesial limbic structures in both hemispheres found in a previous pilot study in auditorily hallucinating patients. Our results should fortify the symptom-oriented approach in psychiatric research.
