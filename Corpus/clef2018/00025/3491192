Glucose transport and utilization in the human brain: model using carbon-11 methylglucose and positron emission tomography. 3-0-[11C]-Methyl-D-glucose (CMG) is specifically suited for measuring carrier facilitated glucose (G) transport it enters the free G pool in tissue from where it is not utilized for metabolism in contrast to G, but is transported back into circulation. The ratio of carrier affinity for G and CMG was reported to be 1.11. By simultaneously measuring CMG concentration in plasma and in cerebral cortex in vivo with positron tomography at 1-min intervals for 40 min, two time-activity curves are obtained, as reported previously, which together with the G concentration in plasma yield the in vivo rate constants of G transport across the blood-brain barrier and the rate of G inflow
