Cerebral and cerebellar uptake of 99mTc-(d,1)-hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime (HM-PAO) in patients with brain tumor studied by single photon emission computerized tomography. The cerebral and cerebellar distribution of 99mTc-(d,1)-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HM-PAO) was investigated by means of a rotating gamma camera in 12 patients with cerebral glioma. Using the corresponding contralateral region as control, reduced uptake of HM-PAO in the tumor region was demonstrated in 10 of the 12 patients. Reduced blood flow in a brain area remote from a circumscribed lesion reflects reduced activation following the interruption of afferent nervous pathways. Reduced HM-PAO uptake indicative of such diaschisis was demonstrated in the visual cortex contralateral to homonymous hemianopia in the two patients with this deficit. In the three patients with the most marked hemiparesis, the cerebellar hemisphere contralateral to the tumor showed significantly reduced HM-PAO uptake indicative of crossed cerebellar diaschisis. SPECT using commonly available gamma cameras and 99mTc-HM-PAO seems capable of depicting reduced flow in functionally inactivated brain areas, and may be clinically interesting as an alternative to more specialized techniques for the investigation of local cerebral blood flow.
