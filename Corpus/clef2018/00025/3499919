Regional cerebral blood flow images of single photon emission computed tomography by N-isopropyl-p-[I-123] iodoamphetamine in patients with brain tumor. Regional cerebral blood flow (r-CBF) was studied by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using N-isopropyl-p-[I-123] iodoamphetamine (IMP) in order to evaluate CBF in patients with brain tumor. Total 27 studies were carried out in 20 patient, including 8 patients with meningioma, 3 with glioblastoma multiforme, 2 with oligoastrocytoma, and 7 with other intracranial tumors. All CBF images by IMP-SPECT were obtained by using a rotating gamma camera with dual heads. In the serial scans, each scan was started at 20 minutes, 2 hours and 6 hours after intravenous injection of I-123 IMP (3 mCi). The all IMP-SPECT images were compared with cerebral angiogram, X-ray CT (plain and/or enhancement), and images of Kr-81 m SPECT and Tc-99 m SPECT. In 5 patients (4 patients with meningioma and 1 with glioblastoma multiforme) this comparative study was performed before and after surgery to evaluate the r-CBF changes surrounding tumor. The abnormal lesion on X-ray-CT was identified as hot area on CBF image by IMP-SPECT in two cases with meningioma, and in 14 cases the lesion showed cold area. Totally 80% of cases showed abnormal findings on CBF images by IMP-SPECT. The cases which showed no abnormal findings on IMP-SPECT images included 1 case with meningioma which located in frontal base, 2 with small intracranial brain tumor which was smaller than 2 cm in diameter, and 1 with pituitary adenoma. On the IMP-SPECT images scanned 2 hours after injection, hot area, which was identified in two cases with meningioma on the images 20 minutes after injection, was changed into cold area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
