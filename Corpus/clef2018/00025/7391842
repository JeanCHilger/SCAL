A fluorinated glucose analog, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-18): nontoxic tracer for rapid tumor detection. Rapid uptake of F-18 FDG was observed in a variety of transplanted and spontaneous tumors in animals. The tumor uptake reached a peak by 30 min and remained relatively constant up to 60 min, with a very slow wash-out of F-18 activity from the tumor thereafter. Tumor-to-normal tissue and tumor-to-blood ratios ranged from 2.10-9.15 and 2.61-17.82, respectively, depending on the type of tumor. A scintiscan of a seminoma in a dog showed very high uptake in the viable part and lack of uptake in the necrotic mass. Toxicological studies in mice using 1000 times human tracer dose (HTD) per wk for 3 wk and in dogs using 50 times HTD per wk for 3 wk did not show any evidence of acute or chronic toxicity.
