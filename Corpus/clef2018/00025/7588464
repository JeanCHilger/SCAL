Ictal HMPAO-single photon emission computed tomography findings in reading epilepsy in a Japanese boy. Reading epilepsy is rare. We report a 14-year-old right-handed Japanese boy who had had jaw jerking only while reading since age 12 years. The episodes occurred every time he read an English textbook and sometimes during prolonged reading of a Japanese textbook. The jaw jerking evolved to generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) on only two occasions during prolonged reading aloud. Routine EEGs showed no abnormality. After a few minutes of reading, however, the EEG showed bilateral 2-Hz, 150-microV spike-wave complexes with left frontotemporal accentuation, accompanied by jaw jerking. Ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [99Tc]hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) showed focal hyperperfusion of the frontal lobes bilaterally and of the left temporal area. Interictal SPECT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were normal. The combination of valproate (VPA) and clonazepam (CZP) almost eliminated his symptoms. Ictal SPECT is a useful technique for seizure localization in reading epilepsy.
