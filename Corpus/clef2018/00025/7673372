Positron emission tomography of 5-HT transporter sites in the baboon brain with [11C]McN5652. [11C]McN5652 is a new radioligand specific for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT serotonin) transporters. In this study we used [11C]McN5652 to image the 5-HT transporter sites in baboon brain by positron emission tomography (PET). Dynamic PET studies were performed in three Papio anubis baboons. The animals were injected intravenously first with 11C-labeled (+)-McN5652([11C](+)McN5652), then with pharmacologically inactive enantiomer 11C-labeled (-)-McN5652 ([11C](-)McN5652)
