Clinical significance of abnormal high signal intensity of left ventricular myocardium by gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The significance of abnormal high signal intensity observed in left ventricular myocardium by gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA) enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients was assessed by comparison with T1-weighted MR imaging, thallium-201 (201Tl) myocardial scintigraphy, radionuclide angiocardiography, M-mode echocardiography, electrocardiography, and chest radiography. The 16 patients were divided into three groups: 8 patients (group I) with abnormal high signal intensity before and after Gd-DTPA enhancement, 4 (group II) with abnormal high signal intensity only after enhancement and 4 (group III) without abnormal high signal intensity. Thallium-201 myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed 4 of the 8 patients in group I, 3 of the 4 patients in group II and only 1 of the 4 patients in group III had abnormalities of regional 201Tl uptake in the left ventricular myocardium. No significant difference in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was seen between groups I, II, and III (64 +/- 13%, 67 +/- 17% and 71 +/- 7%, respectively) although three patients of group I had LVEF of less than 55%. Left ventricular peak filling rates (PFR) of groups I and II were significantly lower than that of group III (1.90 +/- 0.44, 2.41 +/- 0.43 and 3.37 +/- 0.48 EDV/sec, respectively). Group I had larger end-diastolic left ventricular dimension (LVDd), significantly larger end-systolic left ventricular dimension (LVDs), and smaller % fractional shortening (%FS) than group III (49 +/- 4 vs 42 +/- 6 mm, 31 +/- 5 vs 22 +/- 4 mm, and 38 +/- 8 vs 49 +/- 4%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
