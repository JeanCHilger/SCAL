Clinical application of SPECT to the localization of corticoepileptogenic focus of intractable epilepsy. This paper presented 51 cases of intractable epilepsy, of which 36 were males, and 15 females, with a mean age of 21. They were all verified through CT/MRI, among which 17 were proved to have lesions on the brain, and 34 to have no lesion. Before operation all the patients were identified by SPECT and cerebral blood flow imaging (CBF). During the operation they were monitored under subdural strip electrode ECoG for the localization of corticoepileptogenic focus. The results showed that the sensitivity rate of localization with SPECT for corticoepileptogenic focus location was 97.87%.
