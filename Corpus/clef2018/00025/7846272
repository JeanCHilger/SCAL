Nuclear magnetic resonance tomography as a functional diagnostic method. New approaches to non-invasive quantification of cerebral blood volume and blood flow. This paper presents a brief introduction to the current status of cerebral blood volume and blood flow imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. A new method for the quantitative assessment of regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) on the basis of the indicator dilution theory is described and preliminary quantitative results from healthy volunteers are presented. The mean values for the rCBV are 8.27 +/- 1.85 ml/100 g for grey matter and 3.78 +/- 1.34 ml/100 g for white matter. The mean values for the rCBF are 44.8 +/- 11.29 ml/min/100 g for the grey matter and 20.88 +/- 8.42 ml/min/100 g for the white matter. These results are in good agreement with PET results from the literature.
