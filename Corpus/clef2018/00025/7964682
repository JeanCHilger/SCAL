PET studies in progressive supranuclear palsy. Functional imaging (PET and SPECT) can be used to non-invasively demonstrate the patterns of metabolic and dopaminergic dysfunction associated with progressive supranuclear palsy. In this chapter the findings of published functional imaging studies are reviewed and the value of PET for distinguishing between the various degenerative causes of parkinsonism is discussed.
