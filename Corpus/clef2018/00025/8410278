Lesion-by-lesion comparison of computerized tomography and indium-111-labeled monoclonal antibody C110 radioimmunoscintigraphy in colorectal carcinoma: a multicenter trial. C110 is an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Indium-111-labeled C110 radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) in colorectal cancer was studied in 51 presurgical patients at four institutions. Planar and SPECT images were obtained at least twice between 48 and 96 hr after injection of 5 mCi/5 mg of 111In-C110. Fifty-one patients had 87 biopsy-proven lesions at surgery (57 hepatic, 30 extra-hepatic). Thirty-three patients (64.7%) had positive radionuclide scans, while 32 (62.8%) had positive CT scans (p = NS). While CT was better at overall lesion detection (62.1% versus 56%, p < 0.05), radionuclide scans were better than CT for extra-hepatic disease (60% versus 46.7%, p < 0.01). Hepatic metastases (52.6%) were visualized by Mab scans to selectively concentrate radioactivity. Uptake in draining lymph nodes was a significant limitation, making evaluation of these sites difficult. Indium-111-C110 shows selective uptake in metastatic colorectal cancer, including more than half of all hepatic lesions evaluated.
