Comparison of defect size between thallium-201 and technetium-99m tetrofosmin myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease. Defect size on exercise-rest technetium (Tc)-99m tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion imaging was compared with that on exercise-reinjection thallium-201 imaging with 20 patients with 1-vessel coronary artery disease. In each patient, exercise-reinjection thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and exercise-rest Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT imaging were performed. For visual analysis of the obtained SPECT images, the left ventricular myocardium was divided into 20 segments based on 3 short-axis slices from the apical, middle, and basal ventricular levels. For quantitative analysis, a square region of interest was placed on the center of each segment which was used for visual analysis, and relative regional activity to the normal reference region was calculated for each segment. By visual interpretation of the images, exercise Tc-99m tetrofosmin imaging showed a smaller defect size than exercise thallium-201 imaging (6.9 +/- 3.9 vs 8.8 +/- 3.0 segments, p <0.01). In contrast, rest Tc-99m tetrofosmin imaging showed a defect size similar to that on reinjection thallium-201 imaging (5.9 +/- 3.6 vs 5.6 +/- 3.9 segments, p = NS). Similarly, the mean defect sizes during exercise determined by quantitative analysis were smaller on Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT than those on thallium-201 SPECT at all tested threshold cutoff points ranging from 50% to 70%, whereas there were no significant differences in defect sizes between rest Tc-99m tetrofosmin and reinjection thallium-201 imaging. These data indicate that exercise Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT defect size determined either by visual analysis or by quantitative analysis may be smaller than on exercise thallium-201 SPECT.
