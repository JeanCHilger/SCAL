Evaluation of 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl alpha-fluoroalkyl-alpha-hydroxy-alpha-phenylacetates as potential ligands for the study of muscarinic receptor density by positron emission tomography. Both 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl alpha-(1-fluoroeth-2-yl)-alpha-hydroxy-alpha-phenylacetate (FQNE, 5) and 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl alpha-(1-fluoropent-5-yl)-alpha-hydroxy-alpha-phenylacetate (FQNPe, 6) were prepared and evaluated as potential candidates for the determination of muscarinic cholinergic receptor (mAChR) density by positron emission tomography (PET). The results of in vitro binding assays demonstrated that although both 5 and 6 had high binding affinities for m1 and m2 mAChR subtypes, 6 displayed a higher affinity (nM, m1 KD, 0.45, m2
