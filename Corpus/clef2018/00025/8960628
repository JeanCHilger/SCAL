Quantitative PET measurements of regional myocardial blood flow: observations in humans with ischemic heart disease. This review focuses on several related issues concerning positron emission tomography measurements of regional myocardial blood flow using 13-N-ammonia in humans. The effect of partial volume correction on estimates of K1, the model parameter describing myocardial blood flow, is considered. In addition a new method for computing K1 images of myocardial flow distribution is briefly described and compared to a standard method. Potential differences between K1 and equilibrium levels of 13-N-ammonia in the myocardium for estimation of myocardial blood flow are discussed also. The issue of heterogeneity of myocardial blood flow and flow reserve in normal volunteers is considered from the clinical point of view in terms of evaluation of patients with ischemic heart disease. Finally, the use of absolute measurement of adenosine-stimulated myocardial blood flow to assess physiological significance of coronary artery stenoses is addressed.
