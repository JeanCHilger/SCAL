Noninvasive neuroinvestigation in liver disease. The advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) and of single photon and positron emission tomography (SPET:PET) has allowed acquisition of data, not otherwise available, on cerebral metabolic function in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Hyperintensity of the globus pallidus has been observed in cerebral T1-weighted MR images in patients with sub-clinical or overt hepatic encephalopathy, most likely due to the deposition of manganese these trace metal deposits reflect either intoxication or the presence of an adaptive process leading to improved efficacy of ammonia detoxification by astrocytes. Cerebral 31P MRS has shown that there is no primary deficit in energy metabolism in patients with hepatic encephalopathy, but rather an impairment of phospholipid membrane metabolism
