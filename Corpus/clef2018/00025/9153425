Two reactive site locations and structure-function study of the arrowhead proteinase inhibitors, A and B, using mutagenesis. The arrowhead (Sagittaria sagittifolia, Linn.) proteinase inhibitor A and B are double-headed and multifunctional, consisting of 179 amino acid residues with three disulfide bridges. Both their primary structures and cDNA sequences have been elucidated [Yang, H. L., Luo, R. S., Wang, L. X., Zhu, D. X., & Chi, C. W. (1992) J. Biochem. 111, 537 Xu, W. F., Tao, W. K., Gong, Z.
