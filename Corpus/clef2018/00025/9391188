The role of technetium-99m sestamibi single photon emission tomography in the follow-up of malignant melanoma and the detection of lymph node metastases. In the follow-up of patients with malignant melanoma treated by surgical resection of the cutaneous tumour, it is important to achieve early detection of possible lymph node metastasis. In many cases, clinical examination alone will not be sufficient. In our study, single-photon emission tomography (SPET) with technetium-99m sestamibi (MIBI) was used in the assessment of 30 patients with previously resected malignant melanoma when the clinical examination raised the suspicion of lymph node metastasis. Using MIBI, 16 out of 17 lymph node metastases were detected and confirmed by histology. No false-positive results were obtained during this prospective study. It is concluded that MIBI scintigraphy may be useful in the early detection of lymph node metastases of malignant melanomas. If our preliminary results are confirmed, early detection of lymph node metastasis of previously resected malignant melanoma by 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy may have a significant impact on the management of these patients.
