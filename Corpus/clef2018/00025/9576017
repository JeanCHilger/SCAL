Toxicity and radiation dosage of 2-(18F)-2-desoxy-D-glucose in positron emission tomography. 2-[18F]-FDG, a non-physiological glucose analogue, is the most important positron-emission- tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical. As an example we refer to the production of 2-[18F]-FDG at the research center in Karlsruhe. 2-[18F]-FDG is synthesized in a "no carrier added" process. It is delivered at a maximal filling volume of 10 ml from a 14.5 ml batch with a batch-to-batch yield fluctuation from 5075 to 50,750 MBq and a specific activity from 1 to 10 GBq/mumol. The residual remaining synthesis reagents like solvents or catalysts have no toxicological relevance. The applicated dose per patient is in a range from 185 to 370 MBq and 1000 times lower than the correlating concentrations of stable FDG which can be regarded harmless in animals. 2-[18F]-FDG does not interfere with normal glucose metabolism. It is taken up by cells and phosphorylated to 2-[18F]-FDG-6-phosphate. The following dephosphorylation step is slow and the labeled compound is retained over several hours within the cells. Non-metabolized 2-[18F]-FDG is excreted rapidly in the urine to an extent of about 16% after 60 min, and 50% after 135 min, respectively. Fluorine-18F decays by emission of 511 KeV gamma photons. The whole body effective dose is reported to be 21 to 27 microSv/MBq. In case of an intravenous injection of 370 MBq this leads to a total dose of 7.8 to 10 mSv. The critical organ is the bladder wall (radiation dose 120 to 170 microSv/MBq or 80 to 100 mrem/mCi). The risk of a radiation induced late malignoma at 10 mSv can be estimated to be 1:2000. The genetical risk as a consequence of FDG-PET diagnostics would be 1:100,000 to 2:100,000 for dominant, and 5 times higher for recessive mutations.
