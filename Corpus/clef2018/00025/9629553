Tau protein. A potential biological indicator for early detection of Alzheimer disease. In 40 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), in 5 patients with non-AD dementia and in 36 cognitively normal controls the concentration of protein tau was determined in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Of the AD patients, 19 were very mildly demented (MMSE score from 25 to 28). Even in these patients, CSF tau was significantly more elevated than in controls. In the non-AD patients protein tau was less increased. Among the AD patients there was no association between CSF tau and severity of cognitive impairment or deficit in cerebral blood flow, determined by SPECT. Our findings suggest that CSF tau may be elevated even at the predementia stage of AD and be useful as a biological marker for the early recognition of the disease.
