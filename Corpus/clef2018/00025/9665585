Functional network differences in schizophrenia: a rCBF study of semantic processing. Studies of regional cerebral blood flow in patients with schizophrenia have led to the idea that dysfunctional neurocircuitry may play a role in patients' cognitive deficits. The present PET study was designed to explore this idea by comparing the functional neural networks associated with semantic processing for patients and normal controls through structural equation modeling (path analysis). The patients showed significantly different neural interactions among frontal regions, between the frontal and temporal cortices, and between the frontal lobe and anterior cingulate than controls. These discrepancies were especially striking given there were minimal group differences in task performance. Results suggest that schizophrenia involves a neural abnormality that is evident in functional networks during cognitive performance.
