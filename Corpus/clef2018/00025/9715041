Seroepidemiology of Toxoplasma gondii infection among dogs in Taipei, Taiwan. Seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in dogs was investigated in Taipei from July 1995 to June 1996 by the latex agglutination assay. A total of 289 serum samples were taken from stray and domestic dogs as well as from dogs in randomly selected animal hospitals and pet stores. The overall seroprevalence among all dogs was 24.6% (71/289). With regard to the source of the dogs, the seropositivity was 15.4% (10/65) for dogs in animal hospitals, 16.3% (7/43) for dogs in pet stores, 15.5% (11/71) for domestic dogs and 39.1% (43/110) for stray dogs. The seropositivity of stray dogs was significantly higher than that of the domestic dogs (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference among the randomly selected places or dog strains (P > 0.05).
