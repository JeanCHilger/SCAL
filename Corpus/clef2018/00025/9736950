The evaluation of patients with ischemic cerebral lesions by CT, SPECT and qEEG in acute, subacute and chronic phases. SPECT, EEG AND CT scan offer information with several pathophysiologic meanings. Their results vary with time and according to the vascular affected territory.We wanted to study how the sensibility varies and the relationship with the clinic of SPECT, qEEG and CT scan in the acute, subacute and chronic stages and according to the vascular affected territory. We also wanted to analyze the several pathophysiologic aspects of the cerebral ischemia.Thirty-six patients with symptoms of hemispheric stroke were evaluated with CT scan, qEEG, SPECT99mTc-HMPAO during the acute (0-5 days), subacute (0-15 days) and chronic (16 days to 1 year) stages.The decrease of ipsilateral CBF depend on the time (p = 0.0061), being not very frequent during the two first weeks. The qEEG was the most sensitive study in the first phase, its sensibility did not depend on the vascular affected territory and was dependent on the time (p = 0.0011), diminishing in the chronic phase. The slow activity was habitually ipsilateral. The CT scan was the less sensitive study.After 24 hours and until the second week, there is habitually an increase of the ipsilateral rCBF. The luxury perfusion could explain the fogging effect in the CT scan. The slow activity of the qEEG represents the alteration of the oxygen metabolism. The interpretation of the variation of the CBF and the qEEG allow us to define oligemia of the ischemia and between reactive hyperemia and the increase of CBF due to the necrotic tissue.
