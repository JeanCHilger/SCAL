Articular nociception induced by endothelin-1, carrageenan and LPS in naive and previously inflamed knee-joints in the rat: inhibition by endothelin receptor antagonists. Endothelin-1, unlike the selective endothelin ETB receptor agonist sarafotoxin S6c, causes nociception in the rat when injected intraarticularly into the naive knee-joint. By using selective antagonists, the present study further characterizes the receptors underlying the articular nociceptive actions of endothelin-1, as well as the possible contribution of endogenous endothelins towards nociception induced by carrageenan or E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in this tissue. Nociception was evaluated by placing the animal for 1 min each hour on a revolving (3 rpm) cylinder and measuring the increase in time the hindpaw of the limb affected by the intra-articular (i.a.) injection of the nociceptive agent, failed to touch its metallic surface (i.e. paw elevation time, PET). In naive joints, endothelin-1 (120 pmol) increased the area under the PET curve (AUC 0-6 h, in arbitrary units) from 61+/-3 (control) to 156+/-12. This nociceptive effect was reduced by prior intravenous (i.v.) injection of the mixed ET(A)/ET(B)receptor antagonist bosentan (by 54 and 73% with 10 and 30 mg/kg) or i.a. administration of the selective ETA receptor antagonist BQ-123 (cyclo [D-Asp-Pro-D-Val-Leu] by approximately/= 45% with 10 or 30 nmol), but was unaffected by the selective ET(B) receptor antagonist BQ-788 (N-cis-2,6-dimethyl-piperidinocarbonyl-L-gamma-methoxycarbonyl- tryptophanil-D-norleucine
