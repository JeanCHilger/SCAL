Orbital scintigraphy with [111In-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-D-phe1]-octreotide predicts the clinical response to corticosteroid therapy in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy. Corticosteroid treatment is successfully used in Graves' ophthalmopathy, and its effect varies according to the phase of the disease. The infiltration of the orbit by activated lymphocytes may explain the effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy. Scintigraphy with [111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-octreotide was recently used to reveal the presence of activated lymphocytes in foci of autoimmune diseases, because elevated amounts of somatostatin receptors are expressed in the surface of these cells. The aim of the current study was to evaluate whether the degree of orbital [111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-octreotide uptake is able to predict the response to corticosteroid therapy in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy. Ten patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy entered the study. In all patients scintigraphy was performed, and subsequently, corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, 1 g i.v. for 2 consecutive days a week for 6 weeks) was given. Clinical activity of Graves' ophthalmopathy was evaluated before and after treatment by calculating the ophthalmopathy index (OI). Planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images of the head were obtained 24 h after the i.v. injection of 120-190 MBq of [111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-octreotide. Radioligand uptake within each orbit (O) and brain (B) was measured using the region of interests (ROI) method and the O-to-B ratio was determined. According to the O-to-B ratio, the images were classified using the following three points score: 0 = O-to-B ratio < or =1 1 = O-to-B ratio between 1 and 2.5
