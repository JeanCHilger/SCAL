Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose cardiac imaging using a modified scintillation camera. Conventional 201TI and hexakis 2-methoxy-2-isobutyl isonitrile studies are less accurate as compared to FDG PET in the prediction of functional recovery after revascularization in patients with injured but viable myocardium. The introduction of a dual-head variable-angle-geometry scintillation camera equipped with thicker crystals (5/8 in.) and high-resolution, ultrahigh-energy collimators capable of 511 keV imaging has permitted FDG SPECT to provide information equivalent to that of PET for the detection of injured but viable myocardium in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease. The development of standardized glucose-loading protocols, including glucose-insulin-potassium infusion and the potential use of nicotinic acid derivatives, has simplified the method of obtaining consistently good-to-excellent quality FDG SPECT cardiac studies. FDG SPECT may become the modality of choice for evaluating injured but viable myocardium because of enhanced availability of FDG, logistics, patient convenience, accuracy and cost-effectiveness compared to PET.
