Lack of prognostic significance of SPECT abnormalities in non-demented elderly subjects with memory loss. To determine if hypoperfusion abnormalities on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are associated with poorer cognitive function at baseline or increased risk of decline in cognitive function and progression to dementia in memory-impaired but non-demented elderly subjects meeting the criteria for aging associated cognitive decline (AACD).Cross sectional study of 36 AACD subjects comparing hexamethyl propylene-amine oxime (HMPAO) SPECT results rated by visual inspection with base line cognitive functioning. Prospective study of these AACD subjects with clinical and neuropsychological follow-up over 35 months.The memory clinic and nuclear medicine unit of a university teaching hospital.Thirty-six subjects meeting the criteria for AACD recruited from patients seen on a physician referral basis.1) Baseline cognitive function as measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Boston naming, Logical Memory I subtest of the WAIS-R, and verbal fluency, correlated with SPECT status. 2) Decline in cognitive function as measured by clinical exam and the MMSE, with progression to dementia on follow-up being correlated with SPECT status at baseline.18 of the 36 subjects progressed to dementia (probable Alzheimer's Disease) over follow-up. No correlation was found between the presence or absence of SPECT abnormality and MMSE or other cognitive measures. There was no correlation between the presence or absence of SPECT abnormality at initial examination, and cognitive decline according to the MMSE, or with the occurrence of clinical dementia on follow-up.We conclude that SPECT abnormalities assessed by visual inspection do not correlate with severity of impairment in AACD individuals, and are not useful in predicting progression to dementia in AACD subjects.
