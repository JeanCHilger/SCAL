Reorganized cerebral metabolic interactions in temporal lobe epilepsy. Patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy demonstrate language impairments that are not well understood. To explore abnormal patterns of brain functional connections with respect to language processing, we applied a principal component analysis to resting regional cerebral metabolic data obtained with positron emission tomography in patients with right- and left-sided temporal lobe epilepsy and controls. Two principal components were expressed differentially among the groups. One principal component comprised a pattern of metabolic interactions involving left inferior frontal and left superior temporal regions-corresponding to Broca's and Wernicke's areas, respectively-and right mesial temporal cortex and right thalamus. Functional couplings between these brain regions were abnormally enhanced in the left-sided epilepsy patients. The right thalamic left superior temporal coupling was also abnormally enhanced in the right-sided epilepsy patients, but differentially from that in the left-sided patients. The other principal component was characterized by a pattern of metabolic interactions involving right and left mid prefrontal and right superior temporal cortex. Although both the right- and left-sided epilepsy patients showed decreased functional couplings between left mid prefrontal and the other brain regions, a weaker right-left mid prefrontal coupling in the left-sided epilepsy patients best distinguished them from the right-sided patients. The two mutually independent, abnormal metabolic patterns each predicted verbal intelligence deficits in the patients. The findings suggest a site-dependent reorganization of two independent, language-subserving pathways in temporal lobe epilepsy.
