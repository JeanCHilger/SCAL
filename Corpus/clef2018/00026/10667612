Dopamine as the wind of the psychotic fire: new evidence from brain imaging studies. Abnormalities of dopamine function in schizophrenia are suggested by the common antidopaminergic properties of antipsychotic medications. However, direct evidence of a hyperdopaminergic state in schizophrenia has been difficult to demonstrate, given the difficulty of measuring dopamine transmission in the living human brain. This situation is rapidly changing. Recent developments in positron emission tomography and single-photon emission tomographic techniques enabled measurement of acute fluctuation of synaptic dopamine in the vicinity of D2 receptors. Using this technique, we, and others, measured the increase in dopamine transmission following acute amphetamine challenge in untreated patients with schizophrenia and matched healthy subjects. Following a brief overview of these new brain imaging techniques, the main results derived with this method in patients with schizophrenia are described: (1) amphetamine-induced dopamine release is elevated in patients with schizophrenia, supporting the idea that schizophrenia is associated with dysregulation of dopamine transmission (2) following amphetamine, hyperactivity of dopamine transmission is associated with activation of psychotic symptomatology
