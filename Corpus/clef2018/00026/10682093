Evidence that gender difference affects peritoneal dialysis capacity in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients. The progression of renal disease is reported to be more rapid in male patients than in premenopausal females. However, few studies compare the difference in dialysis therapy between males and females. We compared the efficacy of peritoneal dialysis capacity, using measurements of retention volume and pelvic cavity by helical section of computed tomography (CT) in 6 male and 6 female patients. The patients did not differ significantly in age (males: 54 +/- 3 years female: 56 +/- 4 years). Males were heavier than females (p < 0.05). Retention volume in the visceral cavity was significantly larger in males (1787 +/- 43 mL) than in females (1580 +/- 59 mL) (p < 0.05). Peritoneal dialysis capacity was evaluated by peritoneal equilibration test (PET). Although no significant differences were observed in the PET data, when the PET results at 4 hours were divided by body weight in kilograms, a significant difference between males and females was seen (p < 0.05). There was a mild, but not significant, correlation between the volume of the pelvis as measured by helical CT and the PET data per kilogram body weight (p = 0.07). These results suggest that gender differences in peritoneal dialysis capacity relate partially to the difference in pelvic cavity volume.
