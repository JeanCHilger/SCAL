Clinical relevance of gallium-67 scintigraphy in lymphoma before and after therapy. The clinical impact of gallium-67 scintigraphy before and after therapy for lymphoma remains controversial. The aims of this study were: (1) to compare the staging of lymphoma by 67Ga scintigraphy only with staging by clinical examination and conventional imaging (CI), and (2) to analyse the clinical relevance of both 67Ga imaging and CI after treatment. From March 1995 to November 1998, 86 67Ga scintigraphy studies were performed in 62 patients with Hodgkin's disease (n=52) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=10). 67Ga scintigraphy was performed at diagnosis (n=44) or after therapy (n=42) using 185-220 MBq 67Ga citrate and planar and single-photon emission tomography (SPET) studies. Treatment comprised radiotherapy, chemotherapy or combined modalities. CI included plain chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen/pelvis, ultrasound of the abdomen, lymphography, bone marrow biopsy and, when necessary, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bone scintigraphy. For individual suspected sites of disease before treatment, complete agreement between clinical examination and CI on the one hand and 67Ga scintigraphy on the other hand was observed in 25/44 patients (57% 95% confidence interval 41%-72%). Clinical examination and CI showed more sites than did 67Ga scintigraphy in 12/44 patients (27%) and 67Ga imaging demonstrated more sites than CI in 6/44 patients (11%). The clinical stage of the disease as assessed using 67Ga scintigraphy only was in agreement with that using all diagnostic procedures in 34/44 patients (77%
