Are animal studies of antipsychotics appropriately dosed? Lessons from the bedside to the bench. Animal models are crucial for understanding the mechanism of action of antipsychotics. However, the dose of an antipsychotic in animal studies is often arbitrarily chosen, with haloperidol 1 mg/kg being a rather common standard. Recent clinical positron emission tomography (PET) studies in patients show all antipsychotics to block dopamine D2 receptors, and most are effective at doses that lead to 60% to 80% D2 occupancy. When occupancy exceeds 80%, the incidence of side effects rises sharply. To use this "bedside" information to inform the "bench," we measured D2 occupancy in rats using a method similar in principle to the [11C]-raclopride PET method in humans. We found that: 1) as in humans, haloperidol is effective in animal models of antipsychotic action when D2 occupancy > 70% and leads to effects in models of extrapyramidal side effects when D2 occupancy is > 80% 2) very low doses, 0.06 mg/kg/sc, cause acute D2 occupancy of 75%
