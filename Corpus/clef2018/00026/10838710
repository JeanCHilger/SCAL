Polymeric chondroitin sulfate vs. monomeric glucosamine for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Two potentially chondro-protective substances are compared with each other: polymeric chondroitin sulfate and monomeric glucosamine. Chondroitin-sulfate is characterized by tropism for cartilage, i.e. it is preferentially incorporated into cartilagenous tissue. This quality could be of interest in the SPECT-analysis of osteoarthritic knee joints. In contrast to the classic agents Ibuprofen and Indomethacin, the antiinflammatory action of chondroitin-sulfate is less prominent, but the drug does not show any toxic side effects. Glucosamine on the other hand is a multifunctional precursor of the glycosaminoglycan synthesis in general. It lacks the cartilage tropism of chondroitin-sulfate. Into what sort of a glycosaminoglycan glucosamine is eventually integrated, depends therefore on the nature of the cells participating in the biosynthesis.
