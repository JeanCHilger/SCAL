Reperfusion and metabolic recovery of brain tissue and clinical outcome after ischemic stroke and thrombolytic therapy. It is unclear from recent clinical trials whether thrombolytic agents are capable of facilitating reperfusion and metabolic recovery over time or whether a beneficial effect is counteracted by an increase in the risk of brain hemorrhage. We studied the effect of thrombolytic treatment on metabolic recovery after reperfusion and clinical outcome.Patients were prospectively studied with (99m)Tc-ethyl cysteinate dimer single photon emission computed tomography ((99m)Tc-ECD-SPECT) before treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA 0.9 mg/kg IVPatients with metabolic recovery (n=28) had a better chance of being functionally unimpaired 3 months after stroke than patients without recovery (n=24) (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.09 to 18.89) and had smaller infarcts on follow-up CT (36+/-38 versus 167+/-162 mL), regardless of whether metabolic recovery was observed within 6 to 8 hours of treatment or at 7 days. None of the 28 patients with metabolic recovery had a fatal parenchymal hemorrhage versus 5 of 24 patients without recovery (P=0.016). Treatment did not affect the incidence of brain tissue metabolic recovery.Brain tissue metabolic recovery after ischemic stroke was associated with a beneficial effect on clinical outcome and was not facilitated by treatment with 0.9 mg of intravenous rTPA.
