Dipyridamole administration at the end of an insufficient exercise Tc-99m MIBI SPECT improves detection of multivessel coronary artery disease in patients with previous myocardial infarction. To demonstrate that the administration of dipyridamole at the end of an insufficient maximal subjective exercise test can improve the diagnostic accuracy of single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with previous myocardial infarction, 209 consecutive patients were studied with technetium-99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography and coronary angiography. Patients were divided in 3 groups: group 1, 107 patients with sufficient exercise testing group 2, 55 patients with insufficient exercise testing
