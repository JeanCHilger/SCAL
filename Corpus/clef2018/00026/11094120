18F-fluorodopa PET study of striatal dopamine uptake in the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies. Using (18)F-fluorodopa PET and a constant 0.0062 influx rate in the putamen, dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 7) was distinguished from AD (n = 10) with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 100%. A constant 0.0071 influx rate in the caudate yielded a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 100% for distinction of the two disorders. Despite a limited sample size, these findings suggest that assessing nigrostriatal dopaminergic function with (18)F-fluorodopa PET may be a useful diagnostic aid in cases of dementia with Lewy bodies while patients are alive.
