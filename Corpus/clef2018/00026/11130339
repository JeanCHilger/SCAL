Is a low-dose Tc-99m-MIBI protocol suitable for first-pass RNV? Tc-99m-labelled radiopharmaceuticals, such as Tc-99m-sestamibi (Tc-99m-MIBI), offer the opportunity to measure myocardial perfusion and function with one injection only. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether first-pass (FP) radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) consecutively followed by myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) may be performed according to a low-dose MIBI 1-day protocol using a multi-crystal gamma camera. Two hundred and seventy consecutive, predominantly obese [61% with a body mass index (BMI) of >25 kg x m(-2)] patients (169 male, 101 female), referred for myocardial perfusion SPECT with Tc-99m-MIBI [4 MBq x kg(-1) (>300 MBq) at stress 9 MBq x kg(-1) (> 650 MBq) at rest], were studied with FP RNV prior to SPECT. Bicycle ergometry (29%), dobutamine (6%) or dipyridamole stress (65%) was performed. Adequate count (ct) statistics for FP RNV were defined as follows: (1) > 2000 cts within the background-corrected, end-diastolic (ED), left ventricular (LV) region of interest (ROI) of the representative cycle
