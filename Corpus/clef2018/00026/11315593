High uptake of L-3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine in pilocytic astrocytomas. Despite a favourable prognosis, pilocytic astrocytomas may exhibit signs of malignancy on various neuroimaging modalities. This retrospective analysis was conducted to determine whether scintigraphic features of malignancy are also found on single-photon emission tomography (SPET) using L-3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine (IMT) as a tracer. Twenty patients with pilocytic astrocytomas were retrospectively selected from a large series of patients referred for the evaluation of primary or recurrent brain tumours. IMT SPET was performed in 16 patients, positron emission tomography (PET) using 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) was available in 10 of the patients and SPET using technetium-99m tetrofosmin or thallium-201 had been performed in 11. Image analysis was performed using standard protocols to determine how many patients exceeded the respective thresholds of malignancy. Features of malignancy were found in 7/16 IMT SPET studies, in 7/10 FDG PET studies and in 7/11 of the residual SPET investigations. A significant correlation of tumour size and IMT uptake in primary pilocytic astrocytomas indicated partial volume effects to partly account for the differential uptake behaviour (n = 10, r = 0.87, P < 0.05). Differences in IMT uptake in primaries (1.7 +/- 0.6, n = 10) and in recurrent tumours (2.3 +/- 0.7, n = 6) did not attain statistical significance. IMT SPET results indicative of malignancy are regularly found in pilocytic astrocytomas, despite their good prognosis. No uptake may be detected in largely cystic or in small tumours.
