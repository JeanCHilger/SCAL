CDC won't recommend non-occupational PET. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises not using a morning-after pill for non-occupational HIV exposures, except those that result from sexual assault. Postexposure therapy (PET), a complicated medical intervention, requires further studies to determine its effectiveness for HIV prevention. Researchers are concerned that PET could lead to increased transmission rates if people see it as a follow up to risky behavior and become less conscientious about safe sexual practices. PET has serious side effects, and one-third of patients do not complete the treatment, which may increase the risk of developing drug resistance to HIV. Although PET appears to reduce the risk of HIV transmission via exposure to infected blood in the workplace, there is not enough data to prove its efficacy against exposure through sexual relations.
