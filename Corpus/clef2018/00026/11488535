Interdependence of regional and global cerebral blood flow during visual stimulation: an O-15-butanol positron emission tomography study. The authors investigated the influence of variations in global cerebral blood flow (gCBF) on regional flow changes during visual stimulation. Global flow was varied using different end-expiratory CO2 values (PETCO2) between 20 and 70 mm Hg. Visual stimulation was performed with a red LED-array flashing at 8 Hz. Blood flow was measured with 0-15-butanol, continuous arterial blood sampling, and positron emission tomography (PET). Global flow changes surpassed the published values of O-15-H2O studies, better fitting the results of the inert gas technique (gCBF at 20, 40, and 70 mm Hg PETCO2 +/- SD was 31 +/- 4, 48 +/- 13, and 160 +/- 50 mL 100 g(-1) min(-1), respectively). The relation between PETCO2 and CBF in the current study was best described by an exponential rather than a linear function. At low PETCO2, the activation-induced flow changes are moderately damped, whereas at high PETCO2, they are nearly lost (deltaCBF (+/-SD): 52% +/- 25%, 68% +/- 22%, 16% +/- 25% at PETCO2 = 20, 40, 70 mm Hg, respectively).
