Normal IPT and IBZM SPECT in drug-naive and levodopa-treated idiopathic restless legs syndrome. Fourteen drug-naive and 11 levodopa-treated patients with idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS), and 10 controls age-matched to each RLS group separately were examined with polysomnography (PSG), [(123)I]-(N)-(3-iodopropen-2-yl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl) tropane ((123)I-IPT) SPECT, and [(123)I]-(S)-2-hydroxy-3-iodo-6-methoxy-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl] benzamide ((123)I-IBZM) SPECT. Drug-naive and levodopa-treated patients with RLS and controls showed similar striatal dopamine transporter and dopamine D(2)-receptor binding, the latter declining with age. The authors conclude that striatal dopamine transporter and receptor density is normal in drug-naive and levodopa-treated patients with RLS.
