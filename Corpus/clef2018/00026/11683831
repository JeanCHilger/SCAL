Multicenter study of the frequency of contact allergy to gold. Gold sodium thiosulfate (GSTS) is reputed to be the most reliable gold antigen, but control studies are still required. Although Koreans have more varied sources of contact with gold, such as herbal medicines with gold coatings and indwelling gold acupuncture needles, no epidemiological studies have been performed. This study examined the frequency and sources of contact allergy to gold in South Korea by a multicenter study. Patch testing with 0.5% GSTS in pet. was conducted in 255 eczema patients and 58 control subjects. Results were observed at 21 days (D) to ensure there were no undetected late reactions in 54 observed patients and 47 controls. 8 (3.1%) of the 255 patients reacted positively to GSTS, including 1 with a late reaction. 1 of the 58 controls showed a positive reaction to GSTS on D4 with a negative reaction on D14. Clinical relevance was lacking in the patients with positive reactions. Unexpectedly, the above particular sources of gold contact gave rise to few allergic reactions in our patients.
