Management of anorexia in the cat. One of the most frequent motivations for seeking veterinary attention for a cat is when the owner recognises a loss of normal appetite in his pet. The medical term for a lack of appetite for food is 'anorexia', and it may be partial or complete. While anorexia is a common manifestation of disease, the mechanisms underlying decreased food intake are complex and not completely understood. The regulation of appetite involves interaction of external stimuli with signals from the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. Aberrations in any of the internal control systems for hunger and satiety, or changes in external factors such as diet or feeding environment, can result in partial or total anorexia. The challenge for the practitioner is not only to diagnose and treat the underlying condition, but to recognise at what point inadequate food intake has or will impinge on the patient's nutritional status to the extent that it might deleteriously affect clinical outcome. It is also important to bear in mind the significance that the patient's appetite and food intake has for the cat owner in his overall perception of his pet's condition and quality of life.
