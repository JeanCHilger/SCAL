Cloning and expression of Buthus martensii Karsch scorpion toxin gene (BmK IT3) in Escherichia coli. According to the reported sequence of Buthus martensii Karsch scorpion toxin gene (BmK IT3), we synthesized two primers, which were complementary in a region. By the means of PCR, we got the gene. The gene was fused in expression vector pET-28a, which gave rise to a recombinant plasmid pET(IT3R). Then it was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). With IPTG induction, the gene was efficiently expressed. And the fusion product was soluble.
