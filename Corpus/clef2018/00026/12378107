Spinal cord stimulation and cerebral blood flow in stroke: personal experience. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) can increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) and improve stroke patients. In order to better understand the haemodynamic changes underlining the clinical improvement, we have studied with transcranial Doppler (TCD), SPECT and NIRS 18 patients harbouring a stroke. SPECT Group: An increase of regional CBF during SCS was measured far from the stroke areas in 9 patients, further decrease in CBF was found in 2, no changes in 1. TCD Group: An increase of CBF velocities during SCS was found in 4 patients, no changes in 6, a decrease in 1. NIRS Group: Data consistent with and increase in CBF were obtained during SCS in the only patient undergone such a study. In 6 patients studied with different techniques, data obtained fitted only in 2 patients. In 3 patients no changes in TCD faced with changes in SPECT. In one case an improvement in TCD was evident in the left while an improvement of SPECT was shown in the right site. SCS is a valid therapeutic tool in stroke patient even if, as matter of fact, parallelism between clinical and haemodynamic changes during SCS is not demonstrated in our patients, rising the question on the role of ischemic penumbra in mediating clinical improvement.
