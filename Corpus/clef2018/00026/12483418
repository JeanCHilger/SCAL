PET imaging of somatostatin receptors: design, synthesis and preclinical evaluation of a novel 18F-labelled, carbohydrated analogue of octreotide. Because of the excellent nuclear properties of fluorine-18 and the growing interest in somatostatin receptor (sst) scintigraphy with PET, a novel carbohydrated (18)F-labelled sst ligand was developed and preclinically evaluated. Synthesis of N(alpha)-(1-deoxy- D-fructosyl)- N(epsilon)-(2-[(18)F]fluoropropionyl)-Lys(0)-Tyr(3)-octreotate ([(18)F]FP-Gluc-TOCA) was completed in approximately 3 h (20%-30% yield). [(19)F]FP-Gluc-TOCA showed no affinity to hsst1 and hsst3, moderate affinity to hsst4 (IC(50): 437+/-84 n M) and hsst5 (IC(50): 123+/-8.8 n M) and very high affinity to hsst2 (IC(50): 2.8+/-0.4 n M). As a result of carbohydration, lipophilicity of [(18)F]FP-Gluc-TOCA was found to be low (lg P(OW)=-1.70+/-0.02). In mice, the tracer was rapidly cleared via renal excretion (kidneys: 8.69%+/-1.09%ID/g) and showed low uptake in liver (0.72%+/-0.14%ID/g) and intestine (1.88%+/-0.52%ID/g) and high tumour uptake (13.54%+/-1.47%ID/g) (all data at 1 h p.i.). Tumour to non-tumour ratios at 60 min p.i. reached 25, 19, 7, 1.6 and 56 for blood, liver, intestine, kidney and muscle, respectively. A similar biodistribution pattern was observed in pancreatic tumour-bearing rats. Tumour uptake in rats was reduced to 36% and 18% of control (30 and 60 min) by co-injection of 500 microg Tyr(3)-octreotide, demonstrating sst-specific uptake. In a first [(18)F]FP-Gluc-TOCA-PET study of a patient with a metastatic carcinoid in the liver the tracer showed superior pharmacokinetics, e.g. rapid urinary excretion and low uptake in liver, kidney and spleen. Multiple liver lesions (SUVs ranging from 21.4 to 38.0) and previously unknown focal uptake in the abdomen (SUV 10.0) were clearly visible. This is the first report on PET imaging using an (18)F-labelled sst binding peptide it indicates that [(18)F]FP-Gluc-TOCA offers excellent imaging characteristics and allows sst imaging with high tumour to non-tumour contrast.
