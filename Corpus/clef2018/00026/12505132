Cerebral metabolism and risperidone treatment in schizophrenia. This paper compares the metabolic changes associated with risperidone treatment in schizophrenia to those induced by haloperidol, as a representative typical neuroleptic. A group of 11 schizophrenic patients of recent onset underwent two [18F] fluoro-desoxi-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scans at rest: the first one at the moment of the diagnosis, after a minimal treatment with haloperidol followed by wash-out, and the second one after 6 months on risperidone. The study also included 34 patients on chronic haloperidol for comparison. PET images were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM'99) methods. The only change after treatment with risperidone with respect to the baseline was a slight increase in activity in the primary visual area and the right insula. Patients on chronic haloperidol showed increased activity in the motor cortex and cerebellum, as compared to both minimally treated and risperidone-treated patients. The pattern of metabolic changes induced by risperidone appears to be different from that produced by typical antipsychotics.
