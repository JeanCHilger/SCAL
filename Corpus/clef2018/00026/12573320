Radiosynthesis of ML03, a novel positron emission tomography biomarker for targeting epidermal growth factor receptor via the labeling synthon: [11C]acryloyl chloride. An automated procedure for the radiosynthesis of the labeling synthon [11C]acryloyl chloride was developed and applied for labeling several N-acryl amides with carbon-11. [11C]-6-acrylamido-4-(3,4-dichloro-6-fluoroanilino)quinazoline (ML03), a novel PET biomarker targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFr-TK) in cancer, was successfully prepared using this labeled synthon in a fully automated manner. Two other potential anticancer drugs were also labeled using the developed methodology. The potency of ML03 to inhibit autophosphorylation of EGFr-TK was evaluated by an ELISA assay indicating a low IC(50) of 0.037nM.
