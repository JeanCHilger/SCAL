11C-choline PET for the detection of bone and soft tissue tumours in comparison with FDG PET. We assessed and compared the usefulness of C-choline positron emission tomography (PET) with that of 2-[ F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET for the differentiation between benign and malignant bone and soft tissue tumours. A total of 43 patients with 45 lesions were included. C-choline PET and FDG PET were performed from 5 and 40 min, respectively, after injection of 275-370 MBq tracer. PET data were evaluated by using the standardized uptake value (SUV) and were analysed according to the pathological data. C-choline uptake in malignancies was 4.9+/-2.1 (n=14), which was significantly higher than that in benign lesions (2.5+/-1.7, n=31) (P <0.0001). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of C-choline PET were 100%, 64.5% and 75.6%, respectively, when 2.59 of the SUV was used as the cut-off value. The FDG uptake in malignancies was 5.1+/-4.2 (n=14) and was also significantly larger than that in benign lesions 2.9+/-2.9 (n=31) (P<0.003). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FDG PET were 85.7%, 41.9% and 55.6%, respectively (cut-off=1.83). The C-choline uptake in the lesions correlated with FDG uptake ( r=0.61, P<0.003). In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the area under the ROC curve for C-choline PET (area=0.847) was higher than that for FDG PET (area=0.717). This study showed that C-choline PET was superior to FDG PET in differentiation between malignant and benign lesion in bone and soft tissue tumours. C-choline PET might be useful as a screening method for malignant bone and soft tissue tumours.
