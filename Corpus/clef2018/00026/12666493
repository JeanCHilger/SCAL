Multidisciplinary approach of hepatic metastasis of colorectal origin. Surgery remains the only potentially curative treatment for liver metastases. After margin free resection, approximately 30% of the patients present long-term survival. Due to the metastases number and/or volume, only 10 to 15% of the patients are candidates for curative-intent surgery. Thus, the objectives of the diagnostic and therapeutic management are to select adequately the patients for surgery and to improve resection rate by the use of neoadjuvants methods. Positron emission tomography could improve the preoperative detection of hepatic and extrahepatic metastases leading to the exclusion of some patients from useless surgical exploration. For patients with initially resectable tumors, no benefit has been demonstrated for adjuvant chemotherapy. For non resectable metastases, two neoadjuvants methods should be evaluated, chemotherapy to reduce tumor volume and portal vein embolization of the tumor side to improve the hepatic functional reserve and allow larger resection. For non-accessible lesion, selective tumor destruction using radiofrequency offers promising perspectives. In conclusion, the multiplication of the diagnostic and therapeutic methods certainly improve the global management of patients with liver metastases but also makes more difficult the individual choice for the best treatment. For this reason, a multimodal approach is absolutely mandatory.
