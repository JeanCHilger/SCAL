Post-ischemic cyclooxygenase-2 expression is regulated by the extent of cerebral blood flow reduction in non-human primates. We determined whether up to 24 h of ischemia could induce the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the brain of nonhuman primates. Randomized animals were subjected to either a 2 h ischemia (group II n=3) or a 24 h ischemia (group III
