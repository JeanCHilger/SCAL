First experiences with fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) in the evaluation of painful total knee and hip joint replacements. The aim of the study was to describe first experiences using FDG-PET in the examination of painful arthroplasties.12 patients prior to revision of a total hip or knee joint replacement underwent PET. Histopathology, microbiological analysis and intraoperative diagnosis were compared to preoperative PET findings.The analysis of intraoperative findings, of microbiological examinations and of histopathology showed that besides the well known determinants infection and early postoperative granulation tissue, polyethylene wear induced foreign-body reaction was a major cause for increased FDG consumption.In vivo imaging of marked foreign-body tissue reaction induced by polyethylene wear is feasible by FDG-PET. This observation, however, leads to reduced specificity of PET imaging for the diagnosis of periprosthetic infection.
