Clinical application of radioimmunoimaging in the detection of tumors--current status in China. In this article, the development of radioimmunoimaging (RII) in China is reviewed. Since 1984 conventional heterologous specific antibodies (Abs), such as anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and anti-alphafetoprotein (AFP) Abs, have been used to detect cancers of the colon, ovary, lung, liver, etc. Later on, Abs against specific tumor cell-associated antigens have been produced in many institutions and applied clinically, with quite satisfactory results (detection rate ranging from 80-90%). Recently, human monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) are also being prepared. Finally, the existing problems to be overcome are discussed.
