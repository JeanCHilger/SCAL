Prospective analysis of accuracy of positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and endoscopic ultrasonography in staging of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction. Exact preoperative staging of esophageal cancer is essential for accurate prognosis and selection of appropriate treatment modalities.Forty-two patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or the esophagogastric junction suitable for radical esophageal resection were staged with positron emission tomography (PET), spiral computed tomography (CT), and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS).Diagnostic sensitivity for the primary tumor was 83% for PET and 67% for CT for local peritumoral lymph node metastasis, it was 37% for PET and 89% for EUSThe diagnostic value of PET in the staging of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction is limited because of low accuracy in staging of paratumoral and distant lymph nodes. PET does, however, seem to detect organ metastases better than CT.
