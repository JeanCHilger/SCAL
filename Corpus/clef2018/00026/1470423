Quantification of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using 99Tcm-HMPAO and SPECT: choice of the reference region. The effects of the choice of the reference region in determining the relative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using 99Tcm-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) single photon emission tomography (SPECT) have been studied in order to establish or exclude it as a cause of inconsistencies in these studies. Relative rCBF was estimated by normalizing the regional count densities to two reference regions, the cerebellum and the whole slice, in 35 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 25 patients with chronic schizophrenia (SCH) and the same number of matched normal volunteers. The statistical significance of the differences in rCBF between patients and their matched normals varied in the two sets of rCBF data. Smaller differences were highly significant while some larger differences were of less significance with whole slice normalization. The results suggest that the choice of reference region is one of the causes resulting in discrepancies in the results from various centres. The need to use a standard reference region is indicated.
