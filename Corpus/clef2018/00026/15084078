Three-gamma annihilation imaging in positron emission tomography. It is argued that positron annihilation into three photons, although quite rare, could still be used as a new imaging modality of positron emission tomography. The information gained when the three decay photons are detected is significantly higher than in the case of 511 keV two-gamma annihilation. The performance of three-gamma imaging in terms of the required detector properties, spatial resolution and counting rates is discussed. A simple proof-of-principle experiment confirms the feasibility of the new imaging method.
