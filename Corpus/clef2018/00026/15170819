Isoflurane induces dopamine transporter trafficking into the cell cytoplasm. Previous investigations have shown that the binding of a selective hydrophilic positron emission tomography radiotracer for the dopamine transporter (DAT) (2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)nortropane) decreased in monkey striatum during deep isoflurane anesthesia. Immunohistochemistry experiments suggested but did not prove that isoflurane induced a decrease in cell surface DAT. The present investigation was undertaken to demonstrate quantitatively the isoflurane-induced internalization of DAT using a rapid and relatively uncomplicated biochemical technique in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells stably expressing the human DAT (h-DAT) protein. Biotinylation followed by Western blot analysis was used to determine the extent of change in cell surface expression of the DAT under control conditions and in the presence of a clinically relevant concentration of isoflurane. Isoflurane treatment for 30 min resulted in a highly significant decrease in the amount of h-DAT on the cell surface (21 +/- 15% of control P < 0.01) (mean +/- SD
