A comparison of rotation- and blob-based system models for 3D SPECT with depth-dependent detector response. We compare two different implementations of a 3D SPECT system model for iterative reconstruction, both of which compensate for non-uniform photon attenuation and depth-dependent system response. One implementation performs fast rotation of images represented using a basis of rectangular voxels, whereas the other represents images using a basis of rotationally symmetric volume elements. In our simulations the blob-based approach was found to slightly outperform the rotation-based one in terms of the bias-variance tradeoff in the reconstructed images. Their difference can be significant, however, in terms of computational load. The rotation-based method is faster for many typical SPECT reconstruction problems, but the blob-based one can be better-suited to cases where the reconstruction algorithm needs to process one volume element at a time.
