3D RBI-EM reconstruction with spherically-symmetric basis function for SPECT rotating slat collimator. A single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) rotating slat collimator with strip detector acquires distance-weighted plane integral data, along with the attenuation factor and distance-dependent detector response. In order to image a 3D object, the slat collimator device has first to spin around its axis and then rotate around the object to produce 3D projection measurements. Compared to the slice-by-slice 2D reconstruction for the parallel-hole collimator and line integral data, a more complex 3D reconstruction is needed for the slat collimator and plane integral data. In this paper, we propose a 3D RBI-EM reconstruction algorithm with spherically-symmetric basis function, also called 'blobs', for the slat collimator. It has a closed and spherically symmetric analytical expression for the 3D Radon transform, which makes it easier to compute the plane integral than the voxel. It is completely localized in the spatial domain and nearly band-limited in the frequency domain. Its size and shape can be controlled by several parameters to have desired reconstructed image quality. A mathematical lesion phantom study has demonstrated that the blob reconstruction can achieve better contrast-noise trade-offs than the voxel reconstruction without greatly degrading the image resolution. A real lesion phantom study further confirmed this and showed that a slat collimator with CZT detector has better image quality than the conventional parallel-hole collimator with NaI detector. The improvement might be due to both the slat collimation and the better energy resolution of the CZT detector.
