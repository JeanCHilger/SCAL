Considering Fe(II/IV) redox processes as mechanistically relevant to the catalytic hydrogenation of olefins by [PhBP iPr 3]Fe-H x species. Several coordinatively unsaturated pseudotetrahedral iron(II) precursors, [PhBP(iPr)(3)]Fe-R ([PhBP(iPr)(3)] = [PhB(CH(2)P(i)Pr(2))(3)](-) R = Me (2), R = CH(2)Ph (3), R = CH(2)CMe(3) (4)) have been prepared from [PhBP(iPr)(3)]FeCl (1) that serve as precatalysts for the room-temperature hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons (e.g., ethylene, styrene, 2-pentyne) under atmospheric H(2) pressure. The solid-state crystal structures of 2 and 3 are presented. To gain mechanistic insight into the nature of these hydrogenation reactions, a number of [PhBP(iPr)(3)]-supported iron hydrides were prepared and studied. Room-temperature hydrogenation of alkyls 2-4 in the presence of a trapping phosphine ligand affords the iron(IV) trihydride species [PhBP(iPr)(3)]Fe(H)(3)(PR(3)) (PR(3) = PMe(3) (5)
