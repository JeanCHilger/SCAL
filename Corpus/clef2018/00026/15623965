Does I-131-MIBG underestimate skeletal disease burden in neuroblastoma? Controversy persists as to the need for both MIBG and bone scanning in routine evaluation of neuroblastoma.To compare the efficacy of I-131- metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan against that of conventional Tc99m- methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scan for the detection of skeletal deposition of neuroblastoma.The study included 57 patients (36 boys, 21 girls: age range 1-14 years) of neuroblastoma who underwent both bone scan with Tc99m-MDP and I-131-MIBG scan within 15 days of each other at presentation and during follow-up.At presentation 11(19.2%) patients had evidence of skeletal metastases on MDP scan against 7 patients who showed bony secondaries on MIBG scan. Of the 7 patients, with positive MIBG and MDP scans, MDP scan detected 11 sites whereas MIBG scan detected 7 sites. On follow-up study, 3 patients with initial abnormal MDP scan but normal MIBG scan, developed skeletal metastases detectable on MIBG scan, whereas 3 of the 46 patients who had normal MDP and MIBG scan at presentation developed skeletal metastases detectable on MDP scan. MIBG scan was concordant in 2 of them but was normal in the third patient.I-131-MIBG underestimates skeletal disease burden in neuroblastoma. Therefore, Tc99m-MDP bone scan should remain a part of routine assessment of patients with neuroblastoma.
