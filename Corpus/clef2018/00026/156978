Atopy. Atopy should be considered an immunological disorder that may result in several clinical conditions including respiratory disease, allergic dermatitis, food allergy dermatitis, and perhaps flea allergy dermatitis. The clinical course of the disease tends to fluctuate from season to season, which makes objective evaluation of injection therapy difficult. The disease is subject to both familial and environmental influences, and dogs maintain the atopic state throughout their life. The disease cannot be cured however, a combination of symptomatic and specific injection therapy usually provides adequate control of the clinical signs. Owners of atopic dogs should appreciate that their pet has inherently itching skin, a cure for which is unlikely to be found.
