Comparison of the ovine and porcine animal models for biocompatibility testing of vascular prostheses. Evaluation of the pig and sheep models for biocompatibility investigations of vascular prostheses (VP).Comparative analysis of animal experimental investigations involving two different animal models.Commercially available polyester vascular prostheses (PET-VP) were implanted into two different animal models (infrarenal porcine aorta and ovine carotid artery). The costs, surgical handling, patency rate, and healing on the basis of macroscopic, microscopic, and immunohistochemical criteria were analyzed over a period of 3 months.Handling and operating times (63 +/- 10 versus 76 +/- 16 min P = 0.125) did not differ significantly. The cost of the two animal models was comparable. Integration of the VP was complete in the sheep model, but varied in the pig model (two complete, four incomplete). Complete endothelialization of all VPs was observed in the pig, which contrasted with the sheep with complete (circular) endothelialization only in the region of the anastomosis. The thickness of neointima in the region of the anastomosis differed insignificantlyIn the porcine model, extremely good endothelialization of the VP was observed, with formation of a rapid neointimal hyperplasia. The ovine model was characterized by the fact that postoperative follow-up investigations were easy to perform. Complete endothelialization was not observed.
