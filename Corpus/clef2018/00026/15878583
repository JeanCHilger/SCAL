Brain perfusion differences between Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonian features. The patterns of regional cerebral blood flow in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy remain inconsistent.To compare brain perfusion images of 123I-IMP SPECT between Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonian features (MSA-P) and controls.Eighty-two patients with Parkinson's disease, 10 patients with MSA-P and 14 controls were studied. We performed 3D-SSP and volume of interest analysis using 123I-IMP scintigraphy.Occipital perfusion of MSA-P increased compared to that of Parkinson's disease and perfusion in the cerebellum and primary sensorimotor cortex of Parkinson's disease increased compared to that of MSA-P. Perfusion in the putamen of MSA-P decreased compared to that of Parkinson's disease.Our study demonstrated perfusion differences in 123I-IMP SPECT between the two diseases.
