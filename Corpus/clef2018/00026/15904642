Prognostic value of combined perfusion and function by stress technetium-99m sestamibi gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease. The incremental prognostic value of combined regional wall motion and perfusion over perfusion alone by gated single-photon emission computed tomographic myocardial perfusion scintigraphy has not been evaluated. Of the 402 consecutive patients who underwent stress single-photon emission computed tomographic myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for suspected myocardial ischemia, we identified 333 patients (217 men, mean age 63 +/- 10 years exercise in 249 and dipyridamole adminstered to 84). Visual scoring of perfusion images and regional wall motion used 20 segments and a scale of 0 to 4. Resting and poststress left ventricular ejection fraction was automatically generated. On follow-up (median 13 months), 30 hard cardiac events (17 cardiac deaths, 13 nonfatal acute myocardial infarctions) and 66 total cardiac events (including hard events, 26 with unstable angina, and 10 who underwent late revascularization) occurred. After adjustment for prescan information, the best independent predictors of hard events were summed stress score for wall motion (Wald's chi-square 8.3, p <0.004) and several vascular territories with ischemia by perfusion/function (Wald's chi-square 6.2, p <0.01). The strongest predictors of all cardiac events were the number of ischemias (Wald's chi-square 32.1, p <0.0001) and the number of ischemic vascular territories by perfusion (Wald's chi-square 13.1, p <0.0001). Addition of function data to the combined model of perfusion data yielded an incremental value of 26% for predicting hard events but not for all events. In conclusion, the assessment of combined perfusion/function provides incremental prognostic information for further hard events with perfusion data alone
