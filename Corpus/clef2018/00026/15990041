Endovascular treatment of cerebral vasospasm: transluminal balloon angioplasty, intra-arterial papaverine, and intra-arterial nicardipine. Cerebral vasospasm is still one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality from subarachnoid hemorrhage. Vasospasm refractory to medical management can be treated with endovascular therapies, such as transluminal balloon angioplasty or infusion of intra-arterial vasodilating agents. In our review of clinical series reported in the English language literature, transluminal balloon angioplasty produced clinical improvement in 62% of patients, significantly improved mean transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities(P <.05), significantly improved cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 85% of patients as studied by (133)Xenon techniques and serial single photon emission computerized tomography,and was associated with 5.0% complications and 1.1% vessel rupture. Intra-arterial papaverine therapy produced clinical improvement in 43% of patients but only transiently,requiring multiple treatment sessions (1.7 treatments per patient) significantly improved mean TCD velocities (P <.01) but only for less than 48 hours
