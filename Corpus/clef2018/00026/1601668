Production of 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa and its metabolism in vivo--a critical review. This report critically appraises methods for the synthesis of 6-[18F]fluoro-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (6-FDOPA) that are based on labelling by non-regioselective electrophilic fluorination, regioselective fluorodemetalation or nucleophilic substitution. Recommendations for the standardization of labelling procedures, the optimization of radiochemical yield and the assurance of product quality and safety are given. Studies of the metabolism of 6-FDOPA in vivo are also reviewed to emphasize the importance of the biochemical component of the development of this tracer for positron emission tomography (PET).
