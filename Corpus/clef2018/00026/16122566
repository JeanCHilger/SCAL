Neuroimaging in neuropsychiatry. Once limited to structural imaging modalities such as CT and MRI,radiographic evaluation of the psychiatric patient now includes more sophisticated functional techniques such as fMRI, MR spectroscopy, and PET. With the increased sensitivity that these new tools bring comes greater complexity. As new imaging techniques continue to transition from research to clinical application, the imaging options and associated complexity will increase. Consultation with neuroradiology colleagues will allow the practicing psychiatrist to evaluate their patients optimally. These techniques will continue to provide insight into the pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of these patients.
