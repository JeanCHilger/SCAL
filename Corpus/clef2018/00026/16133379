Effect of colony-stimulating factor and conventional- or high-dose chemotherapy on FDG uptake in bone marrow. Granulocyte or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF), usually used in conjunction with chemotherapy, may interfere with the( 18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) reading. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of CSF, conventional-or high-dose chemotherapy on bone marrow FDG uptake.Two hundred and forty-one FDG PET scans obtained in 163 patients with lymphoma and no pathologically and radiologically proven bone marrow involvement were analyzed. The standardized uptake value (SUV) of each patient's spine was measured.Among patients with no recent history of CSF use, the average SUV in 36 patients with no history of chemotherapy was 1.60+/-0.34, that in 49 patients with a history of conventional-dose chemotherapy was 1.37+/-0.32, and that in 12 patients with a history of high-dose chemotherapy was 1.26+/-0.25 (P=0.008 and 0.002, respectively by Mann-Whitney U test). In 80 patients treated with conventional-dose chemotherapy and CSF, the average SUV after discontinuation of CSF was as follows: 0-7 days, 2.37+/-1.19 8-14 days: 2.04+/-0.67Bone marrow FDG uptake may be increased by CSF treatment and may be decreased by chemotherapy. In patients treated with conventional-dose chemotherapy and CSF, increased marrow uptake will return to the pretreatment value approximately 1 month after discontinuation of CSF.
