Influence of arterial O2 on the susceptibility to posthyperventilation apnea during sleep. To investigate the contribution of the peripheral chemoreceptors to the susceptibility to posthyperventilation apnea, we evaluated the time course and magnitude of hypocapnia required to produce apnea at different levels of peripheral chemoreceptor activation produced by exposure to three levels of inspired P(O2). We measured the apneic threshold and the apnea latency in nine normal sleeping subjects in response to augmented breaths during normoxia (room air), hypoxia (arterial O2 saturation = 78-80%), and hyperoxia (inspired O2 fraction = 50-52%). Pressure support mechanical ventilation in the assist mode was employed to introduce a single or multiple numbers of consecutive, sigh-like breaths to cause apnea. The apnea latency was measured from the end inspiration of the first augmented breath to the onset of apnea. It was 12.2 +/- 1.1 s during normoxia, which was similar to the lung-to-ear circulation delay of 11.7 s in these subjects. Hypoxia shortened the apnea latency (6.3 +/- 0.8 s P < 0.05), whereas hyperoxia prolonged it (71.5 +/- 13.8 s
