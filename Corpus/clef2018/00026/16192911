Cost effectiveness of positron emission tomography in Canada. Positron emission tomography (PET) has been shown to be cost effective for the staging of stage I and II breast cancer, recurrent colorectal cancer and non small cell lung cancer. This study determines a required catchment size for the management of these three cancers based on a breakeven analysis.Cost effectiveness analysis is used to determine the cost savings of introducing PET into the diagnostic algorithm for the staging of stage I and II breast cancer, recurrent colorectal cancer and non small cell lung cancer. The cost savings for these cancers are used to calculate a required catchment area for the installation of a PET center with cyclotron.The aggregate estimated "breakeven" cost of a PET study would be dollars 2195, well below the expected cost per study. In order to break even, each PET device would require 740 new cases per year. For a general representative population, one person per 766 may benefit from a PET scan if a PET study was included in the diagnostic algorithm for all three cancers. Finally, a calculated catchment size of 567,000 people would support the use of a PET center with cyclotronThe use of PET for the staging of cancer appears to be cost effective in most jurisdictions in Canada.
