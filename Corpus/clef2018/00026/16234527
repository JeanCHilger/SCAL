Improved detection of second primary cancer using integrated [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography for initial tumor staging. This study evaluated prospectively the value of integrated whole-body positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in detecting a second primary cancer at the time of the initial staging in comparison with a conventional staging work-up (CSW).The participants were 547 patients diagnosed with cancer who underwent FDG PET/CT imaging for the initial staging. An additional diagnostic evaluation was performed when there were abnormal findings indicative of a second primary cancer on either PET/CT or CSW considering the site and the biologic behavior of the alleged primary tumor.A total of 27 second primary malignant tumors were identified in 26 of the 547 patients (4.8%). FDG PET/CT found 45 lesions indicative of a second primary cancer, of which 24 lesions were proved to be a second primary cancer, seven were clinically unexpected metastases, and 14 lesions were benign. Therefore, sensitivity and positive predictive value of FDG PET/CT in detecting a second primary cancer or an unexpected metastasis were 91% (31 of 34) and 69% (31 of 45), respectively. In contrast, CSW could not identify 16 second primary cancers and one metastatic lesion.FDG PET/CT at the time of the initial staging is useful for screening a second primary cancer with a high sensitivity. An additional diagnostic work-up is essential when abnormal findings, which are indicative of a second primary cancer, are obtained on PET/CT images to rule out the presence of either a second primary cancer or an unexpected metastasis.
