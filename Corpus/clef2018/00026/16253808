Synthesis and evaluation of [11C]FR194921 as a nonxanthine-type PET tracer for adenosine A1 receptors in the brain. This report describes the synthesis of [11C]2-(1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)-6-(2-phenylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-3-yl)-3(2H)-pyridazinone ([11C]FR194921), a highly selective, nonxanthine-type adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist, used in brain imaging in rats and conscious monkeys as a potential novel PET tracer. [11C]FR194921 was successfully synthesized in 19 min after [11C]CH3I formation. The radiochemical yield was 38+/-3% and radioactivity was 4.1+/-0.4 GBq, calculated from end of synthesis
