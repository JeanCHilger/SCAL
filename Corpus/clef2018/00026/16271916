Use of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide to detect myocardial ischemia. To evaluate the utility of plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels to detect myocardial ischemia.We conducted a prospective observational study in 260 consecutive patients with suspected myocardial ischemia referred for rest/ergometry myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography. Levels of NT-proBNP were determined before and immediately after symptom-limited bicycle ergometry.Inducible myocardial ischemia on perfusion images was detected in 129 patients (49.6%). Baseline NT-proBNP and exercise induced increase in NT-proBNP (DeltaNT-proBNP) were significantly higher in patients with myocardial ischemia (median baseline NT-proBNP 155 pg/mL vs 91 pg/mL, P <.001 DeltaNT-proBNP 15 pg/mL vs 7 pg/mL, P = .002). Compared with patients in the lowest DeltaNT-proBNP quartile, those in the highest quartile of DeltaNT-proBNP had three times the risk of inducible ischemia (relative risk, 2.9The NT-proBNP level at rest as well as DeltaNT-proBNP during exercise stress testing is associated with inducible myocardial ischemia. NT-proBNP levels may have incremental value in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia.
