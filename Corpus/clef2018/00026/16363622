Comparison of 18FDG-PET with 99mTc-HMDP scintigraphy for the detection of bone metastases in patients with breast cancer. Bone is one of the most common sites of metastasis in breast cancer patients. Although bone scintigraphy is widely used to detect metastatic breast cancer, the usefulness of 18FDG-PET for detecting bone metastasis has not been clearly evaluated. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of 18FDG-PET with bone scintigraphy in detecting bone metastasis in breast cancer patients.Forty-four women aged 35 to 81 years (mean, 56 years) with breast cancer were examined in this study. Both 18FDG-PET and bone scintigraphy were performed for each patient with 0-69 day intervals (mean, 11.5 days). The results of each image interpretation were compared retrospectively. Whole-body bones were classified into 9 anatomical regions. Metastases were confirmed at 45/187 regions in 14 patients by bone biopsy or clinical follow-up including other imaging techniques for a period of at least 6 months afterwards.On a region basis, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18FDG-PET were 84%, 99% and 95%, respectively. Although these results were comparable to those of bone scintigraphy, the combination of 18FDG-PET and bone scintigraphy improved the sensitivity (98%) and accuracy (97%) of detection. False negative lesions of bone scintigraphy were mostly bone marrow metastases and those of 18FDG-PET were mostly osteoblastic metastases. 18FDG-PET was superior to bone scintigraphy in the detection of osteolytic lesions (92% vs. 73%), but inferior in the detection of osteoblastic lesions (74% vs. 95%).This study shows that 18FDG-PET tends to be superior to bone scintigraphy in the detection of osteolytic lesions, but inferior in the detection of osteoblastic lesions. 18FDG-PET should play a complementary role in detecting bone metastasis with bone scintigraphy.
