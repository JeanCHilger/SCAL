Determinants of coronary flow velocity reserve in healthy young men. The objective of this study was to identify risk markers for attenuated coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) that exist in healthy young men without evident atherosclerotic risk factors. Coronary blood flow velocity was measured with transthoracic Doppler echocardiography at baseline and during adenosine infusion in 37 healthy nonsmoking men [mean age, 27 yr (SD 4.0)]. Body composition and distribution of fat tissue were assessed with anthropometric measures and regulation of fat metabolism by determination of adiponectin and leptin levels. Physical performance capacity was tested with ergospirometry. The mean body mass index was 23 kg/m2 (SD 1.9), waist-to-hip ratio was 0.84 (SD 0.04), and CFVR was 3.5 (SD 0.61). Obesity indexes at study outset, leptin, adiponectin, maximal load (Max load in W/kg) and maximal oxygen consumption (Vo2 peak in ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)) in ergospirometry, rate-pressure product, and heart rate at rest were significantly associated with CFVR. In multivariate analysis, Max load (in W/kg) and waist-to-hip ratio were the only independent predictors of CFVR. We found no relationship between CFVR and serum lipids or body mass index. We conclude that abdominal fat accumulation and low aerobic fitness are independently associated with CFVR in men.
