Adrenal lesions: characterization with fused PET/CT image in patients with proved or suspected malignancy--initial experience. To retrospectively evaluate the accuracy of the fused positron emission tomographic (PET)/computed tomographic (CT) image for characterization of adrenal lesions in patients who have proved malignancy or are suspected of having malignancy.Institutional review board approval was received for this retrospective HIPAA-compliant study, and informed consent was waived. Forty-one adrenal lesions in 38 patients (21 men, 17 women mean age, 66 yearsAt PET/CT, findings for all malignant lesions were positive (mean adrenal lesion-liver activity ratio, 4.04 range, 1.53-17.08). Of the 32 benign lesions, most (30 of 32) had activity less than that of the liver (mean ratio, 0.66PET/CT provides a powerful combination of functional and attenuation information for adrenal lesion characterization. All malignant lesions were detected at PET/CT, with no false-negative results.
