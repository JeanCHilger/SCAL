Profile of animal bite cases in Pune. A Cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the profile of animal bite cases reporting to the Anti Rabies clinic of Sassoon Hospital, rune. The data was collected using pretested questionnaire. All 250 cases who reported during the period of study were included in the analysis. The male female ratio was 1.98 : 1. Children in the age group 0-14 years were the victims in 132 (52.8%) cases. Dog was the biting animal in 94.4% cases, followed by cat (2.4%), Jackal (1.2%), mongoose (1.2%), monkey (0.4%) and horse (0.4%). Of the 236 dog bite cases 30% of bites were inflicted by pet dogs of which only 38.02% were immunized. The wound was washed with soap and water in only 3.6% of cases. 64.8% of the bites were on the lower extremity and 63.2% of cases reported within 24 hours of the bite. Of the 247 cases administered Beta Propio Lactone (BPL) inactivated vaccine only 18.8% did not have any local reaction and 58.3% had one or more systemic reaction. A three pronged strategy has been recommended to reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality associated with rabies.
