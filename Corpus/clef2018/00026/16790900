Image reconstruction. We give an overview of the role of Physics in Medicine and Biology in the development of tomographic reconstruction algorithms. We focus on imaging modalities involving ionizing radiation, CT, PET and SPECT, and cover a wide spectrum of reconstruction problems, starting with classical 2D tomography in the 1970s up to 4D and 5D problems involving dynamic imaging of moving organs.
