Image registration for radiation therapy: Practical aspects and quality control. The development of conformal radiotherapy techniques (CRT) and intensity modulated CRT requires an accurate delineation of target structures and organs at risk. Thus, additional information provided by anatomical and/or functional imaging modalities can be used for volume of interest determination combined with traditionally used Computed Tomography imaging (CT): for instance, functional or morphological Magnetic Resonance Imaging (f MRI or m MRI) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET). A prerequisite to the simultaneous use of this information is image registration. Due to the differences between the images and the information they provide, a quality control of image registration process for radiotherapy is mandatory. The purpose of this article is to present the difficulties in implementing such controls and to show the necessity for a clinical validation on patient's images. The last part of this work presents the possible interest in using f MRI to help radio-oncologists in the treatment planning for gliomas associated to image coregistration and quality control considerations.
