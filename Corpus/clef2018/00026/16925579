Staging performance of carbon-11 choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcoma: comparison with conventional imaging. The present study was conducted to compare the diagnostic accuracy between carbon-11 choline (11C-choline) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and conventional imaging for the staging of bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Sixteen patients who underwent 11C-choline PET/CT prior to treatment were evaluated retrospectively for staging accuracy. Conventional imaging methods consisted of 99,mTc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy, chest CT and magnetic resonance imaging of the primary site. The images were reviewed and a consensus was reached by two board-certified radiologists who were unaware of any clinical or radiological information using hard-copy films and multimodality computer platform. Tumor stage was confirmed by histological examination and/or by an obvious progression in number and/or size of the lesions on follow-up examinations. Reviewers examining both 11C-choline PET/CT and conventional imaging classified T stage in all patients. Interpretation based on 11C-choline PET/CT, the Node (N) stage was correctly diagnosed in all patients, whereas the accuracy of conventional imaging in N stage was 63%. Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) stage was assessed correctly with 11C-choline PET/CT in 15 of 16 patients (94%) and with conventional imaging in eight of 16 patients (50%). The overall TNM staging and N staging accuracy of 11C-choline PET/CT were significantly higher than that of conventional imaging (P < 0.05). 11C-choline PET/CT is more accurate than conventional imaging regarding clinical staging of patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas. A whole body 11C-choline PET/CT might be acceptable for imaging studies of tumor staging prior to treatment.
