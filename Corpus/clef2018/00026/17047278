Non-diverging analytic expression for the on-axis sensitivity of converging collimators: experimental verification. The previous paper presented the derivation of an analytical formula for the sensitivity of converging collimators that does not diverge at the focal locus of the collimator. Its predictions, those from a simplified version, and those from the most commonly referenced formula are compared to Monte Carlo and experimental data. Agreement is excellent for all formulae far from the focal locus of the collimator, where it is markedly better for the new formula and its approximation. It is inferred that such formulae should be used in the cases identified by theory, namely around the focal locus of collimators of any focal length and over a substantial part of the field-of-view for short focal length collimators.
