Single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography imaging of multi-drug resistant P-glycoprotein--monitoring a transport activity important in cancer, blood-brain barrier function and Alzheimer's disease. Overexpression of multi-drug resistant P-glycoprotein (Pgp) remains an important barrier to successful chemotherapy in cancer patients and impacts the pharmacokinetics of many important drugs. Pgp is also expressed on the luminal surface of brain capillary endothelial cells wherein Pgp functionally comprises a major component of the blood-brain barrier by limiting central nervous system penetration of various therapeutic agents. In addition, Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells removes amyloid-beta from the brain. Several single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography radiopharmaceutical have been shown to be transported by Pgp, thereby enabling the noninvasive interrogation of Pgp-mediated transport activity in vivo. Therefore, molecular imaging of Pgp activity may enable noninvasive dynamic monitoring of multi-drug resistance in cancer, guide therapeutic choices in cancer chemotherapy, and identify transporter deficiencies of the blood-brain barrier in Alzheimer's disease.
