Molecular imaging of novel cell- and viral-based therapies. Drugs, surgery, and radiation are the traditional modalities of therapy in medicine. To these are being added new therapies based on cells and viruses or their derivatives. In these novel therapies, a cell or viral vector acts as a drug in its own right, altering the host or a disease process to bring about healing. Most of these advances originate from the significant recent advances in molecular medicine, but some have been around for some time. Blood transfusions and cowpox vaccinations are part of the history of medicine...but nevertheless are examples of cell- and viral-based therapies. This article focuses on the modern molecular incarnations of these therapies, and specifically on how imaging is used to track and guide these novel agents. We survey the literature dealing with imaging these new cell and viral particle therapies and provide a framework for understanding publications in this area. Leading technology of gene modifications are the fundamental modifications applied to make these new therapies amenable to imaging.
