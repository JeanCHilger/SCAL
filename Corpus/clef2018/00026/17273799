FDG-PET and CT features of non-small cell lung cancer based on tumor type. We determined if specific tumor types of non-small cell lung cancer can be identified by variance in FDG-PET standard uptake value (SUV) in combination with characteristics on CT. Staging FDG-PET and CT scans of 81 patients (34 men and 47 women, average age 67+/-11 years) with 82 lung cancers were analyzed. Mean tumor SUV was calculated at the location of maximum FDG uptake. Tumor size, margins, and location were analyzed on CT. Statistical analysis compared SUV between tumor subtypes, assessed relationship between tumor subtype and features on CT and determined if combination of CT and SUV patterns predicted tumor type. In total 35 adenocarcinomas (AC) 15 bronchioloalveolar cell carcinomas (BAC), 23 squamous cell carcinomas and 9 large cell carcinomas were evaluated. Significant differences were found between SUV of all AC and squamous cell (p<0.0001)
