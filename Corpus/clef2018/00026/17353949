Ether and crown ether-containing cationic 99mTc complexes useful as radiopharmaceuticals for heart imaging. While radiopharmaceutical research has been focused on the development of target-specific radiotracers for early detection and radiotherapy of cancers in the last decade, there is a limited effort on new cationic 99mTc radiotracers for heart imaging. This review will summarize some of the most recent developments in ether- and crown ether-containing cationic 99mTc radiotracers that have a fast liver clearance with a heart/liver ratio substantially better than that of 99mTc-Sestamibi and 99mTc-Tetrofosmin, the two commercial 99mTc radiopharmaceuticals currently available for myocardial perfusion imaging. Fast liver clearance might shorten the duration of imaging protocols (<30 min post-injection), and allow for early acquisition of heart images of high quality. Improvement of heart/liver ratio may permit better detection of the presence and extent of coronary artery disease. Identification of such a new radiotracer that allows for the improved non-invasive delineation of myocardial perfusion would be of considerable benefit in treatment of patients with suspected coronary artery disease.
