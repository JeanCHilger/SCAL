Respiratory symptoms, asthma and allergen levels in schools--comparison between Korea and Sweden. We studied reports on respiratory symptoms, asthma and atopic sensitisation in relation to allergen contamination in Korean schools and compared with data from a previous Swedish study performed in eight primary schools. Korean pupils (n = 2365) in 12 primary schools first completed a questionnaire. Then airborne and settled dust were collected from 34 classrooms and analyzed for allergens by ELISA. In both countries, boys reported more symptoms. The prevalence of wheeze was similar, while daytime [odds ratio (OR) = 14.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 9.0-21.9] and nocturnal breathlessness (OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.5-6.4) were much higher among Korean students. In Korean schools, dog allergen (Can f 1) was the most common followed by mite allergen (Der f 1), while cat (Fel d 1), dog, and horse allergen (Equ cx) were abundant in Sweden. Moreover, CO(2) levels were high in most Korean schools (range 907-4113 ppm). There was an association between allergen levels in dust and air samples, and number of pet-keepers in the classrooms. In conclusion, allergen contamination in Korean schools may be an important public issue.This study showed that furry pet allergen contamination was common in both Korean and Swedish schools. In addition, house dust-mite (Der f 1) allergen contamination was common in Korean schools, probably because of transport of allergen from other environments. Transfer should therefore be minimized. Korean schools had high CO(2) levels and the concept of mechanical ventilation should be introduced. Measurement of airborne allergen levels is quite new and seems to be a more convenient and correct way to monitor allergen exposure in classrooms.
