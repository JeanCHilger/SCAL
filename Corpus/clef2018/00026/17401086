68Ga-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotide PET in neuroendocrine tumors: comparison with somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and CT. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of a new somatostatin analog, (68)Ga-labeled 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid-d-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide ((68)Ga-DOTA-TOC), for PET in patients with known or suspected neuroendocrine tumors. PET was compared with conventional scintigraphy and dedicated CT.Eighty-four patients (48 men, 36 women age range, 28-79 yPET was TP in 69 patients, TN in 12 patients, FP in 1 patient, and FN in 2 patients, indicating a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 92%, and an accuracy of 96%. The FP finding was caused by enhanced tracer accumulation in the pancreatic head, and the FN results were obtained in patients with a tumor of the gastrointestinal tract displaying liver metastases. (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC showed higher diagnostic efficacy compared with SPECT (TP in 37 patients, TN in 12 patients, FP in 1 patient, and FN in 34 patients) and diagnostic CT (TP in 41 patients, TN in 12 patients, FP in 5 patients, and FN in 26 patients). This difference was of statistical significance (P < 0.001). However, the combined use of PET and CT showed the highest overall accuracy.(68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET shows a significantly higher detection rate compared with conventional somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and diagnostic CT with clinical impact in a considerable number of patients.
