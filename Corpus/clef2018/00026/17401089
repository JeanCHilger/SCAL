Assessment of 11C-PE2I binding to the neuronal dopamine transporter in humans with the high-spatial-resolution PET scanner HRRT. The high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT), dedicated to brain imaging, may offer new perspectives for identifying small brain nuclei that remain neglected by the spatial resolution of conventional scanners. However, the use of HRRT for neuroimaging applications still needs to be fully assessed. The present study aimed at evaluating the HRRT for measurement of the dopamine transporter (DAT) binding to validate its quantification and explore the gain induced by the increased spatial resolution in comparison with conventional PET scanners.Fifteen and 11 healthy subjects were examined using the selective DAT radioligand (11)C-PE2I with HRRT and HR+ scanners, respectively. Quantification of the DAT binding was assessed by the calculation of binding potential (BP) values using the simplified reference tissue model in anatomic regions of interest (ROIs) defined on the dorsal striatum and in a standardized ROI defined on the midbrain.Quantification of (11)C-PE2I binding to the DAT measured in the midbrain and striatum with both scanners at the same spatial resolution (smoothed HRRT images) exhibited similar BP values and intersubject variability, thus validating the quantification of DAT binding on the HRRT. For age-paired comparison, BP values of subjects examined with HRRT were significantly higher than those of the subjects examined with HR+. The increase ranged from 29% in the caudate and 35% in the putamen to 92% in the midbrain. The decline in DAT binding with age in the striatum was in good agreement between both scanners and literature, whereas no significant decrease in DAT binding with age was observed in the midbrain with either HRRT or HR+.HRRT allows quantitative measurements of neurotransmission processes in small brain nuclei and allows recovering higher values as compared with coarser spatial resolution PET scanners. High-spatial-resolution PET appears promising for a more accurate detection of neurobiologic modifications and also for the exploration of subtle modifications in small and complex brain structures largely affected by the partial-volume effect.
