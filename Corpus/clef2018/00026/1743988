Recent developments in 99mTc and 123I-radiopharmaceuticals for SPECT imaging. Availability of 123I of high radionuclidic purity has encouraged the development of 123I-based radiopharmaceuticals for the assessment of myocardial fatty acid metabolism, myocardial neuronal activity, and for receptor and antibody imaging. Advances in the chemistry of technetium have resulted in the development of novel agents for myocardial and cerebral perfusion and renal function studies. Monoclonal antibodies labeled with 99mTc show promise for imaging neoplastic lesions, myocardial infarcts, and thrombus localization. Recent developments in 123I and 99mTc agents for myocardial and brain imaging studies are discussed.
