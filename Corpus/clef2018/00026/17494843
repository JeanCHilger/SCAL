90Y radioembolization of metastatic breast cancer to the liver: toxicity, imaging response, survival. To present data from patients with breast cancer liver metastases who underwent radioembolization with yttrium (90Y) microspheres.Using standard 90Y lobar treatment protocol, 27 female patients with progressing liver metastases on standard of care polychemotherapy were treated under an open-label phase 2 protocol. After treatment, we assessed (a) tumor response using computed tomography and/or positron emission tomography, (b) biochemical toxicity, and (c) survival.The mean age of the patients was 52. Seventeen (63%) patients received 20 left lobe treatments (median radiation dose, 123 Gy mean, 119 Gy), and 20 (74%) patients received 22 right lobe treatments (median radiation dose, 121 GyRadioembolization with 90Y brachytherapy device may be a viable therapeutic option for the treatment of breast cancer liver metastases in patients who have progressed or failed on standard of care polychemotherapy.
