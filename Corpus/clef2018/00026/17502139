Radioiodinated aza-diphenylacetylenes as potential SPECT imaging agents for beta-amyloid plaque detection. Two new iodinated fluoro- and hydroxy-pegylated aza-diphenylacetylene derivatives, 1 and 2, targeting beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques have been successfully prepared. In vitro binding carried out in tissue homogenates prepared from postmortem AD brains with [(125)I]IMPY (6-iodo-2-(4'-dimethylamino)phenyl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine) as the radioligand indicated good binding affinities (K(i)=9.2 and 16.8 nM for 1 and 2, respectively). Brain penetrations of the corresponding radioiodinated ligands, evaluated in the normal mice, showed good initial brain penetrations (3.55% and 5.67% ID/g for [(125)I]1 and [(125)I]2 at 2 min post-injection). The washout from normal mice brain was relatively fast (0.33% and 0.91% ID/g at 2h post-injection). The specific binding of these radioiodinated ligands to beta-amyloid plaques was clearly demonstrated using film autoradiography of AD brain sections. Taken together, these preliminary results strongly suggest that these novel iodinated aza-diphenylacetylenes may be potentially useful for imaging Abeta plaques in the living human brain.
