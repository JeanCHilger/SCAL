Frontotemporal dementia. Frontotemporal dementia usually begins before the age of 65 years. It is manifested by behavioral and language disorders. The lesions observed in frontotemporal dementia affect the frontal and temporal lobes bilaterally. One third of patients have a psychiatric diagnosis at the onset of disease. The genetic component is important: 30-50% of patients have a family history of this disease. Cholinergic effects are not associated with frontotemporal dementia and therefore anticholinesterase treatment is not indicated.
