Evaluation of the GeneQuence DNA hybridization method in conjunction with 24-hour enrichment protocols for detection of Salmonella spp. in select foods: collaborative study. A multilaboratory study was conducted to compare performance of the GeneQuence DNA hybridization (DNAH) method incorporating new 24 h enrichment protocols and reference culture procedures for detection of Salmonella spp. in select foods. Six food types (raw ground turkey, raw ground beef, dried whole egg, milk chocolate, walnuts, and dry pet food) were tested by the DNAH method and by the culture methods of either the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Bacteriological Analytical Manual (FDA/BAM). Fifteen laboratories participated in the study. Four of the foods tested (raw ground turkey, dried whole egg, milk chocolate, and dry pet food), showed no statistically significant differences in performance between the DNAH method and the reference procedure as determined by Chi square analysis. Sensitivity rates for the DNAH method ranged from 92 to 100%. The DNAH method, with the specific enrichment protocol evaluated, was found to be ineffective for detection of Salmonella spp. in walnuts. For raw ground beef, results from one trial showed a statistically significant difference in performance, with more positives obtained by the reference method. However, evidence suggests that the difference in the number of positives was likely due to lack of homogeneity of the test samples rather than to DNAH method performance.
