Impact of FDG PET-CT imaging on the decision making in the biologic suspicion of ovarian carcinoma recurrence. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the impact of integrated PET-CT on treatment management in ovarian carcinoma recurrence suspicion because of increased CA-125.Twenty-nine patients (mean age=61 years), initially treated for ovarian carcinoma (FIGO stage I n=2, stage II n=3, stage III n=21 and stage IV n=3), presenting with increased CA-125 (mean=160 IU/ml, range 33-1930), underwent subsequently a CT and a PET-CT scans. The recurrence was acknowledged by the referring physicians for all patients. The impact of PET-CT on patient's management was evaluated by comparing the therapeutic decision mentioned respectively on the pre and post PET-CT questionnaires filled in by the oncologists.The CT scan was positive in 22/29 patients (76%) and negative in 7/29 patients (24%). The PET-CT scan was positive in 27/29 patients (93%) and negative in 2/29 (7%) patients. Five out of the seven patients with a negative CT scan had a positive PET-CT scan. In comparison to CT scan alone, the PET-CT scan modified the disease distribution for 16 patients (55% p<0.001) in the following ways: more advanced disease (n=11), more limited disease (n=4), and different localizations (n=1). The assessment of pre and post PET-CT questionnaires showed a statistically significant change in the decision making for 10 patients (34%, p<0.0001).This questionnaire-based study showed that PET-CT imaging allows a better restaging than CT and induces a change in clinical management in over one third of patients with suspected ovarian carcinoma recurrence on increased CA-125.
