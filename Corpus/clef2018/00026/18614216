Hemodynamic changes in ipsi- and contralateral cerebral arterial territories after carotid endarterectomy using positron emission tomography. The purpose of this study was to characterize ipsi- and contralateral cerebral hemodynamics before and after CEA.Cerebral blood flow, CBV, and MVTT were measured in 10 patients before and after CEA using PET. Absolute and relative values of these parameters were calculated bilaterally for the entire arterial territories and hemispheres.For all territories in both hemispheres, the mean absolute postoperative CBF was significantly increased compared with preoperative CBF (P < .05). Only in MCA was this increase higher in the ipsilateral than in the contralateral hemisphere (P = .02). Cerebral blood volume was unaffected, whereas MVTT decreased in ipsilateral MCA (P = .05).The present findings suggest that, on the first day after CEA, absolute CBF is increased in all arterial territories on both ipsi- and contralateral sides, but that there are only minor changes in the relative distribution, whereas the CBV was unaffected.
