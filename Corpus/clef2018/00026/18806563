Quantitative assessment of FDG uptake in brown fat using standardized uptake value and dual-time-point scanning. Brown fat is a potential source of false-positive findings on FDG PET. The purpose of this study was to show the variability in body distribution of brown fat, the degree of FDG uptake, the changes on dual-time-point scanning, and determine if dual-time-point scanning can help in differentiating brown fat from malignant lesions.Thirty-two patients were included in this retrospective study (14 male, 18 female, age range: 8-72 years). All patients had hypermetabolic brown fat activity on FDG PET imaging confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scanning. All patients underwent 2 sequential FDG PET scanning (dual-time-point imaging). The average percent change in maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) for 120 brown fat spots between time point 1 and time point 2 was calculated.Body distribution of hypermetabolic brown fat in the 32 patients included supraclavicular area (n = 7) cervical and supraclavicular (n = 5)Brown fat is a potential source of false positives, which has wide variability in distribution and degree of FDG uptake. On dual-time-point scanning, there is a progressive increase in FDG uptake within most of the hypermetabolic brown fat areas that mimic malignant lesions.
