Exploration and management of adrenal incidentalomas. French Society of Endocrinology Consensus. The French Society of Endocrinology convened a multidisciplinary panel of endocrinologists, radiologists, nuclear physicians and surgeons to address the appropriate evaluation and treatment of adrenal incidentalomas. The panel conducted a systematic review of medical literature on the following issues: epidemiology, natural history, radiological and scintigraphic evaluation, endocrine assessment, surgical management and appropriate follow-up. The following text reports the recommendations of experts on behalf of the French Society of Endocrinology. The authors emphasize the paucity of published scientific data that hampers evidence-based medicine recommendations. The crucial points of the French consensus are: the usefulness of CT-scanning evaluation of adrenal incidentalomas, the systematic screening for pheochromocytoma, the usefulness of the 1mg overnight dexamethasone test to screen for latent hypercortisolism, the difficulty to interpret mild biological abnormalities of the HPA axis, the consensus to remove surgically most of tumours greater than 4cm, the necessity to follow clinically glucorticoid tissular targets in the follow-up of non operated benign adrenocortical incidentalomas.
