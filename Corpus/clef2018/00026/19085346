Neuromodulation in a minipig MPTP model of Parkinson disease. Large animal neuroscience enables the use of conventional clinical brain imagers and the direct use and testing of surgical procedures and equipment from the human clinic. The greater complexity of the large animal brain additionally enables a more direct translation to human brain function in health and disease. Economical, ethical, scientific and practical issues may on the other hand hamper large animal neuroscience. Large animal neuroscience should therefore either be performed in order to examine large animal species dependent problems or to complement promising small animal basic studies by constituting an intermediate research system, bridging small animal CNS research to the human CNS. We have, accordingly, during the last ten years used the Gottingen minipig to examine neuromodulatory treatment modalities such as stem cell transplantation and deep brain stimulation directed towards Parkinson disease. This has been accomplished by the development of a MPTP-based large animal model of Parkinson disease in the Gottingen minipig and the development of stereotaxic and surgical approaches needed to manipulate the Gottingen minipig CNS. The instituted changes in the CNS can be evaluated in the live animal by brain imaging (PET and MR), cystometry, gait analysis, neurological evaluation and by post mortem examination based on histology and stereological analysis.
