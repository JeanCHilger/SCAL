Half-time SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging with attenuation correction. Reducing acquisition time may improve patient throughput, increase camera efficiency, and reduce costs reducing acquisition time also increases image noise. Newly available software controls the effects of noise by maximum a posteriori reconstruction while maintaining resolution with resolution-recovery methods. This study compares half-time (HT) gated myocardial SPECT images processed with ordered-subset expectation maximization with resolution recovery (OSEM-RR) (with and without CT-based attenuation correction [AC]) with full-time (FT) images obtained with a standard clinical protocol and reconstructed with filtered backprojection (FBP) and OSEM (with and without AC).A total of 212 patients (mean age, 57 y age range, 27-86 y) underwent 1-d rest/stress (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin gated SPECT. FT (12.5 min, both rest and stress) and HT (rest, 7.5 minAll measurements resulted in significant correlations (P < 0.01) between the HT and FT images. The only significant difference in mean values was for OSEM-RR plus AC this method led to an increase in TID by 4% over FT imaging. The concordance in the clinical diagnosis for HT versus FT was 106 to 112 (kappa = 0.88) for no AC and 102 to 106 (kappa = 0.91) for AC, similar to the repeatability of FT versus FT (98/100, kappa = 0.95).HT images processed with the new algorithm provided a clinical diagnosis in concordance with that from FT images in 95% (no AC) to 96% (AC) of cases. This concordance is similar to the test-retest repeatability of FT imaging.
