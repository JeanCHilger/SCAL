SPECT/CT with 99mTc-MAA in radioembolization with 90Y microspheres in patients with hepatocellular cancer. Radioembolization with (90)Y microspheres is a novel treatment for hepatic tumors. Generally, hepatic arteriography and (99m)Tc-macroaggregated albumin (MAA) scanning are performed before selective internal radiation therapy to detect extrahepatic shunting to the lung or the gastrointestinal tract. Whereas previous studies have used only planar or SPECT scans, the present study used (99m)Tc-MAA SPECT/CT scintigraphy (SPECT with integrated low-dose CT) to evaluate whether SPECT/CT and additional diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT before radioembolization with (90)Y microspheres are superior to SPECT or planar imaging alone for detection of gastrointestinal shunting.In a prospective study, we enrolled 58 patients (mean age, 66 y SD, 12 yGastrointestinal shunting was revealed by planar imaging in 4, by SPECT in 9, and by SPECT/CT in 16 of the 68 examinations. For planar imaging, the sensitivity for detection of gastrointestinal shunting was 25%, the specificity 87%, and the accuracy 72%. For SPECT without CT, the sensitivity was 56%, the specificity 87%, and the accuracy 79%. SPECT with CT fusion had a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 94%, and an accuracy of 96%. In 3 patients, MAA deposits in the portal vein could accurately be attributed to tumor thrombus only with additional information from contrast-enhanced CT. The follow-up did not show any gastrointestinal complications.SPECT with integrated low-dose CT using (99m)Tc-MAA is beneficial in radioembolization with (90)Y microspheres because it increases the sensitivity and specificity of (99m)Tc-MAA SPECT when detecting extrahepatic arterial shunting. The overall low risk of gastrointestinal complications in radioembolization may therefore be further reduced by SPECT/CT.
