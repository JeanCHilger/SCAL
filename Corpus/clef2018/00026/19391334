Integrated multidisciplinary treatment of colorectal neoplasms. In this retrospective study, the modality and advantages of the multidisciplinary diagnostic work-up and therapy regarding colorectal neoplasm were analysed. Over the period 2004-2008, 63 patients underwent multidisciplinary treatment for colorectal cancer. All patients underwent surgery (laparoscopic/open). Exeresis was supplemented by adjuvant chemotherapy in those cases beyond IIA stage all cases of extraperitoneal rectal and anal canal neoplasms plus one case of carcinoma of the transverse colon, initially inoperable, underwent neoadjuvant radiotherapy plus chemotherapy. The treatment was initiated approximately 3 weeks after the diagnosis. Fifty-four percent of patients with colonic and upper rectal neoplasms were given adjuvant chemotherapy, starting around 4 weeks after surgery. Exeresis was performed in those patients with extraperitoneal rectal and anal canal neoplasms (12.7%) about 6-8 weeks after they had completed neoadjuvant therapy. At the end of the treatment, 76% of the overall total numbers of patients were in good condition (follow-up 4-50 months). The remaining 24% suffered recurrences about 13 months after the treatment for colonic and upper rectal neoplasm, and 8 1/2 months after treatment for extraperitoneal rectal/anal canal neoplasms. Seventy-five percent of the recurring cases underwent treatment again, with 50% success
