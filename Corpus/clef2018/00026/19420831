Study of high speed rotation SPECT acquisition method with breath-hold -comparison between dual-head system and triple-head system-. Because lung perfusion Tc-99m MAA of SPECT is generally acquired under the non-breath-hold condition, SPECT image quality is degraded for respiratory lung motion. To solve this problem, a new acquisition mode would need to be developed. We suggest that the acquisition mode is the detector rotating at high speed during the deep breath-hold condition and 20 sec. This acquisition method is known as high-speed detector rotation-multiplied projection single photon emission computed tomography (HSRMP-SPECT). Detail is reconstructed from projection data added while projection data are acquired several times under deep breath-hold sets.The HSRMP-SPECT technique has been developed under the triple-head system. However, the triple-head system is a small field of view. Thus a description of the entire lung area was impossible under the deep breath-hold condition. The HSRMP-SPECT technique seems needed to make the shift to dual-head system, because the generally dual-head system has a large field of view. We were compared triple-head system with dual-head system, and researched some parameter.With lung perfusion HSRMP-SPECT using the dual-head system, description of the entire lung area possible. The triple-head system of 5 projection data sets and dual-head system of 6 projection data sets nearly equaled the total count, and also the coefficient of variation is nearly same. Therefore, we were able to make the triple-head system to the dual-head system the shift on HSRMP-SPECT.
