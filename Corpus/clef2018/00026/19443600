PET of glial metabolism using 2-18F-fluoroacetate. Imaging of the glial activation that occurs in response to central nervous system trauma and inflammation could become a powerful technique for the assessment of several neuropathologies. The selective uptake and metabolism of 2-(18)F-fluoroacetate ((18)F-FAC) in glia may represent an attractive strategy for imaging glial metabolism.We have evaluated the use of (18)F-FAC as a specific PET tracer of glial cell metabolism in rodent models of glioblastoma, stroke, and ischemia-hypoxia.Enhanced uptake of (18)F-FAC was observed (6.98 +/- 0.43 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g] tumor-to-normal ratio, 1.40) in orthotopic U87 xenografts, compared with healthy brain tissue. The lesion extent determined by (18)F-FAC PET correlated with that determined by MRI (R(2) = 0.934, P = 0.007). After transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat brain, elevated uptake of (18)F-FAC (1.00 +/- 0.03 %ID/gOur data support the further evaluation of (18)F-FAC PET for the assessment of glial cell metabolism associated with neuroinflammation.
