Left atrial volume and index by multi-detector computed tomography: comprehensive analysis from predictors of enlargement to predictive value for acute coronary syndrome (ROMICAT study). We aimed to identify the predictors of left atrial (LA) enlargement by multi-detector computed tomography (CT) and determine its association and predictive value for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).LA enlargement is associated with myocardial ischemia and coronary artery disease (CAD) and is a strong predictor for cardiovascular events. These studies were performed primarily with echocardiography. With the rise of cardiac CT, LA volume can be readily measured.In 377 emergency department patients with chest pain, we performed 64-slice CT for coronary artery assessment. We derived LA volumes (LAV(max), LAV(min)) and indices (LAVI(max), LAVI(min)) using a threshold-based volumetric method.Subjects, with cardiac risk factors or CAD by CT, had larger LA (ΔLAV(max) 9.1 ml, p=0.004 ΔLAV(min) 8.1 ml, p=0.001Risk factors related to diastolic dysfunction are independent predictors of LA enlargement. LA enlargement by volumes are associated with a 3-5 fold increase risk for ACS and have incremental value for predicting ACS when added to the CT finding of indeterminate stenosis.
