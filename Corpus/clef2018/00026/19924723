SPECT/CT for preoperative sentinel node localization. The value of SPECT/CT for detection and localization of sentinel nodes is reviewed. SPECT/CT depicts extra sentinel nodes and identifies non-nodal tracer accumulation. SPECT/CT is indicated in patients with complex lymphatic drainage as often present in patients with head, neck and scapular melanoma, breast cancer patients with extra-axillary sentinel nodes and patients with tumors draining to pelvic nodes. SPECT/CT also clarifies the drainage pattern of inconclusive conventional images (non-visualization or unclear location of the nodes).
