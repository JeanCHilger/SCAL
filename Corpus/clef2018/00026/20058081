The washout rate of (123)I-BMIPP and the evolution of left  ventricular function in patients with successfully reperfused  ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: comparisons  with the echocardiography. The evolution of the oxidative metabolism of (11)C acetate parallels the recovery of left ventricular(LV) contraction following acute myocardial infarction(AMI). This study was designed to unravel, for the first time, the impact of the global washout rate(WR) of (123)I-beta-methyl-p-iodophenylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) on the recovery of LV function followingAMI, as evidenced from conventional echocardiography.Twenty consecutive patients (age: 58 +/- 13 years 16 males and 4 females) with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were enrolled and all of them underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). (123)I-BMIPP cardiac scintigraphy was performed at 7 +/- 3 days after admission. The WR was calculated from the polar map and the regional BMIPP defect score was calculated using a 17 segment model. Echocardiography was performed within 24 h of admission and at 3 months to record the ejection fraction (EF), the wall motion score index (WMSI), the ratio of the mitralinflow velocity to the early diastolic velocity (E/E0)and the myocardial performance index (MPI). The mean global WR of the BMIPP was 22.12 +/- 7.22%, and it was significantly correlated with the improvement of the WMSI (r = 0.61, P\0.004). However,the relative changes of the EF, E/E0 and MPI were not correlated with the WR. The BMIPP defect score (18 +/- 10) was significantly correlated with the WMSI on admission (r = 0.74, P = 0.0002), but the defect score was not correlated with the relative changes of any of the echocardiographic parameters. We proved that the WR of the BMIPP is a promising indicator of improvement of the LV wall motion (WMSI) following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and successful reperfusion.
