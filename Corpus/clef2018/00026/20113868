Neoplastic disease of the vertebral column: radiologic-pathologic correlation. Spine imaging is frequently performed in daily practice. Due to the high frequency of spine examinations and the multiple modalities (ie, radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography/computed tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography) used for imaging, neoplastic disease of the vertebral column will occasionally be encountered by practicing radiologists. When a lesion in the spine is encountered, it is helpful to have an understanding of the general types of pathology and key differentiating features that may aid in guiding appropriate workup (eg, no follow-up required, short-term follow-up, or directed biopsy). This article aims to provide a framework for characterizing neoplastic disease in the spine and allows the practicing radiologist an opportunity to develop a more concise and accurate differential diagnosis with which to guide clinical management.
