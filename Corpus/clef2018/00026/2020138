Clinical application of 99mTc-SQ30,217 myocardial imaging--a study of pharmacokinetics and imaging time. 99mTc-SQ30217 555 MBq (15 mCi) was intravenously injected to 6 healthy subjects to study its safety, pharmacokinetics and the imaging time. Neither side effects nor abnormalities in physical findings, hemato-biochemical tests, urinary test, etc. caused by this agent were observed in any case and its safety was suggested. Radiation dose estimates over the entire body was 4.88 mGy/1,110 MBq (0.488 rad) and that over the major organs was less than 10 mGy and they were within the allowable ranges. 99mTc-SQ30217 showed biphasic disappearance curve in blood with the half-life of alpha-phase 0.02 hour and that of beta-phase 10.14 hours. 99mTc-SQ30217 was considered to show characteristic pharmacokinetics in that the myocardial accumulation was high in an early stage of the administration, but it rapidly decreased. Both heart to liver ratio and heart to lung ratio were high within 10 minutes, but they decreased after 15 minutes. As a result of SPECT imaging of 4 patients with ischemic cardiac disease, the images obtained with 99mTc-SQ30217 at an early period after the administration was as good as those with 201Tl and the appearance of defects in the images with both agents was similar. 99mTc-SQ30217 was considered to be sufficiently useful as a 99mTc-labelled agent for myocardial blood flow.
