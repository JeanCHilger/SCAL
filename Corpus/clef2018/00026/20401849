Radiological and scintigraphic evaluation versus stereotaxic biopsy for intracranial hypodense lesions: a comparative study. Intracranial hypodense lesions include a wide group of pathologies with different structures and characters. Although the radiological imaging properties of these neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions are similar, treatment modalities for each lesion differs due to histopathological structure.In this study we have compared the results of radiological and scintigraphic evaluations with the results of stereotaxic biopsies to figure out the diagnostic impact of these non-inasive modalities. 16 patients who admitted to outpatient clinics with headache and/or seizure complaints were included in the study.MR spectroscopic images diagnosed the lesions as accurately as stereotaxic biopsies.Although stereotaxic biopsy keeps the label of "gold standard" when establishing a diagnosis for these lesions, modern radiological modalities are quite reliable.
