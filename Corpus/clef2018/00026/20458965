A new mutation in pea Pisum L. in Tl locus. A new pea mutant with repeatedly odd pinnate leaf type is found. The compound leaf of the mutant differs from the earlier known forms with repeatedly odd pinnate leaf type by very narrow and elongated leaflets inclined to interlacing. It was shown that occurrence of the new form of repeatedly odd pinnate leaves is caused by a mutation in the locus Tl (VII chromosome). The mutation is not analogous to the White's acacia Tl(w) or the Lamm's acacia tl(pet). The recessive nature of the new mutant gene to the allele tl(w) is established. The designation tl(UL) is offered for the new mutation. Plants with a new acacia leaf type (genotype tlUL tlUL Af-) have been received.
