Influence of genotype on dopamine transporter availability in human striatum and sleep architecture. Genetic variants may modulate dopamine transporter (DAT) availability in the brain. A polymorphism within the intron 8 of the DAT1 gene was evaluated in 27 healthy men. No correlation between Int8 VNTR and either the inter-individual variability of the sleep architecture, or the DAT availability, as measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and [(⁹⁹m)Tc]TRODAT-1 was observed.
