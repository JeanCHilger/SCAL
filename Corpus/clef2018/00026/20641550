. Under normal conditions the myocardium can metabolize several different types of substrates for energy. Although fatty acids supply almost 66% of the energy requirements of this tissue, the myocardium can also metabolize glucose (the second most preferred substrate), lactate, amino acids, and ketone bodies (1). Either through β-oxidation or glycolysis the fatty acids and glucose are, respectively, broken down to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), which is further oxidized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle to produce energy. Certain pathological conditions, such as ischemia, are known to alter myocardial metabolism, and the reduced availability of oxygen shifts the myocardium into an anaerobic mode that leads to an increased utilization of glucose for energy because glycolysis requires less oxygen in comparison to β-oxidation (2). Therefore, different imaging agents are used to assess myocardial changes observed during heart disease. For example, radioactive fluorodeoxyglucose ([
