 Acetylcholinerase (AChE) is an enzyme involved in terminating nerve impulses by hydrolyzing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). It plays an important role in heart rate and cardiac contractions, for example, by decreasing the ACh levels associated with cardiac parasympathetic responses (1). AChE, and more exactly the inhibition of its enzymatic function, also seems to play an important role in poisoning from organophosphorus (OP) agents (2). Current treatments consisting of a reversible covalent AChE inhibitor (pyridostigmine (3)), a receptor antagonist atropine (ATR), and a AChE reactivator (pralidoxime chloride) have shown good protection against OP intoxication in animals. Research efforts are being made to find drugs with multiple protective functions. For example, Leader et al. (4) synthesized and evaluated a group of pyridophen analogues, binary pyridogstigmine-aprophen prodrugs with differential inhibition of AChE, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and muscarinic receptors (5). Most of the AChE heart tracers developed for cardiac neurotransmission using positron emission tomography (PET) have shown low selectivity of AChE over BChE, and non-specific binding in AChE enzyme overexpressed regions (6).
