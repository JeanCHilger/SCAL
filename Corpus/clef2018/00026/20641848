 Asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) is specifically taken into mammalian hepatocytes by binding to ASGP receptors (ASGP-Rs) (1). The galactosyl moiety of ASGP is recognized on the surface of hepatocytes and is bound by ASGP-R. The ASGPâ€“ASGP-R complex on the cell surface is subsequently taken into cytoplasm by endocytosis and transferred to lysosomes. ASGP-R is then dissociated from ASGP and recycled to the cell surface. ASGP is degraded in the lysosomes and excreted into the bile. The number of ASGP-Rs on the hepatocytes of individuals with liver disease decreases and is thus considered a good indicator for the evaluation of liver function. Because ASGP-R recognizes galactose,
