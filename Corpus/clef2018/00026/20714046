Evaluation of image reconstruction for mouse brain imaging with synthetic collimation from highly multiplexed SiliSPECT projections. We have performed a theoretical study to explore the potential and limitations of synthetic collimation for SPECT imaging with stacked-detector acquisition (dual magnification). This study will be used to optimize SiliSPECT, a small-animal SPECT for imaging small volumes such as a mouse brain at high sensitivity and resolution. The synthetic collimation enables image reconstruction with a limited number of camera views and in the presence of significant multiplexing. We also developed a new formulation to quantify the multiplexed object sensitivity and investigated how this changes for different acquisition parameters such as number of pinholes and combinations of front and back detector distances for imaging objects as small as the mouse brain. In our theoretical studies, we were not only able to demonstrate better reconstruction results by incorporating two detector magnifications in comparison to either one alone, but also observed an improved image reconstruction by optimizing the detector-collimator distances to change the multiplexing ratio between the front and back detectors.
