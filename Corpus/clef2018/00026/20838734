Bone scanning with sodium 18F-fluoride PET and PET/CT. German guideline Version 1.0.. In nuclear medicine, bone scanning is based on the principle of scintigraphy using bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals which accumulate in sites of increased bone formation. From a historical point of view, (18)F-fluoride was one of the first osteotropic tracers which was replaced by (99m)Tc-labelled polyphosphonates. With the development of modern PET equipment the superior diagnostic performance of (18)F-fluoride PET for the detection and characterization of osseous lesions was proven in comparison to conventional bone scanning. Recently, its importance as a substitute of conventional skeletal scintigraphy increased in a time with limited availability of (99)Mo/(99m)Tc. To ensure health care during this period, (18)F-fluoride PET currently became part of common outpatient care. This guideline comprehends recommendations on indications, protocols, interpretation and reporting of (18)F-fluoride PET and PET/CT.
