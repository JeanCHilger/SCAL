Expression of bovine (Bos indicus) interleukin-18 in Escherichia coli and its biological activity. IL-18 modulates immune functions by inducing IFN-γ production and promoting Th1 immune responses. In the present study, we amplified and cloned the sequence (582 bp) encoding full-length bovine IL-18 from PBMC stimulated with PHA. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequence of Bos indicus IL-18 showed an identity of 86-98% compared with IL-18 sequences of other ruminants. The insert was subcloned into a pET 32a vector and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein and the matured protein was obtained by caspase I treatment. The specificity of these proteins was confirmed by western blotting. The biological activity of the purified protein was analyzed by its ability to induce IFN-γ production in PBMC measured by ELISA and qPCR.
