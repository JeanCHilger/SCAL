In-vivo quantitative imaging of catecholaminergic nerve terminals in brain and peripheral organs using positron emission tomography (PET). Positron emission tomography (PET), has made possible quantitative imaging of the origins of positron-emitting isotopes, such as 11C and 18F, in intact animals and in humans. Lack of absolute specificity of enzymes, storage mechanisms and transporters allows 11C-or 18F-labelled "false transmitters" to be formed, stored and released from nerve terminals. Discussed are the assumptions, limitations, and advantages of 18F-6-fluoroDOPA, 18F-6-fluorodopamine, 18F-6-fluorometaraminol, and 11C-N-methyl-metaraminol (m-hydroxyephedrine) for PET imaging of dopaminergic nerve terminals in brain or sympathetic innervation in peripheral organs.
