Relationship between thyroid hormone levels and regional cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer disease. Subclinical thyroid disease and even variations in thyroid function within the normal range is associated with cognitive function and a risk of Alzheimer disease (AD). Several studies reported the effect of thyroid hormones on cerebral blood flow. The aim of this study was to objectively evaluate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in association with thyroid hormone levels within the normal range in patients with AD. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T3, and free T4 levels were measured in 62 patients with AD (23 men and 39 women age 56 to 91 y
