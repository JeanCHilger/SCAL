Application of recombinant and non-recombinant peptides in the determination of tumor response to cancer therapy. An early and reliable assessment of therapeutic efficacy during the treatment of cancer is essential to achieve an optimal treatment regimen and patient outcome. The use of labeled peptides to monitor tumor response is associated with several advantages. For example, peptides are very stable, non-immunogenic, are easy to label for imaging, they undergo rapid clearance from the circulation, can penetrate tumor tissue, and are inexpensive to synthesize. In this review, studies using recombinant and non-recombinant peptides to monitor the response of glioblastoma multiforme, lung, breast, pancreas, colon, prostate, and skin carcinomas to radiation and/or chemotherapeutics such as camptothecin, doxorubicin, etoposide, 5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel, AG3340, sunitinib, and dasatinib, are presented. A consideration of the imaging techniques available to monitor peptide localization, including near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and ultrasonography, is also included. Peptides that have been successfully used to monitor various tumor types and therapies have been shown to target proteins that undergo changes in expression in response to treatment, endothelial cells that respond to radiation, or mediators of apoptosis. Peptides that are able to selectively bind responsive versus unresponsive tumors have also been identified. Therefore, the advantages associated with the use of peptides, combined with the capacity for selected peptides to assess tumor response as demonstrated in various studies, support the use of labeled peptides to evaluate the effectiveness of a given cancer therapy.
