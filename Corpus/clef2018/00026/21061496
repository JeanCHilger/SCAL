. Hypoxic tumors are often resistant to radio- and chemotherapy, have a high metastatic potential, and predict a poor outcome for the cancer patient (1). Although several techniques (invasive and noninvasive) are available for the detection of hypoxia in tumors, these methods are not completely reliable because they yield variable diagnoses, have functional limitations, show incomplete penetration of tumors, or do not detect hypoxia in all tumor types (2, 3). A common feature of most solid cancerous tumor types is the presence of hypoxic conditions (2) and the overexpression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX exists in several isomeric forms), a transmembrane cell-surface metallo-enzyme that has been shown to acidify the pH of tumor cells to ~6.5 compared to pH ~7.4 for normal cells (4, 5). The induction of CA IX through the hypoxia-inducible factor-I transcription factor pathway and its role in tumorigenesis has been described in detail by Guler et al. (5). In view of its role in the development and progression of neoplastic tumors, oncologists and researchers are pursuing CA IX inhibitors for the detection or therapy of different cancer types. As a result, several small molecule inhibitors of CA are available, and among these compounds some sulfonamide derivatives have shown high selectivity for CA IX (6). It has also been shown that not only overexpression but also activation of the enzyme facilitates the accumulation of sulfonamides in a hypoxic tumor (7). Therefore, noninvasive imaging of CA IX would be an excellent technique to detect tumor hypoxia to develop a suitable treatment regimen for cancer patients. To achieve this, [
