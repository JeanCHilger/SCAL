Preliminary Monte Carlo study of (18)F-FDG SPECT imaging with LaBr(3):Ce Crystal-based Gamma Cameras. The utility of (18)F-deoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) in oncology, cardiology, and neurology has generated great interest in a more economical ways of imaging (18)F-FDG than conventional PET scanners. The main thrust of this work is to investigate the potential use of LaBr(3):Ce materials in a low-cost FDG-SPECT system compared to NaI(Tl) using GATE Monte Carlo simulation. System performance at 140 keV and 511 keV was assessed using energy spectra, system sensitivity and count rate performance. Comparison of the LaBr(3):Ce and NaI(Tl) crystal-based systems showed 4.5% and 8.9% higher system sensitivity for the LaBr(3):Ce at 140 keV and 511 keV, respectively. The LaBr(3):Ce scintillator significantly improves intrinsic count rate performance due to its fast decay time with respect to NaI(Tl). In conclusion, because LaBr(3):Ce crystal combines excellent intrinsic count rate performance with slightly increased system sensitivity, it has the potential to be used for (18)F-FDG -SPECT systems.
