Analysis of the relationship between interictal electrical source imaging and PET hypometabolism. The aim of this paper is to compare interictal EEG source localizations with statistical analysis of hypometabolisms in PET brain imaging. Both methods are currently used in the pre-surgical evaluation of drug-resistant partial epilepsy, but the relationship between electrical source localizations and hypometabolic areas has not been well defined yet. At the present time, these two methods have been performed on five patients in order to develop a comparative quantitative study with these first results which should be then extended to a larger patient database.
