Crystal structure and complexation and fluorescence behaviors of 1,4-bis (9-anthracenylmethyl) piperazine. The crystal structure of the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) fluoroionophore (3) was clarified by X-ray crystallographic analysis. A molecule 3 sits on a center of symmetry such that two anthracene ring systems are in an anti conformation with respect to one another across the piperazine ring. Intermolecular C-H···π and π···π interactions are observed. It was found that 3 was displayed unique photophysical properties in the presence of guest cations. Complexation of 3 with Zn²+ and NH⁴+ increased the fluorescence intensities of the host by a factor of 20.
