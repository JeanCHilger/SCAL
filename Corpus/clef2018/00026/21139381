Neuroradiology and art: a review and personal contribution. Radiology has attracted the world of art with the esthetic value of its images, and as a new medium for the artistic expression. In order to investigate the links between neuroradiology and art, we examined 12,763 artworks presented in corresponding publications and in Google images on the Internet. The selected artworks were created by 1,964 authors. To give our own contribution to this field, we produced several artful radiological images using the X-ray of 4 cerebral hemispheres, one dissected brain, serial sections of one head and brain, the vascular casts of 2 brains, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of one volunteer, and various options in Photoshop. Among the examined artworks, neuroradiological images were used in 129 artworks (1.01%) that were created by 31 artists (1.58%). The artists applied different radiological techniques: X-ray, angiography, computed tomography (CT), multislice CT, MRI, functional MRI, positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), either alone or in various combinations. They used the original images, i.e. radiographs or scans, or their electronic modifications in Photoshop or three-dimensional (3D) software. Some artworks presented the skull, yet others the brain, and still others both, either with or without a head image. The neuroradiological artworks were created as paintings, photographs, digital works and sculptures. Their authors were professional artists, designers, amateurs and radiologists. In conclusion, thanks to the esthetics of some radiological images and the valuable creations of certain artists, neuroradiology has become an important field of contemporary art.
