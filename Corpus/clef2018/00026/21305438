Intraoperative sonography: a technique for localizing focal forms of congenital hyperinsulinism in the pancreas. Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), syn. nesidioblastosis, is the most frequent cause of persistent, recurrent hypoglycemia in infancy. One third of patients show a single circumscribed focus. Enucleation of the focus and the removal of all affected β-cells with preservation of healthy tissue is the treatment of choice. The intrapancreatic choledochus as well as the ductus pancreaticus major must remain intact. The diagnostic gold standard is 18F-DOPA-PET/CT. Intraoperative sonography is carried out to correctly visualize the focus preoperatively localized by PET/CT in situ during the operation. The enucleation of the focus was carried out 3 - 20 days after PET/CT in 5 patients at an age of 3.5 - 14 months. Intraoperative ultrasound was carried out with high-capacity devices of different manufacturers under use of broadband probes (9 - 14 MHz). The localization by intraoperative ultrasound was accurate in all 5 patients with focal CHI, with regard to the intraoperative localization as previously described by PET/CT and histology. D. choledochus and D. pancreaticus major were separated intraoperatively by ultrasound. 3 of 5 patients were cured by complete enucleation of the focus. Nevertheless, the entire intraoperative identification of the segmented focus is still problematic. Characteristic sonographic features of a CHI focus are: hypoechogenicity, variable homogeneous and inhomogenous texture, blurred, irregular limitation without capsule, filiform, lobular processes, and insular dispersal into the surrounding tissue. Intraoperative high-resolution sonography helps the pediatric surgeon to determine size, configuration and topography of a CHI focus.
