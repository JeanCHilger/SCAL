Noninvasive Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Coronary Arterial Inflammation. The importance of inflammation to atherothrombosis has led to the pursuit of noninvasive imaging methods to measure inflammation within the arterial wall. There is substantial evidence supporting the use of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging for evaluation of atherosclerotic plaque inflammation. However, coronary imaging with this technique has been limited, due to several technical hurdles. Nonetheless, early experiences in coronary FDG-PET imaging have been encouraging. This review outlines the development of vascular PET imaging and its potential use for evaluation of coronary artery disease.
