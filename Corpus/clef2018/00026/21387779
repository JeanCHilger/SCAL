Quantitative analysis of heart scintigraphy (99mTc-MIBI GSPECT) with regional myocardial wall motion and systolic thickening of left ventricle assessment for detecting myocardial damage in ethanol withdrawal patients. Severe ethanol withdrawal syndrome, with psychosomatic symptoms, is life-threatening condition and if not treated can be fatal (in approximately 15% of cases). The purpose of this investigation was to assess cardiac muscle function using 99mTc-MIBI GSPECT in acute alcohol withdrawal. The group examined consisted of 10 males aged from 33 to 45 (45.7 +/- 8.82) because of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The control group for quantitative analysis of the heart scintigraphy (GSPECT) consisted of 20 people referred for examination to the Laboratory of Nuclear Medicine, Jagiellonian University, which results of cardiac perfusion scintigraphy were assessed as normal. In acute withdrawal syndrome quantitative analysis of the heart scintigraphy (99mTc-MIBI GSPECT) revealed impaired regional wall motion and wall thickening related mainly to the lower wall segments. The abnormalities in myocardial perfusion (99mTc-MIBI GSPECT) was found in varying degrees of severity in all patients.
