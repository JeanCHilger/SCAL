Synthesis of 68Ga-labeled DOTA-nitroimidazole derivatives and their feasibilities as hypoxia imaging PET tracers. The imaging of hypoxia is important for therapeutic decision making in various diseases. (68)Ga is an important radionuclide for positron emission tomography (PET), and its usage is increasing, due to the development of the (68)Ge/(68)Ga-generator. In the present study, the authors synthesized two nitroimidazole derivatives by conjugating nitroimidazole and 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) via an amide bond (4) and a thiourea bond (5). Both derivatives were labeled with (68)Ga with high labeling efficiency and were stable after labeling. The low partition coefficients (logP) of (68)Ga-4 (-4.6) and (68)Ga-5 (-4.5) demonstrated the hydrophilic natures of the derivatives, and both showed higher uptake in cancer cell lines cultured under hypoxic condition than under normoxic condition. However, (68)Ga-5 showed higher liver uptake than (68)Ga-4 in a biodistribution study due to higher lipophilicity. In an animal PET study, (68)Ga-4 showed higher standard uptake values (SUV) in tumors than (68)Ga-5 in mice xenografted with CT-26 mouse colon cancer cells.
