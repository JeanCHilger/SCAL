Gastric and pulmonary lymphoma presenting as a solitary pulmonary nodule. The common presentations of lymphoma are widespread lymphadenopathy or development of constitutional symptoms. This paper presents a case of a patient who presented with a solitary mass detected on chest X-ray and underwent FDG-PET for further evaluation of this mass. FDG-PET is a commonly utilised technique to assess solitary nodules as it not only allows characterisation of the lesion but can also detect nodal and extra-thoracic disease with greater accuracy than the standard CT. In this case, FDG-PET demonstrated abnormal activity in the lung nodule and at the gastro-oesophageal junction. Biopsies confirmed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma at both sites. The value of FDG-PET in this case was the determination of previous unsuspected disease in an unusual presentation of lymphoma and as a useful tool for monitoring the therapeutic effect post chemotherapy.
