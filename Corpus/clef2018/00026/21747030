In vivo assessment of vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 in dementia with lewy bodies and Alzheimer disease. To assess the diagnostic potential of imaging striatal monoaminergic terminal integrity with the vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) radioligand (18)F 9-fluropropyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine ([(18)F]AV-133) and positron emission tomography to distinguish dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer disease (AD).Nine patients with DLB, 10 patients with AD, 20 patients with Parkinson disease (PD), and 10 healthy age-matched control subjects underwent [(18)F]AV-133 positron emission tomography studies. VMAT2 density was calculated through normalized tissue uptake value ratios at 120 to 140 minutes postinjection using the primary visual cortex as the reference region.Comparison of the tissue ratio for [(18)F]AV-133 between the different clinical diagnostic groups.Lower VMAT2 densities were observed in patients with DLB when compared with patients with AD especially in the posterior putamen (caudate: mean [SD], 1.24 [0.6] vs 2.83 [0.9] P < .001[(18)F]AV-133 allows assessment of nigrostriatal degeneration in Lewy body diseases. [(18)F]AV-133 can robustly detect reductions of dopaminergic nigrostriatal afferents in patients with DLB and assist in the differential diagnosis from AD.
