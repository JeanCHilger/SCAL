Flexible organic light-emitting diodes with a polymeric nanocomposite anode. Flexible organic light-emitting diodes (FOLEDs) are facing mechanical issues arising from failure of the indium-tin oxide (ITO) films fabricated on flexible substrates. Polymeric nanocomposite anodes were fabricated by including single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in aqueous poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). The conductivity, transmittance and flexibility of the polymeric nanocomposite anode were characterized. The polymeric nanocomposite anodes fabricated on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrate exhibited superior bending properties to ITO anodes on PET. The FOLEDs fabricated on the polymeric nanocomposite anodes had a low turn-on voltage and higher luminous intensity than those fabricated on ITO/PET anodes. This flexible nanocomposite polymeric anode is a very promising for fully FOLEDs and other optoelectronics.
