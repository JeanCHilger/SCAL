Animal tumor models for PET in drug development. Positron emission tomography (PET) is being increasingly applied to animal tumor models due to the need for proof-of-concept testing and preclinical efficacy studies of anticancer agents. Regardless of the nature of an experiment, investigators should carefully select a suitable animal tumor model as part of the experimental design. This review introduces sources of information and the guiding principles regarding applicability of various animal tumor models for PET in anticancer agent development especially for small animals.
