Structural, functional and spectroscopic MRI studies of methamphetamine addiction. This chapter reviews selected neuroimaging findings related to long-term amphetamine and methamphetamine (MA) use. An overview of structural and functional (fMRI) MR studies, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies conducted in long-term MA abusers is presented. The focus of this chapter is to present the relevant studies as tools to understand brain changes following drug abstinence and recovery from addiction. The behavioral relevance of these neuroimaging studies is discussed as they relate to clinical symptoms and treatment. Within each imaging section this chapter includes a discussion of the relevant imaging studies as they relate to patterns of drug use (i.e., duration of MA use, cumulative lifetime dose and time MA abstinent) as well as an overview of studies that link the imaging findings to cognitive measures. In our conclusion we discuss some of the future directions of neuroimaging as it relates to the pathophysiology of addiction.
