The use and importance of liposomes in positron emission tomography. Among different imaging modalities, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) gained importance in routine hospital practice depending on ability to diagnose diseases in early stages and tracing of therapy by obtaining metabolic information. The combination of PET with Computed Tomography (CT) forms hybrid imaging modality that gives chance to obtain better images having higher resolution by fusing both functional and anatomical images in the same imaging modality at the same time. Therefore, better contrast agents are essentially needed. The advance in research about developing drug delivery systems as specific nanosized targeted systems gained an additional importance for obtaining better diagnosis and therapy of different diseases. Liposomes appear to be more attractive drug delivery systems in delivering either drugs or imaging ligands to target tissue or organ of diseases with higher accumulation by producing in nano-scale, long circulating by stealth effect and specific targeting by modifying with specific ligands or markers. The combination of positron emitting radionuclides with liposomes are commonly in research level nowadays and there is no commercially available liposome formulation for PET imaging. However by conjugating positron emitter radionuclide with liposomes can form promising diagnostic agents for improved diagnosis and following up treatments by increasing image signal/contrast in the target tissue in lower concentrations by specific targeting as the most important advantage of liposomes. More accurate and earlier diagnosis of several diseases can be obtained even in molecular level with the use of stable and effectively radiolabeled molecular target specific nano sized liposomes with longer half-lived positron emitting radionuclides.
