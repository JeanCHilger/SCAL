¹⁸F]FDG-PET/CT in patients affected by retroperitoneal fibrosis: a bicentric experienc. The aim of our study was to assess the feasibility and usefulness of 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose positron emission tomography computed tomography ([(18)F]FDG-PET/CT) in patients affected by retroperitoneal fibrosis.We retrospectively evaluated 25 patients studied in two centers: 18 underwent [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT as initial evaluation, three during follow-up, three during steroid therapy, and one to re-evaluate the disease. Among the group who underwent initial evaluation, ten underwent a second [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT after steroid therapy.[(18)F]FDG-PET/CT was positive in 18 patients and negative in seven. Among the ten patients who underwent a second study after steroid therapy, six showed complete metabolic response, three partial response, and one no significant maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) reduction.Our preliminary results show that [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT is feasible and suitable for evaluating retroperitoneal fibrosis and is useful in assessing therapy response. Larger studies are desirable to confirm these findings and to determine the appropriate position of [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT in the diagnostic flow chart for this disease.
