FDG PET/CT Response Evaluation in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma Patients Treated with Talc Pleurodesis and Chemotherapy. Talc pleurodesis (TP) is employed worldwide for the management of persistent pneumothorax or pleural effusion, particularly of malignant origin. However, there are very little available data on (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F FDG PET/CT) response evaluation in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) patients treated with TP and chemotherapy.Patients with histologically confirmed MPM underwent TP and FDG PET/CT staging and restaging after 3-4 courses of chemotherapy. All patients fasted and received a dose of 5.18 MBq (18)F-FDG per kilogram of body weight. Whole-body emission scans were acquired with and without Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) iterative reconstruction algorithm.From January 2004 to March 2010, 8 patients with biopsy confirmed MPM (7 epithelial, 1 biphasic), with a median age of 65 years (range: 54-77), were evaluated. Median follow-up was 31 months (range: 4-44). After TP treatment, there was a mean interval of 14 days (range: 9-22) and 125 days (range: 76-162) between FDG PET/CT staging and restaging. According to modified RECIST and EORTC criteria, there was a concordance between the radiologic and metabolic SUVmean and SUVmax responses in 6 (75%) and 3 (37.5%) patients, respectively.TP produces an increased FDG PET uptake which may interfere with the post-chemotherapy disease evaluation. In our case series, the metabolic response measured by SUVmean seems to be in better agreement with the radiologic response compared to the SUVmax.
