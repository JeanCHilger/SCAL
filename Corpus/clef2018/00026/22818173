Use of a TLD-based multisphere spectrometry system to measure the neutron spectra around a not-self-shielded PET cyclotron: Preliminary results. In the present work, we utilized the BSS system with TLD-600 and TLD-700 to measure the neutron spectra around the GE-PETtrace 8 cyclotron of the Development Centre of Nuclear Technology (CDTN/CNEN) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The cyclotron is capable of accelerating protons up to 16.5 MeV, to production of fluorine-18. Four points inside the bunker of the cyclotron were studied. Two points in front of the primary radiation beam and other two opposed to the primary radiation beam. The measurements were unfolded with the BUMS and the NSDUAZ computer codes. The dosimetric quantities obtained were in agreement with the other published data and were coherent with the expected from theoretical estimates obtained from source term informed by the manufacturer of the cyclotron.
