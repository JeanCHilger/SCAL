Improved functional mitral regurgitation after off-pump revascularization in acute coronary syndrome. We evaluated the effect of isolated off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting on functional ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) associated with acute coronary syndrome.Of 1,419 acute coronary syndrome patients who underwent coronary revascularization between 2000 and 2010 (1,324 off-pump and 95 on-pump), 59 OPCAB patients had greater than mild degree functional IMR preoperatively (31 mild to moderate, 23 moderate, 5 severe). Clinical outcomes and results from echocardiography, angiography, and myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography performed early and 1 year postoperatively were analyzed.Operative mortality was 5.1% (3 of 59). All survivors underwent early postoperative echocardiograms, which showed 0 patients with worsened IMR 41 with less than or equal to mild degree residual IMR (NMR group)Most functional IMR associated with acute coronary syndrome, including severe degree IMR, improved during the first postoperative year after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.
