The role of imaging techniques in the management of multiple myeloma. Bone disease is the major feature of multiple myeloma (MM). Imaging is required for correct staging, in the follow-up after treatment and, as recently highlighted, is predictor of prognosis. In the near future, whole-body X-Ray may be replaced by more sensitive techniques, such as whole-body low-dose computerized tomography (CT). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard method for assessing bone marrow infiltration of the spine, predicting the risk of vertebral fracture and distinguishing between benign and malignant osteoporosis. Positron emission tomography (PET) with CT (PET/CT) provides important information about the extent of whole-body disease, including soft tissue masses, and is the best tool to distinguish between active or inactive disease after therapy. Both MRI and PET/CT are predictors of clinical outcome. A prospective use of these newer imaging techniques in both clinical trials and clinical practice may help optimize MM management in the near future.
