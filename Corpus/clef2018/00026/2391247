125I]MIBG uptake and release in different regions of the rat brai. Radioiodinated m-iodobenzylguanidine [( 125I]MIBG) and tritiated norepinephrine [( 3H]NE]) uptake and release were compared, in different regions of the brain of the rat. The classification of the regions according to uptake was the same for both tracers:striatum greater than hypothalamus greater than hippocampus greater than cortex greater than brainstem. Tetrabenazine (TBZ), a granular monoamine uptake inhibitor reduced the uptake in the different regions. The inhibition rate was higher for [3H]NE uptake than for [125I]MIBG. The spontaneous release was the same for [125I]MIBG and [3H]NE and was the lowest in the striatum. The K+ stimulated release of [3H]NE was more complete than the release of [125I]MIBG and was the most important in the striatum. From these results, it is inferred that MIBG enters the brain tissue via NE uptake mechanisms. It appears that MIBG is stored in the chromaffin granules, as NE, but also in the cytoplasm. A modified molecule derived from MIBG which would cross the blood-brain barrier, would then appear as a potential scintigraphic marker of monoamine uptake, storage and release.
