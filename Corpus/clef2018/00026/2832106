An evaluation of the uptake of technetium-99m (v) dimercaptosuccinic acid in patients with squamous carcinoma of the head and neck. A new imaging agent, Technetium-99m (Tc99m) (v) Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), has recently been developed which has been used to evaluate head and neck tumours. Twenty-four patients were studied of whom 21 had histologically proven SCC of the head and neck. The remaining 3 had benign lesions. Planar imaging of patients with primary disease revealed a sensitivity of 83% and a 75% specificity. The results of planar imaging of patients with cervical metastases yielded a 92% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Seven patients also had single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) which improved the image quality, spatial resolution and sensitivity of the investigation. Tc99m (v) DMSA imaging provides a cheap and rapid means of investigating head and neck SCC. This study suggests further work is indicated to assess its role in diagnosis and subsequent management.
