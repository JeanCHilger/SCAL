Value of myocardial defect size measured by thallium-201 SPECT: results of a multicenter trial comparing heparin and a new fibrinolytic agent. In a multicenter randomized double-blind trial comparing heparin and a new fibrinolytic agent, anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC), 231 patients presenting with a less than 5 hr acute myocardial infarction underwent a contrast angiography (CA) before the end of the first week of admission, and radionuclide cardiac blood-pool imaging and a 201Tl single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) study before the end of the third week. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and a wall motion score (WM) were calculated from CA. LVEF was also obtained from cardiac blood-pool imaging, and defect size (DS) from 201Tl SPECT. Results demonstrated that all parameters were significantly improved in patients treated with APSAC versus heparin (contrast LVEF 53 +/- 13 vs. 47 +/- 14 p less than 0.01, WM 9.8 +/- 6.5 vs. 13.3 +/- 7.9 p less than 0.001, radionuclide LVEF 43 +/- 12 vs. 40 +/- 13 p less than 0.05, DS 14 +/- 12 vs. 18 +/- 14 p less than 0.05). When the patients were divided according to infarct site and infarct-related coronary artery patency, it was demonstrated with all four parameters that the beneficial effect of APSAC can be largely explained by the lower incidence of vessel obstruction in this group (37% vs. 77% in the heparin group, p less than 0.001). It is concluded that (a) when compared with heparin and in the conditions of the trial, APSAC significantly improves the cardiac function and decreases the DS and (b) DS measured by 201Tl SPECT is as valuable a quantitative parameter of therapeutic evaluation as are LVEF and WM.
