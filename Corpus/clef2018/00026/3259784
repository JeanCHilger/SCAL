Monoamine re-uptake sites in the human brain evaluated in vivo by means of 11C-nomifensine and positron emission tomography: the effects of age and Parkinson's disease. Six patients with Parkinson's disease, selected to cover a range of clinical features, and 7 healthy volunteers aged 24-81 years, were examined by positron emission tomography after i.v. injection of racemic 11C-nomifensine, a catecholamine re-uptake blocking drug. After injection the radiotracer, radioactivity was rapidly distributed to the brain. The highest accumulation of radioactivity was found in areas rich in dopaminergic and noradrenergic innervation, such as the striatum and the thalamus. In regions with negligible dopaminergic and noradrenergic innervation, such as the cerebellum, radioactivity was lower and evenly distributed. In all investigated brain regions a marked age-related decline in 11C-nomifensine-derived radioactivity relative to the cerebellum was observed in the group of healthy volunteers. Parkinsonian patients did not show such a decline with age. In the group of parkinsonian patients with mainly unilateral involvement, the contralateral putamen exhibited the most pronounced decrease. Only the 3 parkinsonian patients aged 63 and younger showed markedly lower 11C-nomifensine binding in striatal areas than age-matched healthy volunteers. 11C-nomifensine seems to be a valuable tool for investigating noradrenergic and dopaminergic re-uptake sites in vivo. Further achievements will most likely be made when the active enantiomer becomes available.
