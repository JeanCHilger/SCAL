An iterative strategy for determining the source distribution in single photon tomography using a rotating gamma camera (SPECT). A new iterative strategy for determination of the source distribution in single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) simulates mathematically the scintigraphic imaging process during direction sum computation. Limited spatial resolution and gamma-ray attenuation are taken into account using simplifying approximations. Highly resolved low-noise tomograms without obvious artifacts are obtained. Results of phantom measurements as well as cases of thyroid and brain perfusion imaging are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the method.
