Magnetic resonance imaging in intractable partial epilepsy: correlative studies. A study was performed evaluating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 35 patients with intractable complex partial seizures in whom computed tomographic (CT) scans showed no focal abnormalities. These results were correlated with positron emission tomography evaluation (PET), the electroencephalographic ictal onset, and findings during pathological examination. Seven patients had structural lesions that were epileptogenic, detected by MRI the lesions were tuberous sclerosis, astrocytomas, or hamartomas. Three of these 7 patients underwent PET scanning, which was normal in all. Of 18 patients with mesial temporal sclerosis, 10 were shown by PET to have temporal lobe hypometabolism, though all 18 had normal MRI findings. The results indicate that MRI contributes information to that provided by CT and PET, by detecting nonsclerotic epileptogenic lesions of the temporal lobe.
