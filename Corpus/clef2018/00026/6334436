Transient ST-segment depression as a marker of myocardial ischemia during daily life. Patients with angina and coronary artery disease (CAD) have many episodes of transient ST-segment depression during ordinary daily life, and these are often asymptomatic. To investigate this signal as a marker of myocardial ischemia, 30 patients with chronic stable angina and CAD underwent positron tomography, recording the regional myocardial uptake of rubidium-82, pain and ST-segment changes before, during and after 59 technically satisfactory exercise tests, 35 cold pressor tests and 22 episodes of unprovoked ST depression. Exercise resulted in 53 episodes of ST depression with angina and in 5 episodes without pain. After cold pressor tests, there were 3 episodes of ST depression and pain and 12 of painless ST depression. Only 9 episodes of unprovoked ST depression were accompanied by pain. Tomography showed independent evidence of ischemia in 63 (97%) of the total 65 episodes of ST depression with angina and in all 30 episodes of painless ST depression. In each patient perfusion defects occurred in the same myocardial segment during painful and painless ST depression and responses were significantly different from those in 16 normal subjects studied in the same way. These findings support the use of transient ST depression in continuous monitoring to assess the activity of CAD, but only in patients with typical angina pectoris, ST depression during exercise and proved CAD. They strengthen the evidence derived from ambulatory monitoring for a wider picture of the disease than is generally appreciated, with more frequent episodes of silent myocardial ischemia than of angina pectoris.
