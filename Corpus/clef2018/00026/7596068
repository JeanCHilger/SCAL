Clinical significance of diffuse vasoconstriction of coronary arteries--a study using hyperventilation thallium-201 myocardial imaging. Hyperventilation Thallium-201 imaging was evaluated for the examination of the existence of ischemia in the cases of diffuse vasoconstriction under the ergonovine maleate provocative test for coronary artery. Transient myocardial perfusion defect (PD) was demonstrated in 14 patients with ergonovine induced vasospasm (group S), and 13 of these patients also demonstrated redistribution (RD) (92.4%). In 14 patients with diffuse vasoconstriction (group D), nine demonstrated PD, and all of them revealed RD. On the other hand, only one of ten (10%) patients demonstrated PD and RD in a group of patients without spasm or diffuse vasoconstriction (group N). In addition, the left ventricular myocardium was divided into nine segments on a SPECT image, and the mean minimum washout rate (WOR) of each segment was evaluated. These values were compared with the percent change of the lung/heart ratio between early and delayed images (delta L/H%). Both the mean minimum WOR mean and delta L/H% of group D were significantly smaller than that of group N (p < 0.001), and only approximated to group S. Thus, the possibility of myocardial ischemia of diffuse vasoconstrictive coronary artery is implicated and such patients are supposed to be treated medically as vasospastic angina.
