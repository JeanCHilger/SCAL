Relation between myocardial 18F-FDG uptake in the fasting state and coronary angiography in patients with coronary artery disease. The relationship between severity of coronary artery stenosis (CAS) and myocardial 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) uptake in the fasting state, assessed with positron emission tomography (PET), was examined in a series of 48 patients with CAS undergoing both studies for diagnostic purposes. The data analysis was based on the subdivision of the left ventricular myocardium into four segments defined in relation to ventricular vascularization: the anterior and septal segments, perfused by the left anterior descending artery the lateral segment, perfused by the left circumflex
