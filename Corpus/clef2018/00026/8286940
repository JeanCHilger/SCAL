Xenon-133 SPECT-determined regional cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's disease: what is typical? A study of 76 consecutive xenon-133 SPECT studies of regional cerebral blood flow was undertaken to determine the frequency of various patterns of blood flow in cases of clinically diagnosed probable and possible Alzheimer's disease. The reference tomographic section was a slice 6 cm above and parallel to the canthomeatal line. With the use of this technique, the "classic" finding of bilateral temporoparietal (TP) flow reductions as the sole abnormality occurred in only 28% of cases. Bilateral TP reductions accompanied by bilateral or unilateral frontal flow reductions were nearly as common (24%), and other patterns accounted for the other 48% of cases.
