Effects of body and head positions on bilateral difference in tympanic temperatures. We have examined the nonparallel changes in tympanic membrane temperatures (Tty) from the two ears in response to various changes in body and head positions. Upon assuming a lateral recumbent position, the Tty on the lower side increased while that on the upper side decreased. Pressure application over a wide area of the lateral chest only caused inconsistent and obscure asymmetric changes in Tty. A lateral flexion of the head with the subject sitting upright and a rotation of the head to the side in a supine position induced an increase in the Tty on the lower side compared to that on the upper side. The temperature and blood flow of the forehead often decreased on the lower side and increased on the upper side, although such responses were not always concomitant with the asymmetric changes in Tty. A dorsal flexion of the head with the subject in a reclining position caused a slight increase in the Tty, whereas raising the head upright induced a slight decrease in them. Two additional experiments were carried out with single photon emission computed tomography using 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime as tracer, and a slight, relative decrease in counts was noted in the right hemisphere during rotation of the head to the right. These results would strongly suggest that unilateral increases and decreases in Tty could have been caused by one-sided decreases and increases, respectively, in blood flow to the brain and/or the tympanic membrane, induced by a vasomotor reflex involving vestibular stimulation.
