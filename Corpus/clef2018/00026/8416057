Regional cerebral blood flow during experimental phobic fear. Positron emission tomographic measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were used to investigate central nervous system correlates of fear and anxiety. Volunteers with symptomatic snake phobia were studied while exposed to visual phobogenic, aversive, and neutral stimuli. Anxiety ratings and the number of nonspecific electrodermal fluctuations increased as a function of phobic stimulation. Phobic, compared to neutral and aversive, stimulation elevated rCBF in the visual associative cortex. The basal ganglia were not activated more by phobic than aversive or neutral stimulation. However, cortical and thalamic rCBF were always correlated during phobic but not aversive or neutral stimulation. This indicates that the thalamus could be a relay station for phobic stimulus processing and affect.
