Regional myocardial blood flow, glucose utilization and contractile function before and after revascularization and ultrastructural findings in patients with chronic coronary artery disease. In patients with chronic coronary artery disease, follow-up measurements of myocardial blood flow, metabolism and function were correlated with histology. In 41 patients with chronic coronary artery disease and a severely stenosed left anterior descending coronary artery, a positron emission tomographic (PET) flow/metabolism study and nuclear angiography were performed immediately before and 3 months after bypass surgery. Biopsies were taken from the left ventricular anterior wall at the time of surgery. Control biopsies were taken from donor hearts for cardiac transplantation and from hearts of patients with a defect of the atrial septum. A significant improvement of flow (P<0.01) and regional contractile function (P<0.01) was observed in the mismatch group. Glucose utilization was significantly lower (P<0.001) as compared to preoperative values. The group with preserved flow and the PET match group revealed no significant changes in flow, metabolism or function. Control biopsies revealed significantly less myolytic cells as compared to biopsies taken from both match and mismatch groups (P<0.01) and less fibrosis as compared to biopsies taken from the match group (P<0.01). Postoperatively, linear relationships were found between flow and both % fibrosis (r = 0.71, P<0.001) and regional anterior ejection fraction (r = 0.7, P<0.001). Only mismatch areas revealed significant recovery of both flow and function after revascularization with a disappearance of enhanced glucose uptake. The better linear correlation between flow and % fibrosis after surgery as compared to preoperatively was probably due to improvement of flow values in the mismatch group.
