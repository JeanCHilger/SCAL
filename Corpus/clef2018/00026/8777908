Brain SPECT imaging of neuropsychiatric disorders. Brain imaging has become an integral part of the evaluation of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Functional imaging techniques, SPECT and PET, together with structural modalities, CT and MRI, are widely employed. Functional imaging studies are routinely used in the diagnostic workup of patients with well-characterized neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and brain tumors, and have a growing role in research on psychiatric disorders without known mechanisms such as depression and schizophrenia. Furthermore, many well-defined neurological disorders manifest prominent psychiatric symptomatology which may pose difficulties in differential diagnosis. This review addresses the current knowledge of SPECT findings in patients who present with psychiatric phenomena, associated with disorders at the interface of neurology and psychiatry.
