Comparison of single photon emission computed tomography findings in cases of healthy adults and solvent-exposed adults. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a useful tool in measuring dynamic brain functioning. Its potential to reveal the physiological mechanisms of neurotoxicity has not been fully explored. In the present study, the SPECT findings for 25 healthy control subjects were compared to the findings for 25 mixed organic solvent exposure subjects. Specific physiological abnormalities related to regional cerebral blood flow activity (rCBF) were revealed. In the early phase of uptake, significantly decreased uptake was found in the mixed organic solvent group in the late phase of uptake, a significant increase in uptake was found in specific regions of interest. The discovery of this abnormality in brain functioning may be a significant step toward the creation of a biological marker of neurotoxicity. Early detection of neurotoxicity is important in occupational medicine to prevent neurotoxic illnesses in working populations.
