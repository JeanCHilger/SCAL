Comparison of optimised planar scintigraphy with SPECT thallium, exercise ECG and angiography in the detection of coronary artery disease. Thallium SPECT has been shown to be more sensitive than planar imaging in the detection of coronary heart disease (CAD) in a number of reported series. Early (< 10 minutes) redistribution on planar imaging has been demonstrated in clinical studies and this may partly contribute to its lower sensitivity.To determine whether thallium SPECT is superior to planar scintigraphy (with the timing of imaging performed optimally so that it was commenced within five minutes of injection) in the detection of CAD.Planar and SPECT studies were performed in 44 patients with significant (> 70% stenosis) CAD, seven patients with borderline stenoses (50-69%) and in 18 patients with no significant CAD.The sensitivity of planar imaging was 66% which was higher than exercise ECG 54% (ns) but significantly lower than SPECT 86% (p < 0.005). The specificity of planar thallium scintigraphy was 100% which was higher than SPECT (83%) and significantly higher than exercise ECG 72% (p < 0.05). SPECT had a significantly higher sensitivity for LAD and single vessel disease than planar imaging and this was unrelated to a history of prior myocardial infarction.Even when planar imaging is timed optimally to minimise the impact of early redistribution, SPECT is more sensitive than either planar imaging or exercise ECG in the detection of CAD, but its specificity is lower.
