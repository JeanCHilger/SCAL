Functional anatomy of visuomotor skill learning in human subjects examined with positron emission tomography. The present study was designed to examine patterns of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) associated with the learning of a repeated visuomotor sequence both in the early and late phases of the acquisition process. In addition, changes in blood flow related to the implicit versus explicit aspects of learning such a skill were investigated. Fourteen normal control subjects were scanned while performing the task (i) in both early and advanced learning stages of the visuomotor sequence (ii) after having acquired explicit knowledge of the sequences
