Lymphoma: role of whole-body 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) PET in nodal staging. To compare 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) with computed tomography (CT) in primary nodal staging of malignant lymphoma.Sixty consecutive patients with untreated, histopathologically proved malignant lymphoma (aged 7-72 years 33 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 27 with Hodgkin disease) underwent FDG PET and contrast material-enhanced CT for nodal staging. Lymph node regions identified at both CT and PET were regarded as actual locations of disease. Discordant results were verified with biopsy or clinical follow-up whenever possible.One hundred sixty of 740 evaluated lymph node regions were identified as diseased at both CT and PET. Of the 25 additional regions seen with PET, seven were true-positive two, false-positiveFDG PET may be more accurate for detecting nodal lymphoma than incremental CT.
