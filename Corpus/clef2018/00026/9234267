Positron emission tomography study of human prostatic adenocarcinoma using carbon-11 putrescine. To evaluate [1-11C]putrescine ([11C]PUT) as a potential tracer for imaging and characterization of human prostatic adenocarcinoma, positron emission tomography (PET) was performed in eight patients and three normal controls. In addition, four of the patients and the three normal controls also had a prostate scan with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG). Three of the patients had undergone resection of the prostate tumor and all of the patients except for one had bone metastasis. Carbon-11 rapidly accumulated in prostate, bone and rectum after injection of [11C]PUT. Maximal uptake was achieved 5 min after injection with minimal washout during the 50 min study period. The uptake of carbon-11 in the prostate of normal controls was significantly higher than that in the patients. However, three of the four patients scanned for metastatic bone lesions showed higher uptake in bone metastasis than in normal bone. Quantitation of 18FDG uptake in the prostate was hindered by the high accumulation of activity in the urinary bladder. [11C]PUT does not appear to be a useful tracer for assessing proliferation of human prostate adenocarcinoma. Its utility in the imaging of other cancers with high polyamine concentration remains to be investigated.
