Current perspectives in gliomas. The annual incidence of primary central nervous system tumors, including gliomas, is increasing, however, the prognosis of these tumors remains poor with a median survival of only 5 years. The imaging of tumors by computerised tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and newer methods such as positron emission tomography and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is increasing our knowledge of tumor biology and extent of the disease. Advances within the field of neurosurgery have improved operative procedures reducing mortality and morbidity. Furthermore, radiotherapy planning, tumor targeting and repositioning for treatment have all improved initial tumor management. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial. Chemotherapy for advanced and recurrent disease has been extensively investigated, and although improvements in quality of life have been recorded, no prolongation of survival has been documented. With new discoveries and increasing knowledge of the physiology and molecular biology of these tumors the potential for targeting therapy at a genetic level is becoming increasingly promising. This review provides an overview of these current perspectives in glioma management.
