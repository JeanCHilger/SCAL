Comparable uptake of thallium-201 and technetium-99m MIBI in hibernating and "maimed" myocardium. Thallium-201 and technetium-99m-MIBI uptake are comparable in "maimed" (i.e., partially viable) and hibernating myocardium. The appreciation of myocardial viability should be based not only on the presence of a regional contractility improvement, but also on the evaluation of the initial level of contractility and of tracer uptake in the concerned area.
