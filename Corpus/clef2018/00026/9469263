Cerebral blood flow in white matter is correlated with systolic blood pressure and EEG in senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. The presence and functional significance of white matter lesions in the ageing brain and in dementia as well as their relation to blood pressure are often discussed. The aim of this study was to evaluate cerebral blood flow in white matter (WMCBF) and its relation to systemic blood pressure and multichannel EEG. WMCBF was measured in 24 elderly women with senile dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT, median age 85.5, range 68-93) and 20 age-matched controls (median age 86.0, range 79-93) using 99mTc-HMPAO single photon emission CT. A significant low WMCBF could be observed in all analysed regions in SDAT subjects compared to controls, with the greatest decline in the posterior region (parietotemporo-occipital area). Correlations between quantified EEG from the posterior regions and WMCBF were seen. Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the SDAT group and was positively correlated with WMCBF in the posterior and anterior brain regions. Whether low systemic blood pressure is the result of crerebral dysfunction is unclear.
