2-[123I]-iodolisuride SPET visualizes dopaminergic loss in de-novo parkinsonian patients: is it a marker of striatal pre-synaptic degeneration? The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between the functional integrity and density of striatal dopaminergic receptors and clinical data in 15 de-novo patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease by single photon emission tomography (SPET) using 2-[123I]-iodolisuride (ILIS), a tracer based on the D2-dopamine receptor agonist lisuride. Deficient striatal uptake of ILIS correlated with the severity of the disorder, scored by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (n = 15 ratio of ILIS uptake: basal ganglia/cerebellum [B/C] & UPDRS I-III, Spearman R = -0.562, P = 0.013), Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) (n = 12
