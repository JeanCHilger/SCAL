Replacement of amino acid and protein losses with 1.1% amino acid peritoneal dialysis solution. Losses of nutrients into dialysate may contribute to malnutrition. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are reported to lose 3-4 g/day of amino acids (AAs) and 4-15 g/day of proteins. The extent to which one exchange with a 1.1% AA dialysis solution (Nutrineal, Baxter, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.) offsets these losses was investigated in a 3-day inpatient study in 20 PD patients.Simple, open-label, cross-over study on consecutive days in a clinical research unit. On day 1 all patients were given a peritoneal equilibration test (PET). On day 2 they received 1.5% dextrose Dianeal (Baxter) as the first exchange of the day and their usual regimen thereafter. On day 3, the first exchange of the day was the 1.1% AA solution in place of 1.5% Dianeal and the usual PD regimen thereafter. On days 2 and 3 all dialysate effluent was collected and analyzed for AAs and proteins. Patients were maintained on a constant diet.Losses of AAs and total proteins on day 2 were 3.4 +/- 0.9 g and 5.8 +/- 2.4 g, respectively, totaling 9.2 +/- 2.7 g. The net uptake of AAs on day 3 was 17.6 +/- 2.6 g (80 +/- 12% of the 22 g infused). Mean gains of AAs on day 3 exceeded losses of proteins and AAs on day 2, p < 0.001. Losses of total proteins, but not losses of AAs, and the net absorption of AAs from the dialysis solution were correlated directly with peritoneal membrane transport characteristics, obtained from the PET.Daily losses of AAs and proteins into dialysate are more than offset by gains of AAs absorbed from one exchange with 1.1% AA-based dialysis solution. Net gains of AAs exceeded losses of proteins and AAs in all patients studied. The difference was relatively constant across a wide range of membrane transport types. Net AA gains were approximately two times the total AA and protein losses.
