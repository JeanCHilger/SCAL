High-resolution virtual laryngoscopy based on spiral CT data. This pilot study investigated the feasibility and clinical value of high-resolution virtual real-time laryngoscopy based on helical CT data sets. Nine patients with laryngeal pathology (three with tumors of the vocal cords, two laryngeal carcinomas, one with invasion of the larynx by thyroid carcinoma and six subglottic stenoses) underwent examination by helical CT at a collimation of 1 mm. Following acquisition, the images were processed at a workstation with standard visualization software, such that virtual endoscopy (VE) in real time was possible. The images were then compared with the findings of conventional endoscopy. Because of swallowing artifacts, reconstruction failed in 2 of 12 patients. None of the carcinomas of the vocal cords was recognized at VE or in the cross-sectional CT images. VE provided the correct diagnosis in 8 of 12 cases (laryngeal tumors, subglottic stenoses). Virtual laryngoscopy is capable of simulating the visual findings of endoscopy in cases of laryngeal tumors and subglottic stenoses. Small tumors of the vocal cords are not adequately visualized. The major problem affecting results is motion artifacts resulting from involuntary swallowing.
