2D and 3D parameter images for the analysis of contrast medium distribution in dynamic CT and MRI. For dynamic contrast medium (CM) studies, parameter images exploit specific features of the time/intensity curve (TIC) of each pixel and represent these values in a new image. Existing concepts of two-dimensional CM analysis are extended for three-dimensional applications using adequate computer graphic visualization.Imaging: intravenous CM injection first-pass analysis using fast CT acquisition of a single sliceIn first-pass analyses, TMIP and TG allowed the simultaneous or separated presentation of different temporal phases of the CM bolus. Correlation images emphasized regions with similarities to given TIC patterns. Three-dimensional computer graphic techniques enabled (1) anatomical/functional mapping of original image and CM accumulation and (2) fused display of both spatial CM enhancement and color-encoded time of TIC peak in one common image.The quantification of presence, magnitude, and time-of-peak of CM accumulation in local image regions supports the assessment of vascularization and of ischemic or necrotic areas.
