Computer-assisted structure analysis of trabecular bone in the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass and a deterioration of bone structure which results in an increased fracture risk. The purpose of this review is to evaluate structure analysis techniques in the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Several imaging techniques were applied to analyze trabecular bone, such as conventional radiography, high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT) and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI). The best results were obtained using high-resolution tomographic techniques. The highest spatial resolutions in vivo were achieved using HR-MRI. These studies show that texture parameters and bone mineral density predict bone strength and osteoporotic fractures in a complementary fashion. Combining both techniques yields the best results in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.
