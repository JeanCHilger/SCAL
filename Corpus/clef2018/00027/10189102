Preparation of DNA-immobilized immunoadsorbent for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. A new DNA-immobilized immunoadsorbent was prepared to remove the pathogenic anti-DNA antibody from the serum of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. A non-woven poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric made of 3.5-microm diameter fibers was used as the support of the immunoadsorbent. A cationic monomer, N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DAM), was graft polymerized onto the PET fiber surface by UV irradiation or with a chemical initiator. Polyion complexation between the cationic groups of the graft chains and DNA molecules was employed to immobilize DNA onto the fiber surface. No DNA leaching was observed when the DNA-immobilized fabrics were placed in 0.9 and 2.0 wt% NaCl solution at 37 degrees C overnight. In vitro evaluation of this DNA-immobilized immunoadsorbent demonstrated that this adsorbent could selectively adsorb anti-DNA antibody from the serum of SLE patients.
