Active and remitted schizophrenia: psychopathological and regional cerebral blood flow findings. Single photon emission computed tomography with technetium-99m-d,l-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) was used to assess regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during both florid and remitted stages of schizophrenia. Forty schizophrenic patients in an active phase of illness (diagnosis by DSM-III-R) were examined in two clinical states (ill vs. improved). At study entry, 24 patients were drug-naive, five were currently drug-free, and 11 were being treated with antipsychotic medication. Twenty medical patients who suffered from non-specific headaches but were free of neurological and psychiatric symptoms served as control subjects. At initial examination during the active phase of illness, cerebral perfusion patterns in the schizophrenic patients were characterized by both hypofrontality and hypotemporality. After remission, hypofrontality was no longer apparent in two of four frontal regions, and hypotemporality disappeared completely. As assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), formal thought disorders, hallucinations, and ideas of grandiosity correlated with rCBF in the active phase of illness, but not after remission. In the remitted but not in the florid state, blunted affect, difficulties in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity, and stereotyped thoughts correlated with rCBF. Correlations of five symptoms with rCBF changed significantly from first to second examination. The present study suggests that correlations between single psychotic symptoms and rCBF differ significantly in florid vs. remitted phases of schizophrenia.
