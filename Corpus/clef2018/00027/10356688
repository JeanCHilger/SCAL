Current imaging techniques for head and neck tumors. Modern head and neck imaging has led to advances in both the diagnosis and treatment of head and neck cancers. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies provide important information about the location and extent of neoplasm, particularly with respect to the interface of tumor with bone, fat, muscles and other soft tissues, air, blood vessels, dura, and brain. Conventional angiography can be used to assess tumor blood supply and vascularity and to perform therapeutic embolization. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and CT angiography (CTA) are new tools for the noninvasive evaluation of blood vessels. Positron emission tomography (PET) shows promise for differentiating tumor from scar, edema, and other nonneoplastic soft tissues.
