Differentiation of small solitary pulmonary nodules using Tc-99m MIBI and Tl-201 SPECT The authors evaluated the ability of dual SPECT with Tc-99m MIBI and Tl-201 chloride to differentiate malignant and benign solitary pulmonary nodules smaller than 3 cm in diameter. Forty-three patients had solitary pulmonary nodules smaller than 3 cm in diameter based on the findings of chest CT. All patients underwent dual-isotope SPECT with Tc-99m MIBI and Tl-201 chloride. Regions of interest were placed over the tumors (T) and contralateral normal lung tissue (N) on one coronal SPECT view, and T:N ratios and retention indices were calculated. The sensitivities of early and delayed Tc-99m MIBI SPECT and early and delayed Tl-201 chloride SPECT for differentiating malignant and benign lesions were 44%, 48%, 56%, and 52%, respectively. The corresponding specificity rates were 44%, 56%, 25%, and 31%, respectively, and corresponding accuracy rates were 44%, 51%, 44%, and 44%, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between malignant and benign lesions in the early and delayed T:N ratios for Tc-99m MIBI and Tl-201 chloride and the retention index for Tc-99m MIBI. However, the retention index using Tl-201 chloride in malignant lesions was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than that in benign lesions. Analysis of semiquantitative parameters of the T:N ratio and retention index from Tc-99m MIBI SPECT appears to have little or no value for differentiating malignant from benign solitary pulmonary nodules smaller than 3 cm in diameter. However, the retention index using Tl-201 chloride seems to be a better parameter for differentiating between these malignant and benign lesions.
