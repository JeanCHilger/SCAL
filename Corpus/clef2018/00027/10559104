Recent advances in pulmonary imaging. Recent years have witnessed an explosion in imaging technology applicable to chest medicine. These include CT and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and high-resolution CT for the detection and characterization of diffuse lung diseases and the quantification of emphysema. Newly developed approaches to pulmonary functional imaging using CT and MRI have been applied to the evaluation of pulmonary ventilation and perfusion and to the detection of small airways disease. Volumetric CT imaging techniques together with advanced image processing have made possible "virtual bronchoscopy." Positron emission tomography provides an important new approach to the accurate detection and staging of chest malignancies and to the evaluation of pulmonary nodules. Finally, new digital imaging techniques, which are rapidly replacing conventional x-ray film, offer the possibility of computer-aided diagnosis.
