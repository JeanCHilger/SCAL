A Phase II trial of bryostatin-1 for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma have a poor prognosis and no standard therapy is available. The authors performed a Phase II trial of the novel agent bryostatin-1 in this patient population.In all, 30 patients with measurable, previously untreated metastatic renal cell carcinoma were studied. Patients had excellent physiologic reserve and preserved performance status. Bryostatin-1 (25 microg/m(2)) was given in the PET (polyethyleneglycol, ethanol, and Tween 80) formulation as a 30-minute intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. In general, treatment was continued until disease progression.Two patients had significant objective responses, although methodologic problems made interpretation difficult. The median time to progression for all patients was 2.1 months the median overall survival was 13.1 months. The treatment was generally well tolerated. Myalgia was the most common adverse event. One patient died while on study. This was a sudden death for a patient receiving a 15th cycle of therapy. Aside from this patient (for whom the correlation of study drug to death was not clear), no Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity was encountered in more than 150 treatment courses delivered.There is minimal, if any, clinically relevant single-agent activity of bryostatin-1 at this dose and schedule for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
