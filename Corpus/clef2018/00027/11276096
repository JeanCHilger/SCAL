MRI in France: the French paradox. Although France is a modern, developed country, which spends nearly 10% of the gross national product on healthcare and has a highly praised level of medicine, the number of modern imaging scanners, such as CT (595), MRI (182), and PET (5), is quite low when compared to other European countries. Politics and a long-standing tradition of centralization are prominent among reasons for such an underdevelopment. This situation has resulted in another French paradox not linked to wine consumption. The French life expectancy is very high, but the number of imaging equipment is very low.
