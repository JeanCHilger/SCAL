Diagnostic accuracy and prognostic implications of stress testing for coronary artery disease in the elderly. The aim of this study was to define the diagnostic accuracy and the prognostic significance of stress electrocardiography (ECG) and of thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in determining the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in an elderly population.A selected series of 132 patients (90 males, mean age 72.4 years 42 females, mean age 68.2 years) hospitalized because of cardiac events associated with suspected CAD, underwent stress ECG and thallium-201 testingECG findings were positive in 102 patients and coronary angiography confirmed the presence of CAD in 92 of them ECG findings were negative in 30 patients, but only 14 were free from obstructive coronary lesions. Thallium-201 SPECT findings were positive in 112 patients (coronary angiograms confirmed CAD in 101) and negative in 20 patients (in 13 of whom angiography confirmed the absence of disease). The sensitivity of the stress tests was quite good: 85.1% for ECG and 93.5% for thallium-201 SPECTThe diagnostic accuracy of thallium-201 SPECT was 86.3% whereas that of ECG was 80.3%. Considering the overall cardiac events, the predictive value of SPECT was superior to that of ECG both in terms of the positive value (54 vs 51%, p = NS) and, more importantly, in terms of the negative value (84 vs 62%, p < 0.03). In fact, patients with normal thallium images were at low risk for future cardiac events.
