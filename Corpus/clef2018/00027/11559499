MR imaging and single-photon emission CT findings after gene therapy for human glioblastoma. Our goal was to evaluate MR imaging findings after local intracerebral gene therapy in patients with glioblastoma and differentiate postoperative contrast enhancement phenomena.In all, 26 patients with supratentorial single lesion glioblastoma underwent tumor resection and intracerebral injection of murine retroviral vector-producer cells for gene therapy with the herpes simplex virus type I thymidine kinase gene/ganciclovir system. Serial contrast-enhanced MR studies were obtained before treatment and postoperatively on day 1 or 2 weeks 2, 4, 9, 13, 17, 25, and 33Twelve patients showed nontumorous enhancement of various intensities after treatment, arising within 18 to 72 hours and persisting at 3 to 10 months. It was characterized by a strong local enhancement up to 20 mm thick, which was initially nodular and later linear along the resection cavity wall and surrounded by massive perifocal edema. This "flare" enhancement had features that clearly differed from those of residual tumor enhancements and benign postsurgical enhancements. The IMT-SPECT investigations showed increased amino acid uptake in patients with enhancement from residual or relapsing tumor, but not in patients with flare.After local gene therapy, a unique dynamic, transient perifocal flare enhancement can occur on MR images. IMT-SPECT may help to differentiate between tumorous and nontumorous flare enhancements in patients with enhancing tissue on MR images after gene therapy for glioblastoma.
