Clinical utility of positron emission tomography in the diagnosis and management of periampullary neoplasms. This study examined the effect that 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)FDG-PET) imaging had on the clinical management of patients with suspected periampullary malignancy.Fifty-four patients with suspected pancreatic neoplasms underwent both whole-body (18)FDG-PET and abdominal computed tomography (CT). Malignant or benign disease was confirmed pathologically in 47 patients.Of the 41 patients with malignancy, (18)FDG-PET failed to identify the primary tumor in 5 patients. (18)FDG-PET demonstrated increased uptake suggesting primary malignancy in 37 patients. Malignant pathology was confirmed in 36 cases. (18)FDG-PET identified malignant locoregional lymph node metastases in six of ten patients. All nodes identified before surgery by (18)FDG-PET were also seen on preoperative CT. Six patients who were thought to have resectable disease by CT were found to have distant metastasis at laparotomy. (18)FDG-PET did not detect metastasis in any of these cases. Before surgery, (18)FDG-PET identified distant metastases that were not detected by CT in one patient.Despite high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing periampullary malignancy, (18)FDG-PET did not change clinical management in the vast majority of patients previously evaluated by CT. In addition, (18)FDG-PET missed >10% of periampullary malignancies and did not provide the anatomical detail necessary to define unresectabilty.
