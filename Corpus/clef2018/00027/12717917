Experience on clinical application of positron emission tomography with a new radiopharmaceutical preparation sodium 11C-butyrate in differential diagnosis of pathological volume in brain formation. The study was aimed to investigate the possibilities of the application of a new radiopharmaceutical--"Sodium butyrate, [1-(11)C]" (11C-Butyrate) for differential diagnosis of pathological volume brain formations. Positron emission tomography (PET) ("Ecat Exact 47", Siemens) of the brain was performed in 24 patients (14 male & 10 female, aged 19-56). The scanning was carried out as static scan 4-5 min after intravenous administration of 250-350 Mbq 11C-Butyrate and proceeded within 15-20 min. In addition PET with 18F-FDG was performed in all patients. The data had been verified histologically and morphologically. In 15 out of 24 patients the brain malignant tumor has been discovered, in 4 patients--benign tumors, in 5--postoperative cysts. Results of the studies showed that the ratio tumor/normal tissue in case of 11C-Butyrate and 18F-FDG application proved to be comparable for all studied hystological types of tumors. Malignant tumors in these cases had been visualized as a hot sports-fokci of increased uptake 11C-Butyrate (ratio > 1). The obtained data testify to the possibility of 11C-Butyrate application for differential diagnosis of the pathological volumic brain formation.
