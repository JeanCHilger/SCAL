Recombinant Helicobacter pylori urease B subunit and its biological properties. To perform genetic recombination of the urease B subunit (UreB) of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) and examine the biological properties of the recombinant protein.The gene fragment encoding Hp UreB was isolated clinically from Chinese subjects by means of PCR, and cloned subsequently into an expression vector pET-11C-UreB for the non-fusion protein expression in E.coli BL21 (DE3) strain.The expression of recombinant UreB was achieved in E.coli BL21 with a relative molecular weight of approximately 62,000 at the expression ratio of 26%, and the first 15 amino acids of recombinant UreB were MKKISREYVSMYGP. The results of peptide mapping and amino acid compositional analysis were consistent with previous theoretical prediction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay together with Western blotting indicated strong immunogenicity and reactivity of the recombinant protein in BalB/c mice, which were specifically recognized by polyclonal BalB/c mice anti-Hp sera or human sera infected with Hp.The results of this study has laid an solid immunological foundation for incorporating recombinant UreB as a subunit vaccine component against Hp.
