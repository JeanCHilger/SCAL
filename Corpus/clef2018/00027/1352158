The musculus-type Y chromosome of the laboratory mouse is of Asian origin. Mus musculus domesticus, M.m. bactrianus, M.m. musculus, M.m. castaneus, and M.m. molossinus wild mice were investigated for polymorphisms of the Y Chromosome (Chr) genes Zinc finger-Y (Zfy) and Sex-determining region-Y (Sry). Zfy divided the Y Chrs of these mice into domesticus- (domesticus) and musculus-types (musculus, castaneus, molossinus). M.m. bactrianus specimens had both Y Chrs, possibly owing to the introgression of a musculus-type Y into this population. Sry identified a subpopulation of musculus-type Y chromosomes. This subpopulation, designated the molossinus-type, was found in M.m. molossinus, a M. musculus subspecies specimen from northern China (Changchun), and laboratory mice. The cumulative data suggest that M.m. musculus of northern China and Korea are a subpopulation distinct from M.m. musculus of Europe and central China and that this subpopulation invaded Japan, giving rise to M.m. molossinus. Furthermore, the data suggest that the musculus-type Y of the laboratory mouse originated from this subpopulation, corroborating early historical records reporting that Chinese and Japanese mice that were imported into Europe for the pet trade contributed to the genome of the laboratory mouse.
