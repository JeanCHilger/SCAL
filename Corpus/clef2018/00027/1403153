Technetium-99m-N1-(2-mercapto-2-methylpropyl)-N2-(2-propargylthio-2- methylpropyl)-1,2-benzenediamine (T691): preclinical studies of a potential new tracer of regional cerebral perfusion. We report in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies of a new cerebral blood flow tracer, [99mTc]N1-(2-mercapto-2-methyl-propyl)-N2-(2- propargylthio-2-methylpropyl)-1,2-benzenediamine (T691). The tracer demonstrates excellent in vitro chemical stability and accumulates regionally in the brain in a pattern consistent with that of cerebral blood flow. First-pass cerebral extraction determined with the use of the brain uptake index method in the rat was 0.76. Bolus intracarotid injection in monkeys indicated a cerebral extraction of 68% and prolonged retention of 67% of the initially extracted activity. Autoradiographic studies in rats revealed a pattern characteristic of cerebral blood flow at both 1 and 60 min after systemic injection. Dynamic tomographic imaging following systemic injection in the monkey revealed peak brain activity 1 to 2 min postinjection, without significant decline over 60 min. Chromatographic studies of brain as long as 60 min following systemic injection of [99mTc]T691 showed no evidence of tracer metabolism to account for its retention. Overall, [99mTc]T691 demonstrates promise as a potential new clinical tracer of cerebral perfusion.
