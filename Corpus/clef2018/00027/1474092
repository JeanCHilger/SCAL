Modifying pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury by altering ventilatory strategies during ischemia. We used an intact in vivo canine model of pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury to evaluate the differential effects of alveolar hypoxia and ventilation during 2 h of unilateral warm lung ischemia. Serial measurements of regional pulmonary blood flow, extravascular density (EVD), and transcapillary protein flux were made after reperfusion with the quantitative imaging technique of positron emission tomography. Twenty-seven animals were divided into five experimental groups: VENT O2 (n = 5) in which the left lung was ventilated with 40% O2 during ischemia, STATIC O2 (n = 4) in which the left lung was statically inflated with 40% O2 during ischemia, VENT N2 (n = 5) in which the left lung was ventilated with 100% N2 during ischemia, VENT N2/CO2 (n = 5) in which the left lung was ventilated with 95% N2-5% CO2 during ischemia, and STATIC N2 (n = 8) in which the left lung was statically inflated with 100% N2 during ischemia. These groups were compared with a control group (CONT, = 3) that was studied previously. Protein flux was significantly increased in the previous ischemic lung only for the STATIC N2 group [median 175 x 10(-4) min-1 (range 53-1,217) for the STATIC N2 group vs. 50 x 10(-4) min-1 (range 40-56) for the CONT group] 0.25 h after reperfusion and did not change over 3 h. EVD also increased but not significantly. Protein flux and EVD in the other groups were not different from CONT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
