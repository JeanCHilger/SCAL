Interaction between polyethylene films and bromhexine HCl in solid dosage form. V. Effect of packaging materials on the sorption of bromhexine HCl. A prevention method of the sorption of bromhexine HCl to plastic materials used in packaging was investigated. Four kinds of plastic packaging materials were used: Polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN). Three polyethylenes having different densities were used. No effect of PE density on the sorption of bromhexine HCl from granules was observed. The effects of different kinds of plastics on the sorption of bromhexine HCl from solution and granules were studied. The sorption of bromhexine HCl to PAN, which had a high relative dielectric constant, was the most depressed among the four plastics. The sorption of meclizine HCl to PAN from the solution was also lowest, the same as bromhexine HCl.
