Multimodality noninvasive imaging of gene transfer using the human sodium iodide symporter. In this study we investigated the feasibility of using radionuclide accumulation mediated by the human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) gene in conjunction with various imaging modalities as a reporter system to noninvasively monitor the expression of transgenes delivered for gene therapy.NIS-expressing adenovirus (Ad-hNIS) was delivered in vitro to MB-435 breast carcinoma cells. NIS-mediated accumulation of (125)I(-), (99m)TcO(4)(-), and (76)Br(-) by the cells was visualized using autoradiography, gamma-camera scintigraphy, and PET imaging, respectively.For all imaging modalities, signal intensity generated by the cells correlated linearly both with the amount of Ad-hNIS and with the activity of radionuclide added to the cells.hNIS-mediated cellular accumulation of radionuclide was clearly visualized by all 3 imaging modalities tested. This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of using hNIS for monitoring the location and magnitude of expression of genes delivered during gene therapy.
