Dual-phase 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography as a prognostic parameter in patients with pancreatic cancer. Recently, dual-phase 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) was shown to be useful in the differentiation between malignant and benign pancreatic lesions. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the value of dual-phase FDG-PET as a prognostic parameter in patients with pancreatic cancer.Sixty-five consecutive patients with pancreatic cancer underwent dual-phase FDG-PET. Standardised uptake values at 1 h (SUV1) and 2 h (SUV2) following the injection of FDG were determined, and the retention index (RI) was calculated by dividing the difference between SUV2 and SUV1 by SUV1. The prognostic value of SUV1, SUV2 and RI was analysed, along with the various clinical and biochemical parameters.Multivariate analysis showed that only three factors had an independent association with longer patient survival: female gender (p<0.01), TNM stage I-III (p<0.05) and RI>10% (p<0.01). Neither SUV1 nor SUV2 showed any prognostic significance. Combination of tumour stage and RI allowed more accurate prognostic evaluation. Patients at stage I-III with RI>10% survived longer than did patients at the same stage with RI<10% (15.3 vs 11.5 months, p<0.01). Patients at stage IV with RI>10% had an intermediate prognosis, with a median survival of 9.5 months patients at stage IV with RI<10% showed the worst prognosis, with a median survival of 4.9 months (p<0.05).RI calculated with dual-phase FDG-PET can be used not only as a tool for initial diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer but also as a strong independent prognostic parameter that can allow accurate identification of those patients who will benefit from intensive anticancer treatment at different stages of the disease.
