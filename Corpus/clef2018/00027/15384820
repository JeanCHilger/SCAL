Correlation between peritoneal permeability and ultrafiltration volume with icodextrin-based peritoneal dialysis solution. In the present study, we evaluated peritoneal transport characteristics during the use of icodextrin-based peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution, determining ultrafiltration (UF) and dialysate-to-plasma creatinine (D/P(Cr)) in a peritoneal equilibration test (PET). The subjects of the study were 8 anuric patients who, at the time of enrollment into the study, were receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and using a 2.5% glucose-based dialysis solution overnight. The mean age of the patients was 57.9 +/- 6.1 years (range: 45.2 - 64.1 years), and their mean duration of CAPD was 61.6 +/- 44.3 months (range: 5.6 - 140.1 months). We changed the 2.5% glucose solution that the patients were using for the 8-hour overnight dwell to icodextrin and measured the resulting UF. We also performed a PET before and 12 weeks after the start of icodextrin. After the start of icodextrin, PETs were carried out immediately after the icodextrin dwell after rinsing twice with 2.5% glucose solution following an icodextrin dwell
