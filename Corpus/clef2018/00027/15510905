Neurological disorders after carbon monoxide intoxication. Carbon monoxide (CO) intoxications still remain an important clinical problem. Under an influence of CO the cellular respiration is inhibited. Structures of the central nervous system (CNS), extremely vulnerable to hypoxia, are usually considerably damaged. In result, a variety of pathologic neurological symptoms may appear and characteristic biphasic course of complaints is often observed. The modern methods of neuroimaging (CT, MRI, SPECT, PET) enable to show a connection between found structural injury and clinical symptoms, and when repeatedly performed allow us to evaluate the dynamics of the CNS dysfunction. Because of late complications, which may occur after the period of latency, the authors stress the value of the prolonged (for up to few years) ambulatory observation of subjects after CO intoxication.
