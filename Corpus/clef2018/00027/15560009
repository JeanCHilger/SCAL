Attenuation correction for three-dimensional PET using uncollimated flood-source transmission measurements. An attenuation-correction method for three-dimensional PET imaging, which obtains attenuation-correction factors from transmission measurements using an uncollimated flood source, is described. This correction is demonstrated for two different phantoms using transmission data acquired with QPET, a rotating imaging system with two planar detectors developed for imaging small volumes. The scatter amplitude in the transmission projections was a maximum of 30% to obtain accurate attenuation-correction factors the scatter distribution was first calculated and subtracted. The attenuation-corrected emission images for both phantoms indicate that their original uniform amplitudes have been restored. The attenuation correction adds only a small amount of noise to the emission images, as evaluated from the standard deviation over a central region. For the first phantom, with maximum attenuation of 48%, the noise added was 2.6%. The second phantom was attenuated by a maximum of 37%, and 1.9% noise was added. Because the transmission data are smoothed, some artifacts are visible at the edges of the phantom where the correction factors change abruptly within the emission image.
