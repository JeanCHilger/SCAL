Cognitive function before and after surgery in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysm. This prospective study investigated whether surgery for unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) affects cognitive function and cerebral blood flow (CBF).Cognitive tests using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, Wechsler Memory Scale, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test, and CBF measurements using single-photon emission computed tomography were performed before and after surgery for UIAs in 44 patients < or =70 years of age.Group-rate analysis showed the verbal intelligence quotient (IQ), performance IQ, full-scale IQ, and recall trial scores of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test all increased significantly after surgery, whereas the Wechsler Memory Scale and copy trial scores of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test were not significantly different. Event-rate analysis demonstrated that no patient showed impaired cognition. There was no significant difference between CBF before and after surgery.Surgical repair for UIAs does not impair cognition or CBF in patients without postoperative restrictions in lifestyle.
