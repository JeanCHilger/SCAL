Potential of [11C]DASB for measuring endogenous serotonin with PET: binding studies. The serotonin transporter radioligand [11C]-3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile, or [11C]DASB, was examined in order to assess its potential for measuring fluctuations in endogenous serotonin concentrations with positron emission tomography. Binding characteristics of [11C]DASB and the propensity for serotonin to displace the tracer were explored in rat brain homogenates. Experiments showed that serotonin displaced [11C]DASB in vitro. Ex vivo experiments performed after tranylcypromine injection (3 or 15 mg/kg) showed a dose-dependent trend in radioactivity uptake and suggested that serotonin may compete with [11C]DASB for transporter binding.
