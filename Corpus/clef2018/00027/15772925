Comparison of peritoneal equilibration test with 2.27% and 3.86% glucose dialysis solution. The standard Peritoneal Equilibration Test (PET) uses a 2.27% glucose dialysis solution in peritoneal dialysis (PD). A more hypertonic solution (3.86%) has recently been proposed to obtain further information about ultrafiltration (UF).To compare results in terms of peritoneal solute transport (4h-dialysate-to-plasma ratio, 4h-D/P) between 2.27% and 3.86% PET.23 patients on PD were randomized to form two groups, A and B. A 2.27% dextrose 2-L exchange was used in group A, followed on the same day by a 3.86% dextrose 2-L exchange, both with a 4-hour dwell (2.27% and 3.86% PET) in group B, the same treatment was administered in reverse. 4h-D/P of urea, creatinine and sodium at time 0, 60, 120 and 240 minutes and net UF were calculated for each PET and compared.No significant statistical differences were found for the usual peritoneal transport indexes, 4h-D/P of urea and creatinine, between 2.27% and 3.86% PET, which produced almost identical results. The creatinine 4h-D/P were 0.67+/-0.09 vs. 0.66+/-0.10 (p= NS) and the urea 4h-D/P 0.91+/-0.04 vs. 0.90+/-0.04 (p= NS). The sodium D/P was lower at all times during the 3.86% PET: D/P60= 0.92+/-0.05 vs. 0.88+/-0.03, D/P120= 0.91+/-0.02 vs. 0.87+/-0.03, D/P240= 0.92+/-0.02 vs. 0.88+/-0.04 (p< 0.0001). The net UF was 478 +/- 175 vs. 936 +/- 233 mL respectively (p< 0.0001).Our study suggests that a 3.86% PD solution could be used for PET instead of the 2.27% solution in order to assess peritoneal solute transport, as well as UF, while obtaining almost identical results as the 2.27% solution.
