Determination of Sb in the resin and products of PET by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The method of determing Sb in resin and products of PET by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry was studied. The sample was pretreated by 4% acetic acid and determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The sensitivity of this method was 30.5 pg/1% absorption, the relative standard deviation was 3.12% and the rate of recovery was 91.68-97.74%. The results obtained by this method agreed with those of malachite green spectrophotometry.
