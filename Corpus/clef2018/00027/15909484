Human cerebral circulation: positron emission tomography studies. We reviewed the literature on human cerebral circulation and oxygen metabolism, as measured by positron emission tomography (PET), with respect to normal values and of regulation of cerebral circulation. A multicenter study in Japan showed that between-center variations in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) values were not considerably larger than the corresponding within-center variations. Overall mean +/- SD values in cerebral cortical regions of normal human subjects were as follows: CBF = 44.4 +/- 6.5 ml/100 ml/min CBV = 3.8 +/- 0.7 ml/100 ml
