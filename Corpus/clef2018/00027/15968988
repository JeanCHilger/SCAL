Expression and purification of thermostable alpha-glucuronidase from Thermotoga maritima. The xylanolytic enzymes found in Thermotoga maritima showed extremely high thermostability and considerable potential in industrial application. Yet expression level of the genes encoding these enzymes was very low. The alpha-glucuronidase gene aguA from T. maritima ATCC 43589 was cloned and expressed in several E. coli strains with different vector. The alpha-glucuronidase was overexpressed in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL with plasmid pET-28a(+), and made up about 20% of the total proteins present in the intracellular soluble fraction. The results proved the assumption that rare codons for arginine (AGA/AGG) and isoleucine (AUA) affect the expression of aguA gene from hyperthermophilic bacterium T. maritima in E. coli. Purification procedure included two steps, heat treatment and immobilized metal affinity chromatography, and over 13.5mg of pure enzyme was obrained from 1L of induced culture. The purified enzyme showed a single band on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a purification of 5.1 fold, and a yield of 55.1%. The optimum activity of recombinant alpha-glucuronidase was found at pH 6.0 and 85 degrees C, the enzyme retained 70% of its activity after 1 h of incubation at 85 degrees C. The induction conditions for expression of recombinant strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL/pET-28a-aguA were studied on induction time and duration by IPTG. The results showed that the activity of thermostable alpha-glucuronidase reach the maximum in 5-hour after inducted at the exponential phase (OD600 of 0.7 - 0.8).
