SPECT study of Chinese schizophrenic patients suggests that cerebral hypoperfusion and laterality exist in different ethnic groups. Hypofrontality is a common finding in schizophrenia in many countries. To date, there have been few studies on Chinese patients with schizophrenia. We thus wondered whether hypofrontality exists in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. We investigated 45 patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy controls using brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Subjects were also administered the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Battery (HRNB) and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R). Images were analyzed using a semi-quantitative reading and a quantified region of interest analysis. We found that schizophrenic patients showed hypoperfusion in the frontal and temporal lobes and hyperperfusion in the basal ganglia. Schizophrenic patients with both negative and positive symptoms showed asymmetric perfusion in the temporal lobe. Schizophrenic patients with prominent negative symptoms also showed asymmetric perfusion in the prefrontal lobes. Negative symptoms showed a significantly negative correlation with regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the left frontal lobe. Improved memory quotient (MQ) was significantly correlated with increased rCBF in the left temporal lobe. These findings from Chinese patients confirm a similar regional neuroanatomic dysfunction as in Western patients with the disease.
