Evaluation of somatostatin receptors in human cancer. The binding of 123I-Tyr-3-octreotide (SDZ-204-090 specific activity 1 mCi/nmol), a new somatostatin-receptor binding radiopharmaceutical, to human tumour membrane fractions was evaluated in presence of unlabeled Tyr-3-octreotide and octreotide (SMS-201-995
