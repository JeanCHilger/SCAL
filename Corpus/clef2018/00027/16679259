Strain rate dobutamine echocardiography for prediction of recovery after revascularization in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. The purpose of the present study was to assess the accuracy of quantitative segmental analysis by strain rate imaging (SRI) technique during dobutamine test for detecting myocardial recovery after revascularization in patients with chronic ischemic regional left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and compare results with those of 2-dimensional echocardiography (2D) and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) as well as rest-4 hours-24 hours redistribution thallium SPECT (Tl SPECT).Forty-one patients with chronic ischemic regional LV dysfunction (EF 29 +/- 8%) underwent dobutamine 2D/TDI/SRI and Tl SPECT before and after myocardial revascularization. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the recovery of regional LV function were 73%, 81%, and 77% for dobutamine 2D 77%, 82%, and 80% for dobutamine TDIDobutamine SRI is more accurate than TDI in identifying hibernating myocardium. Systo-diastolic values obtained using dobutamine SRI echocardiography and values derived from nuclear perfusion techniques may be complementary in assessing myocardial viability.
