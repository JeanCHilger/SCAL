Novel capillary channel fiber scaffolds for guided tissue engineering. A novel type of capillary channel fibers (CCFs) containing eight open grooves with depth of 5-15 microm and width of 10 microm were tested for their use in tissue engineering as matrices that provide topographical guidance to neo-tissue development. The matrices fabricated from fibers of poly(l-lactic acid) (PLA) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were seeded with rat skin fibroblasts (RSFs) and rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) for up to 4 weeks. Cells attached and extended their cytoplasmic lamellapodia within the grooves. The cells were proliferating within the grooves and were highly aligned parallel to the direction of the grooves. RASMCs and RSFs showed highly aligned actin and vimentin cytoskeleton, respectively. The cells also deposited extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin and collagen within the grooves parallel to the groove direction. These CCFs also have the unique ability to move fluids instantaneously by capillary action, thus, have the potential to transport oxygen and nutrients deep within the scaffolds. Such CCF matrices would be useful for creating highly organized tissues such as tendon, ligament, nerve, and cardiac muscle.
