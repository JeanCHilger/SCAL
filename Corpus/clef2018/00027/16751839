The isoflavone content of commercially-available feline diets in New Zealand. To identify and quantify concentrations of the isoflavones genistein, daidzein, biochanin A and formononetin in commercially- prepared feline diets sold in New Zealand.Feline diets (n=138) were collected from supermarkets, pet stores and veterinary clinics in New Zealand. Diets were classified into five categories based on the following criteria: the presence/absence of soy, the presence/absence of non-soy plant material, and dry matter (DM) content. A high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based assay was developed and validated to identify and quantify concentrations of the isoflavones genistein, daidzein, biochanin A and formononetin.Isoflavones were detected in all categories of diet, and at quantifiable concentrations in 104/138 (75%) of the diets tested. More dry diets (127/138 92%) contained isoflavones at quantifiable concentrations than moist diets (83/138Isoflavones are present in commercially-prepared feline diets sold in New Zealand at concentrations that have elicited physiological responses in the reproductive, endocrine, and immune systems of other mammalian species. Since isoflavones appear to be a common constituent of feline diets, further investigation of the biological activities of these dietary compounds in cats is warranted.
