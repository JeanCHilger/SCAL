Estimates of peritoneal membrane function--new insights. The most widely used peritoneal function test is the peritoneal equilibration test (PET), developed and described by Twardowski in 1987. The test was originally performed using a 2.27% glucose solution and focused on transport of small solutes. With the test, categorization of patients was possible into high, average and low transporters. However, to detect clinically significant ultrafiltration failure and to make an evaluation of the cause, the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) committee on ultrafiltration failure advised to perform the test with a 3.86% glucose solution. Since then, reference values for this test were assessed and further possibilities of utilizing the results were tested. In this review, the new developments in monitoring peritoneal function are described and a guideline proposal for this monitoring is given.
