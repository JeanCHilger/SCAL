Positron emission tomography in gynecological malignancies. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional diagnostic imaging technique. F-18 fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) is a commonly used radiopharmaceutical that is an analog of glucose. PET with FDG is now the standard of care in initial staging, monitoring the response to the therapy and management of various cancers. There is not sufficient data to support the use of PET in the initial diagnosis of cervical cancer however, FDG-PET has a role in initial staging in the detection of distant metastases in patients with cervical cancer. PET has limited value in lesion localization in early stages of ovarian cancer, but plays a significant role in identifying recurrent tumors in patients with rising tumor markers. In this article, the clinical application of PET in gynecological malignancies is reviewed.
