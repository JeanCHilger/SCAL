Excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson disease: a SPECT study. The underlying pathologic mechanism of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in Parkinson disease and the relative contributions of brain function to this process are poorly understood. We compared brain perfusion images between patients with Parkinson disease and EDS and those without EDS using n-isopropyl-p-1231 iodoamphetamine single photon emission computed tomography.Clinical study.Sumitomo Hospital.Thirteen patients with Parkinson disease with EDS (EDS group) and 27 patients with Parkinson disease without EDS (no-EDS group) were studied. Whether or not each case had EDS was determined according to the response to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale: patients with an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score > or = 10 were included in the EDS group, and patients with an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score < or = 9 were included in the no-EDS group.There were significant hypoperfusions in the left parietal and temporal association cortex in the EDS group. In the multivariable logistic regression model, attention and decreased regional cerebral blood flow of the left parietal association cortex and right caudate and increased regional cerebral blood flow of the right thalamus were the independent and significant factors.The cortical hypofunction relative to hyperfunction of the brain stem may relate to EDS in Parkinson disease. This is the first imaging study about EDS in Parkinson disease, and further studies are required.
