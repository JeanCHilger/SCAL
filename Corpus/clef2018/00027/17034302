Comparison of SPECT aerosol deposition data with twenty-four-hour clearance measurements. Three-dimensional (3D) radionuclide imaging provides detailed information on the distribution of inhaled aerosol material within the body. Analysis of the data can provide estimates of the deposition per airway generation. Information on regional distribution of deposited aerosol can also be obtained from 24-hour clearance measurements. In this study, a nebulizer was used to deliver a radiolabeled aerosol to nine human subjects. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has been used to assess the distribution of aerosol deposition per airway generation. The deposition pattern was also estimated using measurements of the aerosol remaining in the lung 24 h after inhalation. The error in the SPECT value was assessed by simulation and that in the 24-h clearance value by repeat analysis. The mean fraction of lung deposition in the conducting airway (CADF) from SPECT was 0.21. The corresponding 24-h clearance value was 0.23. These values were not significantly different. There was a weak but non-significant correlation between the SPECT and 24-h measurements (r = 0.49). The standard error of the difference was 0.11. The corresponding errors on the SPECT and 24-h clearance measurements were 0.04 and 0.05, respectively. There was no systematic difference between the values of conducting airways deposition obtained from 24-h measurements and SPECT. However, there were random differences on individual subjects, which were larger than the estimated measurement errors.
