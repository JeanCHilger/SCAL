Prefrontal hypofunction in patients with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We compared the cognitive functions and interictal cerebral glucose metabolism of 11 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) with frequent seizures to those of 10 patients with MTLE with rare seizures the groups were matched for age, sex, education, IQ, and focus side. The frequent-seizure group had more set-shifting impairment that correlated with glucose hypometabolism in the prefrontal cortices. Our results suggest that frequent seizures in MTLE are associated with hypofunction of the prefrontal cortex.
