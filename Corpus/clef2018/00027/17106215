Impact of FDG-PET/MRI image fusion on the detection of pancreatic cancer. This study assessed the value of image fusion with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients suspected of having pancreatic cancer.32 patients (12 women, 20 men age 24-79 years15/32 patients had pancreas cancer and 17/32 patients benign disease. The sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection by FDG-PET were 93 and 41% for visual and 86 and 58% for semiquantitative analysis whereas MRI achieved 100 and 76% respectively. Topographical assignment of PET foci by image fusion was superior to side-by-side analysis in 11/39 (28%) foci (in 8/32 patients). However, a true impact on therapeutic strategy was observed only in 1/8 patients as the presence of multiple metastases, irresectable primaries or medical reasons for inoperability prevented a curative setting.Compared to side-by-side analysis, PET/MRI image fusion improves the anatomical assignment and interpretation of FDG foci. The therapeutic benefit for the patient however is limited in patients with multiple lesions or incurable primaries.
