Effects of hyperventilation on phosphocreatine kinetics and muscle deoxygenation during moderate-intensity plantar flexion exercise. The effects of controlled voluntary hyperventilation (Hyp) on phosphocreatine (PCr) kinetics and muscle deoxygenation were examined during moderate-intensity plantar flexion exercise. Male subjects (n = 7) performed trials consisting of 20-min rest, 6-min exercise, and 10-min recovery in control [Con end-tidal Pco(2) (Pet(CO(2))) approximately 33 mmHg] and Hyp (Pet(CO(2)) approximately 17 mmHg) conditions. Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance and near-infrared spectroscopy were used simultaneously to monitor intramuscular acid-base status, high-energy phosphates, and muscle oxygenation. Resting intracellular hydrogen ion concentration ([H(+)](i)) was lower (P < 0.05) in Hyp [90 nM (SD 3)] than Con [96 nM (SD 4)]
