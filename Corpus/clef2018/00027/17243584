A fast fully 4-D incremental gradient reconstruction algorithm for list mode PET data. We describe a fast and globally convergent fully four-dimensional incremental gradient (4DIG) algorithm to estimate the continuous-time tracer density from list mode positron emission tomography (PET) data. Detection of 511-keV photon pairs produced by positron-electron annihilation is modeled as an inhomogeneous Poisson process whose rate function is parameterized using cubic B-splines. The rate functions are estimated by minimizing the cost function formed by the sum of the negative log-likelihood of arrival times, spatial and temporal roughness penalties, and a negativity penalty. We first derive a computable bound for the norm of the optimal temporal basis function coefficients. Based on this bound we then construct and prove convergence of an incremental gradient algorithm. Fully 4-D simulations demonstrate the substantially faster convergence behavior of the 4DIG algorithm relative to preconditioned conjugate gradient. Four-dimensional reconstructions of real data are also included to illustrate the performance of this method.
