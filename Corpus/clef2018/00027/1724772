General principles of retrovirus immunodetection tests. Because infecting retroviruses contain protein and glycoprotein antigenic determinants that can be readily distinguished from host cell determinants, the development of immunologic detection systems, immunodetection tests, or immunoassays capable of identifying antigens of some retroviruses (oncoretroviruses) in blood, body fluids, or cells is possible. Conversely, detection of antibodies produced by animals against some infecting retroviruses can also be used to identify current infections of lentiretroviruses and some oncoretroviruses. Studies of various microorganisms by various immunodetection systems indicate that the most specific and sensitive assays are immunofluorescence, radioimmunoassay, and immunoblot (western blot) analysis, followed by sensitive but less specific ELISA and agglutination assays, and finally by even less sensitive but very specific isolation in culture and double immunodiffusion techniques. The first test used routinely for clinical detection of any retrovirus was the immunofluorescent antibody test, introduced in 1972, for detection of FeLV infection in pet cats. Since then, tests for human retroviruses, the human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2 and the human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I and HTLV-II) have been introduced for routine use in human medicine. Recently, retroviral tests for a second feline retrovirus, the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) have been introduced in veterinary medicine. General principles of sensitivity, specificity, true-positive and -negative rates, false-positive and -negative rates, and positive and negative predictive values apply to all methods used for detection of retroviral infections.
