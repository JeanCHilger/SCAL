Use of avidin/biotin-liposome system for enhanced peritoneal drug delivery in an ovarian cancer model. The goal of this study was to determine the distribution of the avidin/biotin-liposome system in an ovarian cancer xenograft model. Optimal avidin/biotin-liposome injection sequence with enhanced liposome accumulation to the peritoneum was determined. Two weeks after NIH:OVCAR-3 cell inoculation, rats were divided into three groups. Group 1 (B-A) (n=4), received an intraperitoneal injection of (99m)Tc-blue-biotin-liposomes 30 min before an intraperitoneal injection of avidin. Group 2 (A-B) (n=4), received an intraperitoneal injection of avidin 30 min before an intraperitoneal injection of (99m)Tc-blue-biotin-liposomes. Group 3 (A-B 2h) (n=5), received an intraperitoneal injection of avidin 2h before an intraperitoneal injection of (99m)Tc-blue-biotin-liposomes. Three additional non-tumor nude rats served as controls in each group, and were subjected to the same injection sequences. Scintigraphic imaging commenced at various times post (99m)Tc-blue-biotin-liposome injection. After imaging, rats were euthanized at 23 h post-liposome injection for tissue biodistribution. Images showed no apparent difference in liposome distribution between control and tumor animals. Regional uptake analysis at 4h for tumor rats showed significantly higher lymphatic channel uptake in the A-B 2h group (p<0.05) and a trend of increased peritoneal uptake in A-B group. By 22 h, peritoneal and lymphatic channel uptake was similar for all groups. At necropsy, most activity was found in blue-stained omentum, diaphragm, mediastinal and abdominal nodes. Bowel activity was minimal. These results correlate with previous normal rat studies, and demonstrate potential use of this avidin/biotin-liposome system for prolonging drug delivery to the peritoneal cavity and associating lymph nodes in this ovarian cancer xenograft model.
