Clinical applications of molecular imaging methods for patients with ischemic stroke. Several molecular imaging methods have been developed to visualize pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia in humans in vivo. PET and SPECT with specific ligands have been mainly used as diagnostic tools for the clinical usage of molecular imaging in patients with ischemic stroke. Recently, cellular MR imaging with specific contrast agents has been developed to visualize targeted cells in human stroke patients. This article reviews the current status in the clinical applications of those molecular imaging methods for patients with ischemic stroke.
