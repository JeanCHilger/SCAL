Evaluation of acute myocardial infarction by 201T1 single-photon emission computed tomography using scoring system. In 36 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 201T1 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) examinations were performed in a relatively early phase of AMI. The short and long axis views of the left ventricle (LV) were divided into 6 segments. Images of each segment were assigned scores (segmental scores) based on a visual evaluation of the extent of 210T1 accumulations as follows: 1 = normal 2 = relatively low
