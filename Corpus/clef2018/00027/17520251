Comparison of 68Ga-DOTATOC PET and 111In-DTPAOC (Octreoscan) SPECT in patients with neuroendocrine tumours. Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) can be imaged with scintigraphy using radiolabelled somatostatin analogues. The aim of our study was to compare the value of (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET and (111)In-DTPAOC SPECT (Octreoscan) in the detection of NET manifestations.Twenty-seven NET patients were prospectively examined. (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET and (111)In-DTPAOC SPECT were performed using standard techniques. Treatment was not applied in between. Mean and maximum standardised uptake values (SUVs) were calculated for PET findings. Tumour/non-tumour ratios were calculated for SPECT findings. Findings were compared by a region-by-region analysis and verified with histopathology, CT and MRI within 21 days.SUVs of positive lesions on (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET ranged from 0.7 to 29.3 (mean SUV) and from 0.9 to 34.4 (maximum SUV). Tumour/non-tumour ratios on (111)In-DTPAOC SPECT ranged from 1.8 to 7.3. In imaging lung and skeletal manifestations, (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET was more efficient than (111)In-DTPAOC SPECT. All discrepant lung findings and 77.8% of discrepant osseous findings were verified as true positive PET interpretations. In regional comparison of liver and brain, (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET and (111)In-DTPAOC SPECT were identical. In lymph nodes, the pancreas and the gastro-intestinal system, different values of the two techniques were not indicated in regional analyses. In a single patient, surgical interventions were changed on the basis of (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET findings.(68)Ga-DOTATOC PET is superior to (111)In-DTPAOC SPECT in the detection of NET manifestations in the lung and skeleton and similar for the detection of NET manifestations in the liver and brain. (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET is advantageous in guiding the clinical management.
