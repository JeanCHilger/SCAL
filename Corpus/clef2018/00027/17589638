Medium term prognostic value of stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in a chest pain unit. To evaluate the prognostic value of stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) applied to patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS).Retrospective study. Patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) admitted into the chest pain unit (CPU) from December 2002 to April 2004, after exclusion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and high risk unstable angina they underwent stress MPS.Selected 301 patients, 65.3 +/- 12.5 years and 164 (54.5%) male gender. The test was performed 13 +/- 12 hours after admission. Myocardial ischemia (ISQ) was found in 142 patients (47.2%). Male gender (n=94, p=<0.0001), history of diabetes mellitus (n=31, p=0.033), past of AMI (n=52, p=<0.0001), past of surgical myocardial revascularization (n=46, p=<0.0001) and past of percutaneous revascularization (n=68, p=<0.0001) presented correlation with ISQ. The follow-up was 697.7 +/- 326.6 days. No MPS variable correlated with the occurrence of primary outcome. Abnormal scintigraphy (n=76, p < 0.0001), ISQ (n=73, p < 0.0001) and post-stress left ventricular ejection fraction below 45% (n=21, p=0.006) correlated with secondary outcome. The presence of ISQ was the major variable in the multivariate analysis for the prediction of secondary outcome (RR = 6.5 CI 95% = 0.009).Presence of ISQ was the major independent factor in prediction of adverse events for patients admitted into the CPU.
