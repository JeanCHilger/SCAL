Giardia and Cryptosporidium and public health: the epidemiological scenario from the Italian perspective. Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. are protozoa that cause human and animal disease worldwide and often exhibit zoonotic transmission. This review gives ample information concerning the epidemiology of these parasites in Italy, i.e. prevalence data in humans, farm and pet animals, shellfish and aquatic environment. Moreover, it reports genotyping results obtained from different isolates, with particular emphasis on the spread of host-specific and zoonotic species/genotypes of various origin, and on molecular data that make the Italian situation different from that of other countries. Finally, possible explanations are given for the infrequent reports of Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. outbreaks, despite widespread faecal contamination by these parasites.
