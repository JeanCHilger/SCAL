Optimizing expression of Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein a, PspA: serocross-reactivity within families of antisera induced against clades 1 and 3. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the agent responsible for infections such as pneumonia, otitis media, and meningitis. Among virulence factors, the Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) has been shown to be immunogenic and protective in mice, and is thus a good vaccine candidate. PspA has been classified into 6 clades and 3 families. Initially, pspA fragments, clades 1 and 3, were cloned into the pAE-6His expression vector. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified by affinity and anion exchange chromatographies, with a yield of 11 mg/l of culture. Due to plasmid instability in E. coli, another construct using pspA1 was obtained based on pET-37b(+), which was shown to be stable in E. coli and increased the yield approximately 3-fold. Our results show good conditions for scale-up. Sera from immunized mice recognized PspA in total extracts of S. pneumoniae strains: anti-rPspA1p sera recognized native PspA clades 1 (+++), 2 (++) and 4 (+) and anti-rPspA3p sera recognized PspA clades 1 (+), 2 (+), 3 (+++) and 4 (+). The cross-reactivity pattern obtained confirms the notion that proteins from both families should be included for development of a broad-coverage vaccine lower-cross reactivity between rPspAs of family 2 indicates that it may be necessary to include 2 proteins from this family.
