Mechanism of uptake and retention of F-18 BMS-747158-02 in cardiomyocytes: a novel PET myocardial imaging agent. BMS-747158-02 is a novel fluorine 18-labeled pyridazinone derivative designed for cardiac imaging. The uptake and retention mechanisms of F-18 BMS-747158-02 in cardiac myocytes were studied in vitro, and the biodistribution of F-18 BMS-747158-02 was studied in vivo in mice.Fluorine 19 BMS-747158-01 inhibited mitochondrial complex I (MC-I) in bovine heart submitochondrial particles with an IC(50) of 16.6 +/- 3 nmol/L that was comparable to the reference inhibitors of MC-1, rotenone, pyridaben, and deguelin (IC(50) of 18.2 +/- 6.7 nmol/L, 19.8 +/- 2.6 nmol/L, and 23.1 +/- 1.5 nmol/L, respectively). F-18 BMS-747158-02 had high uptake in monolayers of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (10.3% +/- 0.7% of incubated drug at 60 minutes) that was inhibited by 200 nmol/L of rotenone (91% +/- 2%) and deguelin (89% +/- 3%). In contrast, an inactive pyridaben analog, P-070 (IC(50) value >4 micromol/L in MC-1 assay), did not inhibit the binding of F-18 BMS-747158-02 in cardiomyocytes. Uptake and washout kinetics for F-18 BMS-747158-02 in rat cardiomyocytes indicated that the time to half-maximal (t((1/2))) uptake was very rapid (approximately 35 seconds), and washout t((1/2)) for efflux of F-18 BMS-747158-02 was greater than 120 minutes. In vivo biodistribution studies in mice showed that F-18 BMS-747158-02 had substantial myocardial uptake (9.5% +/- 0.5% of injected dose per gram) at 60 minutes and heart-to-lung and heart-to-liver ratios of 14.1 +/- 2.5 and 8.3 +/- 0.5, respectively. Positron emission tomography imaging in the mouse allowed clear cardiac visualization and demonstrated sustained myocardial uptake through 55 minutes.F-18 BMS-747158-02 is a novel positron emission tomography cardiac tracer targeting MC-I in cardiomyocytes with rapid uptake and slow washout. These characteristics allow fast and sustained accumulation in the heart.
