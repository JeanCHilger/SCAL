DCT-based complexity regularization for EM tomographic reconstruction. This paper introduces a simple algorithm for tomographic reconstruction based on the use of a complexity regularization term. The regularization is formulated in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain by promoting a low-noise reconstruction having a high sparsity in the frequency domain. The resulting algorithm simply alternates between a maximum-likelihood (ML) expectation-maximization (EM) update and a decreasing sparsity constraint in the DCT domain. Applications to SPECT reconstruction and comparisons with a classical estimator using the best available regularization terms are given in order to illustrate the potential of our reconstruction technique.
