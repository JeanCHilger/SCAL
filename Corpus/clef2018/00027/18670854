The influence of I-131 therapy on FDG uptake in differentiated thyroid cancer. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) [or PET/computed tomography (CT)] is more likely to show false-negative results when it is performed shortly after chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy because of "metabolic stunning". The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of I-131 therapy on FDG uptake and the detection of recurrence or metastasis of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).We retrospectively enrolled 16 consecutive FDG-PET/CT studies which had been performed in patients with DTC with elevated thyroglobulin (TG) but negative I-131 whole-body scan. All studies were performed under L: -thyroxine suppression. The patients were divided into groups A and B for PET/CT performed within 4 months of I-131 therapy or no such therapy, respectively. Each lesion identified on PET/CT was characterized using a 5-point scale by visual analysis: 0 = definitely benign, 1 = probably benign, 2 = equivocal, 3 = probably malignant, and 4 = definitely malignant. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) in each lesion was also measured for semiquantitative analysis. We compared the visual grading and SUV max of the lesion of highest FDG uptake between groups A and B.For visual analysis, group B had significantly more patients with an uptake score of 3 or 4 than group A (80% vs. 17%, P = 0.01). In addition, there were significantly more equivocal results from group A than from group B (67% vs. 10%, P = 0.02). If the patients with the highest uptake scores of 2, 3, and 4 were considered to be positive for local recurrence or metastasis, there would be no significant difference between the positive rates of groups A and B (83% vs. 90%, P = 0.7). However, the mean SUV max of positive results was significantly lower for group A than for group B (3.1 +/- 0.9 and 6.6 +/- 3.5, respectively, P = 0.02).The preliminary results suggested that FDG uptake in DTC may be negatively influenced by I-131 therapy within 4 months, resulting in lower FDG uptake and more equivocal results. Further studies are necessary to determine whether it is secondary to "metabolic stunning" caused by I-131 therapy.
