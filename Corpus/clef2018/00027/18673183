Radionuclide PET and PET/CT in coronary artery disease. In the present review, the basis of non invasive assessment of CAD, the most recent technical developments and results obtained by PET in cardiovascular research and clinical cardiology are described. PET has provided a wealth of new information in the field of cardiac pathophysiology and remains the gold standard for non-invasive measurements of MBF and CFR against which new techniques should be tested. The possibility to combine this relevant functional information with the anatomic details on luminal and arterial wall abnormalities, provided by multislice CT with or without the use of "hybrid" scanners, offers new opportunities for comprehensive non-invasive assessment of CAD and efficacy of new treatments.
