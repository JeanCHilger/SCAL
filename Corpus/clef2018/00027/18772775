Tumors of the oropharynx and oral cavity: MR, CT, PET-CT imaging. Pretherapeutic imaging plays a central role in the management of tumors of the oropharynx and oral cavity. MR and, to a lesser extent, CT and F-18 FDG PET-CT are the imaging modalities of choice for pretherapeutic work-up of these lesions. Imaging protocols should be simple and reproducible, and should provide the key elements for treatment planning.
