Pediatric positron emission tomography-computed tomography protocol considerations. Pediatric body oncology positron emission tomography-computed tomography studies require special considerations for optimal diagnostic performance while limiting radiation exposure to young patients. Differences from routine adult procedures include the patient preparation phase, radiopharmaceutical dose, computed tomography acquisition parameters, and approach to computed tomography contrast materials and imaging sequence. Attention to these differences define the best practice for positron emission tomography-computed tomography examinations of children with cancer contributing to optimal care of these patients.
