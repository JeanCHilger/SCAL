A simple and efficient expression and purification system using two newly constructed vectors. Structural biology places a high demand on proteins both in terms of quality and quantity. Although many protein expression and purification systems have been developed, an efficient and simple system which can be easily adapted is desirable. Here, we report a new system which combines improved expression, solubility screening and purification efficiency. The system is based on two newly constructed vectors, pEHISTEV and pEHISGFPTEV derived from a pET vector. Both vectors generate a construct with an amino-terminal hexahistidine tag (His-tag). In addition, pEHISGFPTEV expresses a protein with an N-terminal His-tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion to allow rapid quantitation of soluble protein. Both vectors have a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site that allows for production of protein with only two additional N-terminal residues and have the same multiple cloning site which enables parallel cloning. Protein purification is a simple two-stage nickel affinity chromatography based on the His tag removal. A total of seven genes were tested using this system. Expression was optimised using pEHISGFPTEV constructs by monitoring the GFP fluorescence and the soluble target proteins were quantified using spectrophotometric analysis. All the tested proteins were purified with sufficient quantity and quality to attempt structure determination. This system has been proven to be simple and effective for structural biology. The system is easily adapted to include other vectors, tags or fusions and therefore has the potential to be broadly applicable.
