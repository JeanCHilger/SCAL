Divided attention and metabolic brain dysfunction in mild dementia of the Alzheimer's type. The relationship between reaction time (RT) measures under single-task and dual-task conditions and resting levels of brain metabolism, as measured by positron emission tomography (PET), was examined in patients with mild dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and age- and educationally-matched controls. Slowing of RT in dual-task but not single-task conditions correlated with reductions in brain metabolism in right premotor and right parietal association areas only for the mild DAT patients. The results suggest a relation between divided attention deficits and metabolic dysfunction of right frontal and parietal lobes in mild DAT patients.
