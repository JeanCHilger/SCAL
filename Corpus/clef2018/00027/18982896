Dog visitation therapy in dementia care: a literature review. This article considers the effectiveness of dog visitation therapy in dementia care and considers implications for practice. The literature indicates that visits by animals to care settings can bring various benefits to patients and residents, including relaxation, less apathy, agitation and aggression, and lower blood pressure. Much of the evidence is, however, anecdotal. If animals are to be introduced to care settings, careful multidisciplinary planning is required to ensure that stringent protocols and procedures are in place to protect the health and safety of all involved.
