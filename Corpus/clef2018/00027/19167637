Important parameters in the detection of left main trunk disease using stress myocardial perfusion imaging. We sought noninvasively to diagnose left main trunk (LMT) disease using myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI).Five hundred and eight patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent both stress MPI and coronary angiography. The extent and severity of perfusion abnormalities were assessed using a 20-segment model. In addition, perfusion defects in both left anterior descending and left circumflex arterial territories were defined as a left main (LM) pattern defect, and those in 3-coronary arterial territories as a 3-vessel pattern defect.In 42 patients with LMT disease, a summed stress score (19.4 ± 10.0 vs. 13.5 ± 10.0 p < 0.0001) and a summed rest score (12.1 ± 9.7 vs. 7.0 ± 7.8In the identification of LMT disease, lung uptake of radiotracers was a single best parameter, which was independent of the presence or absence of previous MI.
