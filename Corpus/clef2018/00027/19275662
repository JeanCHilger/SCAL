Cancer drug development using glucose metabolism radiopharmaceuticals. Imaging of glucose metabolism has resulted in significant improvements in staging and follow-up in oncology. (18)F-FDG PET has become a routine clinical test for most solid tumours. Several radionuclide-labeled derivatives of deoxyglucose that have shown that glucose metabolic imaging may be a useful tool for improving tumour staging, restaging, and monitoring of tumour response to therapy.
