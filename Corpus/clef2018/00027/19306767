Cardiac positron emission tomography: current clinical practice. In the last two decades, the field of nuclear cardiology has experienced significant progress. The introduction of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging represented a major breakthrough that has significantly contributed to a better understanding of physiology and pathophysiology of several heart diseases. Currently, PET imaging is recognized as a well-established method to assess cardiac perfusion, function, metabolism, and viability. This article summarizes the main clinical applications of state-of-the art cardiac PET technology.
