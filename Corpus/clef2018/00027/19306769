Nuclear imaging in heart failure. Heart failure is becoming the main clinical challenge in cardiology in the twenty-first century and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Currently, several therapeutic options are available for heart failure patients, including medical therapy, revascularization, advanced cardiac surgery, device therapy, and cardiac transplantation. Future therapies are directed at cell and gene therapy. In this article the role of nuclear imaging in the management of heart failure patients is discussed.
