The prognostic significance of the SUVmax (maximum standardized uptake value for F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose) of the cervical tumor in PET imaging for early cervical cancer: preliminary results. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of the cervical tumor uptake of fluorine-18-labeled FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) measured as the SUVmax (maximum standardized uptake value) by PET (Positron Emission Tomography) in patients with early cervical cancer treated with surgery+/-adjuvant therapy.Forty-four patients (FIGO clinical stage IB to IIA) with biopsy-proven cervical cancer underwent PET before surgery. The SUVmax of the primary cervical tumor mass was obtained and compared with pathological prognostic factors after the initial treatment. In addition, we investigated the recurrence pattern according to the SUVmax and analyzed independent risk factors associated with the recurrence of disease.According to the tumor stage, the mean SUVmax significantly differed among groups (P=0.013). The SUVmax was significantly higher in patients with deep stromal invasion (>or=1 cm, P=0.0208), LVSI (lymph-vascular space invasion) (P=0.0429) and a pathologically confirmed large tumor size of more than 4 cm (P=0.0074) when compared to controls. Patients with a high SUVmax (>or=13.4) had a significantly reduced disease-free survival rate compared to patients with a low SUVmax (P=0.021). In addition, the SUVmax (>or=13.4) was a significant independent predictor of recurrence of cervical cancer after treatment with surgery (+/-adjuvant therapy) (P=0.0207).Patients with early cervical cancer showing a high SUVmax (>or=13.4) of the cervical tumor should be considered at increased risk for disease recurrence after surgery and may need more aggressive multimodal treatment.
