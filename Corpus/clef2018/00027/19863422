Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis may not be associated with brain abnormalities. The etiology of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is uncertain and multifactorial. Recently, regional brain volume differences have been reported in the pathogenesis of AIS.To examine cerebral glucose metabolism using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) brain positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with AIS and in gender-matched healthy control subjects.Twenty-six right-handed AIS patients (six male, 20 female mean age 14.6+/-2.22 years, range 11-18 years) were prospectively recruited for this study. Fourteen young adults (three male, 11 femaleSPM analysis showed no voxels with differing cerebral glucose metabolism in AIS patients. SPAM analysis revealed no significant differences between AIS and normal control subjects.SPM and SPAM analyses showed no statistically significant differences in cerebral glucose metabolism between AIS and normal control subjects. These results may suggest that there is no relationship between AIS and brain abnormalities.
