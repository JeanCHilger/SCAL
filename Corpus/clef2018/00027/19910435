Methyl-L-11C-methionine PET as a diagnostic marker for malignant progression in patients with glioma. Methyl-L-(11)C-methionine ((11)C-MET) PET has been shown to detect brain tumors with a high sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we investigated the potential of (11)C-MET PET to noninvasively detect tumor progression in patients with gliomas. Moreover, we analyzed the relationship between changes in (11)C-MET uptake on PET and changes in various molecular immunohistochemical markers during progression of gliomas.Twenty-four patients with histologically proven glioma were investigated repeatedly with (11)C-MET PET. (11)C-MET uptake was determined for a circular region of interest. Histologic and molecular analyses for tumor progression were performed after open surgery and stereotactic biopsy, respectively.In patients with malignant progression, the mean increase in (11)C-MET uptake was 54.4% (SD, 45.5% range, 3.1%-162.2%), whereas in patients without a change in tumor grade, mean (11)C-MET uptake did not significantly change (3.9%These data suggest that (11)C-MET-PET represents a noninvasive method to detect malignant progression in patients with gliomas. Moreover, the increase in (11)C-MET uptake during malignant progression is reflected by an increase in angiogenesis-promoting markers as vascular endothelial growth factor.
