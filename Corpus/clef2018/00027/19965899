Effects of pre- and postnatal olfactogustatory experience on early preferences at birth and dietary selection at weaning in kittens. The ontogenesis of olfactogustatory preferences has been investigated in various mammals but surprisingly not in domestic cats Felis catus. In a first experiment, we examined how prenatal exposure (25 days prepartum) to a cheese flavor via the mother's diet can influence olfactory preferences of neonatal kittens. During 2-choice tests, 2-day-old kittens oriented first toward the cheese odor experienced in utero more frequently than toward a usual pet food odor. The choice of kittens born to mothers fed with a control diet did not differ from random. In the second experiment, we assessed the role of pre- and postnatal exposure (from 25th day before to 23rd day after birth) to cheese flavor on food preferences in weaned kittens. Forty-five-day-old cats exposed to cheese flavor during uterine and postnatal life via their mothers' diet ate higher amounts of chicken supplemented with cheese flavor than food supplemented with usual pet food flavor. On the other hand, the control group did not exhibit a preference for a specific food. Our results clearly demonstrated that pre- and postnatal olfactogustatory exposure via maternal ingestion influences later olfactory and food preferences of cats.
