Increased incidence of domestic animal bites following a disaster due to natural hazards. During deployment following Hurricane Ike in September 2008, bites from domestic animals were among the top three trauma complaints seen at the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT) base of operations.Unlike previous reports of frightened, misplaced dogs and cats biting strangers and rescue workers, there was an increase in bites associated with presumed non-rabid pets who were known to the bite victim.This was an observational sampling of all patients presenting for medical care during deployment to the AL-3 DMAT base of operations in Webster, Texas, following Hurricane Ike. Findings were compared with unofficial local norms and observations from the literature.Of the people with animal bites presenting to the field hospital, dog bites accounted for 55%, cat bites, 40%, and snake bites, 5%. Most of the wounds required suturing and were not simple punctures. Most bites (70%) involved the hand(s). Some patients presented >24 hours after the bite, and already had developed cellulitis. One patient required transfer and inpatient admission for intravenous antibiotics and debridement of a hand injury with spread into the metacarpophalangeal space.Most of the bites were severe and occurred within the first 72 hours after the hurricane, and waned steadily over the following weeks to baseline levels. No animal bites caused by misplaced dogs and cats biting strangers were seen. There was an increase in bites associated with domesticated pets known to the bite victim. The current NDMS cache is stocked adequately to care for most wounds caused by animal bites. However post-exposure rabies treatment is not part of the routine medications offered. For future disaster preparedness training, pet owners should be aware of the increased potential for dog and cat bites.
