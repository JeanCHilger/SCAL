Cooperation between nuclear medicine and radiology. Currently there is increasing cooperation between societies in nuclear medicine and radiology. This includes educational, political, and economic collaboration. Part of the reason for this trend is the introduction of SPECT/CT and PET/CT. An increasingly important issue, however, is the difficulty of some nuclear medicine physicians to obtain jobs.
