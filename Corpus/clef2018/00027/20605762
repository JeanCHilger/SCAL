Texture analysis of non-small cell lung cancer on unenhanced computed tomography: initial evidence for a relationship with tumour glucose metabolism and stage. The aim was to undertake an initial study of the relationship between texture features in computed tomography (CT) images of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and tumour glucose metabolism and stage. This retrospective pilot study comprised 17 patients with 18 pathologically confirmed NSCLC. Non-contrast-enhanced CT images of the primary pulmonary lesions underwent texture analysis in 2 stages as follows: (a) image filtration using Laplacian of Gaussian filter to differentially highlight fine to coarse textures, followed by (b) texture quantification using mean grey intensity (MGI), entropy (E) and uniformity (U) parameters. Texture parameters were compared with tumour fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake (standardised uptake value (SUV)) and stage as determined by the clinical report of the CT and FDG-positron emission tomography imaging. Tumour SUVs ranged between 2.8 and 10.4. The number of NSCLC with tumour stages I, II, III and IV were 4, 4, 4 and 6, respectively. Coarse texture features correlated with tumour SUV (E: r = 0.51, p = 0.03 U: r = -0.52, p = 0.03), whereas fine texture features correlated with tumour stage (MGI: rs = 0.71, p = 0.001
