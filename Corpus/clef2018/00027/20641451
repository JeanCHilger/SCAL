 Extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion molecules consist of a complex network of fibronectins, collagens, chondroitins, laminins, glycoproteins, heparin sulfate, tenascins, and proteoglycans surrounding connective tissue cells, and they are mainly secreted by fibroblasts, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts (1). Cell substrate adhesion molecules are considered essential regulators of cell migration, differentiation, and tissue integrity. These molecules play a role in inflammation, but they also participate in the process of invasion and metastasis of malignant cells in the host tissue (2). Invasive tumor cells adhere to the ECM components, which provide a matrix environment for their permeation through the basal lamina and underlying interstitial stroma of the connective tissue. Several ECM adhesion molecules and their protein receptors have been studied extensively for their involvement in tumor invasion and metastasis, including the integrins, lectins, selectins, and cadherins (3). The monoclonal antibody (mAb) 14C5 recognizes an extracellular membrane antigen expressed on SK-BR-3 human breast tumor cells (4, 5). The 14C5 mAb inhibits the adhesion of tumor cells to ECM and tumor growth. The 14C5 antigen is absent on the cell surface of normal tissues and artery. However, it is present in high amounts on the cell membrane of invasive breast carcinomas and several other malignant tumors (4). Surprisingly, the 14C5 antigen is markedly expressed on the cell surface of fibroblasts surrounding the tumor cells. The 14C5 antigen is determined to have a molecular weight of ~90 kDa and 14C5 binds the vascular integrin Î±
