 The gastrin/cholecystokinin subtype 2 receptor (CCK-2R) is a G-protein–coupled receptor (for structure, function, and pharmacology of CCK-2R, see Foucaud et al. (1)) that is believed to participate in the development of a variety of cancers and has a characteristic overexpression in the cancerous tumors (2, 3). As a consequence, investigators are interested in exploring the use of CCK-2R ligands, such as gastrin and cholecystokinin (and their derivatives), for the diagnostic imaging and possible therapy of cancers that overexpress this receptor (3-5). Cholecystokinin is the topic of several clinical trials around the world for the treatment of different gastrointestinal disorders and the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Several radiolabeled CCK-2R peptides have been evaluated under preclinical (3) and clinical conditions (6) for the visualization of CCK-2R–positive tumors, but the major limitation of using these peptides was reported to be either a high uptake by the kidneys or low accumulation in the tumors or both. During an earlier study, based on the tumor/kidney uptake ratio, an
