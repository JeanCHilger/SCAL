 The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is the only known ligand of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met) (also known as the HGF receptor) that has an important function, including cell development, proliferation, scattering, migration, and angiogenesis, all of which are necessary for the survival and repair of tissues (1). c-Met is known to mediate its activity through an intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) that activates different signal transduction pathways leading to initiation of the various cell processes (2). Also, deregulation of c-Met activity due to paracrine/autocrine activation, overexpression, or a mutation promotes the development of a neoplastic cell phenotype (2). Overexpression of c-Met and HGF has been associated with a poor prognosis and survival of the patient (3), suggesting that the c-Met receptor may be a suitable target for the detection of cancers at an early stage, which could help in the development of an appropriate treatment regimen to improve patient prognosis (4). c-Met is the target of several drugs under evaluation in clinical trials approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Investigators recently generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that inhibits the HGFâ€“c-Met interaction and identified the active mAb cell-surface epitope peptide as KSLSRHDHIHHH, which was designated as the c-Met binding peptide (cMBP) (5). The cMBP and its derivatives (containing a tri-amino acid linker, Gly-Gly-Gly (GGG), or an aliphatic carbon linker, 8-aminooctanoic acid (AOC)) were labeled with
