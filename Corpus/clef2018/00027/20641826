 The complex process of programmed cell death (apoptosis) has a very important function in the normal development and differentiation of tissues in animals (1). An increased rate of apoptosis can result in diseases of the cardiovascular (e.g., stroke, myocardial infarction, etc.), nervous (e.g., neurodegeneration), or immune (e.g., autoimmunity) systems, and the development of cancer is often attributed to a reduced rate of apoptosis (2, 3). A characteristic feature of apoptosis is the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), a negatively charged phospholipid that is usually present on the inner layer of the cell membrane, due to the process of membrane inversion observed during cell death (4). Also, annexin A5 (a 36-kD protein) is known to bind specifically to the exposed PS on apoptotic cell membranes (5) and it has been conjugated to a variety of nuclides or fluorescent dyes for the detection and visualization of apoptosis in tissues with different disease pathologies using scintigraphic and optical techniques (6).
