4-[ Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was first identified from extracts of human colon adenocarcinoma (1) and fetal gut (2). It is a Î²-glycoprotein, and its predominant expression on the cell surface is increased in a variety of carcinomas and in certain inflammatory states such as inflammatory bowel disease (3, 4). CEA has a molecular weight of ~180 kDa, and it can be shed and detected in the serum (5). CEA expression is observed in patients with various carcinomas of the colon, lungs, thyroid, uterus, ovaries, pancreas, and medullary thyroid (6). Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed for both the diagnosis and treatment of tumors (7, 8).
