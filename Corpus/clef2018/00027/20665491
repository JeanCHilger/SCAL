Pretransplantation [18-F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan predicts outcome in patients with recurrent Hodgkin lymphoma or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma undergoing reduced-intensity conditioning followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The use of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HG-NHL) has recognized prognostic value in patients who are receiving chemotherapy or undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). In contrast, the role of PET before reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and followed by allogeneic SCT has not been investigated to date.PET was used to assess 80 patients who had chemosensitive disease (34 patients with HG-NHL and 46 patients with HL) before they underwent allogeneic SCT: 42 patients had negative PET studies, and 38 patients had positive PET studies. Patients underwent allograft from matched related siblings (n=41) or alternative donors (n=39).At the time of the last follow-up, 48 patients were alive (60%), and 32 had died. The 3-year cumulative incidence of nonrecurrence mortality and disease recurrence was 17% and 40%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of disease recurrence was significantly lower in the PET-negative patients (25% vs 56% P=.007), but there was no significant difference between the patients with or without chronic graft-versus-host disease (P=.400). The patients who had negative PET studies before undergoing allogenic SCT also had significantly better outcomes in terms of 3-year overall survival (76% vs 33%The current results indicated that PET scanning appears to be an accurate tool for assessing prognosis in patients who are eligible for RIC allografting.
