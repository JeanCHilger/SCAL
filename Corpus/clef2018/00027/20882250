Electronic structural dependence of the photophysical properties of fluorescent heteroditopic ligands - implications in designing molecular fluorescent indicators. Two fluorescent heteroditopic ligands (2a and 2b) for zinc ion were synthesized and studied. The efficiencies of two photophysical processes, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and photoinduced electron transfer (PET), determine the magnitudes of emission bathochromic shift and enhancement, respectively, when a heteroditopic ligand forms mono- or dizinc complexes. The electron-rich 2b is characterized by a high degree of ICT in the excited state with little propensity for PET, which is manifested in a large bathochromic shift of emission upon Zn(2+) coordination without enhancement in fluorescence quantum yield. The electron-poor 2a displays the opposite photophysical consequence where Zn(2+) binding results in greatly enhanced emission without significant spectral shift. The electronic structural effects on the relative efficiencies of ICT and PET in 2a and 2b as well as the impact of Zn(2+)-coordination are probed using experimental and computational approaches. This study reveals that the delicate balance between various photophysical pathways (e.g. ICT and PET) engineered in a heteroditopic ligand is sensitively dependent on the electronic structure of the ligand, i.e. whether the fluorophore is electron-rich or poor, whether it possesses a donor-acceptor type of structure, and where the metal binding occurs.
