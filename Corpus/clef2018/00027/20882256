Taking TiF4 complexes to extremes--the first examples with phosphine co-ligands. The first soft donor adducts of TiF(4), [TiF(4)(diphosphine)] (diphosphine = o-C(6)H(4)(PMe(2))(2), R(2)P(CH(2))(2)PR(2), R = Me or Et) have been prepared from [TiF(4)(MeCN)(2)] and the diphosphines in rigorously anhydrous CH(2)Cl(2), as extremely moisture sensitive yellow solids, and characterised by multinuclear NMR ((1)H, (31)P, (19)F), IR and UV/vis spectroscopy. The crystal structure of [TiF(4){Et(2)P(CH(2))(2)PEt(2)}] has been determined and shows a distorted six-coordinate geometry with disparate Ti-F(transF) and Ti-F(transP) distances and long Ti-P bonds. Weaker soft donor ligands including Ph(3)P, Ph(2)P(CH(2))(2)PPh(2), o-C(6)H(4)(PPh(2))(2), Ph(2)As(CH(2))(2)AsPh(2), o-C(6)H(4)(AsMe(2))(2) and (i)PrS(CH(2))(2)S(i)Pr do not form stable complexes with TiF(4), although surprisingly, fluorotitanate(IV) salts of the previously unknown doubly protonated ligand cations [LH(2)][Ti(4)F(18)] (L = o-C(6)H(4)(PPh(2))(2), o-C(6)H(4)(AsMe(2))(2) and (i)PrS(CH(2))(2)S(i)Pr) are formed in some cases as minor by-products. The structure of [o-C(6)H(4)(PPh(2)H)(2)][Ti(4)F(18)] shows the first authenticated example of a diprotonated o-phenylene-diphosphine. The synthesis and full spectroscopic characterisation are reported for a range of TiF(4) adducts with hard N- or O-donor ligands for comparison purposes, along with crystal structures of [TiF(4)(thf)(2)], [TiF(4)(Ph(3)EO)(2)]Â·2CH(2)Cl(2) (E = P or As), and [TiF(4)(bipy)].
