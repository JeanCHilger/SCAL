Explorations in the relationship of dream sleep to schizophrenia using positron emission tomography. This study explored the relationship between rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and schizophrenia using positron emission tomography. Glucose use was compared between 49 schizophrenics, 30 awake controls and 12 controls in REM sleep. Assessment of the frequency and locations of brain areas showing significant differences suggested that REM did not resemble schizophrenia. Schizophrenics were between the higher awake controls and lower REM controls in corpus callosum glucose use. Hallucinating schizophrenics showed lower left caudate glucose use.
