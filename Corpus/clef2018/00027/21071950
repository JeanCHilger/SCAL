Improved visual hallucination by donepezil and occipital glucose metabolism in dementia with Lewy bodies: the Osaki-Tajiri project. Deficits in the cholinergic system are pronounced in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and are more severe in patients with visual hallucinations (VHs). The aim is to identify the occipital glucose metabolism patterns by positron emission tomography (PET) and the changes following donepezil treatment. 13 DLB patients with VHs were enrolled in the study. After the first FDG-PET study, 5 mg/day donepezil was administered orally, and a second PET study was performed 3 months later. After donepezil administration, VHs disappeared completely in 6 patients, and the PET studies revealed significantly decreased glucose metabolism in the medial occipital cortex. These results suggest that VHs in DLB were associated with impaired glucose metabolism in the medial occipital cortex. Donepezil treatment may modify regional glucose metabolism.
