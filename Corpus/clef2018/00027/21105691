Substitution of the terminal chloride ligands of [Re(6)S(8)Cl(6)](4-) with triethylphosphine: photophysical and electrochemical properties of a new series of [Re(6)S(8)](2+) based clusters. A systematic substitution of the terminal chlorides coordinated to the hexanuclear cluster [Re(6)S(8)Cl(6)](4-) has been conducted. The following complexes: [Re(6)S(8)(PEt(3))Cl(5)](3-) (1), cis- (cis-2) and trans-[Re(6)S(8)(PEt(3))(2)Cl(4)](2-) (trans-2), mer- (mer-3) and fac-[Re(6)S(8)(PEt(3))(3)Cl(3)](-) (fac-3), and cis- (cis-4) and trans-[Re(6)S(8)(PEt(3))(4)Cl(2)] (trans-4) were synthesized and fully characterized. Compared to the substitution of the halide ligands of the related [Re(6)S(8)Br(6)](4-) and [Re(6)Se(8)I(6)](3-) clusters, the chloride ligands are slower to substitute which allowed us to prepare the first monophosphine cluster (1). In addition, the synthesis of fac-3 was optimized by using cis-2 as the starting material, which led to a significant increase in the overall yield of this isomer. Notably, we observed evidence of phosphine isomerization taking place during the preparation of the facial isomer this was unexpected based on the relatively inert nature of the Re-P bond. The structures of Bu(4)N(+) salts of trans-2, mer-3, and fac-3 were determined using X-ray crystallography. All compounds display luminescent behavior. A study of the photophysical properties of these complexes includes measurement of the excited state lifetimes (which ranged from 4.1-7.1 Î¼s), the emission quantum yields, the rates of radiative and non-radiative decay, and the rate of quenching with O(2). Quenching studies verify the triplet state nature of the excited state.
