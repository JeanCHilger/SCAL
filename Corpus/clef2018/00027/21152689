Tracers in oncology - preclinical and clinical evaluation. In oncology, PET and PET/CT with tracers beyond FDG target more specific biological processes, such as proliferation (18F-3´-fluoro-3´-deoxy-L-thymidine 18F-FLT), tumour hypoxia (18F-fluoromisonidazolThe clinical success of multimodal imaging with PET/CT is expected to promote the combination of MRI and PET in the future.
