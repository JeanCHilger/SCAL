The role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the evaluation of gastric cancer recurrence after curative gastrectomy. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) scans are frequently performed for the screening or staging of malignant tumors. This study aimed to assess the usefulness of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in detection of gastric cancer recurrence after curative gastrectomy.Eighty nine patients who had undergone curative gastrectomy due to gastric cancer and had (18)F-FDG PET/CT and contrast CT scans within 2 weeks for surveillance in asymptomatic patients (n = 11) or to clarify suspected recurrence (n = 78) were consecutively collected and retrospectively analyzed. They had clinical follow-up for at least 12 months after PET/CT and CT scans.Fifteen of the 89 patients (16.9%) were diagnosed with recurrent gastric cancer in 21 organs. Forty one organs showed an increase in FDG uptake, and only 9 of these organs were diagnosed with recurrent gastric cancer by (18)F-FDG PET/CT. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of the (18)F-FDG PET/CT were 42.9%, 59.7%, 29.3%, 78.2%, and 57.3%, respectively. On the CT scan, 18 of 21 recurrent gastric cancers were detected, and 7 cases were in agreement with the (18)F-FDG PET/CT. The sensitivity and specificity of the CT scan were 85.8% and 87.3%, respectively, which are superior to the (18)F-FDG PET/CT. When we diagnosed a recurrence based on either (18)F-FDG PET/CT or CT scans, the sensitivity increased to 95.2% and the specificity decreased to 45.6%, when compared with the contrast CT scan alone.(18)F-FDG PET/CT is an insufficient diagnostic method in detection of recurrence after curative gastrectomy, and even less accurate than contrast CT scan alone.
