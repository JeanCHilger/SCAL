Functional impact of coronary stenosis observed on coronary computed tomography angiography: Comparison with ¹³N-ammonia PET. We undertook this study to evaluate the functional impact of coronary abnormalities in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) by means of integrated positron emission tomography (PET) and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) scan obtained on a hybrid state-of-the-art PET/CT scanner.We studied 29 consecutive, patients with a clinically suspected intermediate risk for CAD, using a hybrid PET/CT 64 slice scanner. During a single scanning session, CCTA was performed for coronary anatomy evaluation, and a rest/adenosine stress (13)N-ammonia PET was performed for myocardial perfusion assessment in 3D mode with CT attenuation correction.Twenty four (82.7%) patients had atherosclerosis detected by CCTA 15 patients had significant (≥50%) coronary stenoses and all 15 patients showed ischemia by PETWe found a strong relation between significant coronary stenosis identified by CCTA and ischemia by PET. However, in cases with low-grade stenosis, PET scan can assess the functional significance of atherosclerotic abnormalities.
