Mechanism of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-mediated regulation of coronary artery contractility. We previously identified glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) as a regulator of vascular smooth muscle contraction. In this study, we tested our hypothesis that G6PD activated by KCl via a phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)-protein kinase C (PKC) pathway increases vascular smooth muscle contraction and that inhibition of G6PD relaxes smooth muscle by decreasing intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) and Ca(2+) sensitivity to the myofilament. Here we show that G6PD is activated by membrane depolarization via PKC and PTEN pathway and that G6PD inhibition decreases intracellular free calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) in vascular smooth muscle cells and thus arterial contractility. In bovine coronary artery (CA), KCl (30 mmol/l) increased PKC activity and doubled G6PD V(max) without affecting K(m). KCl-induced PKC and G6PD activation was inhibited by bisperoxo(pyridine-2-carboxyl)oxovanadate (Bpv 10 Î¼mol/l), a PTEN inhibitor, which also inhibited (P < 0.05) KCl-induced CA contraction. The G6PD blockers 6-aminonicotinamide (6AN
