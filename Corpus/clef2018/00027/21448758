Assessment of coronary endothelial function using PET. Endothelial dysfunction is the earliest abnormality in the development of coronary atherosclerosis. Several coronary risk factors adversely affect endothelial function. Therefore, a finding of endothelial dysfunction may guide interventions for preventing the development of future cardiovascular events. The non-invasive aspects and coronary specificity of measurements of myocardial blood flow (MBF) using positron emission tomography (PET) with sympathetic stress make it widely applicable for the evaluation of endothelial function. PET MBF measurements with sympathetic stress have been applied to a variety of subjects with coronary risk factors and have been shown to have value for risk assessment in these subjects. Endothelial measurement using PET remains an ideal research tool for the study of the pathophysiology of several cardiac diseases. PET is also well suited for the acute and longitudinal evaluation of treatment. Thus, the continued development of this approach for the evaluation of new treatment effects should be expected.
