Myocardial substrate and route of administration determine acute cardiac retention and lung bio-distribution of cardiosphere-derived cells. Quantification of acute myocardial retention and lung bio-distribution of cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) following transplantation is important to improve engraftment.We studied acute(1 hour) cardiac/lung retention in 4 groups (n = 25) of rats (normal--NL, acute ischemia-reperfusion--AI-RM, acute permanent ligation-PL, and chronic infarct by ischemia-reperfusion--CI-R) using intra-myocardial delivery, 1 group using intracoronary delivery (acute ischemia-reperfusion, AI-RC, n = 5) and 1 group using intravenous delivery (acute ischemia-reperfusion, AI-RV, n = 5) of CDCs by PET. Cardiac retention was similar in the NL, AI-RM, CI-R, and A-IRC groups (13.6% ± 2.3% vs. 12.0% ± 3.9% vs. 9.9 ± 2.8 vs. 15.4% ± 5.5% P = NS), but higher in PL animals (22.9% ± 5.2%Acute cardiac retention and lung bio-distribution vary with the myocardial substrate and injection route. Intra-myocardially injected CDCs escape into the lungs via coronary veins, an effect that is more pronounced in perfused myocardium.
