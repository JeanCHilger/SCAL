Migration into food of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) cyclic oligomers from PET microwave susceptor packaging. A quantitative method has been developed to measure the migration of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) cyclic oligomers from aluminized PET susceptor film-type food packaging into several food types. Microwaveable French fries, popcorn, fish sticks, waffles and pizza sold in susceptor-type packaging were purchased in local markets, cooked according to package instructions and analysed for PET oligomers. Appropriate food blanks were cooked in glass containers. Quantities of PET oligomers found in the foods ranged from less than 0.012 micrograms/g to approximately 7 micrograms/g.
