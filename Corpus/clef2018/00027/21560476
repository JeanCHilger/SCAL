Cardiac stem cell therapy for the treatment of chronic stable angina refractory to conventional therapy. State of the art and current clinical experience of the San Raffaele Hospital of Milan, Italy. Cardiac stem cell therapy is a field of scientific research with the goal to translate into clinical benefit the initial findings obtained in basic research laboratories. We have moved into clinical trials in different disease categories: acute myocardial infarction, chronic stable angina refractory to conventional therapy and heart failure. So far we have faced with contradictory results. Some previous studies suggested that bone marrow cell injection may improve myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function in patients with chronic myocardial ischemia.In this paper we present a brief review about stem cell use in clinical cardiology and describe our research protocol evaluating the effects of direct intramyocardial injection of autologous bone marrow cells (CD34+ selected cells versus all mononuclear cells) in patients with chronic myocardial ischemia.Preliminary results show that this procedure seems to be safe and generally well tolerated by patients. An improvement in symptoms, in the first 6 months, appears to be achieved in approximately 50% of patients, with concomitant improvement of quantitative scintigraphic stress test imaging.Before drawing any definitive conclusions, we need to wait for the end of enrollment and unblinding of study randomization.
