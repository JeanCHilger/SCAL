Investigation of myocardial stunning after cardiopulmonary resuscitation in pigs. To investigate cardiac function and myocardial perfusion during 48 h after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), further to test myocardial stunning and seek indicators for long-term survival after CPR.After 4 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation, fifteen anesthetized pigs were studied at baseline and 2 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Hemodynamic data, echocardiography and gated-single photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion images were carried out.Mean arterial pressure (MAP), coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) and cardiac troponin I (CTNI) showed significant differences between eventual survival animals and non-survival animals at 4 h after ROSC (109.2 ± 10.7 mmHg vs. 94.8 ± 12.3 mmHg, P=0.048 100.8 ± 6.9 mmHg vs. 84.4±12.6 mmHg, P=0.011Cardiac systolic and early active relaxation dysfunctions were reversible within survival animals cardiac stunning might be potentially adaptive and protective after CPR. The recovery of MAP, CPP, and CTNI could be the indicators for long-term survival after CPR.
