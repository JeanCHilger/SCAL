Functional imaging of infection: conventional nuclear medicine agents and the expanding role of 18-F-FDG PET. A growing body of literature suggests that 18-fluorine fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET), particularly when combined with CT, is a useful tool for the detection of infectious and inflammatory disease processes. This article will briefly review the data to date on the use of FDG PET in diagnosing musculoskeletal infections and fever of unknown origin, comparing it to conventional scintigraphic techniques in both adults and, when available, in children.
