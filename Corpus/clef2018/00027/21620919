A No Observable Adverse Effects Level (NOAEL) for pigs fed melamine and cyanuric acid. Ingesting melamine adulterated milk products led to kidney stones in many infants in 2008. This differs from the renal failure caused by intratubular crystal formation after co-ingestion of melamine (MEL) and cyanuric acid (CYA) in adulterated pet foods in 2007. To better understand the potential risk of developing crystal nephropathy following co-ingestion of MEL and CYA, we fed 16 weanling pigs 0, 1, 3.3, 10, 33, or 100 mg/kg bw/day of each MEL and CYA, or 200 mg/kg bw/day of either compound individually for 7 days. Crystals were found in the renal medulla and cortex and urine sediments of all pigs fed both MEL and CYA each at 10 mg/kg bw/day (or greater). Crystals were also found in one of the two pigs fed 200 mg/kg bw/day MEL-only. In a 28 day study, 36 weanling pigs were fed 0, 1, or 3.3 mg/kg bw/day of MEL and CYA or 200 mg/kg bw/day MEL-only. Only one of the 3.3 mg/kg MEL and CYA pig kidneys contained crystals. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for pigs fed MEL and CYA for 28 days was concluded to be 1.0 mg/kg bw/day corresponding to 25 mg/kg (ppm) MEL and 25 mg/kg (ppm) CYA in dry feed.
