A naphthalimide fluorophore with efficient intramolecular PET and ICT processes: application in molecular logic. A novel 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide (NDI) with two different metal cation receptors connected at 4-amino or imide nitrogen positions respectively was designed and prepared. Significant internal charge transfer (ICT) as well as photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the receptors to NDI is revealed by the shifted UV-vis absorption spectra and significant fluorescence quenching. Both Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) can coordinate selectively with the two cation receptors in this molecule with different affinities. The coordination of Zn(2+) with the receptor at imide nitrogen hindered the PET process and accordingly restored the quenched fluorescence of NDI. But the coordination of Zn(2+) at 4-amino position blocked the ICT process and caused significant blue-shift on the absorption peak with the fluorescence intensity unaffected. Similarly, coordination of Cu(2+) with the receptor at imide nitrogen can block the PET process, but can not restore the quenched fluorescence of compound 3 due to the paramagnetic properties of Cu(2+), which quench the fluorescence significantly instead. With Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) as two chemical inputs and absorption or fluorescence as output, several logic gate operations, such as OR, NOR and INHIBIT, can be achieved.
