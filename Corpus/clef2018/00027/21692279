Effects of eye acupuncture on SEPCT-determined cerebral blood flow in patients with cerebral infarction. OBJECTIVE To verify the correlation between the points of eye acupuncture and zang-fu function so as to provide the theoretical evidence for the principle of point selection in eye acupuncture therapy.Sixty cases of cerebral infarction were treated with different points according to syndrome differentiation of Chinese medicine.upper energizer area and lower energizer area. Supplementary points: liver area, kidney area and spleen area for hyperactivity of wind, phlegm and fire liver area and spleen area for blockage of wind, phlegm and stasisAfter the treatment with eye acupuncture therapy, the intake ratio of region of interest (ROI) between the lesion area and corresponding area on the opposite side was 0.74 +/- 0.12 before eye acupuncture and was 0.91 +/- 0.08 after treatment, indicating significant statistical difference in comparison (P < 0.05). After eye acupuncture, cerebral blood flow increased apparently.The point selection according to syndrome differentiation in eye acupuncture therapy may increase local brain blood flow in the patients with cerebral infarction and improve the state of brain ischemia so that the correlation can be proved between the points of eye acupuncture and zang-fu function.
