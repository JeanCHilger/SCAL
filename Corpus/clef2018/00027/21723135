Production of glass microspheres comprising 90Y and (177)Lu for treating of hepatic tumors with SPECT imaging capabilities. Our objective was to determine if glass microspheres impregnated with two radionuclides, (90)Y as source of therapeutic beta emissions and (177)Lu as source of diagnostic gamma emissions can be useful for SPECT imaging during or after application of the (90)Y microspheres for treating of hepatic tumors. The glass-based microspheres labeled with (89)Y and lutetium (YAS (Lu)) or (89)Y and ytterbium (YAS (Yb)) were prepared by the sol-gel process where sol droplets directly were formed to gel microspheres. Results of the neutron activation indicate that such a combination of glass, microspheres allow bio-distribution studies by SPECT imaging with high resolution.
