Radiation dose management in CT, SPECT/CT and PET/CT techniques. New imaging technologies utilising X rays and radiopharmaceuticals are continuously under development. The benefit of computed tomography (CT) has been so dramatic that there is a tendency to overuse it and not to place enough efforts into optimisation of the technique. It is also now more and more common to combine two imaging techniques into a single investigation, such as PET/CT and SPECT/CT--the so-called 'hybrid imaging'. The increasing radiation exposure from CT has been of concern for some years and is now receiving increased attention from health professionals, authorities, manufacturers and patient groups. The relatively high radiation doses from PET and SPECT investigations have only recently been discussed. The aim of this article is to provide information on developing technologies and clinical techniques for 3D imaging using ionising radiation and their associated radiation dose to patients and staff. Tools for improved dose management are also discussed.
