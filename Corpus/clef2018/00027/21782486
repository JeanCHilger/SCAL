Presence and impact of the exercise-induced collapse associated DNM1 mutation in Labrador retrievers and other breeds. The impact of the mutation causing dynamin 1 (DNM1)-associated exercise-induced collapse (d-EIC) was determined in a retrospective genetic survey. The frequency of DNM1 mutant allele carriers in Labrador retrievers from conformation show, field trial/hunt test, pet or service lines ranged from 17.9% to 38.0% and the frequency of homozygous mutant (EE genotype) individuals ranged from 1.8% to 13.6% 83.6% of these EE Labradors were reported to have collapsed by 4 years of age. DNM1 mutation carriers and EE dogs with a collapse phenotype were also detected in Chesapeake Bay retrievers, Curly-coated retrievers, Boykin spaniels, Pembroke Welsh corgis and mixed breed dogs thought to be Labrador retriever crosses. The DNM1 mutation was not identified in Golden, Flat-coated, or Nova Scotia duck tolling retrievers, or 15 other non-retrieving breeds. Veterinarians and breeders should be aware that the DNM1 EE genotype is not completely penetrant and that d-EIC is a widespread health concern in several very popular breeds, as well as breeds whose genetic similarity to retrievers is not obvious.
