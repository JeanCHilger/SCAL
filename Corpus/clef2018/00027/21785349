Radionuclide cardiac stress testing. To briefly review the field of radionuclide stress imaging, including recent technologic advances and clinical applications.ECG gating and attenuation correction help increase specificity and accuracy of myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Furthermore, advances in camera hardware and software enable more rapid image acquisition and/or radiation dose reduction. Position emission tomography (PET) and hybrid imaging with computer tomography (CT) are emerging technologies which provide improved image resolution and complementary anatomical data. Nuclear cardiology also demonstrates a wide variety of prognostic applications for a diverse group of patient subgroups. More judicious use of SPECT technology using application of the recently updated appropriateness criteria is encouraged.Radionuclide stress imaging provides essential clinical information and has clear impact on patient assessment and management.
