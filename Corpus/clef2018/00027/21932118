Imaging the islet graft by positron emission tomography. Clinical islet transplantation is being investigated as a permanent cure for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Currently, intraportal infusion of islets is the favoured procedure, but several novel implantation sites have been suggested. Noninvasive longitudinal methodologies are an increasingly important tool for assessing the fate of transplanted islets, their mass, function and early signs of rejection. This article reviews the approaches available for islet graft imaging by positron emission tomography and progress in the field, as well as future challenges and opportunities.
