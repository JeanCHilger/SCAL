Neuroimaging of migrational disorders in pediatric epilepsy. Seizures in children are common and represent a final pathway for a variety of brain insults. Although most children with seizures do not require imaging, when indicated, imaging plays an important role in the clinical workup. Imaging in the pediatric seizure population is reserved for a particular subset of patients depending on factors, such as age of onset, symptomatology, physical examination findings, and specific electroencephalography changes to name a few. The etiologies of seizures are extensive and include disorders of cortical migration and organization. Cortical migration and organization disorders are multifactorial and complex and a major cause of seizure disorders. Although magnetic resonance imaging is the most common imaging modality used to identify the seizure focus, positron emission tomographic and/or diffusion tensor imaging are beginning to provide complementary information about the involved areas. Early and accurate detection is key to better treatment and overall improved patient prognosis.
