Microfluidic technology: an economical and versatile approach for the synthesis of O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([18F]FET). A new synthesis of O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine [(18)F]FET was developed using a NanoTek® microfluidic synthesis system (Advion BioSciences, Inc.). Optimal reaction conditions were studied through screening different reaction parameters like temperature, flow rate, reaction time, concentration of the labeling precursor, and the applied volume ratio between the labeling precursor and [(18)F]fluoride. [(18)F]FET was obtained after HPLC purification with 50% decay-corrected radiochemical yield starting from as little as 40 μg of labeling precursor. Small animal PET studies in EMT-6 tumor bearing mice showed radioactivity accumulation in the tumor (SUV(60min) 1.21±0.2) resulting in an slightly increasing tumor-to-muscle ratio over time.
