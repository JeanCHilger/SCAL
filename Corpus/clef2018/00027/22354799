Diagnosis of intestinal metastases from malignant melanoma. The small bowel harbors metastases of malignant melanoma in 5 % to 72 %,                     dependent on tumor stage and evidence of intestinal blood loss. Capsule                     endoscopy is sensitive in detecting small bowel metastasis. Computed tomography,                     magnetic resonance imaging, and PET-CT demonstrate extraintestinal                     intraabdominal metastases. Melanoma patients with signs of intestinal blood loss                     should be endoscopically investigated, including small bowel endoscopy. Selected                     patients in advanced tumor stage should also undergo small bowel endoscopy to                     plan a treatment strategy. A resection of intestinal metastases can improve the                     prognosis, if all metastases are removed.
