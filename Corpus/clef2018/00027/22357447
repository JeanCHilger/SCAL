Phase I safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic study of the oral phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and mTOR inhibitor BGT226 in patients with advanced solid tumors. This phase I dose-escalation study investigated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (PDs), and preliminary antitumor activity of BGT226, a potent, oral dual phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor.Fifty-seven patients with advanced solid tumors received BGT226 2.5-125 mg/day three times weekly (TIW). Dose escalation was guided by an adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control. Assessments included response per RECIST, [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, and phosphorylated-S6 in skin and paired tumor samples.Three patients (125 mg cohort) had dose-limiting toxic effects (grade 3 nausea/vomiting, diarrhea). BGT226-related adverse events included nausea (68%), diarrhea (61%), vomiting (49%), and fatigue (19%). BGT226 demonstrated rapid absorption, variable systemic exposure, and a median half-life of 6-9 h. Seventeen patients (30%) had stable disease (SD) as best response. Nine patients had SD for â‰¥16 weeks. Thirty patients (53%) achieved stable metabolic disease as assessed by [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography however, no correlation between metabolic response and tumor shrinkage according to computed tomography was observed. PD changes suggested PI3K pathway inhibition but were inconsistent.The MTD of BGT226 was 125 mg/day TIW, and the clinically recommended dose was 100 mg/day TIW. Limited preliminary antitumor activity and inconsistent target inhibition were observed, potentially due to low systemic exposure.
