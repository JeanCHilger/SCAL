The pan-deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat induces cell death and synergizes with everolimus in Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines. The pan-deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589) recently has been shown to have significant clinical activity in patients with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma, but its mechanism of action in Hodgkin lymphoma remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that panobinostat has potent antiproliferative activity against Hodgkin lymphoma-derived cell lines. At the molecular level, panobinostat activated the caspase pathway, inhibited STAT5 and STAT6 phosphorylation, and down-regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1 Î± and its downstream targets, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and vascular endothelial growth factor. Paradoxically, panobinostat inhibited LKB1 and AMP-activated protein kinase, leading to activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) that promotes survival. Combining panobinostat with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (RAD001) inhibited panobinostat-induced mTOR activation and enhanced panobinostat antiproliferative effects. Collectively, our data demonstrate that panobinostat is a potent deacetylase inhibitor against Hodgkin lymphoma-derived cell lines, and provide a mechanistic rationale for combining panobinostat with mTOR inhibitors for treating Hodgkin lymphoma patients. Furthermore, the effect of panobinostat on GLUT1 expression suggests that panobinostat may modulate the results of clinical diagnostic imaging tests that depend of functional GLUT1, such as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.
