Standardising measurement of tumour vascularity by imaging: recommendations for ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. This review analyses the need for, and likely impact of, four subsequent papers which discuss the importance of standardisation of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) when assessing tumour vascularity. This is particularly important when measuring the vascular effects of therapeutic agents in oncological research and practice. As imaging inexorably moves from the subjective interpretative art-form of the past into its modern role as a fully fledged objective scientific discipline, it is incumbent on all radiologists to understand the need for strict adherence to perceived best practice when evaluating lesions as part of trials. Indeed trials may only be funded by pharmaceutical companies and other grant-giving bodies if rigorous adherence to imaging protocols and quality assurance is in place.                         Key Points                      • Various imaging methods can now robustly assess tumour vascular support.                      • US, CT, MRI and PET are increasingly used to assess tumour vascularity.                      • These techniques have reached technical maturity for use in therapeutic oncological trials.                      • Consensus guidelines about using these techniques in assessing tumour vascularity are introduced.                      • Image acquisition protocols and quality assurance must be established for large trials.
