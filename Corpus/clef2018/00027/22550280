Radioiodine scintigraphy with SPECT/CT: an important diagnostic tool for thyroid cancer staging and risk stratification. Staging and risk stratification predicate the postoperative management of thyroid cancer patients, determining not only the need for (131)I therapy or alternative options (conservative management without ablation, surgical reintervention, or external-beam radiation therapy) but also the long-term follow-up strategy. This paper presents the progress made in the field of thyroid cancer imaging by application of SPECT/CT technology to radioiodine scintigraphy in both diagnostic and post-therapy settings and reviews the impact of fusion radioiodine imaging on staging, risk stratification, and clinical management of patients with thyroid cancer. In addition, this paper addresses the role of preablation radioiodine imaging and provides nuclear medicine physicians with the background knowledge required for integrating information from fusion imaging into the clinical and histopathologic risk stratification for developing an individualized treatment plan for patients with thyroid cancer.
