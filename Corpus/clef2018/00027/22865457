Effective photothermal chemotherapy using doxorubicin-loaded gold nanospheres that target EphB4 receptors in tumors. Photothermal ablation (PTA) is an emerging technique that uses near-infrared (NIR) laser light-generated heat to destroy tumor cells. However, complete tumor eradication by PTA therapy alone is difficult because heterogeneous heat distribution can lead to sublethal thermal dose in some areas of the tumor. Successful PTA therapy requires selective delivery of photothermal conducting nanoparticles to mediate effective PTA of tumor cells, and the ability to combine PTA with other therapy modalities. Here, we synthesized multifunctional doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded hollow gold nanospheres (DOX@HAuNS) that target EphB4, a member of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases overexpressed on the cell membrane of multiple tumors and angiogenic blood vessels. Increased uptake of targeted nanoparticles T-DOX@HAuNS was observed in three EphB4-positive tumors both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo release of DOX from DOX@HAuNS, triggered by NIR laser, was confirmed by dual-radiotracer technique. Treatment with T-DOX@HAuNS followed by NIR laser irradiation resulted in significantly decreased tumor growth when compared with treatments with nontargeted DOX@HAuNS plus laser or HAuNS plus laser. The tumors in 6 of the 8 mice treated with T-DOX@HAuNS plus laser regressed completely with only residual scar tissue by 22 days following injection, and none of the treatment groups experienced a loss in body weight. Together, our findings show that concerted chemo-photothermal therapy with a single nanodevice capable of mediating simultaneous PTA and local drug release may have promise as a new anticancer therapy.
