Measurements of regional cerebral blood flow and cognitive performance in Alzheimer's disease. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-HMPAO was used to image 26 patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and 10 healthy controls. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) data indicated a relative sparing of the occipital regions in DAT. Normalisation to occipital flow illustrated highly significant CBF deficits in a number of cortical regions, particularly in the left and right posterior--temporal cortex in DAT compared to controls. The cognitive performance of DAT patients was measured using a clinical cognitive assessment procedure (CAMCOG) and numerous correlations between these scores and rCBF were obtained. The implications and value of this investigative technique are discussed.
