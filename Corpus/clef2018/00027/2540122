Synthesis of 11C-labelled thymidine for tumor visualization using positron emission tomography. A no-carrier added synthesis of [11C]thymidine from cyclotron produced [11C]methyl iodide is presented. The bis-silylated derivative of the lithium salt of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine is treated with [11C]methyl iodide in THF at -50 degrees C giving 20-30 mCi [11C]thymidine in a 40-70% radiochemical yield. Purification is performed by reversed phase chromatography on a C18 column. The whole procedure takes 25 min and the specific activity is about 20-30 mCi/mumol at the end of the synthesis.
