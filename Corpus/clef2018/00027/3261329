Normal and abnormal single photon emission computed tomography of the skull: comparison with planar scintigraphy. Using a rotating gamma camera the normal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) anatomy of the skull was defined in eight subjects. The value of SPECT as compared with planar scintigraphy was assessed in 34 patients with known or suspected disease of the skull. Seven patients had normal planar scintigraphy and SPECT. In 12 of 27 patients with bone involvement SPECT and planar scintigraphy showed essentially the same findings. In 15 patients SPECT was superior to planar scintigraphy. In three of these patients SPECT detected lesions while planar scan was normal. In the other 12 patients SPECT showed better anatomic localization and defined the full extent of the lesion. This was most obvious in patients with involvement of sphenoid, petrous, clivus, maxilla, and zygomatic bones. Our findings confirm the potential of SPECT to detect lesions in deep bones that are overlapped by superficial bony structures that cannot be visualized clearly with planar scintigraphy.
