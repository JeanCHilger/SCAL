Options in camera technology for the bone scan: role of SPECT. Planar imaging with current generation gamma cameras and tomographic imaging with current generation rotating camera single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) systems provide excellent spatial resolution and good fidelity between image quantitation and activity levels. Their use in imaging the localization and clearance of skeletal imaging agents such as the Tc-99m labeled diphosphonates, Ga-67 citrate, and In-111 leukocytes offers a sensitive and accurate means to detect occult disease and to investigate skeletal blood flow, metabolism, and pathology. SPECT progressively plays an increasingly important role in imaging studies of joint disease, infection, avascular necrosis, bone growth, developmental abnormalities and the effects of weight bearing, exercise, and other forms of treatment on skeletal repair processes.
