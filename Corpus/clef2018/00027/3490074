Distribution of textile fibers in the path of a bullet. Twenty-one blocks consisting of 20% gelatin were fired at using firearms of the long rifle caliber .22 and .357 Magnum. The frontal area of these blocks was prepared with textile coverings marked with technetium 99m. Two gunshot series of each type were fired at summer, interseasonal, and winter clothing, using different ammunition. The radioactivity of the bombarded blocks was measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The results of these gun shot series were presented graphically and compared. Initially (at 2 cm depth), high radioactivity is always detected, which among other things is caused by the defilement of the bullet's surface when shot through the textile covering marked by technetium. The higher radioactivity in the middle and deeper block areas is the result of fiber infiltration. Accordingly, there are greater fiber accumulations in the middle and deeper areas of the path of the bullet. This is the case mainly in thinner clothing (summer). Heavier clothing (autumn, winter) presents a greater obstacle for bullets with greater impact as well. Here, only projectiles having a lesser tendency to deform, as well as a high impact, transport a considerable proportion of textile fibers into the deeper parts of the blocks.
