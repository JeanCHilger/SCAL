Pharmacodynamic effect of dipyridamole on thallium-201 myocardial perfusion in progressive systemic sclerosis with diffuse scleroderma. We evaluated the effect of dipyridamole on thallium-201 myocardial perfusion in 23 patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) with diffuse scleroderma. Thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed at rest and after coronary artery vasodilatation with intravenous dipyridamole (0.14 mg/kg/min for four minutes). The left myocardium was divided into nine segments each segment was graded as 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0 (zero represents no activity). Dipyridamole significantly improved resting thallium-201 myocardial perfusion: the mean (SD) number of segments with thallium defects decreased from 6.0 (2.1) at rest to 4.1 (2.5) after dipyridamole (p less than 0.0001)
