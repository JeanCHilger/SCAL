Localization of a cerebellar timing process using PET. We used positron emission tomography (PET) to localize a cerebellar timing function. Six healthy volunteers estimated time differences by comparing a test interval (defined by two tones) with a standard interval. In the timing condition, subjects lifted their right index finger if the test interval was shorter and their right middle finger if it was longer than the standard interval. In the control condition, the two intervals were identical and subjects had to alternate between lifting their index and middle fingers. We examined regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using the standard C15O2 inhalation technique. Comparison of control and rest conditions revealed significant increases of rCBF during the control condition in the inferior parts of the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere, reflecting finger movements. Comparison of timing and control conditions showed additional activations of the cerebellar vermis and hemispheres bilaterally during the timing condition, reflecting the cerebellar timing process. We conclude that the cerebellum is involved in time-critical perception ("timing"). This nonmotor task can be separated from a motor task (finger movement).
