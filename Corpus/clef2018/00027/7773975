SPECT and epilepsy with continuous spike waves during slow-wave sleep. Ten cases of epilepsy with continuous spike waves in slow-wave sleep (CSWS) were evaluated using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in eight patients the EEG paroxysmal abnormalities showed a predominant localization. SPECT carried out using 99mTc-HMPAO allows study of cerebral blood flow (CBF)
