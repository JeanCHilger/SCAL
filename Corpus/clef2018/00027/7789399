Radiolabeling with technetium-99m to study high-capacity and low-capacity biochemical systems. After a brief review of the history of the development of technetium-99m-labeled radiopharmaceuticals, the use of technetium chelates in high-capacity systems is discussed. The latter are used in the study of five organ systems, the kidneys, liver, bone, brain, and heart. The chemical characterization of 99mTc complexes is also reviewed, followed by discussion of the various approaches to the labeling of proteins with direct labeling, the preformed chelate approach, and the antibody chelator conjugate approach. Thereafter, the labeling of biochemicals with 99mTc for use with easily saturated sites, e.g., receptors and enzymes, is considered. Finally, attention is given to factors that affect the preparation of high specific activity, high affinity 99mTc-labeled biochemicals.
