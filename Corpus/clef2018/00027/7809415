Assessment of the cerebrovascular response to acetazolamide using 99mTc-DTPA-HSA: methodological considerations. We have reported methods of assessing the cerebrovascular response to acetazolamide using 99mTc-DTPA-HSA and their usefulness in evaluating cerebral hemodynamics. Several problems of this technique were investigated in 10 normal subjects. Following 99mTc-DTPA-HSA injection, dynamic imaging of the anterior head view was performed for 25 to 50 minutes, and 10 minutes after the beginning of imaging, 1,000 mg of acetazolamide was infused intravenously. Venous blood samples were obtained during the imaging period to estimate the blood retention of 99mTc-DTPA-HSA. Radioactivity in the head increased for about 10 minutes following acetazolamide infusion, then decreased slowly. The declining phase almost disappeared after correction for the blood clearance of 99mTc-DTPA-HSA, indicating stability of the vasodilatory effect of acetazolamide. Dilatation index, the percent increase in activity, was a little smaller after correction, but was closely correlated with the index without correction. There was a high correlation between dilatation indices obtained by two analyses, including ROI setting and visual determination of the peak, of the same data. In conclusion, neither blood clearance of 99mTc-DTPA-HSA nor subjective analysis considerably impairs the reliability of the dilatation index, and blood volume in the head from about 15 to 40 minutes after acetazolamide injection is stable and suitable for SPECT.
