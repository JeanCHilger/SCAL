Crossed cerebellar diaschisis: analysis of iodine-123-IMP SPECT imaging. The aim of this study was to review the etiology of CCD and study factors that affect the development and manifestation of CCD.Three hundred and eleven patients with supratentorial lesions were evaluated for the presence of CCD with SPECT and 123I-IMP. In representative cases, continuous arterial blood sampling was done and rCBF was calculated using Kuhl's method.IMP-SPECT detected an abnormality in 206 patients, of whom 30 had CCD. Of CCD patients, 27 had more than single lobe involvement, 17 had motor impairment, 8 of 11 had rCBF of less than 29.1 +/- 10.9 ml/100 g/min. There was also a significant difference in rCBF between non-CCD and CCD cases.Although CCD can also occur with dementia (mixed or vascular type), it is more common with multilobar lesions. It is also associated with the presence of motor impairment but not related to its severity. It is more likely to develop, however, if rCBF is less than 29.1 +/- 10.9 ml/100 g/min regardless of etiology.
