A method for co-registering three-dimensional multi-modality brain images. A method has been developed for co-registering three-dimensional multi-modality images of the human brain. The interactive program allows users to specify the interhemispheric fissure plane in three dimensions by identifying the endpoints of the centerline within transaxial slices. Translations and rotations within transaxial and coronal planes are determined to align the interhemispheric fissure planes of the two image sets to be co-registered. After reslicing the two partially co-registered image volumes, the intercommissural lines are detected by using three internal landmarks. A transformation including translation and rotation in the sagittal plane finally co-registers the two image sets in three-dimensional space. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images and magnetic resonance (MR) images have been used to validate the method for co-registering three-dimensional functional and anatomic brain images. This new co-registration method requires neither special head positioning procedures nor external fiducial markers, thereby making it appropriate for the routine clinical practice.
