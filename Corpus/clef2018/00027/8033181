Assessment of coronary artery disease by radionuclide cineangiography. History, current applications, and new directions. In recent years, the utility of radionuclide cineangiography in prognostication has made it a mainstay of management decision making. With evolution of therapeutic modalities and concomitant alteration in management strategies, however, the technique and its application are undergoing parallel evolution to optimize response to current needs. Thus, in addition to standard planar rest and exercise assessment of left ventricular function, newer approaches are involving combined perfusion and function assessment, application of pharmacological stress to permit technically advantageous variations in imaging protocols, and application of SPECT technology in collecting blood pool data for tomographic display and analysis.
