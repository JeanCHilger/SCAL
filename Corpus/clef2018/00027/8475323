The detection of age-related decrease of dopamine D1, D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors in living human brain. 1. Using positron emission tomography and 11C-N-methylspiperone and 11C- SCH23390, dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors in human brain were evaluated in living healthy age different subjects. 2. Dynamic analysis of PET data indicated that these receptor binding abilities decreased with aging in healthy humans.
