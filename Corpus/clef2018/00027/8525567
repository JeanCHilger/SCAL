The cat, the flea, and pesticides. Recent advances in our knowledge of cat flea biology and the discovery of new nontoxic control methods have greatly simplified and improved flea control. Instead of relying on adulticides for the bulk of flea control, the veterinarian now focuses on the immature stages, particularly the larvae and the eggs. By doing this, environmentally "friendly" flea control methods are employed that are much safer for the veterinarian, the pet owner, and the cat.
