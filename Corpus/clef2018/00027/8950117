Evaluating organic compound migration in poly(ethylene terephthalate): a simple test with implications for polymer recycling. The safety of recycled plastics for food contact use is largely dictated by the ability of post-consumer organic contaminants to absorb into recycled materials and later diffuse from containers made from recycled plastics into the food supply. Diffusion and solubility data for organic contaminants in poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) are scarce. An approach for determining permeability constants, diffusion coefficients and solubility constants of slowly migrating contaminants in PET is described. Compounds (neat or in admixture) were heat-sealed in packets made from thin (0.00127 cm) PET films. Packets were placed in containers with GC sampling closures. Headspace (volatile compounds) or an external liquid medium (non-volatile compounds) was analysed for emergence of the compound. Diffusion coefficients were determined from non-steady state diffusion equations, permeability constants were determined from steady state permeation, and solubility constants were calculated from diffusion and permeability values. Diffusion coefficients (25 degrees C) ranged from 10(-9) to < 10(-16) cm2/s. The diffusion coefficient of benzene increased dramatically with concentration. Compounds with high permeation increased the transport rate of slower permeating volatiles.
