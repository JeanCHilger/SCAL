Clinical value of 67gallium single photon emission tomography. To evaluate the clinical utility of 67gallium single photon emission tomography (SPECT), we prospectively compared 67Ga SPECT with gallium planar views and with compared tomography in 94 patients with diffuse lung diseases. Differences in the accumulation of gallium between slices and between the left and right sides of a single slice were easier to detect with 67Ga SPECT than with planar views. Three-dimensional information regarding accumulation was also obtained by SPECT. Information regarding active inflammation was more difficult to obtain by computed tomography than by SPECT. Diagnosing diffuse lung diseases will be easier with the introduction of gallium SPECT.
