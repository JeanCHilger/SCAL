Bone SPECT in cholesteatoma assessment. Bone SPECT in cholesteatoma assessment. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a procedure in nuclear medicine which enables bone lesions to be better assessed. Twenty patients with cholesteatoma were studied to assess the efficiency of SPECT in bone lesions produced by cholesteatoma. Every patient also had a middle ear computed tomography (CT) and underwent surgery and anatomopathologic examination. Results obtained by SPECT are compared to CT results. SPECT was positive in 15 cases of which 2 of them with a negative CT for bone erosion. Five cases were false negative, but 2 of them had contralateral ear pathology and in one case bone erosion was not found. We conclude that in some patients SPECT can be a complementary diagnostic procedure in cholesteatomatous bone lesions.
