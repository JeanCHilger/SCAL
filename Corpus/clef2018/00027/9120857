Meaningful relationships in veterinary practice. Although the veterinarian as a person is not traditionally seen as part of veterinary science research, perceptions are changing. The aim of this investigation was to analyse veterinary practice as a social system, by quantifying interaction within the practice. The veterinarians' biographical parameters of gender, residential area, home language, age and type of practice were taken as independent variables and questions regarding the other factors in practice as dependent variables. Relationships were considered to be statistically significant when p < 0.05 using the chi-square test. Results indicated that younger, female, urban, companion animal, English-speaking veterinarians are relatively more aware of their clients' and patients' needs, as well as the interaction between owner and animal. They are more orientated towards financial success and are more aware of opposition practices. They also ascribe more emotional behaviour to their clients. Rural practitioners in mixed or production animal practices, who are predominantly Afrikaans-speaking, saw their clients as more calculating and omniscient and they are more likely to take their clients' financial position into account. The study revealed the necessity of a new human orientation in successful practice management, from a social system perspective.
