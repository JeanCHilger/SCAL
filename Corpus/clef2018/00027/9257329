Radiation dosimetry of [18F] (N-methyl)benperidol as determined by whole-body PET imaging of primates. Radiation absorbed doses due to IV administration of [18F](N-methyl) benperidol ([18F]NMB) were estimated by whole-body PET imaging of nonhuman primates. Time-activity curves were obtained for nine compartments (striatum, eyes, heart, lungs, liver, gallbladder, intestines, kidneys, bladder) by using dynamic PET scans of three different baboons given the radiotracer. These time-activity curves were used to calculate the residence times of radioactivity in these tissues. Human absorbed dose estimates were calculated using the updated MIRDOSE 3 S values and assuming the same biodistribution. Based on an average of three studies, the critical organs were the lower large intestine, gallbladder, and liver, receiving doses of 585, 281, and 210 mrad/mCi, respectively. The brain received a dose of 13 mrad/mCi other organs received doses between 32-77 mrad/mCi. These results indicate that up to 8.5 mCi of [18F]NMB can be safely administered to human subjects for PET studies of D2 receptor binding.
