Emerging treatments in headache. Recent PET studies performed in humans during migraine attacks revealed a 'spreading depression-like' oligemia in the occipital cortex during the aura phase and a region of increased blood flow in the brainstem during the headache phase. Animal models were established to test new migraine drugs. A number of 5-HT agonists, the so-called 'triptans', will be available in future besides sumatriptan to treat acute migraine attacks. Migraine prophylaxis is still hampered by the fact that we do not understand the action of drugs used for this purpose and do not have an animal model. Nevertheless, new substances were introduced recently into the prophylaxis of migraine.
