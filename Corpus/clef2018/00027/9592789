Assessment of malignancy of glioma by positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and single photon emission computed tomography with thallium-201 chloride. The histological diagnosis and proliferative potential measured by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling index (LI) were correlated with preoperative CT and contrast-enhanced, MRI, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) and 201T1 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 43 patients with various grades of glioma. 201T1 SPECT had slightly higher sensitivity to tumours with BrdU LI > or = 5% (showing 10/10) than 18F-FDG PET (7/8 tumours). 18F-FDG PET was better for identifying tumours of BrdU LI < 1% (13/15) than 201T1 SPECT (13/22). Accumulation of 201T1 in the tumour was slightly different from contrast enhancement on CT and/or MRI, and gave "false-positive" results in some low-grade gliomas. However, 201T1 SPECT, which is available in many hospitals and may cost less, provided useful information to supplement that from CT and MRI.
