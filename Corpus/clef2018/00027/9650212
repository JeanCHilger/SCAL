Clinical relevance of I-123/I-131-MIBG scintigraphy in intestinal carcinoid tumors. Of this retrospective study was to determine the value of MIBG-scintigraphy in patients with intestinal carcinoids dependent on histological, clinical, and biochemical parameters.In 15 patients uptake in carcinoid tumors and metastasis was correlated with location of the primary tumor, intra- and extrahepatic tumor masses, histology, immunhistochemistry, neuroendocrinological markers, and clinical symptoms.High uptake was to be seen almost only in tumor masses of primary tumors located in the terminal ileum. There also was a positive correlation with clinical symptoms for carcinoids and urinary 5-HIAA level. No correlation between MIBG uptake and tumor masses, histology, and most of the immunhistochemical and neuroendocrinological markers could be found.There is a limited indication for MIBG-scintigraphy in follow up of intestinal carcinoids. In patient with proven uptake MIBG scintigraphy is suitable for long-term follow up and therapy monitoring.
