The state of positron emitting radionuclide production in 1997. Thirty years ago Michel M. Ter-Pogossian and Henry N. Wagner, Jr. wrote an article that was published in Nucleonics on the cyclotron production of isotopes for biomedical research. In this report we use the Nucleonics paper as the framework to relate their predictions to the current state of the art, we have broken this into four key areas commercially available cyclotrons, costs of operating cyclotron facilities, the emergence of compact accelerators, and the cyclotron production of long-lived radionuclides for therapeutic applications. Companies producing cyclotrons commercially are
