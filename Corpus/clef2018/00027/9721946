Neural activity during attention shifts between object features. To investigate the neural mechanisms involved in shifting attention we used positron emission tomography to examine regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during a task that demands shifting attention between color and shape. Significant activation was observed in the right dorsal prefrontal cortex and parieto-occipital cortex at all frequencies of attention shifts. The frequency of shifts between categories correlated significantly with rCBF in the rostral part of the supplementary motor area and the left precuneus, whereas the number of successive correct responses correlated with rCBF in the orbitofrontal cortex and the caudate nucleus. This study suggests that several prefrontal regions may participate in the processes of shifting attention in different ways.
