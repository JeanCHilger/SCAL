Diagnostic efficacy of myocardial tomographic imaging in the detection of restenosis after coronary angioplasty. To analyze the efficacy of single photon emission tomography (SPET) with 99mTc-compounds for the diagnosis of restenosis of previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).Seventy-one patients (16 women, median age: 60 years, 35 with multivessel disease, 78 arteries with PTCA) with previous PTCA and with coronary angiography performed after scintigraphy were studied. 99mTc-SPET exercise (53 with MIBI and 18 with tetrofosmin) was performed, for clinical reasons, to all patients between one month and 4 years after PTCA. Intravenous dipyridamole was administered simultaneously to 16 patients who had insufficient exercise.SPET sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values and global values were all significantly higher than those obtained with exercise tests (80% vs 63% p = 0.05SPET exercise with 99mTc-compounds is a test with a high efficacy for the diagnosis of post-PTCA restenosis, mainly in patients with one vessel disease.
