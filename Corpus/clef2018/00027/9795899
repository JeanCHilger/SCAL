Seroprevalence of Bartonella henselae and Toxoplasma gondii infections among pet cats in Kanagawa and Saitama Prefectures. Seroprevalence of Bartonella henselae and Toxoplasma gondii was investigated among 471 pet cats obtained from seven private animal hospitals in Kanagawa and Saitama Prefectures during the period from May 1994 to June 1995. 'Furthermore, 67 randomly selected from the 471 serum samples were examined for the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibody and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen. The antibody to B. henselae was examined by an indirect immunofluorescent antibody test. T. gondii, FIV and FeLV infections in cats were detected with respective commercial kits. Of the cat serum samples tested, 43 (9.1%) were found to be seropositive for B. henselae and 41 (8.7%) for T. gondii. The B. henselae-positive rate (12.9%) of male cats was significantly higher than that (5.2%) of female cats. On the other hand, T. gondii-positive rate was 9.1% in male and 8.7% in female cats and there was no significant difference in the positivity between sexes. The positive rate in each hospital varied from 0 to 19.5% for B. henselae and 4.9 to 18.8% for T. gondii. The ages of B. henselae- and T. gondii-positive cats were distributed from < 1-year-old to 14-year-old and the seropositivity increased with age of cats. Of the 67 cat serum samples, 16 and 6 cases were positive for FIV and FeLV, respectively. There was no relationship between these viral and B. henselae infections in cats.
