Absorption of L-DOPA from the proximal small intestine studied in the rhesus monkey by positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) seems to be a valuable method for the understanding of intestinal absorption mechanisms, for simultaneous quantitation of absorption rate and distribution kinetics to the tissues of interest after oral drug delivery. PET was evaluated in three Rhesus monkeys for quantitation of the absorption rate from the gastrointestinal tract and the distribution kinetics into different organs. To obtain optimal standardized conditions for the measurement of absorption the drug was administered via a naso-duodenal catheter directly to the absorption site in the proximal small intestine. l-DOPA was used as study drug given in a suspension together with carbidopa and the radiomarker l-[beta-11C]DOPA. The l-DOPA suspension was given into the duodenum without and after administration of a suspension of six l-amino acids (120 mM) in order to investigate any interaction on the intestinal absorption and distribution of l-DOPA into the liver and brain tissue. Intestinal absorption was in general minor during the first study period and higher together with administered l-amino acids. The somewhat contradictory result with increased absorption when amino acids were present in the intestinal lumen, may be a consequence of increased intestinal motility initiated by the nutrient load.
