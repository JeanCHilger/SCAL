Cardiac 123I-MIBG uptake in idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Patients with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation have no additional structural or functional myocardial abnormalities. However, the inducibility of typical tachyarrhythmias by physical or mental stress or by catecholamine infusion suggests the involvement of the adrenergic system in the pathogenesis of these potentially life-threatening diseases.45 patients with idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia (RVO-VT), 25 patients with idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia (ILVT), 15 patients with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) and 10 age-matched control patients were investigated in this study. Diagnoses were made on the basis of detailed evaluation of the results of two-dimensional echocardiography, left and right ventricular angiography, coronary angiography and endomyocardial biopsy. Local presynaptic norepinephrine re-uptake was assessed using the norepinephrine analog 1231-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), SPECT and semiquantitative 33-segment bull's-eye analysis.Locally reduced 123I-MIBG uptake was found in 27 of 45 RVO-VT patients (60%), 5 of 15 ILVT patients (33%) and 17 of 25 IVF patients (68%). Unlike ILVT patients, RVO-VT and IVF patients had significantly reduced segmental 123I-MIBG uptake of the posterior wall compared with control patients.Patients with idiopathic tachycardia and fibrillation show abnormal 1231-MIBG uptake, which indicates presynaptic sympathetic dysfunction. RVO-VT and IVF patients exhibit significantly reduced 123I-MIBG uptake in the posterior left ventricular wall, whereas ILVT patients do not.
