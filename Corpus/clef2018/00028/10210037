Plasma amino acids in childhood epileptic encephalopathies. Abnormalities in plasma amino acid levels have been noted in patients with various epilepsies, and sometimes also in their first degree relatives. We sought to study plasma amino acid levels in children with epileptic encephalopathies and their parents, relating findings to the pattern of cortical glucose metabolism as determined by 18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). Twenty-eight children with cryptogenic epileptic encephalopathies were studied prospectively. Cortical glucose metabolism was evaluated by FDG PET with combined visual and semiquantitative analysis used to detect focal cortical defects. The plasma concentration of 21 amino acids in the children and their parents was measured by ion exchange chromatography and compared with control values using non-parametric statistical methods. Multivariate analysis was used to assess antiepileptic drug effects. Children were classified as: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome following infantile spasms (six patients) de-novo Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (eight)
