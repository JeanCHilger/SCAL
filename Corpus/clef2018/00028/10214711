A complete remote-control system for reliable preparation of [18F]altanserin. A complete remote control system was constructed for production of the PET 5-HT2A ligand [18F]altanserin by nitro-for-fluoro exchange. Comparing with published methods, the key features include (1) conducting azeotropic distillation and nucleophilic displacement in an open vessel heated by a commercial microwave oven (2) purifying the product by a single HPLC procedure and (3) removing HPLC solvent by solid phase extraction. The preparation took 114 min with 23% yield and high quality.
