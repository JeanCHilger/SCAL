The basis of chronic ischemic reversible left ventricular dysfunction (hibernating myocardium). The term "Hibernating myocardium" refers to the presence of a chronic left ventricular dysfunction that could be partially or completely improved after revascularization. Formerly, the myocardial hibernation was considered to be an adaptive response to a sustained reduction of the resting myocardial blood flow. Recently, several studies with positron emission tomography have revealed a normal or almost normal resting myocardial blood flow. The reduced coronary flow reserve of the hibernating myocardium brings about multiple episodes of demand-induced ischemia and may evoce recurrent stunning of the myocardium. It is the basis of structural changes in the myocardium and the contractile dysfunction. Cellular degeneration rather than adaptation prevails in the hibernating myocardium. The longer the process continues, the smaller is the chance for a complete structural and functional recovery after the reperfusion. Thus the early revascularization becomes important for the patients with hibernating myocardium.
