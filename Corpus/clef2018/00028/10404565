Positron emission tomography in pediatric neurology. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an accurate and relatively noninvasive way of studying brain activity using systemically administered tracers labeled with positron emitting isotopes. In pediatric neurology, it has great scope not only to elucidate the complexities of the developing brain but also to understand disease processes and characterize biological risk factors. Its greatest clinical utility lies in the field of epilepsy where it is used (in patients with intractable partial epilepsy) to localize epileptogenic foci for surgical resection. In addition, functional brain mapping using PET is increasingly being used to reliably and accurately identify speech and sensory-motor areas to minimize postoperative morbidity. PET is also useful in evaluating neurodegenerative disorders and cognitive abnormalities when magnetic resonance imaging scans are unrevealing. The technology continues to progress rapidly through improvements in imaging and radiopharmacology with potential applications in neurooncology, cerebral vascular disease, and metabolic diseases.
