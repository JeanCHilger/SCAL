Comparison of different tracers in the follow up of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. In the follow up of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) several scintigraphic methods are used in addition to the serum thyroglobulin and ultrasonography of the neck. Iodine-131 whole body scintigraphy (WBS), which is performed since many years, is able to detect iodine positive recurrence, lymph node metastases and distant metastases in a very specific way. However, the problem of I-131 WBS is the fact that only 67% of metastases from DTC accumulate iodine. Therefore non specific radionuclides like TI-201 or tracers such as Tc-99m Sestamibi or Tc-99m Tetrofosmin and new metabolic tracers like F-18 FDG were introduced in the diagnostic work up to detect iodine negative metastases as well. This study describes the comparison of different tracers in 35 patients with elevated thyroglobulin and suspicion of metastatic disease or already known metastases from DTC.
