Effects of infusion of glucose-insulin-potassium on myocardial function after a recent myocardial infarction. We studied the effects of glucose, insulin, and KCl infusion (GIK), on regional myocardial perfusion and function by 99m-Tc-tetrofosmin-gated SPECT.We studied 21 male patients with their first uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction (AMI). All patients underwent a rest and submaximal stress before and after 24-hour infusion of GIK-solution (group A) or saline solution (group B).Group A showed better stress tolerance and ischaemic threshold improvement after GIK infusion whilst no statistical differences were found between basal and post-infusion test in group B. At first the stress test in group A, of the 192 segments analysed, 52 (27%) showed reversible perfusion defect. In group B, of 144 segments analysed, 31 (21%) showed reversible perfusion defect. A post-infusion analysis in group A showed a post-GIK end-diastolic significant count improvement in 21 segments, and a post-GIK end-systolic count improvement in 22 segments. In group B, perfusion increase was observed only in 4 segments, whilst systolic thickening increase was observed only in 1 segment.These data demonstrate the efficacy of GIK infusion to improve regional myocardial perfusion and function mainly in segments adjacent to the recently infarcted area.
