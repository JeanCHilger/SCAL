Identification of severe and extensive coronary artery disease by postexercise regional wall motion abnormalities in Tc-99m sestamibi gated single-photon emission computed tomography. Postexercise wall motion abnormality (WMA) in patients with normal resting myocardial perfusion may represent prolonged postischemic stunning, and may be related to the presence of severe angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD). This study assesses the diagnostic value of postexercise WMA by technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with normal resting perfusion. Ninety-nine patients underwent exercise gated Tc-99m sestamibi/resting thallium-201 SPECT and coronary angiography within 90 days of nuclear testing. All patients had normal perfusion at rest. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated an incremental value of wall motion and perfusion over perfusion data alone in identifying severe and extensive CAD. Sensitivity for identifying any severely stenosed coronary artery by WMA was significantly higher than by severe perfusion defect (78% vs 49%, p <0.0001). Overall specificities of severe perfusion defect and WMA were 91% and 85%, respectively (p = NS). Thus, postexercise WMA detected by gated Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT in patients with normal resting perfusion is a sensitive marker of severe and extensive CAD.
