Imaging of soft-tissue sarcomas. A multidisciplinary approach that includes active participation by a radiologist is beneficial for optimal diagnostic evaluation and treatment of soft-tissue sarcomas. Recent advances in diagnostic imaging include a better understanding of the practical roles of ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of primary and recurrent soft-tissue sarcomas. The potential role of positron emission tomography scanning and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of soft-tissue sarcomas has been preliminarily evaluated. The clinically practical utility of radiologic imaging in the evaluation of soft-tissue sarcomas is discussed, and ongoing research is briefly reviewed.
