Development and evaluation of muscarinic cholinergic receptor ligands N-[11C]ethyl-4-piperidyl benzilate and N-[11C]propyl-4-piperidyl benzilate: a PET study in comparison with N-[11C]methyl-4-piperidyl benzilate in the conscious monkey brain. The muscarinic cholinergic receptor ligands N-[(11)C]ethyl-4-piperidyl benzilate (4-EPB) and N-[(11)C]propyl-4-piperidyl benzilate (4-PPB) were developed and evaluated in comparison with N-[(11)C]methyl-4-piperidyl benzilate (4-MPB) in the conscious monkey brain using positron emission tomography (PET). Time-activity curves of [(11)C]4-EPB, unlike [(11)C]4-MPB, showed peaks within 91 min in regions rich in muscarinic receptors. [(11)C]4-PPB showed no specific binding even in the regions rich in these receptors. These observation demonstrated that increases in [(11)C]alkyl chain length could alter the kinetic properties of receptor ligands for PET.
