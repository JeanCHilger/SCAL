Expression of vesicular monoamine transporters, synaptosomal-associated protein 25 and syntaxin1: a signature of human small cell lung carcinoma. Vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) are a prerequisite for the uptake of biogenic amines into intracellular storage organelles, whereas soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs such as SNAP-25 and syntaxin1) are essential for exocytosis of biogenic amines by neurons and endocrine cells. In this study, we examined whether these proteins exist in high-grade malignant small cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs), large cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. We analyzed two established human SCLC cell lines, one adenocarcinoma cell line, paraffin-embedded tumors (SCLC, n = 25
