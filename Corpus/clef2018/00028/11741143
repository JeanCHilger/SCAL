Chromosome painting in farm, pet and wild animal species. Among the advanced karyotype analysis approaches embraced by animal cytogenetics during the past decade, chromosome painting has had the greatest impact. Generation of chromosome specific paints is considered pivotal to his development. Additionally, ability to use these paints across species (referred to as Zoo-FISH or comparative painting) is undisputedly the most important breakthrough that has contributed to our ability to compare karyotypes of a wide range of evolutionarily highly diverged chromosome painting, and makes them aware of the tools/resources available to carry out this research in a variety of animal species. An overview of the current status of comparative chromosome painting results across closely as well as distantly related species is presented. Findings from different studies show how some segmental syntenies are more conserved as compared to others. The comparisons provide insight into the likely constitution of a vertebrate/mammalian ancestral karyotype and help understand some of the intricacies about karyotype evolution. Importance of comparative painting in setting the stage for rapid development of gene maps in a number of economically important species is elaborated.
