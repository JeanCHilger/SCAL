The relationships of left ventricular ejection fraction, end-systolic volume index and infarct size to six-month mortality after hospital discharge following myocardial infarction treated by thrombolysis. We sought to relate left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), end-systolic volume index (ESVI) and infarct size (IS), as measured in a single randomized trial, to six-month mortality after myocardial infarction (MI) treated with thrombolysis.These three prognostic indicators have never been compared in the same study group.Radionuclide angiographic and single-photon emission computed tomographic sestamibi measurements of IS were performed in 1,194 and 1,181 patients, respectively, of the 2,948 patients enrolled in the Collaborative Organization for RheothRx Evaluation (CORE) trial. Ejection fraction, ESVI and IS, as measured by central laboratories in these radionuclide substudies, were tested for their association with six-month mortality.Ejection fraction (n = 1,137 p < 0.0001), ESVI (n = 945Ejection fraction, ESVI and IS measurements performed one to two weeks after MI can each predict six-month mortality. Ejection fraction was superior to the other two measurements. However, this study had limited power to detect independent significance of ESVI or IS.
