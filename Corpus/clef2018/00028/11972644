Significance of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for detection of renal cell carcinoma and immunohistochemical glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) expression in the cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET) is now primarily used in oncological indication owing to the successful application of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in an increasing number of clinical indications. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) is recognized as a major early marker of cellular malignant transformation. The aims of this study were to assess whether FDG-PET is a useful diagnostic tool for renal cell carcinoma and to compare the pathologic characteristics.Nineteen consecutive patients who had renal cell carcinoma were examined using FDG-PET preoperatively. The results of PET were then compared to the histology obtained after radical surgery and the immunoreactivity of GLUT-1 was also studied.Pathologic examination confirmed that all 19 patients suffered from renal cell carcinoma. Increased FDG uptake was found in six of the 19 patients (31.5%). The immunohistochemical examination of GLUT-1 in renal cell carcinoma produced different results in each patient. There was no correlation with GLUT-1 immunoreactivity and FDG-PET positivity.These results suggest that FDG-PET may not be a useful diagnostic tool for renal cell carcinoma.
