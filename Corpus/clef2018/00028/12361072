Evaluation of the pathophysiology of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis using bone scintigraphy. The inflammatory changes in the maxillary sinus mucosa and wall (mucosal and bony lesions) were evaluated to identify the pathophysiology of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis. Out of 80 patients who underwent CT, 32 patients were examined using single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) bone scintigraphy (bone SPECT) with 99mTc-hydroxymethylene-diphosphonate. Mucosal and bony lesions were evaluated morphologically on both images. SPECT data were used to assess the bone activity by calculating the count ratios of the causative alveolar process over the cervical vertebrae. The relationships with clinical symptoms, mucosal changes around the maxillary ostium (ostial lesions), and radiolucencies around the causal teeth (periapical lesions) were assessed. Bone SPECT showing the causal site was valuable for aiding a definitive diagnosis. Mucosal lesions tended to exceed bony lesions horizontally and vertically. Bony lesions tended to extend posteriorly and then anteriorly. The vertical extent of mucosal lesions and the horizontal and vertical extent of bony lesions were correlated with the presence of facial symptoms, ostial lesions, and periapical lesions. Bone activity was significantly correlated with the horizontal and vertical extent of mucosal lesions, horizontal extent of bony lesions, and presence of infraorbital symptoms, ostial lesions, and periapical lesions. Bone activity caused by alveolitis affects the pathophysiology of this disease.
