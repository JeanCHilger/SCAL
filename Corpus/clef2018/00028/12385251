Expression of cre gene in Escherichia coli and bioassay its expression product. The Cre recombinase from bacteriophage P1 can recognize specific DNA sequences, cleave DNA at specific target sites, and then ligate it to the cleaved DNA of a second site. In this study, cre gene was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector via PCR procedure. Then the cre gene was inserted into an expression vector pET-29a and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). A 38 kD soluble protein was expressed and named CRE. CRE was purified by DEAE-52 chromatography. Bioassay of the partially purified product showed that CRE can cleave the plasmid pGLGFP which contains two loxP site with the same direction.
