Chronic thalamic stimulation in a patient with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2. We report on a patient with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA 2) with an unusual clinical presentation, including severe, disabling resting and action tremor and the successful treatment of this tremor syndrome with chronic thalamic stimulation. Using [(123)I]beta-CIT single photon emission computed tomography, we document a marked degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in SCA 2.
