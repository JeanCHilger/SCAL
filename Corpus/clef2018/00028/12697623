Dementia and ageing. Sophisticated imaging techniques are required to characterise the complex dynamic neuro-anatomical changes that occur over time in health and disease. With the advent of potential therapies for the treatment of degenerative dementias, imaging strategies need to enable early diagnosis and facilitate monitoring of disease progression in treatment trials. This chapter highlights some of the innovative structural and functional imaging techniques that have impacted on the clinical management of Alzheimer's disease.
