Epilepsy and surgical mapping. Drug treatment resistant epilepsy is an important public health problem. Patients with epilepsy of focal origin may have an excellent outcome following surgery that removes the source of seizures. Identification of the precise cortical region producing seizures is crucial to a good outcome additionally, identification of eloquent cortical areas near the region to be resected is essential to prevent postoperative neurological deficit. A wide range of imaging techniques is valuable for imaging the epileptogenic zone, including high-resolution T1 MRI, T2 signal quantitation, MR spectroscopy, diffusion imaging, PET, SPECT and simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Eloquent cortex has in the past been mapped using highly invasive techniques
