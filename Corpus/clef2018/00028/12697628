Headache: lessons learned from functional imaging. Most idiopathic headache syndromes are still recognized as vascular headaches although the clinical picture points towards a central triggering cause. The early functional imaging work using PET shed light on the genesis of some syndromes, implying that the observed activation in migraine (brainstem) and in cluster headache (hypothalamic grey) is involved in the pain process in a permissive or triggering manner rather than simply as a response to first division nociception per se. Using the advanced method of voxel-based morphometry (VBM), it has been suggested that there is a correlation between the brain area activated particularly in acute cluster headache, the posterior hypothalamic grey matter, and some change in grey matter in the same region. Moreover, also in a PET study in cluster headache and experimental headache, a vasodilation of major basal vessels has been observed which is non-specific to the cause and most likely the effect of a trigemino-parasympathetic reflex. Taken together, functional neuroimaging in headache patients has revolutionised this area of study and provided unique insights into some of the commonest maladies in man, suggesting that migraine and cluster headache are primarily driven from the brain.
