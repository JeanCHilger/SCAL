Shielding effects of body - shields for 3D PET. We analyzed basic physics characteristics of body-shields which have been considered for screening out radioactivity outside the field of view (OFOV) in positron emission tomography (PET). Phantom experiments were performed with simple rectangular body-shields. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to analyze the experimental results and to simulate cases that were not examined experimentally. It was confirmed that the body-shields effectively reduced unwanted radiations from OFOV radioactivity for one of the latest commercial PET scanners, the ECAT EXACT HR(+). The geometrical conditions were the most important factor in determining the shielding effect. The shield thickness should be large enough to keep the shield-scatter component low. The body-shield should be carefully designed to minimize the gap between the body-shield and radioactive distribution as much as possible to maximize the shielding effects, and to be applicable to clinical diagnoses.
