Multi-resolution registration of MR and PET images based on correlation ratio similarity. An effective MR and PET image registration method designed for clinical use is given in this paper. A new correlation ratio similarity measure for voxel intensity based medical image registration was adopted. Detailed discussion on methods of rigid transformation, resampling, multi-resolution medical image representation and optimization for accelerated multi-resolution registration scheme is also given in this paper. At last, experimental results based on clinical MR and PET medical images show that correlation ratio based multi-resolution registration method works well and is faster than most existing direct voxel intensity based registration methods under clinical scenario.
