The role of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin pinhole-SPECT in breast cancer non palpable axillary lymph node metastases detection. We evaluated the usefulness of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin axillary pinhole (P)-SPECT in breast cancer (BC) non palpable axillary lymph node metastasis detection compared with conventional planar and SPECT scintimammography.We studied prospectively 188 consecutive patients with suspected primary BC, negative at axillary clinical examination. Ten minutes after 740 MBq (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin injection, planar and SPECT scintimammography were acquired, followed by axillary P-SPECT imaging.At histology, 12 patients had benign mammary lesions and 176 had BC. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed in all BC patients, bilaterally in 3 cases: 74/179 axillae had metastases. P-SPECT showed a significantly higher overall sensitivity than SPECT and planar (93.2% vs 85.1% and 36.5%, respectively p<0.05 and p<0.0005, respectively) and was false negative in 5 patients with 1 metastatic node each, micrometastatic in 4/5 cases(99m)Tc-tetrofosmin axillary P-SPECT appears highly accurate in BC non palpable axillary lymph node metastasis detection and significantly more sensitive than both planar and SPECT, its few false negative results predominantly concerning micrometastases moreover, only P-SPECT gave additional important prognostic information. Given its very high NPV, P-SPECT could also be used to better select patients who might avoid ALND.
