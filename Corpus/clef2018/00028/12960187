Imaging proliferation in lung tumors with PET: 18F-FLT versus 18F-FDG. Recently, the thymidine analog 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine (FLT) was suggested for imaging tumoral proliferation. In this prospective study, we examined whether (18)F-FLT better determines proliferative activity in newly diagnosed lung nodules than does (18)F-FDG.Twenty-six patients with pulmonary nodules on chest CT were examined with PET and the tracers (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT. Tumoral uptake was determined by calculation of standardized uptake value (SUV). Within 2 wk, patients underwent resective surgery or had core biopsy. Proliferative activity was estimated by counting nuclei stained with the Ki-67-specific monoclonal antibody MIB-1 per total number of nuclei in representative tissue specimens. The correlation between the percentage of proliferating cells and the SUVs for (18)F-FLT and (18)F-FDG was determined using linear regression analysis.Eighteen patients had malignant tumors (13 with non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC], 1 with small cell lung cancer, and 4 with pulmonary metastases from extrapulmonary tumors) 8 had benign lesions. In all visible lesions, mean (18)F-FDG uptake was 4.1 (median, 4.4(18)F-FLT uptake correlates better with proliferation of lung tumors than does uptake of (18)F-FDG and might be more useful as a selective biomarker for tumor proliferation.
