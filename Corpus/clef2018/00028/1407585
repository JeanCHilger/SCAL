Lateralization of human focal epilepsy by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. We attempted to lateralize the epileptogenic focus (seven temporal lobe hippocampal foci, one frontal lobe focus) in medically refractory unilateral complex partial seizures, using noninvasive 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) blindly and interictally to compare hippocampal or frontal regions. The seizure foci were more alkaline (intracellular pH = 7.17 +/- 0.03) compared with the contralateral region (7.06 +/- 0.02, p < 0.01) in all eight cases the inorganic phosphate was relatively increased (240 +/- 50% of contralateral, seven of eight cases, p < 0.01)
