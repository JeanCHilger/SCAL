In-vitro evaluation and vaginal absorption of metronidazole suppositories in rabbits. Vaginal suppository formulations of metronidazole were prepared using six different bases as Witepsol H15, Cremao, Ovucire WL2944, Ovucire WL3264, PEG 1500, PEG 6000. Three different dissolution methods were used to evaluate the in vitro drug release from the suppositories. The diffusion studies were performed through synthetic (cellophane) and natural membrane (rabbit vagina), but the drug did not show good permeation characteristics from natural membrane. Ovucire WL3264 suppositories of metronidazole labeled with 99mTc (Tecnetium-99m) were used for the vaginal absorption and biodistribution studies in the rabbits. Scintigraphic images were collected after vaginal administration of the labeled suppositories using SPECT gamma fitted with a low energy, high-resolution parallel hole collimator. The labeled drug showed high biodistribution in urine beside vaginal site. The results of this study suggested that the Ovucire WL3264 suppository of metronidazole prepared for vaginal infections could also be effective in the urinary infections.
