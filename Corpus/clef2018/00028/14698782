PET measures of pre- and post-synaptic cardiac beta adrenergic function. Positron Emission Tomography was used to measure global and regional cardiac beta-adrenergic function in 19 normal subjects and 9 congestive heart failure patients. [(11)C]-meta-hydroxyephedrine was used to image norepinephrine transporter function as an indicator of pre-synaptic function and [(11)C]-CGP12177 was used to measure cell surface beta-receptor density as an indicator of post-synaptic function. Pre-synaptic, but not post-synaptic, function was significantly different between normals and CHF patients. Pre-synaptic function was well matched to post-synaptic function in the normal hearts but significantly different and poorly matched in the CHF patients studied. This imaging technique can help us understand regional sympathetic function in cardiac disease.
