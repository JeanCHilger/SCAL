Headache in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: analysis of clinical EEG and neuroimaging studies. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of headache in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), its classification and estimation if they are the symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in patients with SLE causing any pathologies in EEG and neuroimaging methods like SPECT and MRI. We examined 83 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (81 females and 2 males) aged between 19 and 71 years. All patients had neurological examination and EEG complemented with SPECt and MRI in some cases. 65 patients reported headache, 45 of them complained of idiopathic headache and 20--symptomatic one. The group with symptomatic headache had more frequently paroxymal changes in EEG while changes in background activity were more often notified in patients with idiopathic headache. Both SPECT and MRI showed more cerebral pathologies in patients with idiopathic headache. In SPECT the most common were multiple perfusion deficits and in MRI small hyperintensive lesions in white matter of cerebral hemispheres. Headache is the most common neurological complaint in SLE. Headache associated with pathological results of EEG or neuroimaging methods indicate the presence of central nervous involvement in patient with SLE.
