Using 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography in detecting infectious endocarditis/endoarteritis: a preliminary report. We evaluated the effectiveness of positron emission tomography (PET) with 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) in the detection of infectious endocarditis/endoarteritis.For this study, we recruited 6 patients (4 women, 2 men age range, 35 - 78 yearsFor all 6 patients, we also found increased FDG uptakes in the corresponding areas detected in echocardiography.FDG-PET appears to be a promising tool in diagnosing infective endocarditis/endoarteritis, and further prospective studies on a large scale to fully exploit the usefulness of FDG-PET for infective endocarditis/endoarteritis are needed.
