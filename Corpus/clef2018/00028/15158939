Myocardial contrast echocardiography in chronic ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies. The coronary microcirculation is integral in the pathophysiology of both ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. MCE is a unique tool for studying microcirculatory integrity, not only to aid diagnosis and determination of prognosis but also to guide interventions and management. The expanding paradigm of microcirculatory disturbances may in the future also include hypertensive and diabetic heart disease.
