Diagnostic value of cerebral perfusion scintigraphy in evaluation of intracranial arteriovenous malformations--preliminary report. Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) markedly alter the distribution of the regional cerebral blood flow, as they consist of abnormal arteries and veins with no resistance vessels between them. The aim of this study was to the evaluate diagnostic utility of cerebral perfusion scintigraphy (dynamic phase and SPECT) in patients with AVM.Nineteen patients were examined. All the patients had been previously diagnosed with AVM and qualified for intravascular embolization. Brain scintigraphy was performed with 99mTc-ECD and included dynamic phase and SPECT imaging. The regional blood flow was evaluated visually and semi quantitatively, based on comparison between the activity in the two symmetrical regions of interest. Differences higher than 10% were considered significant. Cerebral angiography combined with intravascular embolization was carried out after a scitigraphic examination.Based on angiograms, the diameter of the AVM nidus was estimated and varied from 1.0 cm to 9.0 cm. In 13 cases, AVM were visible in the dynamic scintigraphy as areas of increased tracer activity. In each case, SPECT images showed the AVM nidus as a region of decreased tracer accumulation. Hypoperfusion in the brain tissue adjacent to the nidus was seen in 15 subjects. In one patient cerebellar diaschisis was present. The average ratio of activity in the region of AVM to activity in the normally perfused tissue calculated by semiquantitative analysis was 77.5 +/- 10.9%.Cerebral perfusion scintigraphy (SPECT images and dynamic scintigraphy) allows one to identify perfusion disturbances caused by the presence of intracranial AVM.
