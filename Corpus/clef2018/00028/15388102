New aspects on the preparation of [11C]acetate--a simple and fast approach via distillation. [11C]Acetate, initially developed for nuclear cardiology has gained increased interest also for oncological problems. A conjoint problem of all preparation methods is the high sensitivity of the Grignard-precursor to moisture, demanding long cleaning and drying procedures of apparatus and reaction vials. Our rationale was to simplify and accelerate the preparation of [11C]acetate by the development of an inert, sterile and disposable system. The present publication deals with the remote-controlled preparation of [11C]acetate via distillation into a buffer ready to use.
