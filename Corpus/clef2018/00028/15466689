Lung function at age 3 years: effect of pet ownership and exposure to indoor allergens. To investigate the effect of pet ownership and exposure to indoor allergens on lung function in 3-year-old children.Birth cohort study.Community.Children recruited prenatally and followed prospectively to age 3 years.Specific airway resistance (sRaw) (measured with body plethysmograph) at age 3 years skin-prick testsThere was no effect of cat or dog ownership at birth or age 3 years on lung function, and no association between lung function and mite, dog, or cat allergen exposure. Sensitized children exposed to high levels of sensitizing allergen had significantly poorer lung function (n = 49, sRaw kiloPascal per second [kPa/s] geometric mean [GM], 1.20Pet ownership, sensitization without exposure, or exposure in nonsensitized individuals have no effect on lung function. However, the combination of specific sensitization and exposure to sensitizing allergen is associated with significantly poorer lung function in early life.
