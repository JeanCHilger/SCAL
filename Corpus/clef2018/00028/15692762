Randomized phase II trial of the anti-angiogenic potential of doxorubicin and docetaxel primary chemotherapy as Biomarker Discovery Laboratory. Primary chemotherapy provides an ideal opportunity to correlate potential non-invasive surrogate markers of angiogenesis with tumor microvessel density (MVD) and response.Patients with newly diagnosed stages II or III breast cancer were treated with sequential doxorubicin 75 mg/M2 q2 wks x 3 and docetaxel 40 mg/M2 weekly x 6 treatment order was randomly assigned. Potential serologic and imaging markers of angiogenesis were obtained pre-treatment, at crossover and completion of chemotherapy. Non-invasive biomarkers were correlated with MVD and pathologic response.From June 1999 to October 2002, 70 patients were entered. Median pretreatment tumor diameter was 6.0 cm with clinically involved axillary nodes in 33 (47%) patients 20% had inflammatory disease. Clinical response rate was 91%, including 46% clinical complete responses. Pathologic complete response (pCR) was confirmed in 9 (12.8%) patients. Baseline MVD did not correlate with clinical or pathologic response. Serologic markers were obtained in all patientsSequential doxorubicin and docetaxel is generally well tolerated and highly active. Serum angiogenic factors and imaging parameters frequently varied throughout treatment but did not correlate with MVD or consistently predict response.
