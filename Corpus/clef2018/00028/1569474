Regional metabolic abnormality in relation to perfusion and wall motion in patients with myocardial infarction: assessment with emission tomography using an iodinated branched fatty acid analog. The clinical usefulness of single-photon tomography using both a beta-methyl-branched fatty acid analog, 123I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-methyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) and 201TI was assessed in 4 normal subjects and 28 patients with myocardial infarction. A homogeneous distribution of the tracer in the left ventricular myocardium was observed in each normal subject. BMIPP uptake was decreased compared to 201TI (discordant) in 17/28 patients (61%) and in 49/196 myocardial segments (25%). Such discordant BMIPP uptake was observed more often in areas of acute myocardial infarction (59% at less than or equal to 4 wk versus 31% at greater than 4 wk after onset) (p less than 0.01) and areas supplied with revascularized arteries (74% for revascularized versus 28% for nonrevascularized areas) (p less than 0.01). In addition, the discordant BMIPP uptake was seen more often in the segments exhibiting a wall motion score lower than the perfusion score (46%) in comparison to segments showing a similar decrease in both the wall motion and perfusion scores (12%) (p less than 0.01). Thus, BMIPP imaging may play a major role in increasing our understanding of the relationship between perfusion and wall motion, particularly in patients with acute myocardial infarction and those who received revascularization therapy.
