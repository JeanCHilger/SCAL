The human orbitofrontal cortex monitors outcomes even when no reward is at stake. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) processes the occurrence or omission of anticipated rewards, but clinical evidence suggests that it might serve as a generic outcome monitoring system, independent of tangible reward. In this positron emission tomography (PET) study, normal human subjects performed a series of tasks in which they simply had to predict behind which one of two colored rectangles a drawing of an object was hidden. While all tasks involved anticipation in that they had an expectation phase between the subject's prediction and the presentation of the outcome, they varied with regards to the uncertainty of outcome. No comment on the correctness of the prediction, no record of ongoing performance, and no reward, not even a score, was provided. Nonetheless, we found strong activation of the OFC: in comparison with a baseline task, the left anterior medial OFC showed activation in all conditions, indicating a basic role in anticipation the left posterior OFC was activated in all tasks with some uncertainty of outcome, suggesting a role in the monitoring of outcomes
