The role of 99mTc-tetrofosmin scintigraphy for staging patients with laryngeal cancer. Diagnosis and staging of laryngeal cancer is currently based on physical examination, endoscopy, and imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance (MR) and histology. While imaging techniques have a pivotal role for defining the size of the primary tumor, they are less accurate for defining metastatic involvement of regional lymph nodes, especially if lymph nodes are smaller than 10-15 mm. The aim of this study was to comparatively assess the relevance of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin scintigraphy for the staging of laryngeal tumors versus the CT scan. We evaluated the sensitivity of imaging with (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin in 28 consecutively enrolled patients with squamous cell laryngeal carcinoma. Total-body scintigraphy with 99mTc-tetrofosmin was performed preoperatively, and the results were compared to CT images of the neck and mediastinum. CT and (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin scintigraphy were equally sensitive (96%) in identifying the primary tumor. While CT was more sensitive for detecting metastatic lymph nodes (100% versus 50%), (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin scintigraphy was more specific (100% versus 56% p < 0.04). The overall diagnostic capabilities of the two techniques for detecting lymph node metastases were comparable (Youden Index: J = 0.56 for CT and J = 0.50 for (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin scintigraphy). (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin scintigraphy is a useful complement to CT for staging laryngeal tumors, especially for detecting metastatic lymph nodes and distant metastases.
