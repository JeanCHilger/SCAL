Early detection of tumor response to chemotherapy by 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine positron emission tomography: the effect of cisplatin on a fibrosarcoma tumor model in vivo. We have assessed the potential of [18F]fluorothymidine positron emission tomography ([18F]FLT-PET) to measure early cytostasis and cytotoxicity induced by cisplatin treatment of radiation-induced fibrosarcoma 1 (RIF-1) tumor-bearing mice. Cisplatin-mediated arrest of tumor cell growth and induction of tumor shrinkage at 24 and 48 hours, respectively, were detectable by [18F]FLT-PET. At 24 and 48 hours, the normalized uptake at 60 minutes (tumor/liver radioactivity ratio at 60 minutes after radiotracer injection NUV60) for [18F]FLT was 0.76 +/- 0.08 (P = 0.03) and 0.51 +/- 0.08 (P = 0.03), respectively, compared with controls (1.02 +/- 0.12). The decrease in [18F]FLT uptake at 24 hours was associated with a decrease in cell proliferation assessed immunohistochemically (a decrease in proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling index, LI(PCNA), from 14.0 +/- 2.0% to 6.2 +/- 1.0%
