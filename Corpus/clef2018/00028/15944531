Relationship of transient ischemic dilation in dipyridamole myocardial perfusion imaging and stress-induced changes of functional parameters evaluated by Tl-201 gated SPECT. This study assessed whether transient ischemic dilation (TID) of the left ventricle is related to ischemic stunning, manifested by stress-induced decrease of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and worsening of wall motion, by use of dipyridamole-stress and redistribution thallium 201 gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Ninety-two consecutive patients undergoing dipyridamole Tl-201 gated SPECT were included. Patients with a TID ratio in the highest quartile were defined as having TID. In patients with TID, end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) were both significantly greater on dipyridamole-stress images than on redistribution images (P < .001). The degree of enlargement was much greater for ESV than EDV. In patients without TID, EDV and ESV were both decreased after stress (P < .001). Patients with TID had a lower mean LVEF on dipyridamole-stress images than on redistribution images (P < .001). Patients without TID had a higher mean LVEF on dipyridamole-stress images than on redistribution images (P < .001). Patients with TID had a significant worsening of global wall motion on dipyridamole-stress images than on redistribution images (P < .001), but patients without TID did not.TID was significantly correlated with ischemic stunning, and the enlargement of ESV was an important factor resulting in TID.
