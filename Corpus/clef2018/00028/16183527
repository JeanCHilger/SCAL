Endocrine tumours of the gastrointestinal tract. Management of metastatic endocrine tumours. Gastroenteropancreatic tumours are rare. They compromise a heterogenous class of neoplasm. If there is no hypersecretion syndrome, symptoms may be uncharacteristic and thus diagnosis occurs rather late after the first manifestations of the disease. The most important prognostic parameters are histological classification, the localisation of the primary, the tumour size and stage at diagnosis, and the presence or absence of metachronous or synchronous neoplasia. The article will focus on the importance of each of these parameters for the various treatment options in patients with metastatic disease.
