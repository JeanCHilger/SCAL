Positron emission tomography--usefulness in assessing myocardial viability. Positron emission tomography (PET) using N-13 ammonia and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been used to evaluate myocardial viability in comparison with thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and left ventricular wall motion in comparison with contrast ventriculography. Forty patients with anterior myocardial infarction underwent stress and delayed resting perfusion imaging using Tl-201 SPECT and ammonia PET, a glucose metabolism study using FDG PET, and wall motion assessment with left ventriculography. Out of a total of 600 segments of left ventricular imaging, SPECT demonstrated 197 fixed perfusion defects, 99 with redistribution on delayed imaging and 304 normal segments. Of 197 segments with fixed defects, 24 (12%) were normal and 71 (36%) ischemic according to PET criteria. Nineteen of 28 with infarction and all of 12 with non-Q wave infarction showed a viable myocardium. Left ventricular wall motion was significantly better in patients with normal PET findings compared with those with ischemia or scar on PET. Post-PTCA PET revealed improved ammonia PET in 6 of 11 patients but reduced FDG uptake was noted only in 3. These data suggests that Tl-201 SPECT significantly underestimates myocardial viability and that PET imaging is a promising tool for assessing the presence of salvaged myocardium.
