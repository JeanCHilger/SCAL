Brain natriuretic peptide and cardiac autonomic function in type 2 diabetic patients. The present study tested the hypothesis that increased plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are related to cardiac autonomic dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients. A total of 32 consecutive Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were assigned to either a high-BNP (>or=18 pg/ml) group (n=12 age 57+/-13 years, mean+/-S.D.) or a normal-BNP (<18 pg/ml) group (n=20
