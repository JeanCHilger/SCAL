Conformations and electronic structures of axially coordinated fullerene-porphyrin-fullerene triad (C60CHCOO)2-Sn(IV) porphyrin. The conformational (cis and trans) stability and electronic structures of (C(60)CHCOO)(2)-Sn(IV) porphyrin, recently synthesized as a novel fullerene-porphyrin-fullerene triad linked by metal axial coordination, have been studied by ab initio calculations. The cis conformer was found to be slightly more stable than the trans by 1.38 kcal/mol in the neutral compound. Upon the addition of an electron to the triad, the relative stability of the cis conformer was found to be higher (3.29 kcal/mol) than that in the neutral one. From the investigation of frontier molecular orbitals, for the cis conformer, it was found that the electrons are localized in HOMO of the porphyrin, while the electrons are localized in LUMO of the syn-fullerene. For the trans conformer, it was found that the electrons are localized in HOMO of the porphyrin, while the electrons are localized in LUMO of one of the two fullerene moieties, and the electrons are localized in LUMO2 of the other fullerene moiety, but the LUMO and LUMO2 have the same orbital energy. Thus, the PET may take place unidirectionally in the cis conformer from the porphyrin to the syn-fullerene, while it is bidirectional from the porphyrin to both of the fullerene moieties.
