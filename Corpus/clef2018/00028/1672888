Measurement of D2 dopamine receptor-specific carbon-11-YM-09151-2 binding in the canine brain by PET: importance of partial volume correction. Carbon-11-YM-09151-2 binds highly selectively to D2 dopamine receptors in the brain. Using this ligand, D2 dopamine receptor density (Bmax) and affinity (Kd) in canine striatum were measured. After administering various doses of the ligand in nine experiments, regional uptake was followed by repeated PET scanning for up to 80 min. D2 dopamine receptor specific binding at equilibrium was defined as striatal minus occipital activity after partial volume correction. Bmax and Kd were estimated by Scatchard analysis to be 40.3 pmole/ml of tissue and 22.9 nM, respectively. When a low mass dose of the ligand was administered, the bound-to-free ligand ratio in the striatum at equilibrium was consistent with the Bmax/Kd value obtained from the Scatchard analysis. The present study demonstrates the importance of partial volume correction and the Bmax/Kd measurement in a single PET study with carbon-11-YM-09151-2.
