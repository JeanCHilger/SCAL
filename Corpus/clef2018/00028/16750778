Attenuation correction reveals gender-related differences in the normal values of transient ischemic dilation index in rest-exercise stress sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging. Transient ischemic dilation (TID) has been established as an important independent marker of severe and extensive coronary artery disease (CAD) in myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). The accuracy of the TID index is dependent on a well-determined threshold (normal limits) between normal and abnormal values for each study protocol. To date, the effects of neither gender nor attenuation correction (AC) on TID normal limits have been established. Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine if AC processing changes the normal value of the TID index and if there were gender-related differences in the TID index of normal patients who had undergone rest/exercise-stress technetium-99m sestamibi MPI.Seventy-five patients (33 women, 42 men mean age, 57.7 +/- 11.7 y and 55.9 +/- 10.0 y, respectively) with less than a 5% likelihood of CAD, who had undergone low-dose rest/high-dose exercise-stress Tc-99m sestamibi MPI, were studied. All studies were acquired using simultaneous emission/transmission scans and were corrected for attenuation, scatter, and resolution effects using the ExSPECT II method. Both the AC and non-AC studies were analyzed using the Emory Cardiac Toolbox (ECTbTID normal values for rest/exercise-stress Tc-99m sestamibi MPI are gender-dependent and not affected by AC processing. Thus, diagnosticians should take into account these gender-related differences, as compared with the traditional value generated from mostly male populations, to ensure both men and women have the same overall accuracy of using the TID index in the diagnosis and prognosis of CAD.
