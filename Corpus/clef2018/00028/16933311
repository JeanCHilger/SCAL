Lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel node mapping using a hybrid single photon emission CT (SPECT)/CT system in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. We assessed the added clinical value of fused single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and low-dose CT images compared with planar images for sentinel node (SN) mapping in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).Twenty consecutive patients with newly diagnosed biopsy-proven SCC of the oral cavity were enrolled. Scintigraphy was performed using a hybrid gamma-camera/low-dose CT system. Planar images and fused SPECT/CT images were interpreted separately. All patients underwent a sentinel node biopsy (SNB) followed by a neck dissection. All SNs underwent meticulous pathologic examination and immunohistochemistry staining (cytokeratin complex) in addition to routine pathologic examinations of the neck dissection specimen.The sensitivity for the detection of nodal metastases was 87.5%. SPECT/CT improved SN identification and/or localization compared with planar images in 6 patients (30%).SPECT/CT SN mapping provides additional preoperative data of clinical relevance to SNB in patients with oral cavity SCC.
