Comparative analysis of visual and semi-quantitative assessment of striatal [123I]FP-CIT-SPET binding in Parkinson's disease. We used qualitative visual assessment and semiquantitative measures of striatal DAT binding using [(123)I]FP-CIT-SPET in 85 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We compared these two assessments and their correlation with PD clinical progression. SPET imaging was visually classified by a nuclear medicine physician as normal or abnormal pattern grade I, II and III, in relation to a different degree of radioligand reduction uptake. Nineteen patients presented abnormal grade I (group 1), 53 grade II (group 2) and 13 grade III (group 3). The UPDRS III motor score, the H-Y score, the rigidity and bradykinesia subscores were significantly different among the three groups. Post hoc analysis showed that all values of these clinical parameters were higher in group 3 than in 2 and 1. All clinical indices were also significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1. This means that groups 3 and 2 were clinically more severely affected. No significant differences among the 3 groups were observed for age or duration of disease. Values of the mean striatum uptake were also significantly different among the three groups. Post hoc analysis revealed significantly lower values of the mean striatum uptake in group 3 with respect to groups 2 and 1 values were also significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1. We conclude that our findings of good consistency between visual and semi-quantitative assessment may help simplify the evaluation of striatal DAT binding in PD in a clinical routine setting.
