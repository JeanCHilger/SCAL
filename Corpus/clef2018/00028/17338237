Tentative results of using 99mTC-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile in predicting the effect of preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer. The investigation was concerned with use of 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (99m Tc-MIBI)-assisted prognosis for chemotherapy of locally-advanced breast cancer based on the assessment of 99m Tc retrieval from primary tumor in 26 patients. 99mTc was administered in the course of two-phase scintigraphy of the breast prior to chemotherapy. The dynamics of accumulation and withdrawal from tumor was identified. In view of the absence of any correlation between accumulation and chemotherapy efficacy, one was established between high rates of label withdrawal, on the one hand, and lack of pathomorphosis, on the other, while medium and low rates were associated with marked pathomorphosis in 44 and 50%, respectively (p < 0.05).
