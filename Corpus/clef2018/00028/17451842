National survey of non-small cell lung cancer in the United States: epidemiology, pathology and patterns of care. To determine the epidemiology, pathology and patterns of care for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the United States.In 2001 the National Cancer Data Base, under direction of the American College of Surgeons, conducted a patient care evaluation study in 719 hospitals. We collected information on patient demographics and histories, diagnostic and staging methods, pathology, and initial treatment.Information on 40,909 patients was obtained 93% were smokers. Slightly more than half were older than 70 yearsOur results substantiated the pattern of increasing proportions of women with NSCLC and the increasing frequency of adenocarcinoma. Most patients presented with Stage III or IV disease. Ethnic minorities were more likely to present in late stage disease than Whites. Treatment strategies depended more on stage and age than comorbid burden. Older patients were less likely to receive surgery and more likely to be treated with radiation only or have no treatment.
