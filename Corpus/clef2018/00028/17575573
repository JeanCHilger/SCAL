Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is a sub-type of the heterogeneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma category, and comprises approximately 5% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). It was first recognized as a distinct clinico-pathologic entity 20 years ago, and recent work has further characterized specific molecular features. Gene expression profiling has suggested a partial overlap with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), with which it shares some clinical features. The optimal management remains a matter of debate. There is uncertainty as to whether weekly alternating chemotherapy regimens may be more effective than CHOP, whether consolidation radiotherapy (RT) to the mediastinum is always required, whether PET scanning can be used to determine this, and whether the use of rituximab as part of initial therapy will change the answers to these questions. The International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG) 26 clinicopathologic study of PMBCL, which has recently opened, represents a first attempt to gather data prospectively on some of these issues.
