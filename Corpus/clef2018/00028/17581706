A genetically engineered Escherichia coli, expressing the fusion protein of green fluorescent protein and carboxylesterase B1, can be easily detected in the environment following degradation of pesticide residues. Genetically engineered Escherichia coli, expressing the fusion protein of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and carboxylesterase B1 (CarE B1), was successfully constructed by cloning the genes into the pET-28b vector and then transforming E. coli BL21 (DE3). Expression of the fusion protein was induced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) which could then degrade environmental pesticides and could be easily detected using fluorescence spectrophotometry or by the naked eye in daylight.
