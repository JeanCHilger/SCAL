Effect of Qingre Liqi Granule on clinical therapeutic efficacy, electrogastrogram and gastric emptying in patients with functional dyspepsia. To evaluate the effects of Qingre Liqi Granule (QLG) on clinical therapeutic efficacy, electrogastrogram (EGG) and gastric emptying in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD).Thirty-two FD patients of dyskinesis type enrolled were treated with QLG by oral taking for 6 days. Scoring on 8 kinds of symptoms, including abdominal distension, abdominal pain, morning gastric fullness, belching, regurgitation, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, fasting EGG and the gastric emptying determination were performed using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) before and after treatment.The total and individual scores of clinical symptoms, expect that of vomiting, significantly decreased after treatment (P < 0.05), and the percentage of patients with tachygastria and bradygastria significantly decreased (P<0.01) at the same time. EGG after treatment showed significantly elevated rates of normal slow wave dominant power, and nearly normalized dominant frequency. An increased gastric emptying rate at different phases after 75 min (P < 0.05), and significantly shortened gastric emptying half-time (P < 0.01) were shown meanwhile in gastric emptying detection. The improvement of symptom score and gastric emptying half-time showed significant positive linear correlation (r =0.8929, P < 0.01).QLG can improve symptoms of FD patients by regulating the rhythm and power of gastric electro-wave, increasing gastric motility and enhancing gastric emptying function.
