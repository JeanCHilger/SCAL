Neuroimaging in neuroophthalmology. Recent advancements in the speed and accuracy of data acquisition and resolution of neuroimaging and interventional techniques have revolutionized the early anatomical and functional diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of many neuroophthalmological disorders. The relatively new techniques include magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, computed tomography angiography, positron emission tomography, and functional MR imaging. In this paper the author describes the principles of the current techniques used by neuroophthalmologists and their value in the diagnosis, localization, and treatment of various afferent and efferent visual and ocular disorders.
