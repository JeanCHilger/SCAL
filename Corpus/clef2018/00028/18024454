Bone and soft-tissue sarcoma: preoperative staging with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT and conventional imaging. To retrospectively compare the diagnostic accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), PET, conventional imaging, and combined PET/CT and conventional imaging for tumor staging of bone and soft-tissue sarcomas, by using histologic or follow-up imaging findings as the reference standard.Institutional review board approval was received for this HIPAA-compliant study informed consent was obtained. Integrated PET/CT was performed in 117 patients (69 male patients, 48 female patientsInterpretations based on combined PET/CT and conventional imaging findings correctly staged tumors in 60 (87%) of 69 patients, overstaged tumors in eight (12%) patients, and understaged tumors in one (1%) patient. Overall staging accuracy of combined PET/CT and conventional imaging was significantly higher than that at PET (P < .0001). Combined PET/CT and conventional imaging resulted in correct N staging in 114 (97%) of 117 patients and M staging in 109 (93%) of 117 patients. Combined PET/CT and conventional imaging helped reduce overstaging in three (4%) patients and helped change tumor diagnosis from unresectable to resectable in two (2%) patients compared with PET/CT.The combination of PET/CT and conventional imaging is accurate in preoperative staging of bone and soft-tissue sarcoma.
