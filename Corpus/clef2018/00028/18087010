The role of furry pets in eczema: a systematic review. To systematically search, summarize, and critically appraise the literature to examine whether pet exposure in early life is associated with an increased risk of eczema.We searched MEDLINE (1950 to June 2006) supplemented by citation lists in retrieved articles and contact with researchers. No language restrictions were imposed.Cohort studies were sufficiently similar to allow pooled analysis. Meta-analysis was not possible for cross-sectional studies owing to differences in methods and populations.Incidence or prevalence of eczema.Evidence from longitudinal studies showed that previous exposure to cats (pooled odds ratio [OR], 0.76 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-0.92), dogs (pooled OR, 0.68There was no clear evidence that early pet exposure is associated with increased risks of subsequent eczema. We found some evidence of a possible protective effect of early pet exposure, but this might be explained by avoidance behavior in high-risk families.
