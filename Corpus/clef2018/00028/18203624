Cortical metabolic changes in the cerebellar variant of multiple system atrophy: a voxel-based FDG-PET study in 41 patients. In addition to neuronal loss in the cerebellum and basal ganglia, recent imaging studies have suggested that cortical involvement may be more extensive in patients with MSA. In this study, we focused on cortical metabolic patterns in 41 patients with MSA-C and 30 controls, using statistical parametric mapping analysis to evaluate whether metabolic derangement in MSA-C patients involved the cortical area and correlated cerebral metabolism with clinical parameters. In patients with MSA-C, SPM analysis revealed that, apart from the expected reduction of FDG-uptake in brainstem-cerebellar area, there was a significant hypometabolism in widespread frontal cortex, including inferior orbitofrontal, rectus, middle and superior frontal, and superior mesiofrontal extending to cingulum, and left inferior parietal cortex. In a subgroup analysis of MSA-C patients, metabolic derangement in the cerebral cortex was visible even in the early stages of MSA-C. In advanced stages, the metabolic derangement tended to evolve into the rostral brainstem and into other cortical areas, including left inferior frontal cortex and right inferior orbitofrontal, right anterior and middle cingulate, and anterior portion of superior mesiofrontal gyri. In correlation analysis, reduced FDG-uptake in orbitofrontal area was most significantly correlated with disease severity and duration, followed by the medial frontal, the dorsal portion of the midbrain, and the cerebellum. Our study demonstrated that there were widespread areas of decreased metabolism in the cerebral cortex and, as the disease progressed, the pattern of metabolic derangement tended to evolve into other frontal areas without significant changes in cerebellar metabolism, suggesting that reduced FDG-uptake in cortical area may be associated with the primary disease process.
