Beyond FDG: novel PET tracers for cancer imaging. Despite the excellent clinical performance of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a cancer-imaging agent for positron emission tomography (PET), false positive and false negative results can be problematic in some clinical settings. Radiopharmaceutical development has recently focussed on the search for new PET tracers that could complement or replace FDG in such settings. Due to the general availability and favourable physical properties of fluorine-18, much effort has been directed to fluorinated compounds. The most promising of these are discussed.
