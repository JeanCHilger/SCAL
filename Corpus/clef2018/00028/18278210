Whole-body imaging of oncologic patients using 16-channel PET-CT. Evaluation of an i.v. contrast enhanced MDCT protocol. This study evaluated a MDCT protocol for contrast-enhanced 16-channel PET-CT with regard to scan range and duration of a whole-body (18)F-FDG PET-CT examination, the occurrence of contrast-material induced artefacts and quantitative assessment of CT attenuation.205 patients (51.9+/-12.4 years) with different malignant tumours underwent whole-body PET-CT the study protocol had been approved by the institutional review board. Contrast-enhanced MDCT (16 x 1.5 mmAttenuation corrected PET images were free of contrast media-related image artefacts. Homogeneous contrast enhancement was found in the mediastinal veins (right/left jv 171+/-34/171+/-35, scv 127+/-50/127+/-40, vcs 153+/-36 HU) and arteries (e.g. ap 145+/-26/151+/-26). Cardiac chambers, abdominal vessels (e.g. vci 138+/-24, pv 159+/-25 HU), and parenchymal organs revealed sufficient and homogenous contrast-enhancement in all cases. No beam-hardening artefacts occurred in the neighbourhood of the subclavian veins.The chosen whole-body (18)F-FDG 16-slice PET-CT protocol allowed for craniocaudal CT scanning with high vessel and parenchymal contrast revealing no IV contrast-media induced artefacts in attenuation-corrected PET data sets.
