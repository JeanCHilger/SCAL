Determinants of final infarct size and incidence of aborted infarction in patients treated with primary coronary intervention and adjunctive abciximab therapy. Assess the determinants of final infarct size in patients successfully treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and abciximab therapy and check whether infarct abortion may occur.In 208 patients we examined the parameters that predict final infarct size and the incidence of aborted infarction, defined by completely normal perfusion and regional wall motion plus >50% left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) acquired at one month.In linear regression analysis, sex (p<0.0001), high cholesterol (p<0.05), Killip class (p<0.0001), symptom-to-reperfusion time (p<0.001), admission ST segment elevation (p<0.0001), infarct related artery (p<0.05), and pre-procedural TIMI flow (p<0.002) were significant univariate predictors of final infarct size. In multiple linear regression analysis, symptom-to-reperfusion time (p<0.001), Killip class (p<0.0001), ST segment elevation (p<0.003), and sex (p<0.03) remained significant predictors, model R(2)=0.53. Aborted infarction was registered in 32 patients, more frequently female (59% versus 21%, p<0.00001), older (p<0.02), with larger prevalence of TIMI grade 3 (p<0.05) and lower ST segment elevation at admission (p<0.05).Sex, reperfusion delay, and initial infarct severity as indicated by Killip class and/or ST segment elevation appear the determinants of final infarct size in patients treated with primary PCI. The presence of aborted infarction seems related to the same factors and to preserved TIMI 3 flow.
