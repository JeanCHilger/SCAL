The mediating effect of pet attachment support between loneliness and general health in older females living in the community. The relationship between loneliness and general health was investigated in 159 older females living in the community. Pet attachment support, a variable tested as a mediator of this relationship, was examined also. Participants completed the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale, a Pet Attachment scale, and the Psychological General Well-Being Schedule: general health subscale. A negative relationship between loneliness and general health decreased when controlling for pet attachment support as a coping mechanism. The findings from this study support that pet attachment support has a mediating effect on the relationship between loneliness and general health in this sample of older females. Implications for community health nurses and public policy are discussed.
