Interactions of guanine and guanosine hydrates with quinones: a laser flash photolysis and magnetic field effect study. Laser flash photolysis and an external magnetic field have been used to study the interaction of two quinone molecules, namely, 9,10-anthraquinone (AQ) and 2-methyl 1,4-naphthoquinone, commonly known as menadione (MQ), with one of the DNA bases, guanine (G) and its nucleoside guanosine hydrate (dG). In organic homogeneous medium, it has been observed that G undergoes a predominant hydrogen (H) abstraction reaction with both the quinones while dG supports photoinduced electron transfer (PET) along with H abstraction. On the other hand, in SDS medium, G supports PET with AQ but not with MQ. However, behavior of dG remains unperturbed toward AQ and MQ with the change in medium. All of these observations have been explained on the basis of stabilization of radical ion pair and difference in size of the quinones, which can affect the distance of approach among the interacting molecules.
