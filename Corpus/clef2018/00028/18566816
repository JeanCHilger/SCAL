Does 18F-FDG PET/CT add diagnostic accuracy in incidentally identified non-secreting adrenal tumours? The widespread use of high-resolution cross-sectional imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the investigation of the abdomen is associated with an increasing detection of incidental adrenal masses. We evaluated the ability of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography to distinguish benign from malignant adrenal masses when CT or MRI results had been inconclusive.We included only patients with no evidence of hormonal hypersecretion and no personal history of cancer or in whom previously diagnosed cancer was in prolonged remission. PET/CT scans were acquired after 90 min (mean, range 60-140 min) after FDG injection. The visual interpretation, maximum standardised uptake values (SUVmax) and adrenal compared to liver uptake ratio were correlated with the final histological diagnosis or clinico-radiological follow-up when surgery had not been performed.Thirty-seven patients with 41 adrenal masses were prospectively evaluated. The final diagnosis was 12 malignant, 17 benign tumours, and 12 tumours classified as benign on follow-up. The visual interpretation was more accurate than SUVmax alone, tumour diameter or unenhanced density, with a sensitivity of 100% (12/12), a specificity of 86% (25/29) and a negative predictive value of 100% (25/25). The use of 1.8 as the threshold for tumour/liver SUVmax ratio, retrospectively established, demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity.FDG PET/CT accurately characterises adrenal tumours, with an excellent sensitivity and negative predictive values. Thus, a negative PET may predict a benign tumour that would potentially prevent the need for surgery of adrenal tumours with inconclusive conventional imaging.
