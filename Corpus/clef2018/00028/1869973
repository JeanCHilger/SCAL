Positron tomographic assessment of 16 alpha-[18F] fluoro-17 beta-estradiol uptake in metastatic breast carcinoma. The positron-emitting estrogenic steroid 16 alpha-[18F]fluoro-17 beta-estradiol (FES) has been shown to exhibit selective uptake in primary breast carcinomas the uptake of tracer by positron emission tomography (PET) is strongly correlated with the tumor estrogen-receptor concentration. We have now extended the use of this radiopharmaceutical for imaging of metastases of breast carcinoma by PET in 16 patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease. Increased uptake of FES was identified on PET images in 53 of 57 metastatic lesions (93%)
