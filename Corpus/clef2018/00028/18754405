Endothelial function assessment by positron emission tomography in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Hypercholesterolemia prompts to endothelial dysfunction (ED) and ED predisposes to atherogenesis. ED appears early in the course of atherogenesis and it is considered a coronary artery disease (CAD) marker.To assess endothelial function (EF) using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in asymptomatic patients with recent dyslipidemia diagnosis and without history of ischemic heart disease and previous hypolipemiant treatment.Fourteen asymptomatic patients with recent dyslipidemia diagnosis (< 6 months) were studied by obtaining a lipid profile, blood glucose, and a three phase 13N-ammonia PET scan: rest, cold pressor test (CPT) and pharmacologic stress with adenosine. EF was assessed by calculating the coronary flow reserve (CFR), endothelial-dependant vasodilatation index (EDVI), and coronary blood flow increase percentage in CPT (% Delta CF).79% of patients with dyslipidemia had ED and all their values were lower than those previously published as normal: rest coronary flow 0.44 +/- 0.12 vs 0.57 +/- 0.147 (p = 0.002), CPT coronary flow 0.57 +/- 0.17 vs 0.88 +/- 0.26 (p = 0.001), stress coronary flow 1.24 +/- 0.05 vs 1.81 +/- 0.35 (p = 0.005), EDVI 1.28 +/- 0.25 vs 1.53 +/- 0.24 (p 0.017), CRF 2.79 +/- 0.94 vs 3.15 +/- 0.48 (p 0.198) and % Delta CF 29.08 +/- 24.62% vs 53 +/- 24.60% (p 0.022).Asymptomatic patients in early stages of dyslipidemia showed a greater ED prevalence that was detected by 13N-ammonia PET scan.
