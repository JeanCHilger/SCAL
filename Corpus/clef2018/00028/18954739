Staging and evaluation of the patient with lymphoma. Patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma most often present for medical attention because of signs or symptoms referable to enlarged lymph nodes or other disease-related symptoms (such as fevers, night sweats or fatigue). Less often, enlarged lymph nodes or splenomegaly may be incidental findings during evaluation for other medical issues. Determination of the extent of disease and accurate assessment of responses are necessary for appropriate management. Newer technologies have improved the ability to evaluate patients and to conduct clinical trials, leading to more effective therapies. This article addresses the advances in staging and evaluation of patients who have lymphoma, specifically examining the use of positron emission tomography.
