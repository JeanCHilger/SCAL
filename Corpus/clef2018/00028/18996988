Comparison of thallium deposition with segmental perfusion in pigs with chronic hibernating myocardium. Viable, chronically dysfunctional myocardium with reduced resting flow (or hibernating myocardium) is an important prognostic factor in ischemic heart disease. Although thallium-201 imaging is frequently used to assess myocardial viability in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, there are limited data regarding its deposition in hibernating myocardium, and this data suggest that thallium retention may be supernormal compared with control myocardium. Accordingly, pigs (n=7) were chronically instrumented with a 1.5 mm Delrin stenosis on the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) to produce hibernating myocardium. Four months later, severe anteroapical hypokinesis was documented with contrast ventriculography (wall motion score, 0.7+/-0.8 normal=3), and microsphere measurements confirmed reduced resting flow (LAD subendocardium, 0.78+/-0.34 vs. 0.96+/-0.24 ml.min(-1).g(-1) in remote
