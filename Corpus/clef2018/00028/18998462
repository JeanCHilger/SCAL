Isolation of Id1 interaction protein in human prostate cancer. To isolate the inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (Id1) interaction protein and to determine the role and action mechanism of Id1 in human prostate cancer.The expression vector pET-28a/Id1 was established and used as a bait to prey the interaction protein by pull-down assay.A clear interaction protein band was observed by SDS-PAGE, which was found to be activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) by Western blotting.Id1 may play a role in human prostate cancer by interacting with ATF3.
