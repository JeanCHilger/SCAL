Reactions of tertiary phosphines with alcohols in aqueous media. The phosphines R(2)R'P [R = R' = Me, Et, (n)Pr, (i)Pr, (CH(2))(3)OH Me(2)PhP and MePh(2)P] react with 2- or 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohols, including "lignin-type" vanillyl, syringyl, and alpha-methylvanillyl alcohols, in a 1:1 ratio in aqueous media, to give zwitterionic phosphobetaine products
