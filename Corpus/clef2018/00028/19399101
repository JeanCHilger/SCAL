A prototype hybrid intraoperative probe for ovarian cancer detection. A novel prototype intraoperative system combining positron detection and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging has been developed for early ovarian cancer detection. The probe employs eight plastic scintillating fiber tips for preferential detection of local positron activity surrounding a central scanning OCT fiber providing volumetric imaging of tissue structure in regions of high radiotracer uptake. Characterization measurements of positron sensitivity, spatial response, and position mapping are presented for Tl(204)/Cs(137) sources as well as 18F-FDG. In conjunction with co-registered frequency domain OCT measurements the results demonstrate the potential for a miniaturized laparoscopic probe offering simultaneous functional localization and structural imaging for improved early cancer detection.
