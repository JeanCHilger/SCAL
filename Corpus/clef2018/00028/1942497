Stunned myocardium and sympathetic denervation--clinical assessment using MIBG scintigraphy. To evaluate the clinical relationship between stunned myocardium and the sympathetic nervous system, 6 patients who had stunned myocardium accompanied by T wave inversion underwent simultaneous 123I-metaiodobenzyl guanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy and thallium scintigraphy. All patients showed abnormal filling defects on the MIBG scintigrams in the areas with stunned myocardium but the thallium scintigrams were almost normal. The extent of the defects in these 6 patients was determined on the MIBG scintigrams using a Bull's eye display. The defects were found to be larger than those in 4 patients with angina pectoris, and those in 4 patients who had previously shown T wave inversion but had a normal electrocardiogram at the time of examination. Thus, it is suggested that sympathetic denervation is one of the mechanisms causing stunned myocardium.
