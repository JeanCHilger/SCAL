Evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics in geriatric carotid stenosis pre- and post-carotid artery stenting. To explore influencing factors of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in geriatric carotid stenosis, and to analyze changes of rCBF and clinical symptoms after carotid stenting.During August 2005 and April 2008, 68 geriatric patients of carotid stenosis having SPECT examination in our hospital were retrospectively studied, whose diagnosis was approved by angiography. Correlated rCBF was compared separately in different stenotic degrees of carotid stenosis, in unilateral or bilateral stenosis, accompanied with vertebrobasilar stenosis (VBS) or not, with collateral circulation or not, before and after carotid stenting.When patients of unilateral carotid stenosis were grouped by different clinical factors, cases of patients with reduced rCBF were compared using chi(2) test: the P value was 0.046 and 0.020 when comparing group of stenotic degree 90% - 99% with group 70% - 89% and group 50% - 69% the P value was 0.927 between group accompanied with VBS and group withoutThe research indicates that higher stenotic degree and bilateral carotid stenosis may cause rCBF decrease in geriatric carotid stenosis. Carotid stenting may improve rCBF and change clinical symptoms significantly.
