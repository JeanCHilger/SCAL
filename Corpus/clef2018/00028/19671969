Theoretical analysis and simulation study of a high-resolution zoom-in PET system. We study a novel PET system that integrates a high-resolution zoom-in detector into an existing PET scanner to provide higher resolution and sensitivity in a target region. In contrast to a full-ring PET insert, the proposed system is designed to focus on the target region close to the face of the high-resolution detector. The proposed design is easier to implement than a full-ring insert and provides flexibility for adaptive PET imaging. We developed a maximum a posteriori (MAP) image reconstruction method for the proposed system. Theoretical analysis of the resolution and noise properties of the MAP reconstruction is performed. We show that the proposed PET system offers better performance in terms of resolution-noise tradeoff and lesion detectability. The results are validated using computer simulations.
