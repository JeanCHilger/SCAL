Fragmented wide QRS on a 12-lead ECG: a sign of myocardial scar and poor prognosis. Fragmented QRS (duration <120 ms) on a 12-lead ECG represents myocardial scar in patients with coronary artery disease. However, the significance of fragmented QRS has not been defined in the presence of a wide QRS (wQRS duration >or=120 ms). We postulate that fragmented wQRS (f-wQRS) due to bundle branch block, premature ventricular complexes, or paced rhythms (f-pQRS) signify myocardial scar and higher mortality.Patients who underwent cardiac evaluation with nuclear stress imaging or cardiac catheterization and had wQRS (bundle branch block, premature ventricular complex, or pQRS) were studied. f-wQRS was defined by the presence of >2 notches on the R wave or the S wave and had to be present in >or=2 contiguous inferior (II, III, aVF), lateral (I, aVL, V(6)) or anterior (V(1) to V(5)) leads. ECG analyses of 879 patients (age, 66.7+/-11.4 years male, 97%f-wQRS on a standard 12-lead ECG is a moderately sensitive and highly specific sign for myocardial scar in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. f-wQRS is also an independent predictor of mortality.
