Hybrid SPECT/CT imaging for primary hyperparathyroidism: case reports and pictorial review. The utility of hybrid single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography imaging for primary hyperparathyroidism is both intuitive and becoming increasingly apparent clinically, particularly for patients with prior failed surgery and for those with suspected ectopic adenomas. Second generation imaging equipment, capable of superimposing functional information on highly detailed anatomic images is proving useful in surgical planning, permitting the successful application of minimally invasive techniques. The clinical background and hybrid imaging modality are discussed, together with a selection of illustrative case images. Special emphasis is placed on the use of the technique for imaging ectopic parathyroid adenomas.
