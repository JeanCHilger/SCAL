18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in uterine leiomyomas in healthy women. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and features of increased FDG uptake in uterine leiomyomas in apparently healthy women. The incidence of increased FDG uptake is 0.1% in all 2193 women, 0.5% in women with uterine leiomyoma, and 3.4% in women with degenerated leiomyoma. There was no relationship between the intensity of FDG uptake and the size/site of leiomyoma or the tendency of degeneration in leiomyoma. The women with the increased uptake were not limited at premenopause.
