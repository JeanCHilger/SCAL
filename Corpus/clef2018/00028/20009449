Clinical usefulness of FDG-PET for pancreatic cancer. The purpose of this study was to estimate the usefulness of positron emission tomography (PET) in dividing the uptake with and without the main tumor for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.Ninety-eight patients with primary pancreatic cancer were evaluated with 18F-FDG-PET. For the main tumor, the maximum standardized uptake values(SUVmax)were compared with clinicopathological factors and analyzed. We examined the site of accumulation and the rate of malignancy without the main tumor.For the accumulation of FDG in the main tumor, the high SUVmax level was significantly correlated with T-category in TNM classification (p=0. 003), tumor invasive size (>3 cm) (p <0. 001), CA19-9 levels>100 U/mL) (p=0. 002). The overall survival of the group in which SUVmax was less than 7. 5 was better than that of the group in which it was more than 7. 5 (p=0. 03). Meanwhile, 58 patients (59%) showed the accumulation of FDG except for the main tumor. Lymph node uptake was shown in 44% of them. As for visceral accumulation, the liver was 11, lung 10, pancreas except main tumor 9, thyroid 7, peritoneal wall 3, colon 2, gall bladder 2, and bone 1. As for the rate of malignancy among them, the liver was 100%, lung 50%, pancreas except main tumor 0%, thyroid 29%, peritoneal wall 67%, colon 50%, gall bladder 50%, and bone 0%.We conclude that FDG-PET is a useful tool for predicting the prognosis in pancreatic cancer, and for detection of distant metastases and hidden malignant disease. FDG-PET has an important clinical impact on the selection of proper treatment.
