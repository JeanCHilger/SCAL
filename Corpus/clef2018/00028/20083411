Monte Carlo simulation of the standardization of 22Na using scintillation detector arrays. In order to calibrate PET devices by a sealed point source, we contrived an absolute activity measurement method for the sealed point source using scintillation detector arrays. This new method was verified by EGS5 Monte Carlo simulation.
