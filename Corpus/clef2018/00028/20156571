Effects of low-field magnetic stimulation on brain glucose metabolism. Echo planar imaging (EPI), the gold standard technique for functional MRI (fMRI), is based on fast magnetic field gradient switching. These time-varying magnetic fields induce electric (E) fields in the brain that could influence neuronal activity but this has not been tested. Here we assessed the effects of EPI on brain glucose metabolism (marker of brain function) using PET and 18F 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)FDG). Fifteen healthy subjects were in a 4 T magnet during the (18)FDG uptake period twice: with (ON) and without (OFF) EPI gradients pulses along the z-axis (G(z): 23 mT/m
