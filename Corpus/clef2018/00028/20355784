Quantitative investigation of the photodegradation of polyethylene terephthalate film by friction force microscopy, contact-angle goniometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Studies of the UV-induced photodegradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) have been carried out using contact-angle goniometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and friction force microscopy (FFM). The advancing contact angle of water, theta, decreased following exposure of free-standing PET films to UV light. Measurements of surface friction by FFM showed that the coefficient of friction mu increased as the degradation proceeded, reaching a limiting value after ca 200 min, in agreement with the contact angle data. Using a modified form of the Cassie equation, a quantitative analysis of the extent of modification could be carried out. There was a very close correlation between the coefficient of friction determined by FFM and the value of cos theta. XPS provided more detailed information on surface bonding that also correlated closely with the FFM data. Although FFM provides quantitative data on surface modification with nanometer-scale spatial resolution, it does not provide detailed structural information such as is provided by XPS. The oxygen content at the surface was found to increase as photo-generated radicals within the PET reacted with atmospheric oxygen. Increases in both ester and carbonyl contributions within XPS data accompanied this increase. It was concluded that the photodegradation process follows mainly Norrish type I reaction pathways, following previous work by Fechine et al and Grosstete et al.
