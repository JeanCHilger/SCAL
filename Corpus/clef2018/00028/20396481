Therapeutic effects of caloric stimulation and optokinetic stimulation on hemispatial neglect. Hemispatial neglect refers to a cognitive disorder in which patients with unilateral brain injury cannot recognize or respond to stimuli located in the contralesional hemispace. Hemispatial neglect in stroke patients is an important predictor for poor functional outcome. Therefore, there is a need for effective treatment for this condition. A number of interventions for hemispatial neglect have been proposed, although an approach resulting in persistent improvement is not available. Of these interventions, our review is focused on caloric stimulation and optokinetic stimulation. These lateralized or direction-specific stimulations of peripheral sensory systems can temporarily improve hemispatial neglect. According to recent functional MRI and PET studies, this improvement might result from the partial (re)activation of a distributed, multisensory vestibular network in the lesioned hemisphere, which is a part of a system that codes ego-centered space. However, much remain unknown regarding exact signal timing and directional selectivity of the network.
