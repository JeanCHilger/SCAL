In vivo imaging of cellular transplants. We will talk about the techniques of in vivo imaging currently used in today's research and biomedical field, giving a general view of how each technique works and examples of practical applications of each technique. We will cover fluorescent (BL/CL), PET, SPECT and quantum dot imaging. Afterwards, we will cover how in vivo imaging is used in a biomedical sense more specifically we will see how researchers studying cancer and neurodegenerative disease employ in vivo imaging.
