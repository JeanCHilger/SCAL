Hyperperfusion in primary somatosensory region related to somatic hallucination in the elderly. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of patients with delusional disorder, somatic type (DDST) exhibiting somatic hallucination.Five patients diagnosed with DDST, as well as 20 control subjects, were examined. All subjects underwent technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography. Statistical analysis was performed with SPM5, using a two-sample t-test model to test the regional population effect on rCBF.Patients with DDST had a significant increase in perfusion in the left post-central gyrus and the right paracentral lobule, both of which are involved in somatic sensory processing.Somatic hallucination might be associated with increased perfusion in the primary somatosensory regions.
