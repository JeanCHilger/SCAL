Impact on the Spatial Resolution Performance of a Monolithic Crystal PET Detector Due to Different Sensor Parameters. The performance characteristics of a monolithic crystal PET detector utilizing a novel sensor on the entrance surface (SES) design is reported. To facilitate this design, we propose to utilize a 2D silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) array device. SiPMs are a form of Geiger-Muller mode avalanche photodiodes (GMAPD) that can provide signal gain similar to a photomultiplier tube (PMT). Since these devices are still under active development, their performance parameters are changing. Using a multi-step simulation process, we investigated how different SiPM parameters affect the performance of a monolithic crystal PET detector. These parameters include gain variability between different channels gain instability
