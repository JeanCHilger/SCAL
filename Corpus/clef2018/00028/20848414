SPECT/CT for sentinel lymph node mapping in head and neck melanoma. The additional value of single photon emission computed tomography with CT (SPECT/CT) for detection and localization of sentinel nodes in patients with a melanoma of the head and neck was determined.Thirty-eight patients received conventional lymphoscintigraphy followed by hybrid SPECT/CT. The number of sentinel nodes visualized and anatomic information provided were analyzed. Changes in surgical approach due to additional information from the SPECT/CT were evaluated in 20 patients.SPECT/CT visualized a mean of 2.6 sentinel nodes per patient (range, 1-6). SPECT/CT depicted an additional sentinel node in 16% of the patients and clearly showed the anatomic location of the hot nodes in all patients. The surgical approach was adjusted on the basis of SPECT/CT images in 11 patients (55%).SPECT/CT visualizes more sentinel nodes than conventional images and shows their anatomic location. SPECT/CT is recommended in patients with a melanoma in the head or neck.
