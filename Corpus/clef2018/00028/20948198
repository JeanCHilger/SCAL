CT perfusion with angiography as a substitute for both conventional digital subtraction angiography and acetazolamide-challenged SPECT in the follow-up of postbypass patients. We evaluated the clinical usefulness of CT perfusion (CTP) with angiography (CTA) as an alternative to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and acetazolamide (ACZ)-challenged single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in the follow-up evaluation of hemodynamic changes and bypass patency after bypass surgery in chronic cerebral ischemic diseases.Thirty-five patients who underwent superficial temporal artery/middle cerebral artery bypass surgery for chronic cerebral ischemic diseases were retrospectively enrolled. We assessed the relationship between CTP parameters [cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT), affected-to-unaffected hemisphere (ATU) ratio of perfusion parameters and MTT differences between hemispheres] and SPECT parameters (regional CBF and cerebrovascular reserve) and compared the preoperative CTP parameters with the postoperative ones. For the bypass patency, we compared CTA with DSA.MTT showed the best correlation with CVR of SPECT (r = -0.343 p < 0.001). ATU ratio (r = -0.547CTP performed simultaneously with CTA seems to be a safe and efficient substitute for DSA and ACZ-challenged SPECT in the follow-up evaluation after bypass surgery in patients with chronic cerebral ischemic diseases.
