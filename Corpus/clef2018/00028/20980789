Feasibility and activity of sorafenib and sunitinib in advanced penile cancer: a preliminary report. We describe our experience with sorafenib and sunitinib in the treatment of chemotherapy-refractory advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).Between May 2008 and June 2009, 6 advanced penile cancer patients were treated with sorafenib or sunitinib in our center. All of them had previously received at least two chemotherapy regimens. Tumor responses were evaluated by radiologic assessment and serum SCC antigen change. Immunohistochemical staining of CD34 and Ki-67 was performed in 3 paired tumor tissues before and after treatment.In the 6 patients, 1 partial response and 4 stable diseases were observed. Three patients showed pain response and had an improvement in quality of life. After molecular-targeted therapies, reduction in microvessel density and Ki-67 labeling index was observed in paired specimens. Serum SCC antigen levels were decreased in 5 patients after 1 week of medication. The patient who achieved partial response had an SCC antigen reduction of nearly 95% after treatment with sunitinib. Serious adverse events were fatal infection and rupture of the femoral vessel, which were unlikely related to the medication.The feasibility and activity of sorafenib and sunitinib in our series suggest that this approach may be a promising alternative in chemotherapy-refractory advanced penile SCC.
