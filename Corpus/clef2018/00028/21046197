Identification of the minimal active fragment of the Cry1Ah toxin. cry1Ah1, a novel holo-type gene cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis strain BT-8, encoded a protein exhibiting strong insecticidal activity against lepidopteran insects. To identify the minimal active fragment of the Cry1Ah toxin, 9 pairs of primers were designed to generate different PCR products. Seven PCR products were amplified by different primers using the cry1Ah1 gene as a template and cloned into a pET-21b vector. These positive clones were separately transformed into Escherichia coli. Insecticidal activity against 2nd-instar larvae of Plutella xylostella was performed using the leaf-dip bioassay: the minimal active fragment of the Cry1Ah toxin was located between amino acid residues 50I and 639E.
