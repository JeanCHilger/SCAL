Preliminary study on the correlation between grading and histology of solitary pulmonary nodules and contrast enhancement and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose standardised uptake value after evaluation by dynamic multiphase CT and PET/CT. To evaluate whether the histology and grading of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) correlated with the results of dynamic multiphase multidetector CT (MDCT) and the [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose standardised uptake value (SUV) in 30 patients.Chest x-rays of 270 patients with incidentally detected SPNs were retrospectively evaluated. Thirty patients with histologically proven SPNs were enrolled. On MDCT and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT images, two experts measured the density of nodules in all perfusion phases and the SUV. Net enhancement (NE) was calculated by subtracting peak pre-contrast density from peak post-contrast density. The Pearson test was used to correlate nodule NE, SUV, grading, histology and diameter.Of the 30 malignant SPNs, six were classified as G1 (median NE, 31.5 Hounsfield units (HU) median SUV, 4.8 units), 15 were classified as G2 (median NE, 49 HUThe significant correlation in dedifferentiated (G3) SPNs between NE and diameter (r=-0.834 p=0.00524) supports the theory that stroma and neoangiogenesis are fundamental in SPN growth. The highly negative correlation between NE and diameter demonstrates a net decrease in perfusion despite an increase in dimension. The multidisciplinary approach used herein may result in a more precise prognosis and consequently a better therapeutic outcome, particularly in patients with undifferentiated lung cancer.
