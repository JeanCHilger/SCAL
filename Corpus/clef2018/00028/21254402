Semi-synthetic polysaccharide sulfates as anticoagulant coatings for PET, 1--cellulose sulfate. In the present study, blood-compatible PET surfaces were prepared by coating with anticoagulant cellulose sulfates that were synthesized homogeneously in ionic liquids. The adsorption behavior of polysaccharides on PET films was investigated using QCM-D. It was demonstrated that pre-coating with different amino-group-containing polysaccharides improves the affinity toward cellulose sulfate. Moreover, the effect of different degrees of sulfation on the adsorption process was evaluated. Based on these results, several layer-by-layer coated PET foils were prepared that showed significantly improved blood compatibility compared to the initial untreated material.
