Comparison of FBP and ML-EM reconstruction used by simulation data effect of the projection number for the SPECT image. The influence of the numbers of projection of SPECT exerting on a re-constructed image cannot be strictly evaluated by phantom studies. Therefore, we compared re-constructed images of the FBP method and the ML-EM method by using simulation data.Simulation data was entered in the image processing software, and the projection data that changed the numbers of projection was made. Afterwards, reconstructed images of the FBP and the ML-EM methods were compared with respect to contrast, %COV, and the NMSE value.When the numbers of projection of the FBP and the ML-EM method were decreased, all of the contrast, %COV, and the NMSE value were more deteriorated than that of the ideal image. Therefore, the image quality of SPECT improves with both FBP and ML-EM methods when there are many numbers of projection. Moreover, the FBP method was excellent in a cold contrast, and the ML-EM method was uniformly excellent. Therefore, an understanding of features and their inspection are effective for the selection of each image reconstruction method.
