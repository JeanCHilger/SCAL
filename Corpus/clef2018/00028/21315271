Fully automated SPE-based synthesis and purification of 2-[18F]fluoroethyl-choline for human use. 2-[(18)F]Fluoroethyl-choline ([(18)F]FECH) is a promising tracer for the detection of prostate cancer as well as brain tumors with positron emission tomography (PET). [(18)F]FECH is actively transported into mammalian cells, becomes phosphorylated by choline kinase and gets incorporated into the cell membrane after being metabolized to phosphatidylcholine. So far, its synthesis is a two-step procedure involving at least one HPLC purification step. To allow a wider dissemination of this tracer, finding a purification method avoiding HPLC is highly desirable and would result in easier accessibility and more reliable production of [(18)F]FECH.[(18)F]FECH was synthesized by reaction of 2-bromo-1-[(18)F]fluoroethane ([(18)F]BFE) with dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) in DMSO. We applied a novel and very reliable work-up procedure for the synthesis of [(18)F]BFE. Based on a combination of three different solid-phase cartridges, the purification of [(18)F]BFE from its precursor 2-bromoethyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonate (BENos) could be achieved without using HPLC. Following the subsequent reaction of the purified [(18)F]BFE with DMAE, the final product [(18)F]FECH was obtained as a sterile solution by passing the crude reaction mixture through a combination of two CM plus cartridges and a sterile filter. The fully automated synthesis was performed using as well a Raytest SynChrom module (Raytest, Germany) or a Scintomics HotboxIII module (Scintomics, Germany).The radiotracer [(18)F]FECH can be synthesized in reliable radiochemical yields (RCY) of 37±5% (Synchrom module) and 33±5% (Hotbox III unit) in less than 1 h using these two fully automated commercially available synthesis units without HPLC involvement for purification. Detailed quality control of the final injectable [(18)F]FECH solution proved the high radiochemical purity and the absence of Kryptofix2.2.2, DMAE and DMSO used in the course of synthesis. Sterility and bacterial endotoxin testing following standard procedures verified that the described production method for [(18)F]FECH is suitable for human applications.The routine production of [(18)F]FECH with sufficient RCYs was established by reliable and fast solid-phase extraction purifications of both the secondary labeling precursor [(18)F]BFE and the final product [(18)F]FECH, avoiding complex and sensitive HPLC equipment. The purity of the product was >95%, rendering the tracer suitable for human application. The newly developed purification procedure for [(18)F]BFE significantly reduces the complexity of the automated synthesis unit, hence reducing the cost for routine production in a clinical setup and allowing easy transfer to different synthesis modules.
