2-{4-[-Pyridin-4-yl-1-(2-[ Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are composed of at least 11 families of enzymes that hydrolyze cyclic 3´,5´-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and/or cyclic 3´,5´-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to the corresponding inactive 5´-AMP and 5´-GMP, respectively (1, 2). These second-messenger cyclic nucleotides are formed in response to stimuli (such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and cytokines) to regulate cellular functions. PDEs are essential in the termination of cellular responses
