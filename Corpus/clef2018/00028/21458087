Radiographic and metabolic response rates following image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy for lung tumors. To evaluate radiographic and metabolic response after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for early lung tumors.Thirty-nine tumors were treated prospectively with SBRT (dose=48-60 Gy, 4-5 Fx). Thirty-six cases were primary NSCLC (T1N0=67% T2N0=25%)At median follow-up of 9 months (0.4-26), RECIST complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) rates were 3%, 43%, 54% at 6 weeks 15%, 38%, 46% at 16 weeksSBRT yields excellent RECIST and EORTC based response. Metabolic response is rapid however radiographic response occurs even after 1-year post treatment.
