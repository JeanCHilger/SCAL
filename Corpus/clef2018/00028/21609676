The neural impact of cognitive training. Tracing the connections from brain functions to education is a major goal of modern neuroscience. By providing insights into the abilities and constraints of the learning brain, neuroscience can help to explain why some learning environments work while others fail. The results presented here provide the first insights into neuropedagogy of reasoning.
