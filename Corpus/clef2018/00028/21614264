Incorporating PET information in radiation therapy planning. PET scanning, because of its impressive sensitivity and accuracy, is being incorporated into the standard staging workup for many cancers. These include lung cancer, lymphomas, head and neck cancers, and oesophageal cancers. PET often provides incremental information about the patient's disease status, adding to the data obtained from structural imaging methods, such as, CT scan or MRI. PET commonly upstages patients into more advanced disease categories. Incorporation of PET information into the radiotherapy planning process has the potential to reduce the risks of geographic miss and can help minimise unnecessary irradiation of normal tissues. The best means of incorporating PET information into radiotherapy planning is uncertain, and considerable effort is being expended in this area of research.
