Delineation of glioblastoma, simplicity to complexity, the contribution of imaging. Delineation of glioblastoma is complex. Volumes conventionally defined: gross tumour volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) overlap and are separated according to imagery used. A review of these provides insight into the problem. If the correlations between imaging abnormalities and pathology seem to be relevant, the impact of their use in terms of local control and survival remains to be demonstrated.
