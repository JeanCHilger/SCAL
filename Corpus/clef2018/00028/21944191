Utility of the PET-CT in the evaluation of early response to treatment in the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Preliminary results. To assess the role of FDG-PET/CT performed after the first cycles of chemotherapy in the prediction of response to treatment in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.Twenty patients (mean age: 48 years) were included, 16 initial staging and 4 relapse. All patients underwent PET/CT at 3 times: 1) Baseline, 2) After 1-3 cycles of chemotherapy (early response assessment), and 3) End of treatment (evaluation of final response). Early PET/CT findings were correlated to the end-treatment PET/CT and follow-up. The evaluation of the response was established according to the decrease in uptake of the lesions (SUVmax). In the early assessment, a good response indicator (GRI) was obtained when the lesion disappeared or had more than 50% reduction in SUVmax. At the end of the treatment, a complete metabolic response (CMR) was determined in negative PET scans. Follow-up was superior to 19 months and final outcome was established as progression/relapse or no evidence of disease (NED).At the early treatment evaluation, 16/16 patients of initial staging (100%) and 2/4 of relapse (50%) achieved GRI. At the end of treatment evaluation, 14/16 patients of initial staging with GRI achieved CMR and 1/16 PMR: 14 were alive with NED in the follow-up while 1 relapsed. In the second group, 2/2 patients with GRI achieved CMR (100%): 1 continued with NED in the follow-up and another relapsed.FDG-PET/CT after the first cycles of chemotherapy is useful to monitor treatment due to its high negative predictive value (87.5%), using it to modify treatment early in the non-responders.
