Fungi, pets and their owners. Some parasitic or pathogen fungi for pet skin are possibly transmitted to humans in whom they are responsible for superficial mycozoonoses. Cats, dogs and some small rodents are commonly involved. The lesions correspond to glabrous skin dermatophytoses and to microsporic tinea of the scalp. These disorders represent the vast majority of the prevalent mycozoonoses in Wallonia. Microsporum canis and Trichophyton mentagrophytes are the two fungi that are commonly involved.
