Non-linear mixed effects modelling of positron emission tomography data for simultaneous estimation of radioligand kinetics and occupancy in healthy volunteers. The aim of this work was to develop a model simultaneously estimating (11)C-AZD9272 radioligand kinetics and the relationship between plasma concentration of AZD9272 and receptor occupancy in the human brain. AZD9272 is a new chemical entity pharmacologically characterised as a noncompetitive antagonist at the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5). Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to measure the time course of ((11)C-AZD9272) in the brain. The study included PET measurements in six healthy volunteers where the radioligand was given as a tracer dose alone as well as post oral treatment with different doses of unlabelled AZD9272. Estimation of radioligand kinetics, including saturation of receptor binding was performed by use of non-linear mixed effects modelling. Data from the regions with the highest (ventral striatum) and lowest (cerebellum) radioligand concentrations were included in the analysis. It was assumed that the extent of non-displaceable brain uptake was the same in both regions while the rate of CNS uptake and the receptor density differed. The results of the analysis showed that AZD9272 binding at the receptor is saturable with an estimated plasma concentration corresponding to 50% occupancy of approximately 200 nM. The density of the receptor binding sites was estimated to 800 nM and 200 nM in ventral striatum and cerebellum respectively. By simultaneously analysing data from several PET measurements and different brain regions in a non-linear mixed effects framework it was possible to estimate parameters of interest that would otherwise be difficult to quantify.
