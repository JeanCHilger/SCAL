How do contemporary imaging techniques contribute to basic and clinical rheumatology? Recent major advances in biomedical imaging techniques have allowed us to visualise a variety of previously unseen biological phenomena. In particular, advanced fluorescent microscopy and radioimaging have enabled us to visualise cellular and molecular dynamics in living animals and humans. These new technologies have identified novel therapeutic targets against a wide array of diseases and have provided novel diagnostic tools for the evaluation of several disease conditions. In this brief review, the author outlines the contemporary imaging techniques used in the fields of immunology and rheumatology, with special focus on intravital fluorescent microscopy, and discusses how these cutting-edge methodologies contribute to clinical practice for patients with rheumatism.
