Changes in the maternal cytokine profile in pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction. Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is an important and poorly understood condition of pregnancy, which results in significant fetal, neonatal and long-term morbidity and mortality. The aetiology of FGR is unknown and is likely to result from sub-optimal placental implantation and feto-maternal immunological interaction. The diagnostic criteria for FGR vary between studies, and the condition often occurs with preeclampsia (PET). We present a review of studies of maternal cytokines in FGR and compare these with studies of Small for Gestational Age and PET pregnancies.
