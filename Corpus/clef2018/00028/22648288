Coronary CT angiography after stress testing: an efficient use of resources? Implications of the Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging Consortium (ACIC) results. Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) has matured to be a fast noninvasive imaging test in the evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). It has demonstrated excellent accuracy for defining the presence and the severity of luminal coronary artery stenoses and is probably the best noninvasive test to reliably exclude atherosclerotic coronary disease. Furthermore, accumulating CCTA data indicate that it can identify individuals at risk for all-cause mortality. It is also well known that despite the wealth of data regarding diagnostic and prognostic values of stress testing in CAD, up to 10% of stress imaging studies are considered inconclusive, leading to subsequent invasive coronary angiography for definitive diagnosis often with negative results. Moreover, recent data indicate that up to 30 % of patients undergoing angiography have no significant CAD despite a majority of them having had a prior stress test. Whether CCTA can serve as a cost-effective methodology to invasive angiography has been a source of active research. In this context, we will discuss the implications of the recently published data from the Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging Consortium registry looking at the use of CCTA after stress testing in Michigan.
