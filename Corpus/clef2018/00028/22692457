Dual-time-point F-18 FDG PET/CT for evaluation in patients with malignant lymphoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) dual-time-point (DTP) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with semiquantitative analyses for the initial staging in patients with malignant lymphoma.Forty-three patients had DTP PET/CT, with 60-min and 2-h scan [n = 8, Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) n = 12, indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)A total of 524 lesions were evaluated (406 lymph nodes and 118 extra-nodal lesions). The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) on 2-h delayed scan (SUV(2)) was significantly higher than those on 1-h early scan (SUV(1)) for all groups (P < 0.0001 for HL P < 0.0001 for indolent NHLDTP F-18 FDG PET/CT with a semiquantitative technique may have the potential to provide the more accurate diagnoses for the staging of malignant lymphoma and the more important role in predicting the histological grades of malignancy compared with single-time-point F-18 FDG-PET scan.
