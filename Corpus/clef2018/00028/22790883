18[F]FDG-PET/CT is a useful molecular marker in evaluating tumour aggressiveness: a revised understanding of an in-vivo FDG-PET imaging that alludes the alteration of cancer biology. Molecular imaging employing (18)[F]FDG-PET/CT enables in-vivo visualization, characterisation and measurement of biological process in tumour at the molecular and cellular level. In oncology, this approach can be directly applied as translational biomarkers of disease progression. In this article, the improved roles of FDG as an in-vivo glycolytic marker which reflect biological changes across in-vitro cellular environment are discussed. New understanding in how altered metabolism via glycolytic downstream drivers of malignant transformation as reviewed below offers unique promise as to monitor tumour aggressiveness and hence optimize the therapeutic management.
