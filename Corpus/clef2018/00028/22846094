Essential parameters to consider for the characterization of optical imaging probes. The Molecular Imaging and Contrast Agents Database (MICAD) was launched in 2005 to promote the development and application of imaging and contrast agents (probes) to advance the field of molecular imaging. As of March 2012, there are approximately 1170 agents available in MICAD. Based on the modality used for imaging, the largest category of probes described in MICAD are those used for PET (41.6%), followed by agents used for single-photon emission computed tomography (30.3%), optical imaging (12.0%), MRI (9.3%), multimodality imaging (3.4%), ultrasound (2.4%) and x-ray/computed tomography (1.0%). This article is intended to be a guideline for new investigators and students who wish to characterize an optical imaging probe that will be used to perform in vivo molecular imaging studies. It is necessary, however, to ensure that these agents meet certain quality control parameters before they are used in various in vitro and in vivo applications.
