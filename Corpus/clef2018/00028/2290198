Estimation of I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial washout. A crosstalk from I-123 to Tl-201 (Tl) window was 35 +/- 30% (mean +/- SD) and 30 +/- 10% in a myocardial phantom and the images of 6 patients respectively. However, the crosstalk from Tl to I-123 was approximately 1% in each. I-123 MIBG (MIBG) and Tl myocardial SPECT images were recorded in 3 normal volunteers (N), 10 patients with myocardial infarction (MI), and 4 with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The MIBG and Tl imagings were performed on the other day to avoid the crosstalk. Myocardial washout rates (WR) of Tl and MIBG were derived from 15 min and 4 hour images. WR of Tl was approximately 36% in each group. On the other hand, WR of MIBG in DCM (52 +/- 7%) and MI (41 +/- 14%) groups were statistically higher than in N (24 +/- 7%) group. Thus WR of MIBG would be useful to detect abnormalities in adrenergic nervous system.
