Near-infrared Dye Integrins are multifunctional cell-surface receptors that are implicated in the regulation of cell–cell interactions, angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer metastasis (1, 2). There are 24 known integrin receptors, and each receptor is made up by the combination of a single α subunit (with 18 subtypes) and a single β subunit (with 8 subtypes) (3). A characteristic feature of the integrin receptors is that they can be activated either by cytoplasmic events ("inside-out" activation) or by extracellular ligand binding ("outside-in" activation) as illustrated by Margadant et al. (3). Integrins such as α
