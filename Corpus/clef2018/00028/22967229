The practicality of nanoceria-PAN-based (68)Ge/(68)Ga generator toward preparation of (68)Ga-labeled cyclic RGD dimer as a potential PET radiotracer for tumor imaging. Cyclic RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptides radiolabeled with (68)Ga have great potential for the early tumor detection and noninvasive monitoring of tumor metastasis and therapeutic response. Herein, the preparation of (68)Ga-labeled DOTA-E[c(RGDfK)](2) (DOTA=1,4,7,10-tetraazacylododecane-1,4,7,10-tetracetic acid E=Glutamic acid
