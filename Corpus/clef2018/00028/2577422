Low peritoneal clearances--differential diagnosis and management. The magnitude of peritoneal solute clearance is analyzed in terms of: 1) population mean, 2) preservation during long-term therapy, 3) values obtained with hemodialysis, and 4) requirements to maintain patients free of uremic signs and symptoms. The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) has been used successfully to characterize peritoneal solute transport rates and to formulate more adequate dialysis prescription. Serial PET's can also provide a valuable prognostic index of peritoneal membrane function. The experience with mechanical and physical maneuvers to enhance peritoneal clearance is reviewed.
