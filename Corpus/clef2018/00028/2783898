Multimodality approach to osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head appears to be effective when the disease is identified and treated early. Forty-one patients were evaluated with prospective laboratory assessment, anteroposterior and frog-lateral roentgenograms of both hips, intraosseous pressure measurements (IOP), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 99mTc methylene diphosphonate planar and single-photon emission computerized tomographic (SPECT) bone imaging. Pathologic specimens were obtained in most patients. Preradiographic disease was identified in 26 hips and 11 of these were asymptomatic. Fifteen clinically symptomatic hips had normal plain roentgenograms, but abnormal protocol studies. Evaluation of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value (positive and negative), respectively, in diagnosing osteonecrosis of the femoral head revealed the following percentages: 83%, 83%, 96%, and 48% for planar bone scanning 91%, 78%, 94%, and 70% for SPECT
