Brain morphology and regional cerebral blood flow in anorexia nervosa. Cranial computed tomography (CT) was performed in 12 patients with anorexia nervosa, revealing that the majority of the patients displayed ventricular dilatation and/or sulcal widening. In addition, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured at admission and once again after weight gain, using xenon-133 dynamic single-photon emission tomography (dSPECT). The mean flow rates assessed at the first examination did not significantly differ from those assessed at the second examination and from those of a control group. There was a significant inverse relationship between the size of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces and the cerebral blood flow in the anorectics a decrease in ventricular size after weight gain was associated with an increase in cerebral blood flow in this area. This finding, however, has to be interpreted with caution, as partial volume effects render the flow rates ambiguous in brain areas, which, in addition to neuronal tissue, also include ventricular and sulcal structures.
