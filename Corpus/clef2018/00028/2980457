Blood brain barrier modification and chemotherapy. Interventional neuroradiology in the treatment of malignant gliomas. Postoperative interventional neuroradiology was performed in patients with malignant gliomas to increase target efficacy of chemotherapy. In 8 glioma patients the blood brain or blood tumor barrier was reversibly opened by intraarterial injection of hyperosmolar fluid (Mannitol 25%). One additional patient had primary lymphoma of the central nervous system. During barrier modification chemotherapeutic agents were applied intraarterially and intravenously. A total of 22 blood brain barrier modification procedures have been carried out until now, ranging from one to five per patient. A presently continuing tumor regression or tumor progression free intervals have been noted in 5 patients. Therapeutic effects are being evaluated from repeated computed tomography and single photon emission computed tomography examinations.
