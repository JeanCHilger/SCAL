Single photon radioisotope emission computed tomography image using gamma camera (author's transl). Single photon radioisotope computed tomography (RCT) images were obtained using the following devices such as conventional gamma camera, data processer for exclusive use of nuclear medicine (C.D.S.-4096), magnetic tape and medium size electronic computer FACOM 230-28S (48K) for multipurposes, which are routinely used for clinical purpose. To reconstruct the RCT image we made absorption correction by geometric mean of opposing counts considering the thickness of source and used the convolution integral method. The reconstructed images of phantom study resolved one centimeter clearly and were very similar to original. The RCT image of patient was acquired by the rotation of patients using the revolving chair and the handmade implement which settles the center of patient's head. Three dimensional informations were obtained by one examination with a gamma camera which collects two dimensional images. When using a gamma camera, therefore, not only a transaxial but an arbitraly RCT image will be important to contribute for diagnosis.
