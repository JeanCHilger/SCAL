Dead time correction and counting statistics for positron tomography. A correction for loss of events due to dead time in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) is presented. The model employs a paralysing dead time to describe the behaviour of a tomograph over the range of event rates normally encountered in patient studies (up to 200 000 events/s per detector layer). The Donner 280-crystal positron tomograph has a dead time of 1.8 microseconds/event for observed count rates less than 200 000 events/s. The dead time correction factor is 1.8 at 180 000 events/s. The correction is applied to projection data and region of interest analysis of dynamic PET studies, and formulae for the covariances between corrected projection data and between counts in regions of interest in different images from the same dynamic study are established. At 180 000 events/s, the variance of the actual (corrected) number of events in a region containing 3.34 X 10(5) actual events is predicted from the model to be 3.86 X 10(6) (events)2, more than 10 times the variance that would be expected from a naive assumption of Poisson statistics. These statistical results are verified experimentally. An error of 25% is observed in myocardial flow if dead time compensation is not applied, showing the necessity for this correction.
