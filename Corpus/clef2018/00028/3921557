Regional cerebral blood volume and hematocrit measured in normal human volunteers by single-photon emission computed tomography. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was used for the measurement of regional cerebral blood volume (CBV) and hematocrit (Hct) in normal healthy human volunteers (mean age 30 +/- 8 years). Regional cerebral red blood cell (RBC) volume and plasma volume were determined separately and their responses to carbon dioxide were investigated. Ten right-handed healthy volunteers were the subjects studied. SPECT scans were performed following intravenous injection of the RBC tracer (99mTc-labeled RBC) and plasma tracer (99mTc-labeled human serum albumin) with an interval of 48 h. Regional cerebral Hct was calculated as the regional ratio between RBC and plasma volumes and then was used for calculating CBV. Mean regional CBV in the resting state was 4.81 +/- 0.37 ml/100 g brain, significantly greater in the left hemisphere compared with the right by 3.8% (p less than 0.01). Mean regional RBC volumes (1.50 +/- 0.09 ml/100 g brain) were less than mean regional plasma volumes (3.34 +/- 0.28 ml/100 g brain), and mean regional cerebral Hcts were 31.3 +/- 1.8%, which was 75.9 +/- 2.1% of the large-vessel Hct. During 5% CO2 inhalation, increases in plasma volume (2.48 +/- 0.82%/mmHg PaCO2) were significantly greater than for RBC volume (1.46 +/- 0.48%/mmHg PaCO2). Consequently, the cerebral-to-large-vessel Hct ratio was reduced to 72.4 +/- 2.2%. Results emphasize the importance of cerebral Hct for the measurement of CBV and indicate that regional cerebral Hcts are not constant when shifted from one physiological state to another.
