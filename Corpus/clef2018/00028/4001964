131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy of neuroblastomas. Sixteen neuroblastoma patients have been studied by 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy. Three patients were possibly cured, and their scintigraphy results were normal. Thirteen patients had tumors and metastases demonstrated by 131I-MIBG, two of these patients had a normal vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) excretion level. One patient has been treated by 131I-MIBG, but died. 131I-MIBG was concentrated in other cells too, eg, in erythrocytes and platelets.
