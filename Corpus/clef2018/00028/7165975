Progesterone therapy in pregnancy induced hypertension therapeutic value and hormonal profile. The study was carried on 25 primigravidae with severe pre-eclamptic toxaemia (PET) and 19 normal pregnancies as a control group. 15 cases of PET were treated by 600 mg. progesterone daily for variable duration between one and six weeks. Daily blood samples were assayed for progesterone, dihydroprogesterone, estriol, estradiol, placental lactogen and prolactin. Under progesterone therapy there was a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, significant increase in urinary output, amelioration of the edema, slight reduction in weight gain, but no change in the proteinuria. Prolactin was the only hormone that showed significant rise in the group of PET when compared with normal pregnancy.
