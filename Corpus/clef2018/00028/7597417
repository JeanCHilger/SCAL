Clinical brain radionuclide imaging studies. A recent survey of the knowledge and practice of both positron-emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain among referring physicians in Europe (neurologists and psychiatrists) showed a disquieting lack of knowledge of the potential of these methodologies in the investigation and management of patients of their own specialities. The need to bring the knowledge of the potential of these techniques to the practicing physicians is paramount. It is imperative that the methodologies and concepts that preside over the application of these techniques in neurology and psychiatry must become more uniform if an impact is to be felt at a clinical level. There is clear improvement in the instrumentation available with the new state-of-the-art tomographic devices and with the development of new technetium-based radiopharmaceuticals for the study of cerebral perfusion. The constant progress made with ligands that permit the study of neurotransmission, tumor metabolism, and turnover do expand our capability to improve the knowledge concerning neurophysiology, neuropathology, and neuropharmacology of a variety of disease states. PET and SPECT will be progressively included in protocols aimed at stratifying patients with dementia, monitoring therapeutic trials, and improving our ability to determine outcome. Clinical usefulness of PET and SPECT begin to emerge in cerebral vascular disease, in the identification of cerebral death, in epilepsy, in cerebral trauma, in the investigation of HIV-positive patients with cerebral involvement, and in the monitoring of tumor recurrence and postirradiation damage. This review article outlines a current perspective of SPECT and PET as practiced in Europe, its potential, and its limitations.
