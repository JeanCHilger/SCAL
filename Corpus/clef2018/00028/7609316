Changes in distribution of reticuloendothelial function in transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), estimated by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In order to study the changes in distribution of reticuloendothelial function in transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the radioactivity of 99mTc-phytate was calculated by the accumulation rate in the organs by means of the single emission computed tomography (SPECT). It was regarded as the reticuloendothelial function in the liver and spleen, and was evaluated independently. Before TAE, significant increases were noted in both splenic activity and splenic volume in the cirrhotic patients, as compared with non-cirrhotic patients. After TAE, the activity in the liver was reduced at the first day after TAE, which returned to the normal level by 5 days. While that in the spleen increased immediately after TAE. After one day of TAE, reticuloendothelial functions of the spleen was significantly higher in the cirrhotic cases then in the non-cirrhotic cases. Furthermore, in the cirrhotic patients, it was significantly higher in the cases embolizated in more than two segments than in those embolizated in one segment only. In conclusion, the reticuloendothelial function of the liver was significantly reduced by the TAE in the cirrhotic patients as compared with non-cirrhotic patients. However the reduced reticuloendothelial function of the liver in the cirrhotic patients was compensated by the increased reticuloendothelial function of the spleen.
