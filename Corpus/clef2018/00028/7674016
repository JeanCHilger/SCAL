Decreased cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with brain tumors: an effect of corticosteroids. The authors measured cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRglu) using [18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with brain tumors to evaluate the effect of exogenous corticosteroids (in this instance, dexamethasone) on glucose metabolism. Fifty-six FDG-PET studies obtained in 45 patients with unilateral supratentorial brain tumors were analyzed. Patients with brain tumors were divided into three groups: 1) patients with cushingoid symptoms, who had been treated with combinations of radiotherapy and chemotherapy taking oral dexamethasone 2) patients not taking dexamethasone but treated with radiotherapy
