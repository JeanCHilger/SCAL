Prognostic value of dipyridamole sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography and dipyridamole stress echocardiography for new cardiac events after an uncomplicated myocardial infarction. A high-dose dipyridamole stress test (0.84 mg/kg in 6 minutes) with simultaneous sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) and echocardiographic imaging was performed in 89 patients before hospital discharge after an uncomplicated myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of these tests for new cardiac events and to compare the relative values of SPECT and echocardiography in a postinfarction dipyridamole stress test. Two years after infarction, nine patients (10%) had died, five patients (6%) had suffered a nonfatal reinfarction, and 14 patients (16%) had been readmitted to the hospital for a revascularization procedure. Cardiac death had occurred in 5 (10%) of 48 patients with a positive SPECT versus 4 (10%) of 41 with a negative SPECT (difference not significant) and in 6 (19%) of 31 with a positive echocardiogram versus 3 (5%) of 56 with a negative echocardiogram (p = 0.05). Cardiac death or reinfarction had occurred in 8 (17%) of 48 patients with a positive SPECT versus 6 (15%) of 41 with a negative SPECT (difference not significant) and in 6 (19%) of 31 with a positive echocardiogram versus 8 (14%) of 56 with a negative echocardiogram (difference not significant). Thus the predictive value of the dipyridamole stress test for new cardiac events after an uncomplicated myocardial infarction was limited, irrespective of the method used to detect ischemia. Reversible perfusion defects were identified more frequently than new wall motion abnormalities but did not predict late events. A positive dipyridamole echocardiogram was associated with a higher late mortality rate but did not predict other cardiac events.
