The peritoneal permeability and surface area index. The value of the peritoneal equilibration test (PET)-derived dialysate-to-plasma creatinine ratio (D/Pcr) as a measure of the peritoneal membrane's diffusive characteristics is obscured by the major role of convection in determining this value, particularly for low transporters. A simple index, derived from PET data, may permit a more accurate clinical measure of peritoneal diffusion.
