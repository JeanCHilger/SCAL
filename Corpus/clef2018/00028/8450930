Activation of cerebral blood flow during a visuoperceptual task in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) associated with a face-matching task were examined using positron emission tomography (PET) and H2(15)O in 7 patients with mild-moderate dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and in 8 healthy age-matched controls. rCBF was normalized to whole brain flow and pixel-by-pixel difference images were computed by contrasting flow during a control task to flow during face matching. Both patients and controls showed bilateral rCBF increases in occipitotemporal extrastriate cortex during face matching. The magnitude of these increases was not significantly different between the groups. In addition, the patients showed greater rCBF activation in regions of occipital and frontal cortex. These results show that early in the course of DAT, patients utilize extrastriate cortex to perform a visuoperceptual task, as do control subjects but also show rCBF increases in additional cortical areas. Activation of these additional areas of cortex in the patients may reflect an increased attentional load during face matching due to their reduced cognitive capacity.
