Usefulness of follow-up regional cerebral blood flow measurements by single-photon emission computed tomography in the differential diagnosis of dementia. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether follow-up measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provide additional information in the differential diagnosis of dementia. Thirty-six patients (70 +/- 14 yr) with suspected dementia who had two technetium 99m-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime SPECT scans over 18 +/- 7 months were included in this retrospective study. The patients comprised three groups based on the final clinical diagnosis: (1) neurodegenerative disorder (NDD) including Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 13), frontotemporal lobe dementia (n = 2), progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 1), and mixed dementia (AD plus multiinfarct dementia [MID]) (n = 3) (2) MID (n = 8)
