Changes in PCO2 with acute changes in cardiac index. A direct relationship between cardiac index (CI) and end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) shortly after decreased CI was reported, but arterial PCO2 was not measured. Our purpose was to supply the missing information on the immediate effects of alterations in CI on PaCO2, PETCO2 and thus on Pa-PETCO2.We measured CI, Pa and PETCO2 and calculated the difference in 20 patients scheduled for elective heart surgery just before and immediately after the sternotomy. The measurements were made using standard methods: thermodilution for CI, infra-red and blood gas analysis for PET and PaCO2 respectively. The results were analyzed by linear regression.Very significant, direct and immediate changes in PET and PaCO2 with changes in CI were noted. The ratios were 3.8 and 4.2 mmHg L-1 respectively. The calculated values of r were 0.75 (P < 0.001) for PETCO2 and 0.64 (P < 0.005) for PaCO2. The magnitude of individual change in PCO2 varied considerably such that the alterations in Pa-PETCO2 were also variable, without any correlation with the direction or magnitude of change in CI.Our results explain the reported wide variations in Pa-PETCO2 that accompany perturbations of cardiac output. Our observations pertain to the unsteady state only. The results suggest that PETCO2 can be used to estimate changes in CI with a reasonable degree of confidence.
