Auger-electron spectra of radionuclides for therapy and diagnostics. The present paper documents the calculation of radiation spectra and of radial dose distribution around a point source for 24 selected radionuclides. The radionuclides were ordered into three groups: Nuclides potentially useful for therapy by emission of Auger electrons: 51Cr, 64Cu, 67Ga, 73Se, 75Se, 77Br, 80mBr, 94Tc, 99mTc, 114mIn, 115mIn, 123I, 124I, 125I, 167Tm, 193mPt, and 195mPt, nuclides potentially useful for therapy by alpha-particles with additional emission of Auger electrons: 212Bi, 211At and 255Fm, and nuclides potentially useful for electron Auger-therapy with simultaneous PET diagnosis: 73Se, 94Tc and 124I. The calculations imply strongly the development of labelled DNA-seeking compounds useful as carrier for the Auger- and Coster-Kronig electron-emitting radionuclides.
