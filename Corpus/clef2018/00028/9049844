A human neuroblastoma xenograft model for 125-I-metaiodobenzylguanidine biodistribution studies. We developed an animal model to evaluate the 125-I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (125-I-mIBG) biodistribution in tumor bearing mice. Six weeks old nude-atimic mice were subcutaneously injected with 30 x 10(6) cells of the human neuroblastoma (NB) cell line SH-SY5Y. TE-671, a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, was used as a control tumor without a specific mIBG uptake mechanism. In order to prevent possible tumor rejection mediated by NK activity the anti asialo GM1 antiserum was administered intraperitoneally once a week for 4 weeks. The maximum anti asialo mediated effect was obtained by administering the first dose the same day as the cell implant. In this group of animals by 9 weeks 98% of mice had a measurable tumor. We have utilized this model to evaluate the biodistribution of 125-I-mIBG given as two different formulations: standard preparation with a specific activity of 84 mCi/mg and the no carrier added (n.c.a) formulation with a specific activity of approximately 8,000 mCi/mg. Our preliminary results indicate that the biodistribution of the two different formulations in the various organs are similar. Therefore it appears that n.c.a. mIBG should not cause an increased toxicity in possible normal target organs such as heart or adrenals. Additional experiments will be performed in this model to ascertain if there is a potential advantage of the clinical use of n.c.a. mIBG over the standard preparation.
