Risk stratification in coronary artery disease: implications for stabilization and prevention. Noninvasive nuclear imaging techniques, including dual-isotope myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), have been employed in the development of strategies for diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease. These risk-stratification strategies are based on studies in which known outcome has been linked to diagnostic and prognostic information provided by myocardial perfusion SPECT. This article describes a validated dual-isotope exercise protocol for assessment of perfusion and function and reviews the evidence on which a cost-effective risk management strategy is based.
