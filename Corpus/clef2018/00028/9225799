Intra-individual differences between technetium-99m-HMPAO and technetium-99m-ECD in the normal medial temporal lobe. Regional distributions of 99mTc-hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) and 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer (99mTc-ECD) were compared in the normal brain.Six paid, healthy volunteers (mean age 26 yr) had high-resolution neuroperfusion SPECT using both 99mTc-HMPAO and 99mTc-ECD on separate days.Regional distribution of the two tracers differed. Technetium-99m-HMPAO accumulated more in the thalamus, frontal lobe, temporal lobe and cerebellum than 99mTc-ECD, which accumulated more in the occipital and parietal lobes. There was a considerable difference in the accumulation of the two tracers in the medial temporal lobe. The percent accumulations of 99mTc-HMPAO and 99mTc-ECD in the medial temporal lobe compared with the mean global cerebral cortical accumulation were 93.9% +/- 2.4% and 83.1% +/- 4.1% (mean +/- s.d.), respectively.The results suggest that 99mTc-HMPAO and 99mTc-ECD require specific and separate criteria for diagnosing temporal lobe pathologies, such as dementia and temporal lobe epilepsy.
