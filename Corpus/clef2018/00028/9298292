A semiquantitative cortical circumferential normalization method for clinical evaluation of rCBF brain SPECT. The authors studied 33 normal patients who ranged in age from 8 to 71 years to establish a normative data base for young-age, middle-age, and older-age subjects using a computer automated semi-quantitative cortical annular region of interest (ROI) method. The data were grouped to obtain a "young age-range" normative data base of mean age +/- 1 S.D. = 13.1 +/- 4.8 years (seven subjects with an age range of 6 to 20 years) a "middle age-range" normative data base of mean age +/- 1 S.D. = 39 +/- 2.7 years (12 subjects with an age range of 35 to 43 years)
