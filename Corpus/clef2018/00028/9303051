X-ray phototherapy for canine brain masses. Brain masses diagnosed in 47 pet dogs as tumors by CT scans, and confirmed in 12 dogs by necropsies, were injected with iodinated contrast media and treated by a modified CT scanner, the CTRx. Twenty-six dogs that received six or more weekly treatments of about 5.6 Gy per fraction, of which about 25% was contributed by radiation from the iodine, for a median total dose of 39 Gy, had a median survival of 230 days. This compares well with the 150 days reported for 25 dogs given 46-48 Gy of cobalt-60 radiation to the whole brain, and is significantly greater than the 6 to 13 days in untreated historic controls.
