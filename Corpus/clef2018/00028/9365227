N-arachidonylethanolamine (anandamide) formation from N-arachidonylphosphatidylethanolamine in rat brain membranes. Labeled L-N-arachidonylphosphatidylethanolamine (L-N-arachidonyl PE), a likely precursor of N-arachidonylethanolamine (anandamide), as well as its D-isomer, were synthesized using [14C]arachidonic acid. Anandamide was formed by incubating L-N-arachidonyl PE and rat brain membrane with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), an inhibitor of anandamide amidohydrolase. Formation of anandamide from L-N-arachidonyl PE was inhibited by p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (p-CMPS), sulfhydryl reagent, and heat inactivate pre-treatment. D-N-Arachidonyl PE, an unnatural analog for N-arachidonyl PE, did not form anandamide.
