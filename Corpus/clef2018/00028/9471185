Positron emission tomography in carcinomas of the head and neck. Recently published studies indicate a potential clinical application of PET in head and neck tumors. In the preoperative staging phase, PET enables confirmation of regional lymph node extension and guides nodal neck dissection or systemic treatment. In this phase, a high negative predictive value, near 100%, could make it possible to avoid many negative neck dissections. This is a reliable technique for confirming or excluding the presence of recurrent/residual tumor and for obtaining an early evaluation of chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic response. PET imaging in many cases makes it possible to locate and guide histological study of tumors with an unknown primary. PET imaging for these indications is a perfect complementary method for clinical exploration and better than other imaging techniques.
