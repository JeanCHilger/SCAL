Fluorine-18-labeled fluoroboronophenylalanine PET in patients with glioma. We synthesized fluorine-18-labeled fluoroboronophenylalanine (18F-10B-FBPA), an analog of boronophenylalanine (10B-BPA), and characterized its pharmacokinetics in patients with glioma. We conducted PET studies on three types of gliomas to clarify the relationship between tumor grade and each rate constant [K1 (ml/g/min), k2 (min[-1]) and k3 (min[-1])], and here, we discuss the metabolism of the 10B-BPA analog (18F-10B-FBPA).Thirty-three cases of primary gliomas were studied by dynamic PET using DL-18F-10B-FBPA or L-18F-10B-FBPA. Dynamic PET images of 18F-10B-FBPA incorporation into tumors were obtained, and the arterial blood samplings were performed in all cases.When the dynamic PET data were represented as Gjedde-Patlak plots, there was a positive slope, suggesting the involvement of the putative metabolic pool of this tracer. A three-compartment model using rate constants (K1, k2 and k3) was used for the kinetic analysis. The accumulation of 18F-10B-FBPA was found to correlate with the degree of malignancy, and the L form of 18F-10B-FBPA was taken up better than was the DL form. The results of dynamic PET analysis suggested that K1 (measuring amino acid transport process) is a major factor determining the accumulation of 18F-10B-FBPA. A comparison of the rate constants revealed that k3 (metabolic process) did not correlate with the degree of malignancy. The absence of evident differences in k3 between DL and L forms suggests that k3 represents phenomena that are not dependent on the native form of L.These PET data will be of practical use for diagnosis of malignancy and direct prediction of the effectiveness of boron neutron capture therapy using 10B-BPA.
