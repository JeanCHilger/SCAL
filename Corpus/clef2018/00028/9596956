Dobutamine technetium-99m-MIBI spect in evaluating the effects of coronary interventional management. To evaluate the effects of coronary interventional management by dobutamine 99mTc-MIBI single photon emission computed tomography (Dobu-ECT).Dobu-ECT was performed in pre- and post-interventional management of 32 patients. Dobutamine was administered intravenously at incremental rates from 5 to 40 micrograms x kg-1.min-1 at 3-minute intervals. At the highest infusion rate, 20 mCi 99mTc-MIBI was injected intravenously, and tomographic imaging was performed after one hour. Rest imagings were taken after 24 hours with a second dose of 99mTc-MIBI.In 32 patients accepting interventional treatment, within 3-6 months follow-up, the results of Dobu-ECT showed a total effectiveness rate of treatment was 68.1%. 27 patients of whose Dobu-ECT showed significant reversible defects before procedure, the effectiveness rate was 77.8% (21/26), 6 still had reversible ischemia within the follow-up period, and restenoses of 5 patients were confirmed by angiography. We also compared the effect of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with intracoronary stenting using Dobu-ECT. The results showed that intracoronary stenting was more beneficial than PTCA (81.3% vs 43.8%, P < 0.05)Dobu-ECT can be used to evaluate the effect of interventional management and detect restenosis after procedure.
