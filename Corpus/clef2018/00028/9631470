The role of the left inferior temporal cortex for visual pattern discrimination--a PET study. We measured regional cerebral blood flow using positron emission tomography in seven normal volunteers during discrimination tasks for visual patterns. For the 'attention to right or left' tasks, the subjects were instructed to press a key when sample and test stimuli presented in the right or left visual fields, respectively, were identical. In the control task, subjects were instructed to press a key on every second presentation of the test stimulus. Both discrimination tasks activated the same area in the inferior temporal sulcus of the left hemisphere. The results indicate that the left inferior temporal cortex plays a dominant role in the discrimination of visual pattern in right handed subjects.
