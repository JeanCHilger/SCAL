Diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of combined dipyridamole-exercise thallium imaging in hemodialysis patients. Non-invasive detection of coronary artery disease in dialysis patients, a major cause of mortality, often remains difficult. The aim of the study was to test the diagnostic and prognostic accuracies of combined dipyridamole-exercise thallium imaging in dialysis patients.Dipyridamole-exercise thallium imaging and coronary angiography were both performed prospectively in 60 asymptomatic hemodialysis patients who were followed up, long term, by recording any major coronary event.Coronary angiography was abnormal in 13 patients (21%), and there was abnormal thallium uptake in 17 patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and overall accuracy of thallium to detect a coronary artery disease were 92, 89, 71, 98 and 90%, respectively. After a median follow-up of 2.8 years, 12 patients experienced at least one major coronary event (4 cardiac deaths, 5 myocardial infarctions and 3 revascularizations). Eight of the 17 patients with abnormal thallium uptake (47%) suffered a coronary event, compared to only 4 of the 43 patients (9%) with a normal thallium uptake (P < 0.001). The positive prognostic predictive value of thallium imaging was 47% and its negative predictive value was 91%. The probability of survival free of coronary events was significantly higher in patients with normal thallium uptake than in those with abnormal thallium uptake (crude risk ratio 7.6 P < 0.001) even after adjustment for several risk factors for cardiovascular disease (adjusted risk ratio 9.2In dialysis patients, combined dipyridamole-exercise thallium imaging is an accurate method for detecting coronary stenosis and for predicting future coronary events.
