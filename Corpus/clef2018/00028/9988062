An ultrashort 1-day protocol of Tc-99m tetrofosmin. This study describes a new 1-day protocol with Tc-99m tetrofosmin that requires only 100 minutes to obtain both stress and resting cardiac images by using a double-injection and subtraction method.This procedure was performed in 48 consecutive patients. Rest-rest double injections were performed in eight patients (five men, three women mean age, 69 +/- 9.8 years ) to evaluate count and image reproducibility (subprotocol A), and stress-rest and additional resting perfusion images (true rest) were done on a different day in 11 patients (five men, six womenImage quality scores of the resting image were excellent (35 of 48, or 72.9%), good (7 of 48, or 14.6%), fair (3 of 48, or 6.3%), and poor (3 of 48, or 6.3%). The scintigraphic findings with the new protocol corresponded closely with those of angiography in 26 of 34 cases (76.5%), with a tendency for underestimation (in 5 of 34 cases, or 14.7%) rather than overestimation (in 3 of 34 cases, or 8.8%). In subprotocol A, count reproducibility between the two resting images was excellent (r = 0.95 P < 0.0001)Although there are some limitations, this protocol can be used as a routine stress-rest protocol.
