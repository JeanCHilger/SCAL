Antiangiogenic activity of restin, NC10 domain of human collagen XV: comparison to endostatin. Based on a homology search with endostatin, the C-terminus 185 aa of collagen XVIII, we report the cloning, expression, and antiangiogenic activity of a 22 kDa human collagen XV fragment, that we have named restin. Restin was expressed in the prokaryotic pET expression system. We have shown that restin inhibits the migration of endothelial cells in vitro but has no effect on the proliferation of these cells. A polyclonal antibody raised against endostatin cross-reacted with restin. Systemic administration of restin suppressed the growth of tumors in a xenograft renal carcinoma model.
