Crossed cerebellocerebral diaschisis in patients with cerebellar stroke. We performed single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to investigate crossed cerebellocerebral diaschisis (CCCD) in patients with cerebellar stroke.Fifteen patients with unilateral cerebellar stroke underwent SPECT of the brain with N-isopropyl-p-[123I] iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by the autoradiographic method. Regions of interest were defined in the cerebral cortex, striatum, thalamus and cerebellum to compare structures (contralateral to the cerebellar lesion) with counterparts ipsilateral to the stroke.In the frontal and parietal cortices, especially the posterior superior frontal, anterior midfrontal, precentral, postcentral, and supramarginal areas, rCBF contralateral to the lesion was significantly lower than on the side of the lesion (showing CCCD).This CCCD phenomenon is important to be aware of in clinical reading of images.
