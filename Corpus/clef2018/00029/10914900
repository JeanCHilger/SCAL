Correlation between severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension and 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine left ventricular imaging. It remains unclear whether cardiac sympathetic nervous function is disturbed in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH) and how sympathetic dysfunction is related to PH.In this study, (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging of the heart, which reveals the sympathetic innervation of the left ventricle, was performed in 7 healthy volunteers without cardiopulmonary disease (control subjects) 55 patients with PH, including 27 with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) of major vesselsCardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake, assessed as the heart-to-mediastinum activity ratio (H/M), was significantly lower in the CTEPH and PPH groups compared with that in the control group (P < 0.01). Myocardial MIBG turnover, expressed as the washout rate (WR [%]) from 15 to 240 min, was significantly higher in the CTEPH and PPH groups than that in the control group (P < 0.01). In the PPH group, H/M and WR values of MIBG correlated with the severity of pulmonary hypertension (represented by total pulmonary vascular resistance determined by right heart catheterization), the right ventricular ejection fraction determined by electron beam CT, and other variables but did not correlate well in the CTEPH group. In both groups, patients with H/M > or = 2.0 showed better cumulative survival than did those with H/M < 2.0 (P < 0.05).Patients with PH have significant left ventricular myocardial sympathetic nervous alteration. (123)I-MIBG imaging of the heart is useful for assessing the severity of pulmonary hypertension caused by PPH or CTEPH.
