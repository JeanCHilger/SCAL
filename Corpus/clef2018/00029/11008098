Evaluation of Abdominal Tumors with Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic usefulness of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET).Procedures: We performed FDG-PET in 22 patients with suspected primary or recurrent cancer (23 cases). The FDG-PET findings were compared with the final diagnosis, which was obtained by histological examination of resected, or biopsy specimens and the clinical course.Results: In all patients, the sensitivity, specificity, and the accuracy of FDG-PET were 93.8%, 85.7%, 91.3%, respectively. In the patients with colo-rectal cancer, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 92.9%, 100%, 94.4%, respectively.Conclusions: FDG-PET was considered to be clinically useful for the detection of primary or recurrent malignant tumors, and for differentiating recurrent tumors from inflammatory scars.
