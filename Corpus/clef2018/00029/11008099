Comparison of FDG-PET and Bone Scans for Detecting Skeletal Metastases in Patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. Purpose: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with F18-fluorodeoxyglucose has been proven useful for staging non-small cell lung cancer. Bone scans are frequently performed for suspected skeletal metastases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if bone scans compared to PET scans provide additional information that changes the stage of disease.Procedures: Nineteen patients with non-small cell lung cancer had PET and bone scans done for staging of the malignancy. The results of both studies were compared.Results: Bone and PET scans agreed on the presence or absence of skeletal metastases in all nineteen patients. The addition of a bone scan to a PET scan did not change the stage of the disease or the management in any of the patients. Bone scans allowed for more precise localization of the lesions in some patients.Conclusions: Bone scans do not change the stage of disease when performed in addition to PET scans, but provide more precise localization of skeletal abnormalities.
