"Allergic sinusitis" revisited. "Allergic sinusitis" is a frequently used term but there is question about its true existence.To detect the presence of allergic inflammation of the sinuses in five highly symptomatic ragweed sensitive adults.Three imaging techniques were utilized: SPECT bone imaging, SPECT Indium111 labeled WBC uptake, and FDG F-18 (PET scanning).We could find no evidence of sinus involvement in association with severe allergic rhinitis.Employing three different imaging modalities, we were unable to demonstrate inflammation of the sinuses in patients with allergic rhinitis.
