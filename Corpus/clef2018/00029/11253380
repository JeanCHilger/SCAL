Lateralized cortical perfusion in women with Alzheimer's disease. To define the pathophysiologic substrate of gender differences in cognition and behavior in Alzheimer's disease (AD).Hemispheric regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was studied in a consecutive series of dementia patients using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Subjects included 300 outpatients who were studied with SPECT as part of a diagnostic evaluation for degenerative dementia or memory disorder.Based on qualitative descriptions by a radiologist, subjects were classified as having unilateral left, unilateral right, bilateral, or no perfusion defects. Semiquantitative analysis of SPECT images was also performed using region of interest radionuclide counts normalized to the cerebellum.Among 174 females and 126 males, unilateral left hemisphere defects were found more commonly in women than men (24% vs 10% chi 2 = 9.4Women with AD exhibit greater heterogeneity in rCBF than men. Asymmetry in rCBF occurs more often in women. In some cases, this is related to relative preservation of right hemisphere function in women.
