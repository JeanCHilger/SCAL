Evaluation of cardiac and respiratory involvement in sarcoglycanopathies. Sarcoglycanopathies constitute a subgroup of limb-girdle recessive muscular dystrophies due to defects in sarcoglycan complex that comprises five distinct transmembrane proteins called alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-and epsilon-sarcoglycans. As it is well known that sarcoglycans are expressed both in heart and in skeletal muscles and a complete deficiency in delta-sarcoglycan is the cause of the Syrian hamster BIO.14 cardiomyopathy, we studied cardiac and respiratory involvement in 20 patients with sarcoglycanopathies by clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, scintigraphic and spirometric assessments. A normal heart function was found in 31.3% of all patients a preclinical cardiomyopathy in 43.7%
