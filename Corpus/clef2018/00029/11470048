Neuroimaging techniques in the diagnostic work-up of patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome. The detection of multisystemic involvement often leads to a correct diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), even in cases with predominant neurologic manifestations. However, when central nervous system deficits are isolated and have a relapsing-remitting or a progressive course, other conditions must be carefully considered. In this context, the diagnostic accuracy of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is hampered by its limited pathologic specificity, which is one of the reasons why no or only modest correlations have been found between the burden of MRI-visible lesions and other clinical or laboratory measures of disease severity in patients with APS. Neuroimaging techniques with a higher pathologic specificity than conventional MRI show promise in achieving diagnostic confidence earlier in the course of APS and in better monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.
