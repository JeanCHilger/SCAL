Aorta-left ventricular relationship evaluated by Doppler echocardiography and ambulatory arterial prsesure monitoring. Arterial distensibility is one of the components of afterload. Arterial distensibility, left ventricular (LV) mass and LV function are closely linked. The aim of this study is to describe the relations between LV mass LV function and arterial distensibility evaluated by echography Doppler (Ã©chography Doppler) and ambulatory monitoring pressure. Sixty-two patients with or without cardiac disease were prospectively enrolled excepted those with atrial fibrillation, left bundle branch block pace maker, or valvulopathy. Echography Doppler study collected stroke volume, LV diameters and wall thickness, ejection time (ET) and preejection time (PET) were calculated ejection fraction (EF), systolic pressure/systolic diameter ratio, LV mass index (LVMI), relative wall thickness ratio (e/r). AMP collected usual pressure datas and QKd, time interval between QECG and diastolic Korotkoff sound, instantaneous, over 24 h (i, 24 h), and for a pressure of 100 mm Hg and a heart rate of 60 bpm (QKd 100-60).QKd 24 h was correlated with LVMI (r = 0.40, p = 0.006) and e/r (r = 0.32, p = 0.028). QKdi was correlated with EF (p < 0.001, r = 0.65), with systolic pressure/systolic diameter ratio (p < 0.001, r = 0.75), and with ET/PET (r = 0.56, p < 0.001). When PET was withdrawn from QKd, no correlation exist between QKd-PET and LV function index, excepted QKd-PET versus systolic pressure/systolic diameter (r = 0.46, p = 0.005).QKd is not only an arterial distensibility index but also a LV function index, because PET is included in it. Echography Doppler and AMP are available and common tools to study the aorta/LV relationship.
