Quantitative analysis of striatal dopamine D2 receptors with 123 I-iodolisuride SPECT in degenerative extrapyramidal diseases. 123I-Iodolisuride has high specific affinity for binding on dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum and has been used in a few single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies of extrapyramidal disorders. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is very difficult in the first 5 years of evolution, with 15-25% false positive diagnoses. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the value of iodolisuride SPECT in discriminating Parkinson's from the most frequent Parkinson-plus syndromes (PPS). Seventeen patients with an extrapyramidal syndrome had a SPECT examination 1 h after injection of 180-185 MBq of 123I-iodolisuride. They were followed under dopaminergic treatment for at least 2 years. After 2 years, they were separated in two groups according to specific clinical criteria and sensitivity to dopaminergic treatment: nine patients had PD (age = 59.8+/-8.8 years Hoehn and Yahr = 1.8+/-0.7
