Clinical results of transmyocardial laser revascularization for 77 patients with coronary artery disease. To analyses the clinical results of transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMLR) for 77 patients with coronary artery diseases (CAD).The mean age of the patients was (65 +/- 7) years. Previous medical record included CABG (6 patients), PTCA (9), AMI (66.2%), hypertension (70.1%), and diabetes mellitus (45.5%). TMLR was performed on the beating heart via a left anterolateral thoracotomy at the fifth intercostal space. Transesophageal echocardiography showed transmyocardial penetration of 23 +/- 6 channels.The hospital mortality was 3.8%, and postoperative complications were AMI (3.8%), left ventricular failure (2.6%), PVC (5.2%). After operation, the mean CCS angina class was improved from the baseline 3.5 +/- 0.7 to 2.1 +/- 0.3 at 3 months, 1.7 +/- 0.3 at 6 months, 1.7 +/- 0.3 at 12 months and 1.8 +/- 0.4 at 24 months. One patient died of AMI and two died not due to cardiac events during a follow-up of 3 to approximately 24 months. Echocardiography showed that the average of left ventricular ejection fractions was improved significantly at 6 months after operation compared with the preoperative value (P = 0.0457). (201)TI-SPECT showed a remarkable improvement in reversible ischemia in 70% patients followed up. Metabolic stress test for 20 patients followed up patients demonstrated an average increase in exercise tolerance from 7.1 +/- 3.2 min at the baseline to 9.6 +/- 1.3 min at 12 months (P = 0.021). Similarly the METs increased from 4.3 +/- 2.1 at the baseline to 5.4 +/- 2.0 at 12 months.TMLR is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of end stage coronary artery diseases not amenable to PTCA or CABG. The effect of TMLR is associated with indication, correct evaluation of myocardial ischemia, and management for postoperative complications.
