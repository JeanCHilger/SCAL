First outbreak of Baylisascaris procyonis larva migrans in rabbits in Japan. A syndrome of progressive neurological signs was noticed in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) kept in a small wildlife park in mid-July 2000. Three out of 12 common raccoons (Procyon lotor) kept in this park were infected with Baylisascaris procyonis, and the larvae were found from affected rabbits. This outbreak is the first proven B. procyonis larva migrans in Japan, and the potential risk of serious zoonosis by this ascarid species should be considered by pet owners, veterinarians, physicians and public health authorities in this country as in North America where raccoons are endemic.
