Biomaterial surface chemistry dictates adherent monocyte/macrophage cytokine expression in vitro. An in vitro human monocyte culture system was used to determine whether adherent monocyte/macrophage cytokine production was influenced by material surface chemistry. A polyethylene terephthalate (PET) base surface was modified by photograft copolymerization to yield hydrophobic, hydrophilic, anionic and cationic surfaces. Freshly isolated human monocytes were cultured onto the surfaces for periods up to 10 days in the presence or absence of interleukin-4 (IL-4). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis on days 3, 7 and 10 of cell culture revealed that interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression significantly increased in cells adherent to the hydrophilic and anionic surfaces but significantly decreased in the cationic surface adherent monocytes/macrophages. Conversely, interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression was significantly decreased in cells adherent to the hydrophilic and anionic surfaces. Further analysis revealed that the hydrophilic and anionic surfaces inhibited monocyte adhesion and IL-4-mediated macrophage fusion into foreign body giant cells (FBGCs). Therefore, hydrophilic and anionic surfaces promote an anti-inflammatory type of response by dictating selective cytokine production by biomaterial adherent monocytes and macrophages. These studies contribute information necessary to enhance our understanding of biocompatibility to be used to improve the in vivo lifetime of implanted medical devices and prostheses.
