Staging of recurrent and advanced lung cancer with 18F-FDG PET in a coincidence technique (hybrid PET). The aim of this study was to evaluate [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ( F-FDG) imaging of recurrent or inoperable lung cancer using a hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) device of the third generation. Examinations were compared with the results of conventional staging. Thirty-six patients suffering from recurrent or primarily inoperable lung cancer (29 men, seven women age 64.8+/-12.0 years) were examined using hybrid PET (Marconi Axis gamma-PET ) 60 min after injection of 370 MBq F-FDG. The data obtained were reconstructed iteratively. All patients received a computed tomography (CT) scan using either the spiral or multislice technique. All lesions suspicious for primary or recurrent tumour were verified by biopsy
