Clinical significance of basal ganglia alterations at brain MRI and 1H MRS in cirrhosis and role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. In hepatic encephalopathy, a progressive and diffuse impairment in brain function is associated with gradual alterations that can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS). In some patients, a variety of movement disorders suggestive of extrapyramidal impairment points toward basal ganglia (BG) alterations. Accordingly, (i) hyperintensities at MRI predominant in the pallidum, an important region of BG involved in the motor control, (ii) redistribution of cerebral blood flow from cortical areas to BG structures observed using positron emission tomography studies, and (iii) the preferential pallidal location of Alzheimer astrocytosis, all support this hypothesis. In most clinical studies, little if any correlations have been found between cerebral hyperintensities and neurological manifestations. The application of a test designed to evaluate patients with Parkinson's disease (where extrapyramidal signs are typical) showed significant clinical correlations both with pallidal hyperintensity and with choline/creatine ratio at 1H MRS in BG structures. Because of complex neuronal connections between BG and many cortical areas, BG dysfunction may influence the neurocognitive manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy. Similarities between chronic Mn intoxication and cirrhosis suggest common pathophysiological mechanisms including altered dopaminergic neurotransmission, although information in chronic liver failure is limited. Clinical observations are presented regarding the evolution of parkinsonian signs in various situations.
