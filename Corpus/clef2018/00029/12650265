Cerebral blood flow during acceleration in flight measured with SPECT. Positive pressure breathing for G-protection (PBG) reduces the need for fighter pilots to use the fatiguing anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM) so that they can better endure high acceleration (+Gz). The aim of the study was to determine the differences in cerebral blood flow during flight with an extended-coverage anti-G suit (ECGS) with AGSM or with PBG.Subjects were eight male members of the Finnish Air Force. Each was studied in the laboratory at +1 Gz and then during two identical flights in the back seat of the BAe Hawk Mk 51 jet trainer at +6 Gz, first with AGSM and second with PBG (24 mmHg). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by injecting (99 m) Tc-ECD for deposition at +6 Gz, then scanning the subject in the laboratory an hour later using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).The rCBF was 30% below baseline for both the AGSM and PBG.PBG maintained CBF at +6 Gz without the need for the fatiguing AGSM.
