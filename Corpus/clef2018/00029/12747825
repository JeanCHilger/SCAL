Neurological explorations in Nuclear Medicine. A Spanish survey. A representative Nuclear Medicine Service in Spain has two or three gammacameras. It performs neurologic studies one or two days at week wich account 2,1% of total workload. Brain Perfusion SPECT, specially in cognitive disorders, is the most frequent application. Neurooncology has a lower but established relevance. Neuroreceptors imaging are increasing in the last months. Emission tomography is obtained using a double-headed camera fitted with high-resolution parallel hole collimators and a half an hour total acquisition time. Datasets are reconstructed by filtered backprojection with Butterworth or Metz filtres. Images are visually interpreted with comparison to MRI and/or CT findings.
