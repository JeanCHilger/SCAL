Automatic Synthesis of [(18)F]Altanserin, a Radiopharmaceutical for Positron Emission Tomographic Studies of the Serotonergic Type-2 Receptors. [(18)F]Altanserin is routinely used in several centers to study the serotonergic type-2 receptors (5HT(2)) with positron emission tomography (PET). An automatic production system allowing the preparation of multimillicurie amounts [>1.5 GBq (40 mCi) EOS, mean radiochemical yield 20 +/- 6% EOB, specific activity >1 Ci/Î¼mol, n = 50] of this radiopharmaceutical within a synthesis time of 90 minutes (quality controls included) is described in this paper. The apparatus includes the recovery of the activity from the target, the preparation of the dried [(18)F]KF/kryptofix 2.2.2 complex, the labeling reaction using a microwave cavity, the Sep Pak and HPLC purification. A sterile, pyrogen-free and single use unit was also developed for the formulation of the injectable solution. This last part could be used for the formulation of many other radiopharmaceuticals.
