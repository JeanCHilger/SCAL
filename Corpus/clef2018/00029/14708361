Health claims in dog and cat feed. The number and diversity of health claims for dog and cat foods have increased markedly over the past few years. There is no explicit legislation as to these claims. Many claims are insufficiently supported by research and are vague and suggestive. In order to inform pet owners and veterinarians properly and to enhance honest competition among pet food producers, rules for the application of claims should be developed. For the time being, the veterinarian will have to take a stand by critical assessment.
