Positron emission tomography in the early follow-up of advanced head and neck cancer. To assess the clinical effect of an early follow-up positron emission tomography (PET) examination at the time of the first routine clinical control in patients with advanced-stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).Prospective, nonrandomized, case-control study.Single referral center.A total of 26 patients (mean age, 56 years) with histologically confirmed stage III-IV HNSCC underwent PET before and approximately 6 weeks after the end of a combined treatment with radiation and chemotherapy with curative intent. The PET findings were confirmed by histologic analysis and a 6-month clinical follow-up.The presence of distant metastases, secondary synchronous cancers, and residual locoregional tissue was confirmed, and the effect on further clinical management was assessed.Using PET, we correctly identified residual tumor tissue, distant metastases, or a second primary tumor in 10 patients, 5 of whom had no clinical evidence of such findings. Results were true negative in 14 cases false positive in 1Whole-body PET scanning approximately 6 weeks after completion of a combined treatment regimen with radiation and chemotherapy can reliably identify locoregional residual cancer and distant metastases or secondary tumors in patients with advanced-stage HNSCC and has a direct influence on management decisions.
