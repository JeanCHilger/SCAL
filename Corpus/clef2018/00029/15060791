Oscillopsia associated with dysfunction of visual cortex. To investigate the cause of oscillopsia without nystagmus or vestibular dysfunction in a 31-year-old man with no past history of serious illness.The changes in the regional cerebral blood flow elicited by visual stimuli were studied by positron emission tomography (PET) in the patient and were compared with changes in normal subjects. The primary visual cortex (PVC) and area V5 were defined on Talairach coordinates, as shown in previous PET studies, and were confirmed with their activation patterns in our subjects.Flicker stimulation (8 Hz) and a stationary random dot pattern activated area V5 in the patient, but not in the six normal controls. A moving random dot pattern activated both the PVC and the extra-striate cortex in both the patient and the controls.Oscillopsia in this case is associated with dysfunction of the visual cortices and may be caused by it.
