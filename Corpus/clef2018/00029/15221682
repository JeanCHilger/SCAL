Screening coagulation tests in the cat: reference values based on direct venipuncture and catheterized samples. Platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen degradation products, fibrinogen, and modified thrombin time were determined in 46 healthy adult cats. Samples were obtained by direct venipuncture (pet cats, n=20) or through an 18 gauge intravenous jugular catheter (laboratory conditioned cats, n=26). Range, mean, standard error, and 95% confidence interval were tabulated for the 2 samples. A statistically significant difference between the two groups of cats (Student's t test, p <.05) was found for fibrinogen. No statistical difference was detected between the two groups of cats for the other laboratory values.
