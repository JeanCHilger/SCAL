Assessment of myocardial viability with dobutamine stress echocardiography in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. The noninvasive assessment of myocardial viability has proved clinically useful for distinguishing hibernating and/or stunned myocardium from irreversibly injured myocardium in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease or recent myocardial infarction, with marked regional and/or global left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Noninvasive techniques utilized for the detection of viability in asynergic myocardial regions include positron emission tomographic imaging of residual metabolic activity, single photon emission tomography (SPECT) of radioisotope uptake with thallium-201, low-dose dobutamine echocardiography assessment of inotropic reserve and myocardial contrast echocardiography for evaluation of microvascular integrity. Of these techniques, dobutamine stress echocardiography is a safe, widely available and relatively inexpensive modality for the identification of myocardial viability for risk stratification and prognosis. Low-dose dobutamine response can accurately predict improvement of dysfunctional yet viable myocardial regions, and thus identify a subset of patients whose LV function will improve following successful coronary revascularization.
