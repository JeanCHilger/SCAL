A novel colorimetric and fluorescent chemosensor for anions involving PET and ICT pathways. A novel colorimetric and fluorescent chemosensor ADDTU-1 bearing dual receptor sites, which shows specific optical signaling for AcO-, H2PO4-, and F- over other anions and dual response toward AcO- and F- via PET and ICT mechanisms, is described.
