Sum frequency generation studies at poly(ethylene terephthalate)/silane interfaces: hydrogen bond formation and molecular conformation determination. To better understand the effects of interfacial molecular orientation on adhesion to plastics, the interfaces between poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and different silane coupling agents were probed using sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy. The polymer/air interface was dominated by the ester carbonyl, methylene, and phenyl groups. Upon contacting the PET film with the amino-functional silane 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (ATMS), the ester carbonyl stretch shifted to a lower energy indicating the formation of hydrogen bonds between the polymer surface and the silane molecules. This shift was not observed when silanes that contained no hydrogen bond donors, such as (3-glycidoxypropyl)-trimethoxysilane and n-butyltrimethoxysilane, were placed into contact with the PET surface. Further evidence of silane ordering at the interface was observed as vibrational peaks attributed to the C-H stretching of the silane methoxy headgroups dominated the PET/silane spectra. It was determined that the conformation of the ATMS molecules at the interface was such that the amino endgroups were oriented toward the interface while the methoxy headgroups were directed toward the silane bulk.
