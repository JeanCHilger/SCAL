Current situation and problems of PET examinations. In recent years, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has become a remarkable new modality for use in preventive medicine. FDG-PET examinations have many characteristics that are not available through conventional examinations, including the diagnosis of cancer. However, devices and examination techniques that take advantage of the merits of FDG-PET examinations are still required. In addition, many problems related to the management of facilities need to be solved. Therefore, we introduce the current situation of FDG-PET examinations in our facility and discuss our problem-solving efforts. FDG-PET examinations are very useful as screening examinations for cancer, and, in the future, FDG-PET will combine with other techniques and examinations in preventive medicine to provide a general cancer-screening system. For the future development of FDG-PET, we need to focus on the effective utilization of FDG-PET examinations and to establish evidence of their effectiveness. Moreover, we must create guidelines for the improvement of technology and the standardization of PET examination facilities.
