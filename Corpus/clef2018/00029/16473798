Gastrointestinal malignancies evaluated with (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography. (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography has demonstrated high accuracy in the staging and evaluation of colorectal and esophageal carcinomas. FDG PET is demonstrating increasing utility in a number of other gastrointestinal tumours and clinical scenarios. The established clinical indications for its use, the diagnostic accuracy, and limitations will be reviewed. Data on the emerging indications and limitations for pancreatic, hepatocellular, and gastric carcinomas, as well as gastrointestinal stromal tumours, cholangiocarcinoma, and carcinoma of unknown primary will also be briefly discussed. The use of combined PET-CT is demonstrating further improvements in diagnostic accuracy.
