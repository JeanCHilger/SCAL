Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus: an emerging obstetric pathogen? A report in May 2005 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describing a cluster of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infections among 4 solid organ recipients has increased awareness of and clinical interest in this pathogen. Human infection with LCMV results from direct or indirect contact with rodents. LCMV has particular relevance to obstetrics, as it is likely an under-recognized abortifacient and fetal teratogen. There have been 54 cases of congenital LCMV reported since 1955, with 34 of the cases diagnosed since 1993. Chorioretinitis and hydrocephalus are the predominant characteristics among children diagnosed with congenital LCMV infection. Obstetricians should educate their pregnant patients about the risks of exposure to laboratory, pet, and wild rodents.
