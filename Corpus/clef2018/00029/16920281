DOI and booster vaccination--dealing with the issue at practice level in France. After presenting pet demographics and discussing the present situation of vaccine use in France, the article focuses on the required changes to implement extended DOI vaccination protocols. Initiatives should address both the vets' and owners' attitudes and behaviour. However, many French vets are already implementing DOI protocols by vaccinating dogs every 2 years, so that the perceived risk of waning immunity is far from reality. Implementing an extended DOI schedule offers an opportunity to increase client attachment to the practice rather than perpetuate 'false loyalty' based on habit. Suggestions are made how vaccine companies may want to help French veterinarians switch from yearly booster vaccination to 3-year extended DOI protocols.
