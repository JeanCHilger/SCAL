Veterinary compounding in small animals: a clinical pharmacologist's perspective. The advent and growth of veterinary compounding and the increasing role of the pharmacist in drug dispensing, including compounding, should be embraced by the veterinary profession. For selected patients, extemporaneous compounding of prescriptions is necessary and beneficial for optimal treatment. By its nature, however, compounding is individualized and fraught with risks of failure. Pet owners should be informed of the risks associated with using a compounded product and consent to therapy based on disclosure that the use of the product may be scientifically unproven. As the pharmacy profession increases its efforts to define and ensure its role in veterinary medicine, and as the regulatory agencies consider changes in the regulations that increase the flexibility of animal drug compounding, the veterinary profession must implement actions that protect the patient and the public. It is indeed the responsibility of the veterinarian to ensure the safety and therapy of any prescribed therapeutic intervention, and failure to do otherwise places the patient and pet owner as well as the veterinarian at risk.
