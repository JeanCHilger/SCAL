Correlations between 18F-FDG uptake by bone marrow and hematological parameters: measurements by PET/CT. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlations between (18)F-FDG uptake by bone marrow and various hematological parameters. Forty-eight patients who underwent FDG-PET/CT studies and also received hematological examinations within 5 days before or after the PET study were included in this study. All patients had not received chemotherapy. FDG uptake by bone marrow was measured as a standardized uptake value (SUV) on three-dimensional PET/CT fusion images, and the uptake ratio (UR) of the SUV of bone marrow to the SUV of longitudinal dorsal muscle was calculated. The correlations between the SUV and the UR of bone marrow and various hematological parameters were evaluated. Bone marrow FDG uptake was strongly correlated with the white blood cell counts but was not significantly correlated with the red blood cell and platelet counts. The neutrophil count was significantly correlated with bone marrow FDG uptake but the lymphocyte count was not. FDG uptake by bone marrow was specifically correlated with the neutrophil count, suggesting that the FDG uptake by bone marrow reflects marrow metabolism that is mainly regulated by granulocyte progenitors and stimulated by endogenous hematopoietic growth factors. They may also be helpful in interpreting PET images, especially for diagnosing bone marrow involvement by malignancy.
