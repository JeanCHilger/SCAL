Abdominal visceral fat accumulation is associated with the results of (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy in type 2 diabetic patients. We tested the hypothesis that increased abdominal visceral accumulation (VFA) is associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients not receiving insulin treatment.The fat distribution was evaluated by measuring the VFA by abdominal computed tomography at the umbilical level. The study group consisted of 24 type 2 diabetic patients with high VFA (> or =100 cm(2), age 60 +/- 8 years, high VFA group). The control group consisted of 19 age-matched type 2 diabetic patients with normal VFA (<100 cm(2), age 60 +/- 7 years, normal VFA group). Cardiovascular autonomic function was assessed by baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability, plasma norepinephrine concentrations, and cardiac (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy.Early and delayed (123)I-MIBG myocardial uptake values were lower (p < 0.005 and p < 0.0001, respectively) and the percent washout rate of (123)I-MIBG was higher (p < 0.0005) in the high VFA group than in the normal VFA group. The fasting plasma insulin concentrations (p < 0.005) and the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index values (p < 0.0005) were higher in the high VFA group than in normal VFA group. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the level of VFA was independently predicted by the HOMA index values and the myocardial uptake of (123)I-MIBG during the delayed phase.Our results demonstrate that the level of VFA is associated with depressed cardiovascular autonomic function and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
