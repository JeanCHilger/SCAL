Utility of rest Tl-201 myocardial SPECT images for estimating myocardial viability. Rest Tl-201 myocardial SPECT images were underwent in 19 patients with anterior wall myocardial infarction under PTCR one month after the onset of acute myocardial infarction. The relationship between shortening rate (SR) of the left ventricle estimated by radial method and corresponding %Tl-201 uptake obtained by circumferential profile analysis was studied. For each patients 10 points on the anterior wall were taken into consideration. Seven patients showed depressive flat profile curve and 12 patients showed slant curve, in which %Tl-201 uptake continuously decreased from base to apex. Well correlation was obtained between SR and %Tl-201 uptake (SR = -41.2 +/- 1.03% Tl-201 uptake, r = 0.54, p less than 0.001). Average %Tl-201 uptake corresponding to SR = 0 was 46.3 + 6.8% (36-58). The sensitivity of %Tl-201 uptake greater than or equal to 60% for SR greater than or equal to 20% was 97% (87/90) and specificity was 69% (31/45). Tl-201 myocardial SPECT images were useful for estimating myocardial viability and %Tl-201 uptake was one of excellent parameters for quantitatively estimating myocardial viability.
