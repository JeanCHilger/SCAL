Biological effects of immune serum from fusion protein of beta-amyloid peptide and HbcAg/MIR on AD transgeneic cells. To investigate the expression of fusion protein c-Abeta-c, a fusion protein from the beta amyloid peptide (Abeta) and the Hepatitis B core antigen/ Major immunodominant region (HbcAg/MIR), in the BL21/pET28 prokaryotic expression system and to immunize mice with the expressed fusion protein and evaluate the immunogenicity and biological effects of the serum in vitro.The recombinant prokaryotic expression plasmid PET-28a /c-Abeta-c was constructed by molecular cloning technique and the c-Abeta-c fusion gene expression was induced in E. coli BL21 by isopropyl-1-thio-b-Dgalactopyranoside (IPTG). The expressed fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of the purified c-Abeta-c fusion protein was given to the BALB/c mice. The anti-Abeta effect of the immune serum was detected by indirect ELISA. The biological effect of the immune serum on Alzheimer's disease (AD) transgeneic cells was assessed by MTT assay and flow cytometer.The c-Abeta-c fusion protein was found in the sediment of the isolated bacteria. The expressed protein comprised more than 30% of the total proteins in the bacteria sediment. The anti-Abeta antibody in the serum of the immunized mice reached 1:16000. The antiserum reduced the cytotoxicity of Abeta peptide in the AD transgeneic cells and significantly decreased the apoptosis of cells.The c-Abeta-c fusion protein has good Abeta immunogenicity and the animal immune serum efficiently inhibits the cytotoxicity of Abeta peptide.
