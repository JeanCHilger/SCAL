Ictal and interictal 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT studies in temporal lobe epilepsy with unilateral EEG focus. Ictal and interictal SPECT measurements using 99mTc-HMPAO are helpful in localising an epileptic focus. 24 patients (12 women and 12 men mean age 30 years) suffering from temporal lobe epilepsies with unilateral EEG foci were examined. In all patients a presurgical evaluation including sphenoidal and foramen oval electrodes was carried out. The analysis of SPECT measurement was done visually and semi-quantitatively, comparing the data with findings in healthy persons (10 women and 10 men
