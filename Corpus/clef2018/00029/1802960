Coronal reconstruction images of glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's disease. Coronal images of position emission tomography (PET) by 18F-labelled deoxyglucose reconstructed from interpolated scan in Alzheimer's disease clearly indicated suppression of glucose metabolism in the parietal lobe and lateral part of the temporal lobes, compared to normal controls. The medial part of the temporal lobes in Alzheimer's disease did show a mildly lower glucose metabolic rate than that in normal controls therefore it is suggested that the parietal and lateral parts of the temporal lobes are primary affected regions in Alzheimer's disease, not the medial part of the temporal lobe, including the hippocampus.
