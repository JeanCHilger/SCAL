Regional cerebral blood flow during volitional breathing in man. 1. Positron emission tomographic imaging of brain blood flow was used to identify areas of motor activation associated with volitional inspiration in six normal male subjects. 2. Scans were performed using intravenous infusion of H2(15)O during voluntary targeted breathing and positive pressure passive ventilation at the same level. 3. Regional increases in brain blood flow, due to active inspiration, were derived using a pixel by pixel comparison of images obtained during the voluntary and passive ventilation phases. 4. Pooling data from all subjects revealed statistically significant increases in blood flow bilaterally in the primary motor cortex (left, 5.4% right, 4.3%), in the right pre-motor cortex (7.6%), in the supplementary motor area (SMA
