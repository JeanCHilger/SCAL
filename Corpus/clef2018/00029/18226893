Synthesis and evaluation of stilbenylbenzoxazole and stilbenylbenzothiazole derivatives for detecting beta-amyloid fibrils. This paper describes a novel series of stilbenylbenzoxazole (SBO) and stilbenylbenzothiazole (SBT) derivatives for beta-amyloid specific binding probes. These 24 compounds were synthesized and evaluated by competitive binding assay against beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta42) aggregates using [(125)I]TZDM. All the derivatives displayed higher binding affinities with K(i) value in the subnanomolar range (0.10-0.74 nM) than Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB) (0.77 nM). Among these derivatives, SBT-2, 5-fluoroethoxy-2-{4-[2-(4-methylaminophenyl)vinyl]phenyl}benzothiazole, showed lowest K(i) value (0.10 nM). In conclusion, the preliminary results suggest that these compounds are implying a possibility as a probe for detection of Abeta fibrils in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.
