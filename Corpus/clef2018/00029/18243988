An Iterative Image Space Reconstruction Algorthm Suitable for Volume ECT. The trend in the design of scanners for positron emission computed tomography has traditionally been to improve the transverse spatial resolution to several millimeters while maintaining relatively coarse axial resolution (1-2 cm). Several scanners are being built with fine sampling in the axial as well as transverse directions, leading to the possibility of the true volume imaging. The number of possible coincidence pairs in these scanners is quite large. The usual methods of image reconstruction cannot handle these data without making approximations. It is computationally most efficient to reduce the size of this large, sparsely populated array by back-projecting the coincidence data prior to reconstruction. While analytic reconstruction techniques exist for back-projected data, an iterative algorithm may be necessary for those cases where the point spread function is spatially variant. A modification of the maximum likelihood algorithm is proposed to reconstruct these back-projected data. The method, the iterative image space reconstruction algorithm (ISRA), is able to reconstruct data from a scanner with a spatially variant point spread function in less time than other proposed algorithms. Results are presented for single-slice data, simulated and actual, from the PENN-PET scanner.
