Usefulness of automatic quantification of immunochemical staining on whole tumor sections for correlation with oncological small animal PET studies: an example with cell proliferation, glucose transporter 1 and FDG. To highlight the use of automatic quantification of immunochemical staining on digitized images of whole tumor sections in preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) studies.Xenografted human testicular tumors (36) were imaged with 2-deoxy-2[F-18]fluoro-D: -glucose (FDG) small animal PET (SA-PET). Tumor cell proliferation and glucose transportation were assessed with cyclin A and Glut-1 immunostaining. Tumor slides were digitized and processed with PixCyt software enabling whole slide quantification, then compared with junior and senior pathologist manual scoring. Manual and automatic quantification results were correlated to FDG uptake.For cyclin A, inter- and intra-observer agreement for manual scoring was 0.52 and 0.72 and concordance between senior pathologist and automatic quantification was 0.84. Correlations between Tumor/Background ratio and tumor cell proliferation assessed by automatic quantification, junior and senior pathologists were 0.75, 0.55, and 0.61, respectively. Correlation between Tumor/Background ratio and Glut-1 assessed by automatic quantification was 0.74.Automatic quantification of immunostaining is a valuable tool to overcome inter- and intra-observer variability for correlation of cell proliferation or other markers with tumor tracer uptake.
