Effects of dog ownership in early childhood on immune development and atopic diseases. Exposure to pets in childhood has been associated with a reduced risk of wheezing and atopy.Our objective was to determine whether the effects of pet exposure on immune development and atopy in early childhood can be explained by alterations in exposure to innate immune stimuli in settled dust.Two hundred and seventy-five children at increased risk of developing allergic diseases were evaluated to age 3 years for pet ownership, blood cell cytokine responses, and atopy. Can f 1, Fel d 1, endotoxin, ergosterol, and muramic acid were measured in settled dust from 101 homes.Dog exposure at birth was associated with decreased atopic dermatitis (AD) (12% vs. 27% P=0.004) and wheezing (19% vs. 36%Exposure to dogs in infancy, and especially around the time of birth, is associated with changes in immune development and reductions in wheezing and atopy. These findings are not explained by exposure to endotoxin, ergosterol, or muramic acid.
