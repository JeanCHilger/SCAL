Personal radiation doses in PET/CT facility: measurements vs. calculations. The estimation of shielding requirement of a new positron emission tomography (PET) facility is essential. Because of penetrating annihilation photons, not only radiation safety in the vicinity of patients should be considered, but also rooms adjacent to uptake and imaging rooms should be taken into account. Before installing a PET/CT camera to nuclear medicine facilities of Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH), a typical PET imaging day was simulated using phantoms. Phantoms were filled with 300 +/- 36 MBq of (18)F isotope and dose rates were measured at 12 central locations in the laboratory. In addition to measurements, dose rates were also calculated using guidelines of AAPM Task Group 108. The relationship between the measured and calculated dose rates was found to be good and statistically significant, using Pearson's correlation test. The evaluated monthly doses were compared with personal dosemeter readings. AAPM's report gives practical tools for evaluation of radiation shielding. Calculations can be carried out successfully for existing hospital complexes too. However, calculations should be carried out carefully, because especially doors, windows and partitions can easily cause underestimation of shielding requirements as shown in this work.
