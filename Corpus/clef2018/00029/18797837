Rational imaging in locally advanced prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is one of the principal medical problems facing the male population in developed countries with an increasing need for sophisticated imaging techniques and risk-adapted treatment options. This article presents an overview of the current imaging procedures in the diagnosis of locally advanced prostate cancer. Apart from conventional gray-scale transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) as the most frequently used primary imaging modality we describe computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). CT and MRI not only allow assessment of prostate anatomy but also a specific evaluation of the pelvic region. Color-coded and contrast-enhanced ultrasound, real-time elastography, dynamic contrast enhancement in MR imaging, diffusion imaging, and MR spectroscopy may lead to a clinically relevant improvement in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. While bone scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-bisphosphonates is still the method of choice in the evaluation of bone metastasis, whole-body MRI and PET using (18)F-NaF, (18)F-FDG, (11)C-choline, (11)C-acetate, and (18)F-choline as tracers achieve higher sensitivities.
