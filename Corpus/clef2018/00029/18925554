30 years animal welfare legislation: where are the problems of application?. The contribution deals with legal structure, organization and problems of application of the Swiss animal welfare legislation of 1978. Besides positive effects considerable problems with the application of the legislation occurred, in particular in housing of bovines, swine and laying hens. Punishable acts of animal protection in companion and pet animals were markedly increasing in the last years, particularly in dogs. There were also loopholes in the legislation, which could be filled by the new animal welfare law of 2005 and the animal welfare ordinance of 2008 with only a few exceptions.
