A poison information service for small animals offered by a regional poison center. Since 1985 the Hennepin Regional Poison Center has provided the same quality service to veterinarians and pet owners that parents of small children, physicians and other health care providers have enjoyed for many years. To facilitate this service, the poison center has expanded its data base to include information on small animal poisonings and has periodically mailed newsletters state-wide to veterinarians. In addition, the poison center began to routinely assist per owners in the home treatment of minor ingestions in dogs, and enlisted the aid of a veterinary toxicologist who is on-call for consultation. Prior to 1985, animal-related exposures totaled 1,092 cases, which comprised 3.9% of the center's total annual cell volume. As a result of the above efforts, calls from veterinarians and pet owners increased to approximately 2,000 cases annually for the period 1986-88 (average 6.3%). Recently, the poison center received the financial support of the Minnesota State Veterinary Association for the printing of telephone stickers promoting a line exclusively for pet calls (337-PETS). This Pet Poison Information Service appears well received, resulting in an additional 58% increase in pet-related calls. During 1990 this center consulted on over 3,500 exposures in companion animals. Based on our experience, veterinarians and pet owners appear to have been relatively neglected by poison centers. Poison centers may play an important role in the treatment of poisonings in pets.
