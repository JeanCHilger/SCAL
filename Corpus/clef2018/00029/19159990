Prognostic value of myocardial perfusion-gated SPECT in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. There are no extensive series in which risk stratification of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (IC) is based on their rest and exercise and scintigraphic characteristics. The purpose of our study was to analyze rest and exercise myocardial perfusion-gated SPECT variables for prognosis in patients with ischemic IC.Prospective cohort study. A study was performed in 167 patients with IC who consecutively underwent rest myocardial perfusion-gated SPECT. In addition, stress SPECT was performed on 137 of these patients. During an average follow-up of 2.3 +/- 1.2 years, cardiac mortality (CM) was 17.4%. Independent predictors of CM in rest-gated SPECT were the positive criteria for myocardial viability (P = 0.027 Hazard risk, HR: 5.1Myocardial perfusion-gated SPECT improves prognostic stratification of patients with IC.
