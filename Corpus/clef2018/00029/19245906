The influence of (18)flourodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography on the management of gastroesophageal junction carcinoma. The influence of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with flourodeoxyglucose (FDG) on decision making for the treatment of patients with esophagogastric junction (EGJ) carcinoma is unclear as is the utility of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) as a prognostic indicator.This study was a retrospective review of EGJ carcinoma cases at a single institution during a 5-year period.FDG-PET altered treatment in 13 of 64 patients (20%). Of these, 21 patients had PET scans before and after undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) as well as surgery. Patients who had a decrease in SUV >50% had a 12-month disease-free survival advantage over patients a decrease in SUV <50% (93% vs 43%, P = .025).FDG-PET alters treatment in a significant number of patients with EGJ carcinoma. A >50% decrease in SUV after CRT is associated with an improved prognosis.
