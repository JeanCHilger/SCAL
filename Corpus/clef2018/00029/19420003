Repeated autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell therapy in patients with large myocardial infarction. We sought to determine whether repeat administration of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMC) can improve left ventricular function compared with a single infusion in patients with large acute myocardial infarction (AMI).Thirty-nine patients with a ST-elevation AMI of the anterior wall and a significantly decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 20-39%) were randomly assigned to three groups following primary percutaneous coronary intervention: Group A (n = 12) received a single intracoronary infusion of BMC (1.9 +/- 1.2 x 10(8)) at 3-7 days after AMI Group B (n = 15) received BMC administration both at 3-7 days (2.0 +/- 1.4 x 10(8)) and at 3 months (2.1 +/- 1.7 x 10(8))Data from this preliminary study suggest that repeated BMC administration might be a safe and feasible therapeutic strategy for patients with large AMI.
