Revelations from the unconscious: studying residual brain function in coma and related states. The purpose of our research is to contribute to a better understanding of the residual brain function of patients who survive an acute brain damage but remain in a coma, vegetative state, minimally conscious state or locked-in syndrome. The diagnosis, prognosis, therapy and medical management of these patients remain difficult. These studies are also of interest scientifically, as they help to elucidate the neural correlates of human consciousness. We here review our studies on bedside behavioral evaluation scales, electrophysiology and functional neuroimaging in these disorders of consciousness and conclude by discussing methodological and ethical issues and current concepts of the standards for care and quality of life in these challenging conditions.
