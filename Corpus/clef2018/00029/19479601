Imaging tumour-bearing animals using clinical scanners. We investigated the capability of small animal imaging in clinical scanners for cancer research focusing on positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).We summarise basic principles, benefits and drawbacks of imaging modalities and discuss issues associated with animal welfare during imaging and its related effects on imaging results based on data from literature supplemented by own experiences.MRI of tumour-bearing mice and rats in the clinical scanner is well-established for morphological and functional imaging in oncology. Clinical PET/CT did not yet establish as a research tool due to limited resolution and sensitivity, but its feasibility for tumour imaging has been demonstrated in mice. Anesthesia, animal handling and application of substances (e.g., contrast media) may alter animal physiology and, thus, also influence imaging results.Small animal imaging in clinical scanners offers good image quality and presents an alternative to dedicated small animal scanners for numerous applications in cancer research. Successful and meaningful small animal imaging in clinical as well as dedicated scanners prerequisites a thorough knowledge of animal morphology and physiology, a deep understanding of likely influences of animal manipulation on imaging and an adequate care for animal welfare.
