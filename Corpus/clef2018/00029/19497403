Hybrid imaging (SPECT/CT and PET/CT)--improving the diagnostic accuracy of functional/metabolic and anatomic imaging. In-line combined systems, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, allow an instant generation of fused images of scintigraphy and CT data. The accumulated clinical data on the use of these systems in various clinical scenarios indicate that this hybrid technology improves the diagnostic accuracy as compared to scintigraphy and CT alone and even to side-by-side interpretation of scintigraphy and CT, which were acquired separately. The improved diagnostic accuracy is reflected by improving image quality of SPECT and PET, detection of more clinically relevant lesions, better localization of disease and differentiation between physiologic and pathologic uptake, characterization of disease by its functional and morphologic appearance before and after therapy and accurate delineation of disease, optimizing biopsy and therapy planning.
