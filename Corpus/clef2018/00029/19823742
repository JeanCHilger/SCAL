Molecular probes for the in vivo imaging of cancer. Advancements in medical imaging have brought about unprecedented changes in the in vivo assessment of cancer. Positron emission tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, optical imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging are the primary tools being developed for oncologic imaging. These techniques may still be in their infancy, as recently developed chemical molecular probes for each modality have improved in vivo characterization of physiologic and molecular characteristics. Herein, we discuss advances in these imaging techniques, and focus on the major design strategies with which molecular probes are being developed.
