Nuclear scan studies in critical care. The field of nuclear cardiology has grown significantly over the past decade. This is a reflection of the value seen by providers in these safe and effective procedures. Nuclear scan studies are noninvasive and versatile in their usefulness. These studies assist in determining the likelihood of future cardiac events, guide approaches to revascularization, and assist in evaluation of the adequacy of revascularization procedures. Critical thinking and decision-making abilities are two key requirements for nurses in the critical care environment. Knowledge and understanding of the nuclear scan studies indicated for patients help nurses advocate for those in their care.
