A bullseye display of regional perfusion of the brain. The authors submit a method of viewing Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT images of the brain based on the principles of the myocardial bullseye or polar mapping. Commercially available software for the production of a myocardial bullseye display is suitable for the preparation of a bullseye display of regional perfusion image of the brain. This display facilitates the detection of cerebral cortical perfusion defects by displaying all SPECT oblique slices concentrically from base to vertex in a single image.
