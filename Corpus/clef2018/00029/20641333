1-(1-Phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylic acid [11C]methyl ester In the adrenocortex, 11β-hydroxylase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of cortisol and aldosterone. This enzyme can be overexpressed in adrenocortical carcinomas, which secrete excessive amounts of catecholamines and cortical hormone (1). However, some adrenal tumors appear unexpectedly as incidentalomas in computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound scans in 1-4% of patients (2). Most of these incidentalomas consist of benign, cortical, nonhypersecretory adenomas (3). Therefore, it is important to identify the malignant lesions in the incidentalomas for appropriate clinical treatments. Ketoconazole, etomidate and metomidate are potent inhibitors of 11β-hydroxylase (4, 5). [
