(2 Many diseases affect the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and imaging of pathological changes of adrenergic transmission has been an important area of radiopharmaceutical research (1, 2). Most postganglionic sympathetic neurons in the autonomic nervous system release the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE), which stimulates adrenergic receptors in various effector organs (3). There are different types and subtypes of adrenergic receptors, and they are characterized as Î±
