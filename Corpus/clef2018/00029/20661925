Cerebral β-amyloid detected by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission topography predisposes to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator-related hemorrhage. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) may be an important predisposing factor for the hemorrhagic complications of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) therapy. We studied patients treated within 3 hours of onset of ischemic stroke with rt-PA using positron emission tomography to compare Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) (a cerebral β-amyloid ligand) retention in those with and without parenchymal hemorrhage (PH) and normal controls. Neocortical PiB retention was higher among patients with PH compared with patients without PH and normal controls, suggesting underlying CAA as a predisposing factor for rt-PA-related hemorrhage. This finding may provide an impetus for the development of a more practical rapid pretreatment screening technique.
