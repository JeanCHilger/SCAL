 Hypoxic tumors are often resistant to radio- and chemotherapy, have a high metastatic potential, and predict a poor outcome for the cancer patient (1). Although several methods (invasive and noninvasive) are available for the detection of hypoxia in tumors, including the use of radiolabeled small molecules, but these methods are not completely reliable because they either yield variable diagnoses, have functional limitations, show incomplete penetration of tumors, do not detect hypoxia in all tumor types, etc (1, 2). A common feature of most solid cancerous tumor types is the presence of hypoxic conditions (3) and the overexpression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), a transmembrane cell surface enzyme that is known to regulate the pH and adhesion of tumor cells (4). Therefore, as an alternative to the currently available agents used to detect hypoxic tumors, targeting the CA IX as a hypoxia biomarker is of great interest to investigators (1-3, 5). As an alternative to small molecules, the chimeric monoclonal antibody (cMab) cG250, directed against the CA IX, was developed, labeled with
