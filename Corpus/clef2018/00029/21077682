Enhancement of plant essential oils' aqueous solubility and stability using alpha and beta cyclodextrin. Sodium benzoate has been shown to produce benzene in combination with ascorbic acid. This has led to research for safe alternatives from plant essential oils and parabens that have shown some antimicrobial activity, but many of these compounds exhibit poor solubility in aqueous solutions. Cyclodextrins can increase the solubility of many compounds. This work aimed to investigate the solubility of 23 plant essential oils and 4 parabens in water and an apple juice medium. Four of these compounds were chosen for their low aqueous solubility to determine if complexing the compound with α- and β-cyclodextrin would increase solubility. Three of the complexes were dissolved in an acidified aqueous solution and then studied in glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to determine if storage material would affect the stability. Solubility of the 27 compounds in distilled water ranged from 1.6 mg/L to 2460.6 mg/L and the solubility of 18 of the compounds decreased from 2.5 to 84.7% in apple juice medium (pH = 3.4, 12-13 °Brix). Complexation with cyclodextrin dramatically increased the solubility of the compounds, up to 10-fold. Packaging material had no effect on concentration of compounds present over 7 days. Cyclodextrins were able to increase solubility of these compounds to more suitable concentrations, and may lead to viable natural alternatives to sodium benzoate.
