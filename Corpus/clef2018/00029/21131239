Generalized 3-Hz spike-and-wave complexes emanating from focal epileptic activity in pediatric patients. We describe two pediatric patients with an uncommon electrophysiological seizure propagation pattern. Both had dialeptic seizures as the main or only symptom. Case 1 had a small mass in the left medial temporal structures case 2 had no lesion on magnetic resonance imaging. In both, the electroencephalogram showed not only left temporal spikes, but also bilaterally synchronous 3-Hz spike-and-wave complexes (SWCs) from onset and unusual secondarily generalized 3-Hz SWC patterns arising from the left temporal region. Case 1 was seizure free following resection of the mass
