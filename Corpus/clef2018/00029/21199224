Fixed dose (555 MBq 15 mCi) radioiodine for the treatment of hyperthyroidism: outcome and its predictors. Radioiodine therapy (RIT) is an accepted treatment for hyperthyroidism and a 555-MBq (15-mCi) dose is frequently used. We aimed to assess treatment outcome with this dose, and to identify predictors of successful treatment. An analysis of 478 treated patients demonstrated an overall four-month cure rate of 79.5% success rate was higher in patients with toxic multinodular goitre, solitary toxic adenoma, a smaller thyroid or less severe disease. This information may be of further assistance if variation in the dose of RIT is considered.
