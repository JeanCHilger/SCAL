PET/CT in gynecologic cancer: present applications and future prospects--a clinician's perspective. This article briefly reviews the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of the common gynecologic malignancies, with an emphasis on the shortcomings of current clinical practice. The persistent need to achieve early diagnosis, adjust proper treatment, enhance surveillance, and improve the outcome of these patients has led to the development of new diagnostic modalities. Novel tools such as 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT should aim at enhancing the clinician's ability to make critical decisions in treating difficult scenarios.
