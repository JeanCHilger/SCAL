Radiological assessment of gynecologic malignancies. Patients with gynecologic malignancies are evaluated with a combination of imaging modalities including ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. US has a primary role in detecting and characterizing endometrial and adnexal pathology. CT is one of the primary modalities in staging malignancy and detecting recurrence. MR imaging is characterized by superior contrast resolution and specificity. This article reviews the role of radiologic imaging for the characterization of gynecologic masses and for staging, planning, and monitoring treatment, as well as for the assessment of tumor recurrence of the most common gynecologic malignancies.
