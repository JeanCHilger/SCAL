Metabolic response of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes during radiotherapy for carcinoma of the uterine cervix: using positron emission tomography/computed tomography. We evaluated the metabolic response of lymph nodes (LNs) using consecutive F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and correlated the metabolic response with the volumetric response measured by consecutive CT.Twenty-two patients with cervical cancer that had positive LNs underwent preradiotherapy (pre-RT) and inter-RT PET/CT. The metabolic response of the LNs was assessed quantitatively and semiquantitatively by measurement of the maximal standardized uptake value. All patients underwent inter-RT CT simulation after 45 Gy to the whole pelvis and inter-RT PET/CT scans after median 63 Gy to the gross LNs.A total of 48 pelvic and para-aortic LNs were found on the pre-RT PET/CT. The mean maximal standardized uptake value of nodal disease decreased from the pre-RT of 5.2 (SD, 3.1 range, 1.8-15.6) to the inter-RT of 1.1 (SD, 2.1We suggest that the PET/CT can be a useful tool for the evaluation of the interim response of the LNs and aid in selecting patients that need further treatment. The results showed a significant correlation between the metabolic and volumetric responses during RT, although the anatomical changes of LNs would not always represent the metabolic status.
