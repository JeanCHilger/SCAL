Rational design of hybrid graphene films for high-performance transparent electrodes. Transparent, flexible conducting films were fabricated by using a metallic grid and graphene hybrid film. Transparent electrodes using the hybrid film and transparent substrate such as glass or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films were assembled. The sheet resistance of the fabricated transparent electrodes was as low as 3 Ω/◻ with the transmittance at ∼80%. At 90% transmittance, the sheet resistance was ∼20 Ω/◻. Both values are among the highest for transparent electrode materials to date. The materials used for the new hybrid electrode are earth-abundant stable elements, which increase their potential usefulness for replacement of indium tin oxide (ITO) in many applications.
