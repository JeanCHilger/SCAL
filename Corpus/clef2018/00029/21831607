A 4-year dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging study in neuroleptic-naive first episode schizophrenia patients. Alterations in the dopaminergic system have long been implicated in schizophrenia. A key component in dopaminergic neurotransmission is the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT). To date, there have been no longitudinal studies evaluating the course of DAT in schizophrenia. A 4-year follow-up study was therefore conducted in which single photon emission computed tomography was used to measure DAT binding in 14 patients and 7 controls. We compared the difference over time in [(123)I] FP-CIT striatal/occipital uptake ratios (SOUR) between patients and controls and the relationship between this difference and both symptomatology and functional outcome at follow-up. We also calculated the relationship between baseline SOUR, symptoms and functional outcome at follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between patients' SOUR changes over time and those of controls. A significant negative correlation was observed between patients' SOUR changes over time and negative symptomatology at follow-up. A significant negative correlation was also found between baseline SOUR in patients and negative symptomatology, and there was a significant association between lower SOUR at baseline and poor outcome. Although the study found no overall differences in DAT binding during follow-up between schizophrenia patients and controls, it demonstrated that differences in DAT binding relate to patients' characteristics at follow-up.
