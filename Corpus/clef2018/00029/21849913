The role of positron emission tomography with computed tomography in the follow-up of asymptomatic cutaneous malignant melanoma patients with a high risk of disease recurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of [F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as a surveillance tool in asymptomatic patients with primary cutaneous melanoma with the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 3 disease. Thirty-four patients with primary cutaneous malignant melanoma with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 3 disease, who underwent at least one annual surveillance PET/CT scan, were retrospectively identified from our PET Centre Database in May 2008 and their characteristics, PET/CT results and disease course were reviewed. In 20 patients with microscopic stage 3 disease at diagnosis, annual surveillance PET/CT detected two of three recurrences and detected one incidental breast carcinoma. In 14 patients with macroscopic stage 3 disease at, or subsequent to, their initial diagnosis, annual PET/CT detected four of four recurrences, detected metastases in one patient who remains asymptomatic and detected one incidental thyroid carcinoma. PET/CT seems to be a useful surveillance tool in patients with macroscopic stage 3 disease, although the numbers in this study are small. However, the role of PET/CT in patients initially presenting with microscopic stage 3 disease requires further confirmation.
