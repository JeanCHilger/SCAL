A new N-methyl thymine derivative comprising a dihydroxyisobutenyl unit as ligand for thymidine kinase of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1 TK). Molecular modeling and phosphorylation assay in vitro were employed to select a novel unsaturated 1,3-dihydroxyisobutenyl thymine derivative 6 as ligand for HSV-1 TK which may be of interest as lead for the development of an positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent. Compound 6 was successfully prepared using modified approaches. A significant improvement over the syntheses involving pathways A and B (1% and 3% overall yield, respectively), was observed using synthetic route C (14% overall yield).
