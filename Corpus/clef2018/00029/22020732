Heterogeneity in relaxation of different sized porcine coronary arteries to nitrovasodilators: role of PKG and MYPT1. The present study was to determine the role of the type I isoform of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG I) and its downstream effector myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) in the responses of different sized coronary arteries to nitrovasodilators. Relaxations of isolated porcine coronary arteries were determined by isometric tension recording technique. Protein levels of PKG I and its effectors were analyzed by Western blotting. The activities of PKG I and MYPT1 were studied by analyzing phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and MYPT1, respectively. Nitroglycerin, DETA NONOate, and 8-Br-cGMP caused greater relaxations in large than in small coronary arteries. Relaxations were attenuated to a greater extent by Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS (a PKG inhibitor) in large vs. small arteries. The expressions of PKG I and MYPT1 in large arteries were more abundant than in small arteries. DETA NONOate stimulated phosphorylation of VASP at Ser239 and inhibited phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr853 to a greater extent in large than in small arteries. A suppressed phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr853 was caused by 8-Br-cGMP in large but not small arteries, which was inhibited by Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS. These results suggest that the greater responsiveness of large coronary arteries to nitrovasodilators result in part from greater activities of PKG I and MYPT1. Dysfunction in nitric oxide signaling is implicated in the vulnerability of large coronary arteries to certain disorders such as atherosclerosis and spasm. Augmentation of PKG I-MYPT1 signaling may be of therapeutic benefit for combating these events.
