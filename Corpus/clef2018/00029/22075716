Age-related changes in pre- and postmenopausal women investigated with 18F-fluoride PET--a preliminary study. To evaluate the relationship between age and regional skeletal uptake at sites consisting of either predominantly trabecular or cortical bone using (18)F-fluoride positron emission tomography (PET) in pre- and postmenopausal women.Thirty-two women (40.6 ± 12.3 years age range 25-72 years) were assigned to one of two groups: group 1 comprised 22 premenopausal women (33 ± 6.5 yearsThe SUVmax (mean ± SD) was 1.2 ± 0.5 in the humeral shaft and 4.7 ± 1.0 in the lumbar spine. The SUVmax in the humeral shaft correlated significantly with advancing age (r = 0.67, P < 0.01). The SUVmax in the lumbar spine declined significantly with advancing age (r = -0.50, P < 0.01). The humeral shaft of women in group 1 exhibited a significantly lower SUVmax compared to that in group 2 (1.1 ± 0.4 versus 1.6 ± 0.6 P < 0.05). On the other hand, the lumbar spine of women in group 1 exhibited a significantly higher SUVmax compared to that in group 2 (5.1 ± 0.7 versus 4.0 ± 1.1Semiquantitative analysis with (18)F-fluoride PET might be a useful tool for analyzing age-related changes in pre- and postmenopausal women.
