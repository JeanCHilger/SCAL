Emerging role of whole-body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography as a marker of disease activity in patients with sarcoidosis: a systematic review. This study was designed to systematically review the emerging role of whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in patients with sarcoidosis.A comprehensive literature search of published studies through December 2010 in PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase databases regarding whole-body FDG-PET and PET/CT in patients with sarcoidosis was performed.Ultimately, we identified nine studies comprising a total of 379 patients with sarcoidosis. Main findings of the included studies are presented.from this systematic review we can summarize that: (1) positive FDG-PET findings should be interpreted with caution in differentiating sarcoidosis from other inflammatory diseases and malignant abnormalities (2) FDG-PET seems to be a very useful molecular imaging method in assessing disease activity, in staging and identifying occult sites, and in monitoring treatment response in patients with sarcoidosis
