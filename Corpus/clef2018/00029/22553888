1- The β-glucuronidase (β-GUS EC 3.2.1.31) is a lysosomal enzyme that is known to activate prodrugs (PDs) for the treatment of cancer. β-GUS has been used to track the path of gene delivery vehicles, and there is evidence that it can be used as a tumor marker (1). The primary function of the enzyme is to catalyze the hydrolysis of β-glucuronic acid residues from the cell-surface glycosaminoglycans for normal restructuring of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (2), and the enzyme is believed to participate in the processes of angiogenesis, cancer metastasis, and inflammation (3). Normal tissues have low levels of β-GUS in the ECM, but tissues under pathological stress, such as bacterial infection, fibrosis, and malignancy, show elevated levels of the enzyme (4). Intracellular β-GUS is released from necrotic cells, and its activity in these lesions has been used to activate anti-cancer PDs
