Methyl ester of 1- The β-glucuronidase (β-GUS EC 3.2.1.31) is a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of β-glucuronic acid residues from the cell-surface glycosaminoglycans for normal reconstruction of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (1), and the enzyme is believed to participate in the processes of angiogenesis, cancer metastasis, and inflammation (2). The β-GUS is known to activate prodrugs (PDs) for the treatment of cancer. β-GUS also has been used to track the path of gene delivery vehicles, and there is evidence that it can be used as a biomarker to detect cancerous tumors (3). Normal tissues have low levels of β-GUS in the ECM, but tissues under pathological stress, such as bacterial infection, fibrosis, and malignancy, show elevated levels of the enzyme (4). As a result of cell lysis, intracellular β-GUS is released from the necrotic parts of neoplastic tumors, and its activity in these lesions has been utilized for the
