18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with amyloid light-chain amyloidosis: case-series and literature review. To describe FDG-PET/CT in amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis.We describe a French multicenter study which included patients with AL amyloidosis who had undergone a FDG-PET/CT during follow-up.Ten patients with AL amyloidosis (median age 62 years [59-85]) were analyzed. AL amyloidosis was of Î»-type in 7/10 cases (70%) and localized amyloidosis in 4/10 cases (40%). AL amyloidosis was primary in 7/10 (70%) cases and associated with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (n = 2) and plasmocytoma (n = 1) in the remaining cases. Median delay between diagnosis and PET was 1 month [0-51]. PET was positive in seven (70%) patients and showed a median FDG SUV of 6.5 [ 4-15 ]. FDG uptakes with positive PET were localized in seven patients, namely in the nasopharynx (n = 3), bronchopulmonary (n = 2), duodenal, cutaneous, bone, joint and muscular areas (n = 1, each). FDG uptakes on PET were concordant with the known organ impairment in 6/7 cases (86%) and showed unknown nasopharyngeal and mesenteric localization in one case each. PET was negative in the patient with cardiac amyloidosis and two patients with pulmonary amyloidosis.High FDG uptake may be present in patients with AL amyloidosis, however prospective studies are needed in order to determine the place of FDG PET in AL amyloidosis.
