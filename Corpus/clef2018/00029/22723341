Indexing severity of diabetic foot infection with 99mTc-WBC SPECT/CT hybrid imaging. Management of diabetic foot infection (DFI) has been hampered by limited means of accurately classifying disease severity. New hybrid nuclear/computed tomography (CT) imaging techniques elucidate a combination of wound infection parameters not previously evaluated as outcome prognosticators. Our aim is to determine if a novel standardized hybrid image-based scoring system, Composite Severity Index (CSI), has prognostic value in DFI.Masked retrospective (99m)Tc-white blood cell (WBC) single photon emission CT (SPECT)/CT image interpretation and independent chart review of 77 patients (101 feet) suspected of DFI-associated osteomyelitis at a large municipal hospital between January 2007 and July 2009. CSI scores were correlated with probability of favorable outcome (no subsequent amputation/readmission after therapeutic intervention) during median 342-day follow-up.CSI ranged from 0-13. Receiver operating characteristic accuracy for predicting favorable outcome was 0.79 (optimal cutoff CSI, ≤2 odds ratio of therapeutic failure for CSI >2, 15.1 [95% CI 4.4-51.5]). CSI of 0 had a 92% chance of favorable outcome, which fell progressively to 25% as indices rose to ≥7. Image-based osteomyelitis versus no osteomyelitis assessment was less accurate than CSI at predicting outcome (P = 0.016). In patients with intermediate severity (CSI 3-6), treatment failure decreased from 68 to 36% when antibiotic duration was extended to ≥42 days (P = 0.026).(99m)Tc-WBC SPECT/CT hybrid image-derived wound infection parameters incorporated into a standardized scoring system, CSI, has prognostic value in DFI.
