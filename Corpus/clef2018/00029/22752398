Subjective estimations of thermal environment in recreational urban spaces--part 2: international comparison. The present paper is the second part of our study in which we compare the results obtained in Szeged (Hungary) with those achieved through earlier outdoor thermal comfort projects based on simultaneous questionnaire surveys and on-site meteorological measurements. The main characteristics of the selected studies--conducted in Hungary, Sweden, Portugal, Canada, Taiwan and across Europe in the frame of project RUROS--are reviewed, emphasizing the common features and also the discrepancies in the applied methodology. We discuss their potential effects on the evolution and interpretation of the results concerning the subjective assessment of the thermal environment. Another aspect of the comparison focuses on the regional climatic differences naturally ensuing from the various locations, which left their marks on the results related to both physiological acclimatization and mental adaptation. The compared results of different studies include correlation coefficients expressing interrelationships between the different aspects of subjective estimations (thermal sensation, perceptions, preferences) and also between subjective assessments and the corresponding meteorological parameters. We compare neutral temperatures (expressed in physiological equivalent temperature, PET) which arose for Taiwan and Hungary, as well as thermal sensation zones for local inhabitants. Subjectively assessed temperature values of Sweden and Hungarians are analyzed according to the measured air temperature. According to our experiences the methodology should be standardized for the level of field surveys and also for the level of data processing in order to make the data collected in different locations comparable.
