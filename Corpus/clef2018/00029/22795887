Salmonella paratyphi B and Salmonella litchfield outbreaks associated with pet turtle exposure in Spain. Salmonellosis is an important public health problem. Turtles are increasingly involved in the role of transmitters of this infection to humans.Salmonella cases are reported to the local Surveillance Agency where interviews are carried out to address possible exposures. Molecular epidemiology techniques were used to identify species.In this article we report two examples of this type of infection in two places, 300 km apart in Spain. In Barcelona a turtle transmitted the disease to a small baby via her mother, and in Castellón 5 related cases of Salmonella infections were detected, and all were transmitted by imported turtles. Molecular epidemiology techniques confirmed the turtle-person transmissions and showed strong relationships between cases in Castellón and Barcelona.These examples represent the tip of the iceberg of what is happening with pet reptiles as regards transmission of this infection. We believe that it is important to assess the impact of this type of infection in each country, in order to subsequently promote prevention strategies such as: regulations for pet shops, and educating/informing families who buy reptiles as pets.
