Diagnostic accuracy of 123 I-FP-CIT SPECT in diagnosing drug-induced parkinsonism: a prospective study. Drug-induced parkinsonism is a major type of parkinsonism in our setting. Symptoms usually disappear after discontinuation of the drug. However, they may persist in patients with a variant known as subclinical drug-exacerbated parkinsonism early identification of this entity has important prognostic and therapeutic implications. The most widely used complementary test in this diagnosis is single-photon emission computed tomography with ioflupane ((123)I), also known as (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT. The aim of our study is to verify its diagnostic accuracy.We designed a prospective study of patients with drug-induced parkinsonism in which, after discontinuing the drug and undergoing a (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT scan, patients would be monitored for at least 6 months. Patients were categorised as having iatrogenic parkinsonism if symptoms disappeared, or as having subclinical drug-exacerbated parkinsonism if they persisted. Lastly, we verified concordance between the clinical diagnosis and results from the (123)I- FP-CIT SPECT scan.The sample included 19 patients. The most commonly prescribed drug class was neuroleptic agents. For the diagnosis of both subgroups, (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT showed a sensitivity of 66.7%, specificity and positive predictive value of 100%, a negative predictive value of 86.7%, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.33.Although the study needs to be repeated in a larger sample of patients, (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT is useful in the diagnosis of drug-induced parkinsonism since it is a very precise tool for identifying patients with that illness.
