A novel alpha-galactosidase from Arthrobacter sp. GN14 isolated from Grus nigricollis feces: gene cloning, heterologous expression and characterization. Cloning and heterologously expressing the alpha-galactosidase gene (agaAGN14) from Arthrobacter sp. GN14 isolated from feces of black-neck crane (Grus nigricollis).The full-length agaAGN14 was cloned based on degenerate PCR and GC TAIL-PCR (thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR), ligated into pET-28a (+) vector and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The recombinant alpha-galactosidase (rAgaAGN14) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by Ni(2+)-NTA metal chelating affinity chromatography, and then the enzyme characterizations were determined. Amino acids sequences of agaAGN14 (AgaAGN14) and alpha-galactosidases from Actinobacteria and gastrointestinal microorganisms were aligned and used for constructing a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree.The 2109-bp full-length agaAGN14 (66.8% GC content) encodes a 702-residue polypeptide (AgaAGN14 77.5 kDa). AgaAGN14 showed the highest identity of 53.7% with alpha-galactosidases in public databases, and < 43% identities with alpha-galactosidases from gastrointestinal microorganisms. AgaAGN14 was put in a phylogenetic branch sharing the catalytic motifs KWD and SDXXDXXXR, and close to alpha-galactosidases from soil microorganisms and far from alpha-galactosidases from gastrointestinal microorganisms. The purified rAgaAGN14 efficiently hydrolyzed pNPG, raffinose, melibiose, stachyose, rapeseed meal and cottonseed mealThe Arthrobacter strain isolated from feces of Grus nigricollis, and the sequence analysis, phylogenetic analysis, heterologous expression and recombinant enzyme's biochemical characterizations of an alpha-galactosidase from Arthrobacter strain were first reported. rAgaAGN14 was a novel alpha-galactosidase.
