Differential effects of predosing on tumor and tissue uptake of an 111In-labeled anti-TENB2 antibody-drug conjugate. TENB2, also known as tomoregulin or transmembrane protein with epidermal growth factor-like and 2 follistatin-like domains, is a transmembrane proteoglycan overexpressed in human prostate tumors. This protein is a promising target for antimitotic monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE)-based antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy. Nonlinear pharmacokinetics in normal mice suggested that antigen expression in normal tissues may contribute to targeted mediated disposition. We evaluated a predosing strategy with unconjugated antibody to block ADC uptake in target-expressing tissues in a mouse model while striving to preserve tumor uptake and efficacy.Unconjugated, unlabeled antibody was preadministered to mice bearing the TENB2-expressing human prostate explant model, LuCaP 77, followed by a single administration of (111)In-labeled anti-TENB2-MMAE for biodistribution and SPECT/CT studies. A tumor-growth-inhibition study was conducted to determine the pharmacodynamic consequences of predosing.Preadministration of anti-TENB2 at 1 mg/kg significantly increased blood exposure of the radiolabeled ADC and reduced intestinal, hepatic, and splenic uptake while not affecting tumor accretion. Similar tumor-to-heart ratios were measured by SPECT/CT at 24 h with and without the predose. Consistent with this, the preadministration of 0.75 mg/kg did not interfere with efficacy in a tumor-growth study dosed at 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg of ADC per kilogram.Overall, the potential to mask peripheral, nontumor antigen uptake while preserving tumor uptake and efficacy could ameliorate toxicity and may significantly affect future dosing strategies for ADCs.
