Radiation dosimetry and biodistribution of the hypoxia tracer (18)F-EF5 in oncologic patients. The primary goals of this study were to determine the biodistribution and excretion of (18)F-EF5 in oncologic patients, to estimate the radiation-absorbed dose and to determine the safety of this drug.Sixteen patients with histologically confirmed malignancy received a mean intravenous infusion of 217  MBq (range 107-364  MBq) of (18)F-EF5. Over a 4-6-hour period, four to five serial positron emission tomography (PET) or PET/computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained. To calculate the radiation dosimetry estimates, volumes of interest were drawn over the source organs for each PET scan or on the CT for each PET/CT scan. Serial blood samples were obtained to measure (18)F-EF5 blood clearance. Bladder-wall dose was calculated based on urine activity measurements.The urinary bladder received the largest radiation-absorbed dose, 0.12 ± 0.034 mSv/MBq (mean ± SD). The average effective dose equivalent and the effective dose of (18)F-EF5 were 0.021 ± 0.003 mSv/MBq and 0.018 ± 0.002 mSv/MBq, respectively. (18)F-EF5 was well tolerated in all subjects.(18)F-EF5 was demonstrated to be safe for patients, and the radiation exposure is clinically acceptable. As with any radiotracer with primary excretion in the urine, the bladder-wall dose can be minimized by active hydration and frequent voiding.
