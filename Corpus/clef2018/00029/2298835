Changes in sensory-cognitive input: effects on cerebral blood flow. Eight healthy right-handed young men were subjected to local CBF measurement by [15O]water and positron emission tomography during partial sensory deprivation and during sensory-cognitive activation physiological, hormonal, and subjective stress measurements were also performed. Results indicated that (a) "whole-brain" CBF increased during activation
