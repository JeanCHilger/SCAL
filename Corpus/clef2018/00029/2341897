Design and performance of POSICAM 6.5 BGO positron camera. A high-resolution, whole-body positron camera, POSICAM 6.5 BGO, has been designed, built, and tested results from it are presented. The camera utilizes 1,320 BGO crystals and 720 PMTS in a staggered geometry to produce high resolution of 5.8 mm FWHM and 21 image planes simultaneously. The axial resolution of the camera is measured at 11.9 mm at the center. High axial sampling is achieved with 5.125 mm separation of the image planes such that three-dimensional imaging of an object can be carried out in a single scan. Recovery of volumetric distribution of radioactivity and object dimensions in axial and sagittal views is demonstrated by imaging spherical objects 13 mm to 39 mm in diameter.
