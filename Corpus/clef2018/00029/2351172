Production of carrier-free 66Ga and labeling of antimyosin antibody for positron imaging of acute myocardial infarction. A method for labeling monoclonal antimyosin antibodies with 66Ga is described. The radionuclide is a positron emitter (t1/2: 9.4h) produced by means of the 63Cu (4He, n) 66Ga reaction. Purification of the 66Ga from the copper target is described in detail. Monoclonal antimyosin antibodies are labeled with 66Ga at a high yield (99%) by transcomplexation from an acetate buffer with the diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA)-labeled antibody and preliminary evaluated in two dogs for imaging of myocardial necrosis by positron emission tomography.
