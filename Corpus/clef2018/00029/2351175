Reproducibility of cerebral glucose utilization measured by PET and the [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose method in resting, healthy human subjects. The stability of cerebral glucose utilization was examined in nine right-handed, healthy men (age, 24.88 +/- 2.93 years) using positron emission tomography (PET) and the [18F]-fluorodeoxglucose (FDG) method. Each study was run twice at intervals of 1-12 weeks with the subject at rest. The average cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRGlu) was 5.40 +/- 0.71 mg/100 g per min (coefficient of variance, 13.08). The average intraindividual variation of CMRGlu was 7.91% +/- 15.46% (P = 0.13). Metabolic indices (MI: regional/mean cortical CMRGlu) were used to determine the regional cerebral metabolic distribution. The interindividual (coefficient of variance, 7.13) and intraindividual variabilities (average variation, -0.12% +/- 8.76%) of MI were smaller than those of metabolic rates. No reproducible significant asymmetry was observed. The FDG method used with subjects at rest thus yields low intraindividual variability of both cerebral glucose consumption and regional metabolic distribution, even at an interval of several weeks. Cerebral glucose utilization measured under such conditions may act as a reliable reference for determination of the influences of physiological (activation), pharmacological or pathological processes on cerebral glucose metabolism.
