SPECT of the brain using 99mTc-HMPAO in patients with cerebrovascular disease: a comparison with CT. A report of 100 cases. In a retrospective study the sensitivity of SPECT and CT in detecting changes in cerebrovascular disease is compared, based on a group of one hundred patients. The higher sensitivity of SPECT with regard to right-positive results, especially in TIA and PRIND and the markedly lower number of false-negative results are underlined and discussed. The fact that both methods reveal only a slight sensitivity regarding the detection of changes in the basal regions of the brain is also pointed out, with SPECT proving to be the more sensitive of the two methods.
