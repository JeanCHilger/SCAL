Alteration of FHR pattern and cerebral metabolic rate of glucose of the fetus measured by positron emission tomography during progress of acidemia. The significance of overshoot acceleration in FHR. In order to investigate the significance of overshoot acceleration in FHR with acidosis induced by serial cord compression, cerebral glucose metabolic rate (CMRglc) was measured in four chronically instrumented fetuses before cord compression and immediately after appearance of the overshoot acceleration in FHR. The investigation of CMRglc was carried out using positron emission tomography to assess accumulation of cyclotron-produced F18-FDG in the fetal brain. CMRglc in the fetal brain in the nonacidemic condition was 1.73 mg/100 g/min. In acidemia, with fetal arterial pH near 7.15 in which FHR showed the characteristic pattern with overshoot acceleration, CMRglc was significantly decreased to 0.73 mg/100 g/min. We concluded that, to avoid neuronal damage, it is necessary to intervene when the fetal condition deteriorates to the extent that overshoot acceleration in FHR occurs.
