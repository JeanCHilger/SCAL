The diagnostic role of nuclear medicine in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. This paper is a review of (a) the pathophysiology of the autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and (b) the diagnostic procedures nuclear medicine has to evaluate human immunodeficiency virus related disorders. This article is organized in an organ system approach to AIDS pathology. The application of [67Ga]citrate, 111In-labeled white blood cells, [201Tl]chloride, single photon emission computed tomographic, and positron emission tomographic brain agents, [99mTc]sulfur colloid and [99mTc]methylene diphosphonate to the pulmonary, nervous, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, and renal systems is discussed. These radioisotopes allow earlier diagnosis than routine radiographic studies, and can monitor the effect of therapy on disease activity. In this review an attempt is made to provide clinically useful algorithms to suggest a specific pathogen based on the pattern of radionuclidic uptake.
