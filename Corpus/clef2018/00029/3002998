Comparison of 68Ga-EDTA, [1-11 C]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, and [99mTc]sodium pertechnetate in an experimental blood-brain barrier lesion. Unilateral opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in rats, induced by infusion of a hyperosmotic solution of mannitol into the left internal carotid artery, was applied to compare 68Ga-EDTA, [1-11C]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (using the long-lived 14C-labeled analog), and [9mTc]sodium pertechnetate as agents for diagnosis of BBB disruption. Of the three agents and two time intervals studied, 68Ga-EDTA at 30 min postinjection gave the highest target-to-nontarget ratio. In addition, 68Ga-EDTA, unlike commonly used [99mTc]sodium pertechnetate, can be used in conjunction with positron emission tomography, which could make possible earlier and better assessment of BBB defects using 68Ga-EDTA.
