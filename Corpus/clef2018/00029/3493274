PET study of methionine accumulation in glioma and normal brain tissue: competition with branched chain amino acids. Five patients with glioma were examined with positron emission tomography using ([11C]methyl)-L-methionine. The study was repeated while the patient was being infused with branched chain amino acids (BCAA), 250 mumol/min. The accumulation rates of methionine in tumor tissue and in normal brain tissue were compared without and with the infusion of amino acids. Both tumor tissue and normal brain tissue showed a reduction in the methionine accumulation by 35% while the patient received the infusion. In one patient with a severe blood-tissue barrier disruption the tumor accumulation rate was unaffected. It is concluded that in gliomas without severe blood-tissue barrier disruption, the accumulation of methionine is governed by processes exhibiting similar properties regarding competition with BCAA as in normal brain tissue.
