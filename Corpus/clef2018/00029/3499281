Kock continent ileal urinary reservoir. Anatomy and potential pitfalls of radionuclide imaging. The Kock continent ileal urinary reservoir (Kock pouch) is a new form of urinary diversion that, due to its advantages over previous techniques of urinary bypass, will probably become widespread in urologic practice. When bone imaging is performed in the presence of the Kock pouch, the unusual configuration of the pouch may obscure or simulate osseous lesions. An understanding of the surgical anatomy as well as the planar and SPECT scintigraphic appearances of the Kock pouch is necessary to avoid errors during interpretation. This series of 51 bone images reports on the variable scintigraphic appearance of the Kock pouch. In addition, the incidence and type of potentially avoidable pitfalls in the interpretation of bone imaging when this form of urinary diversion is used are evaluated.
