Trazodone treatment response in obsessive-compulsive disorder--correlated with shifts in glucose metabolism in the caudate nuclei. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe psychiatric illness that is difficult to treat. The effects of trazodone hydrochloride treatment were studied, both with and without the addition of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, in OCD patients. Changes in symptoms correlated with changes in local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (LCMRGlc), as measured by positron emission tomography and the 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose method. All patients whose OCD responded favorably to drug treatment showed a relative increase in glucose metabolism in the heads of the caudate nuclei compared with the metabolic rate in the ipsilateral hemisphere as a whole (ratio LCMRGlc caudate/LCMRGlc hemisphere). Patients who did not respond to treatment did not show an increase in this ratio, and the difference between responders and nonresponders was significant (p less than 0.03). Changes in the ratio LCMRGlc caudate/LCMRGlc hemisphere correlated with changes on OCD and depression rating scales.
