Risks of pet ownership. The family practitioner's viewpoint. In this article, I have tried to give the reader some idea of the variety and the magnitude of problems that exist with pet-related ailments and to present some suggestions as to possible solutions. A recent editorial in a medical journal was titled "Caution: Pets May Be Hazardous to Your Health." Although it is a very appropriate warning, I doubt whether we will ever get it printed on the sides of all pets. Rather, it will be up to us in the medical and veterinary communities to educate the population about the risks of pet ownership and to keep ourselves educated about the problem. That way we can more readily recognize pet-related ailments and provide the appropriate care.
