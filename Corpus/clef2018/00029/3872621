In vivo measurement of brain tumor pH using [11C]DMO and positron emission tomography. In vivo measurements of regional brain tissue/tumor pH (rpH) have been accomplished in 9 patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors using [11C]dimethyloxazolidinedione [( 11C]DMO) and positron emission tomography. Tumor rpH values ranged from 6.88 to 7.26, whereas gray matter and white matter rpH values ranged from 6.74 to 7.09 and from 6.77 to 7.03, respectively. Our results, which are consistent with reported [14C]DMO autoradiographic measurements of brain and tumor pH, suggest that the pH microenvironment of brain tumors is not more "acidic" than that of normal gray or white matter.
