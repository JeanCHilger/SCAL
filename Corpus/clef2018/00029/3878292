The measurement of radiation doses from P32 chromic phosphate therapy of the peritoneum using SPECT. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has been shown to be of value in estimating the radiation dose to the peritoneum from 32P therapy. Simple dosimetry calculations, assuming uniform irradiation of tissue, indicate that radiation doses of approximately 40 Gy to the peritoneal surface are achieved. However, the images show that the radionuclide distribution is non-uniform, giving rise to radiation dose variations of at least a factor of 10.
