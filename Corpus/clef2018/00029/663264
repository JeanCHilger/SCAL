A multislice positron emission computed tomograph (PETT IV) yielding transverse and longitudinal images. We designed, built, and tested a positron emission tomograph (PETT IV) capable of providing seven slices of the human body simultaneously. PETT IV utilizes a moving hexagonal array of 48 scintillation detectors placed around the subject. Each detector consists of a cylindrical activated sodium iodide crystal optically coupled to two photomultiplier tubes. The multislice capability is achieved by comparing the light outputs of the two photomultiplier tubes in each detector. The images are displayed either as transverse or as longitudinal tomographic sections. This system provides high sensitivity and resolution, and permits rapid and accurate three-dimensional imaging of the head and body.
