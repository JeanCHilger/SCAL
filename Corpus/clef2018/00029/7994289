Synthesis, radiolabelling and stability of radioiodinated m-iodobenzylguanidine, a review. Since the introduction of radioiodinated m-iodobenzylguanidine in 1980, much research has been performed, both in the chemical field as well as in medical sciences. This paper reviews the synthesis, radiolabelling and stability of radioiodinated m-iodobenzylguanidine. Regarding the many radiolabelling procedures for m-iodobenzylguanidine, the Cu(1+)-assisted nucleophilic exchange radioiodination can be considered as the method of first choice. Quality control of the radiopharmaceutical product is discussed and attention is paid to recent studies regarding the radiochemical stability of iodine-131 labelled m-iodobenzylguanidine.
