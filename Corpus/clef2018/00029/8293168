Functional imaging of the central nervous system using magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. There have been striking advances recently in magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the central nervous system, particularly in the area of "functional" imaging. We discuss these advances with emphasis on the similarities and differences between the PET and magnetic resonance imaging methods. In addition, we examine recent progress and controversies in the use of volume-localized nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Finally, we review the use of three-dimensional acquisition for PET studies, with an evaluation of the relative advantages and disadvantages of this modification of the PET technique.
