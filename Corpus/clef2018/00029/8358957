Brain sonography, computed tomography, and single-photon emission computed tomography in term neonates with perinatal asphyxia. The clinical diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in neonates can be supported by radiologic studies including cranial sonography, computed tomography (CT), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. The role of cranial sonography, CT, and SPECT in term neonates with perinatal asphyxia is reviewed in this article.
