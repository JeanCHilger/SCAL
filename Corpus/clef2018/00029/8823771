Imaging of cerebral metastases. MR imaging with intravenous gadolinium has greatly enhanced our ability to detect and delineate intracranial metastases as well as to differentiate them from other disease processes. Techniques such as magnetization transfer and triple dose gadolinium imaging have further improved lesion detection. Consideration of these radiologic techniques, including the issues and controversies of screening and cost effectiveness, suggests a reasonable approach to imaging patients with possible intracranial metastases. Newer modalities such as echo planar imaging, spectroscopy, PET, and SPECT, may in the future, prove to be very useful in the evaluation of patients with intracranial metastases. Proper imaging is also critical to appropriate diagnosis and management of meningeal metastases, calvarial metastases, and paraneoplastic disease.
