The use of dobutamine stress echocardiography for the determination of myocardial viability. Determining the presence of viable myocardium has prognostic and therapeutic implications in the treatment of ischemic heart disease. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is one possible technique to help identify both hibernating and stunned but viable myocardium. Low-dose dobutamine infusion has an increased inotropic effect, while higher doses cause both inotropic and chronotropic effects. Thus, at lower doses cardiac augmentation occurs, and at higher doses regions of ischemia may be produced in the presence of significant coronary artery disease. This is manifested echocardiographically as changes in segmental wall motion. In theory, therefore, areas of viable myocardium should show improved wall motion at low doses, and areas of irreversible myocardial damage will remain akinetic. Five studies have investigated DSE for determining viability in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, thus looking for stunned but viable myocardium. DSE was shown to compare favorably with positron emission tomography and was highly sensitive and specific for predicting functional myocardial recovery. Five additional studies examined DSE for determining the presence of hibernating myocardium. The sensitivity and specificity of DSE were found to range from 71 to 92% and from 73 to 93%, respectively. The benefits of DSE include lower cost, convenience to both patient and physician, additional ancillary information, and determination of the possible need for urgent revascularization. Limitations of DSE include occasional technical difficulty in obtaining and interpreting studies and the need for larger volumes of viable myocardium to detect changes predictive of functional recovery. Larger trials are currently underway to confirm DSE as a reliable technique for determining myocardial viability.
