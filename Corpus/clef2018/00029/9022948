Radiolabelled-tyrosine for the measurement of protein synthesis rate in vivo by positron emission tomography. The amino acid incorporation rate, generally described as protein synthesis rate or PSR, can be assessed in vivo using carboxylic-labelled amino acids such as L-[1-11C]tyrosine and PET. In animals, labelled tissue metabolites are below 4% of total tissue radioactivity and are therefore neglected in the model. Labelled plasma metabolites on the other hand rise continuously to 50% of total plasma radioactivity at 40 minutes. After correction of the total plasma radioactivity for the metabolite fraction, a Patlak analysis may be performed to calculate the PSR. A number of applications in the field of oncology were presented. The use of L-[1-11C]tyrosine in the study of metabolic disease was also discussed. It is concluded that the application of [11C]tyrosine-PET in a clinical setting is of interest for an increasing number of diseases.
