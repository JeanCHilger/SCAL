Mechanical efficiency in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy assessed by positron emission tomography with carbon 11 acetate. This study was performed to assess the relation between the regional work and oxidative metabolism in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). By using carbon 11 acetate as a tracer of myocardial blood flow (%A(0)) and oxygen consumption (k value), 12 patients with HCM with asymmetric septal hypertrophy and 10 normal subjects were studied. Regional work rate (RWR) of the left ventricle was estimated by wall stress and wall thickness. %A(0) in hypertrophied septum was similar to that in nonhypertrophied free wall (92.6% +/- 2.8% vs 93.5% +/- 3.8% p = not significant). However, oxygen consumption was significantly lower in hypertrophied septum than in nonhypertrophied free wall (0.043 +/- 0.011 vs 0.057 +/- 0.013 min(-1)
