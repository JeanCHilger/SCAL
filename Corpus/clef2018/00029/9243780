Acquired conditions that lead to osteoarthritis in the dog. There are many acquired arthopathies that will result in some degree of osteoarthritis, even after proper management. Once the articular cartilage is damaged, it is unlikely that the architecture of the original cartilage surface will return to the normal conditions that existed prior to injury. The purpose of timely and meticulous management of traumatic joint events is to stop the progression of osteoarthritic development. When dealing with articular fractures or other forms of trauma to articular cartilage, three important principles to remember are anatomic reduction of the articular surfaces, stable fixation, and limited weight bearing on the affected limb as soon as possible after surgery. Even after strict adherence to these principles, the pet owner should always be warned that the animal will develop some degree of osteoarthritis in the affected joint at some future time at that time, chronic medical management may be indicated.
