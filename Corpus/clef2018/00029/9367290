Neuroimaging in the evaluation of children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy: II. Neuroimaging and pediatric epilepsy surgery. The costs of epilepsy encompass all aspects of life, including medical, educational, and psychosocial. Adults with intractable epilepsy who undergo epilepsy surgery and have seizure-free outcomes still have significant barriers in the attainment of improved quality of life. For this reason, there is increasing interest in the recognition of children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy who might be epilepsy surgery candidates. This is Part II of an article on the role of neuroimaging in the evaluation of children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy. Part I addressed the role of MRI in detecting the substrates of epilepsy (Pediatr Neurol 199717: 19-26)
