Reversible ischemia in hippocampal areas by retrograde cerebral circulation surgery for thoracic aortic aneurysm with Tc-99m ECD brain SPECT. Because hippocampal neurons are quite vulnerable to the anoxic brain injury that sometimes occurs in aortic arch surgery in humans, hippocampal ischemia should be a sensitive indicator of global cerebral ischemia. It was concluded that the hypothermic retrograde cerebral circulation technique for aortic arch surgery could not only be performed safely with respect to the brain, but could also increase blood flow to the hippocampal areas, probably as a result of restoration of blood flow in the thoracic aorta.
