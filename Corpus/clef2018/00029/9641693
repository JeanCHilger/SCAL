Sympathetic denervation and reinnervation after arterial switch operation for complete transposition. Sympathetic cardiopulmonary nerves arise from the cervical sympathetic trunks and the stellate ganglia and subsequently course along the origin of the great arteries and the coronary arteries to innervate the ventricles. Therefore, the sympathetic nerves may be obligatorily interrupted by the arterial switch operation (ASO) for complete transposition of the great arteries.To demonstrate and characterize the possible sympathetic denervation, 51 patients after ASO, 4.8 years old (range, 1 month to 10.1 years), underwent [123I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging of the sympathetic nerve terminal. MIBG uptake to the heart was graded by quantitative analysis using the heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratio of MIBG uptake. A quantitative criterion for absent uptake of MIBG was set to 1.48 in the H/M ratio. Four patients < 1 month after ASO showed complete absence of MIBG uptake, which had been observed preoperatively. In contrast, 47 patients late after ASO (range, 15 months to 10.1 years) showed various degrees of uptake of MIBG. Patients operated on at < or =55 days of age showed positive MIBG uptake much more frequently than those operated on at later ages. Heart rate and rate-pressure product at peak exercise on a treadmill exercise test were significantly greater in patients with positive uptake than in those with absent uptake of MIBG.Cardiac sympathetic nerves were denervated early after and reinnervated late after ASO. Neonatal ASO may be favorable to facilitate sympathetic reinnervation, which may affect exercise tolerance late after surgery.
