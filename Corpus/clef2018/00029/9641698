Profound underestimation of glucose uptake by [18F]2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose in reperfused rat heart muscle. [18F]2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose (FDG) is widely used as a tracer for glucose uptake in ischemic heart muscle. We tested the effects of low-flow ischemia and reperfusion on the ratio of tracer/tracee (lumped constant, LC).Isolated working rat hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing only glucose 5 mmol/L (group 1) or glucose 5 mmol/L plus oleate 0.4 mmol/L (group 2, fed group 3, fasted). Dynamic glucose uptake was measured simultaneously with [2-3H]glucose and with FDG. After 20 minutes, coronary flow was reduced by 75% for 30 minutes before it was returned to control conditions for the final 20 minutes. Hexokinase activity in the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions and tissue metabolites were determined. Rates of glucose uptake were highest when glucose was the only substrate. Glucose uptake, FDG uptake, and the LC increased during ischemia only in group 3. There was no change of these parameters during ischemia in groups 1 and 2. FDG uptake decreased significantly with reperfusion in groups 2 and 3, and there was a striking fall in the LC (from >1.0 to <0.2, P<.001). The fall in the LC was associated with a significant increase in intracellular free glucose. Neither ischemia nor reperfusion affected the kinetic properties of hexokinase.FDG profoundly underestimates glucose uptake during reperfusion in the presence of fatty acids. In the fasted state, however, FDG overestimates glucose uptake during ischemia. The results indicate limitations in the use of FDG to quantify myocardial glucose uptake in human heart.
