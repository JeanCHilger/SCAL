Detection of coronary artery disease by adenosine triphosphate stress echocardiography: comparison with adenosine triphosphate stress thallium myocardial scintigraphy and coronary angiography. The clinical feasibility and usefulness of adenosine triphosphate-2Na (ATP) stress echocardiography for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) were assessed. Two-dimensional echocardiography and thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) during ATP infusion were performed simultaneously in 58 consecutive patients (41 men and 17 women mean age 66 +/- 12 years) with suspected CAD. ATP was infused intravenously at 0.16 mg/kg/min for 5 min and thallium was injected at 4 min. All patients underwent coronary angiography within 2 weeks of ATP echocardiography and ATP SPECT. An ischemic response during ATP infusion was detected by echocardiography as the development or worsening of a wall motion abnormality compared with the baseline and by SPECT as a perfusion defect that filled totally or partially during redistribution. Significant coronary artery stenosis was defined as > or = 75% diameter stenosis in a major epicardial vessel. The severity of the stenosis was classified as follows: Group A, lesions with significant coronary artery stenosis (> or = 75%, < 90%)
