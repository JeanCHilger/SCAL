Biochemical characterization of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (rRT) as a glycyrrhizin-binding protein and the CK-II-mediated stimulation of rRT activity potently inhibited by glycyrrhetinic acid derivative. By means of successive Mono Q and glycyrrhizin (GL)-affinity column chromatography (HPLC), recombinant HIV-1 RT (rRT) was purified to apparent homogeneity from the Superdex 200 pg fraction of the crude protein extract of E. coli BL21 transfected with pET 21a(+)/HIV-1 PR-RT. It was found that (i) rRT functioned as an effective phosphate acceptor for recombinant human casein kinase II (rhCK-II) in vitro (ii) this phosphorylation was inhibited by anti-HIV-1 substances [a glycyrrhetinic acid derivative (oGA) and quercetin] and a high dose (100 microM) of GL
