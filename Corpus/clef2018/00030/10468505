Sensory processing in Parkinson's and Huntington's disease: investigations with 3D H(2)(15)O-PET. There is conjoining experimental and clinical evidence supporting a fundamental role of the basal ganglia as a sensory analyser engaged in central somatosensory control. This study was aimed at investigating the functional anatomy of sensory processing in two clinical conditions characterized by basal ganglia dysfunction, i.e. Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. Based on previously recorded data of somatosensory evoked potentials, we expected deficient sensory-evoked activation in cortical areas that receive modulatory somatosensory input via the basal ganglia. Eight Parkinson's disease patients, eight Huntington's disease patients and eight healthy controls underwent repetitive H(2)(15)O-PET activation scans during two experimental conditions in random order: (i) continuous unilateral high-frequency vibratory stimulation applied to the immobilized metacarpal joint of the index finger and (ii) rest (no vibratory stimulus). In the control cohort, the activation pattern was lateralized to the side opposite to stimulus presentation, including cortical [primary sensory cortex (S1) secondary sensory cortex (S2)] and subcortical (globus pallidus, ventrolateral thalamus) regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) increases (P < 0.001). Between-group comparisons (P < 0.01) of vibration-induced rCBF changes between patients and controls revealed differences in central sensory processing: (i) in Parkinson's disease, decreased activation of contralateral sensorimotor (S1/M1) and lateral premotor cortex, contralateral S2, contralateral posterior cingulate, bilateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10) and contralateral basal ganglia
