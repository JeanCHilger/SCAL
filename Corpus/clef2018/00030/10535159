Myocardial viability in man: state of the art and directions to pursue. The advent of modern coronary revascularization procedures has profoundly modified the prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction or that of patients with chronic left ventricular ischemic dysfunction. Presumably, the beneficial effects of revascularization result from improving blood supply to dysfunctional but viable regions with subsequent improvement in regional and global left ventricular function. Various approaches have been proposed to predict the reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction after coronary revascularization. For the most part, these techniques allow detection of viable myocardium with a high sensitivity (80%). However, specificity has been more varied (+/- 55% for, +/- 75% for PET and +/- 85% dobutamine echocardiography). All these techniques also bear important prognostic implications that are independent and complementary to those usually available in these patients.
