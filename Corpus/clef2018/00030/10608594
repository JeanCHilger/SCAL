Development of a method for measuring myocardial contractility with gated myocardial SPECT and arterial tonometry. Gated myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and radial artery applanation tonometry were used, respectively, to quantify the time-volume curve of the left ventricle and to estimate ventricular pressure wave. We developed ways of determining end-systolic elastance (Ees) with the normalized-single-beat method and tested the reproducibility of these measurements.In patients with coronary artery disease (male/female = 33:2, age 66 +/- 10 years, ejection fraction 22% to 77%), rest thallium-201 gated/poststress technetium-99m sestamibi gated SPECT/24-hour rest Tc-99m sestamibi gated SPECT and arterial tonometry were performed. Quantitative gated SPECT software yielded a systolic time-volume curve, and tonometrically measured radial artery pressure wave yielded central aortic pressure wave. With systolic half of pressure-volume curve, void volume (Vo) was estimated and Ees was calculated. Over 71 measurements Ees ranged from 1.7 to 5.3 and Vo from -4 to 200 mL. Ejection duration, other indexes of central pressure waveform, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and ejection fraction were reproducible. The reproducibility of Vo was excellent (r = 0.97). Ees at rest (n = 15) showed fair reproducibility between Tc-99m-sestamibi and TI-201 SPECT (r = 0.51).With gated myocardial SPECT, a noninvasive method of quantifying myocardial global contractility was developed. Reproducibility of this measurement was sufficient for use in clinical routine. Ees measured by this method warrants validation by invasively measured Ees.
