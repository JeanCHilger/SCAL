Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose dual-head positron emission tomography in the detection of recurrent differentiated thyroid cancer: preliminary results. In the follow-up of patients with thyroid cancer, it may be very difficult to identify the site of recurrence in the presence of persistently elevated or rising thyroglobulin (Tg) levels and negative iodine-131 whole-body scintigraphy (WBS). The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of employing fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose and a dual-head positron emission tomography (PET) camera to detect recurrent thyroid cancer in patients with elevated Tg levels and negative 131I WBS. Eleven patients suspect of having recurrent thyroid cancer (five males, six females mean age 47 years
