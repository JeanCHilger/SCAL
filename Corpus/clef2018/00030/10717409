The correlation between P300 alterations and regional cerebral blood flow in non-demented Parkinson's disease. P300 was evoked by a visual oddball and an S1-S2 task in 22 non-demented Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (13 in the early stage, nine in the late stage) and 18 normal controls. Reaction time was also measured. All patients undertook the (99)Tc-ECD SPECT examination. Quantitative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was obtained by overlying SPECT image on the 3D-magnetic resonance image. In the PD patients in the late stage, P300 latency to S2-same and reaction time were significantly prolonged, while rCBF at bilateral frontal, temporal, and the right parietal lobes was decreased. P300 latency to S2-same was significantly correlated with the rCBF at bilateral temporal lobes. Reaction time was significantly correlated with the rCBF at the right frontal and parietal lobes, as well as the temporal and occipital lobes. The results suggest that P300 changes in non-demented PD in the late stage could be related to the temporal lobe dysfunction.
