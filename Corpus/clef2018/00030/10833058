Dissociation of cerebral glucose metabolism and level of consciousness during the period of metabolic depression following human traumatic brain injury. Utilizing [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), we studied the correlation between CMRglc and the level of consciousness within the first month following human traumatic brain injury. Forty-three FDG-PET scans obtained on 42 mild to severely head-injured patients were quantitatively analyzed for the determination of regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc). Reduction of cerebral glucose utilization, defined as a CMRglc of < or =4.9 mg/100 g/min, was present regionally in 88% of the studies. The prevalence of global cortical CMRglc reduction was higher in severely head-injured patients (86% versus 67% mild-moderate), although the absolute magnitude was similar across the injury severity spectrum (mean CMRglc 3.9 +/- 0.6 mg/100 g/min). The level of consciousness, as measured by the Glasgow Coma Scale, correlated poorly with the global cortical CMRglc value (r = 0.08 p = 0.63). With regards to severity of head injury, this correlation was worst for the severely injured (r = -0.11
