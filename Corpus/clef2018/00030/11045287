Ultrafiltration with icodextrins in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and automated peritoneal dialysis. Icodextrins (Icos) produce constant linear ultrafiltration (UF). This effect allows Icos to replace glucose during long dwells in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [CAPD (nighttime)] and automated peritoneal dialysis [APD (daytime)]. However, the effectiveness of Icos in producing UF (IcoUF) is limited by lymphatic reabsorption, whose extent depends partly on posture and physical activity. This paper aims to assess whether the difference in posture and physical activity between daytime dwells in APD and nighttime dwells in CAPD affects IcoUF. Patients undergoing first treatment were retrospectively examined. Ten patients were on CAPD [4 males, 6 females average age, 73.0 +/- 13.4 years
