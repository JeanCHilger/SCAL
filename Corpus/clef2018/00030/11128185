Attenuation corrected cardiac perfusion SPECT. Image artifacts, especially those caused by photon attenuation, commonly affect the specificity of cardiac SPECT perfusion imaging. Although often suspected by characteristic patterns identified in female and male patients respectively, the widely variable body habitus of individual patients are associated with unpredictable variations in tissue attenuation. The accuracy of PET perfusion imaging has long benefited from correction methods for soft tissue attenuation. This paper reviews recent developments in attenuation correction methods for cardiac SPECT perfusion imaging. Several commercial methods are now available. Initial reports indicate these methods have varied greatly in their clinical success. Some methods have demonstrated significant improvements. However, others have created more artifacts than they have cured. Recent developments suggest very significant clinical advantages can be achieved with robust, well-validated methods for attenuation corrected SPECT in the diagnostic evaluation of coronary heart disease, high risk coronary disease, and women.
