Compartmental modeling of technetium-99m-labeled teboroxime with dynamic single-photon emission computed tomography: Comparison with static thallium-201 in a canine model. Invest Radiol 200136:178-185.A compartmental modeling approach to deriving kinetic parameters from a time series of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images of technetium-99m-labeled (99mTc-) teboroxime may have value for semiquantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion. This study investigated the value of the kinetic parameters derived from a two-compartment model of 99mTc-teboroxime for measuring myocardial perfusion and compared it with static thallium-201 (201Tl) uptake and microsphere-measured blood flow in dogs.Experiments were successfully conducted in 9 of 11 open-chest dogs. During adenosine stress, a single complete set of projections of 201Tl uptake was acquired. 99mTc-teboroxime was then injected during adenosine stress, and a complete set of projections was acquired every 5.7 seconds for 17 minutes. Resting studies were performed on 4 of the animals. All of the projection sets were reconstructed with an iterative algorithm and incorporated corrections for attenuation and the geometric response of the collimators. Regional kinetic parameters (washin and washout) were determined semiautomatically from the time series of reconstructed 99mTc-teboroxime images and registered with microsphere data. Regional washin estimates were compared with 201Tl intensities and myocardial blood flows determined from microspheres.Optimally scaled 99mTc-teboroxime washin parameters and 201Tl uptakes were correlated with microsphere-determined blood flows (r = 0.91, y = 0. 99x + 0.01, and r = 0.92, y = 0.88x + 0.28, respectively). In six of the studies, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded, and stress occluded-to-normal (O/N) ratios were calculated. The O/N ratios were 0.32 +/- 0.17 as determined from microspheres injected with 201Tl and 0.38 +/- 0.29 from microspheres injected with 99mTc-teboroxime (P = NS). The O/N ratios were 0.48 +/- 0.16 for static 201Tl uptake and 0.27 +/- 0.21 for 99mTc-teboroxime washin (P < 0.05).Both 201Tl uptake and 99mTc-teboroxime kinetic parameters were well correlated with flow. The 99mTc-teboroxime washin parameters offer semiquantitative flow values and provide greater defect contrast than can be obtained with 201Tl uptake values.
