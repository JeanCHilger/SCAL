Clinical studies on bronchial asthma caused by contact with hamsters. Bronchial asthma induced by contact with hamsters and other small rodents is receiving higher attention from the medical profession not only because of the problem of laboratory animal allergies (LAA), but also because of increasing household allergens for asthma, since keeping these pets has become more common in Japanese homes. The present report describes our studies on the backgrounds of nine patients with asthma who kept Dzungarian Dwarf hamsters as household pets. The following features were recognized among patients with bronchial asthma induced by contact with hamsters: 1) earlier onset of symptoms than for keeping other household pets, at an average of 14.7 months or within 12 months in 78% of the cases following the start of pet keeping 2) adults ranging from their late 30s to 40s who have children of primary school age
