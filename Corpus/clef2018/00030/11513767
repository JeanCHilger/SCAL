Single-photon emission tomography imaging of the chest. We review single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the chest for practical applications that may be used by pulmonary disease specialists. First, we cover SPECT uses in pulmonary thromboembolic disease. Second, SPECT's applications in quantitative evaluation of the lung are reviewed, with special emphasis on lung volume reduction surgery. Finally, we consider the use of SPECT to characterize somatostatin receptors in lung masses. The role of SPECT will always be compared to the ever-advancing place of positron emission tomography chest imaging for patients with pulmonary disease. We believe that SPECT will continue to help pulmonary specialists take care of their patients in the years to come.
