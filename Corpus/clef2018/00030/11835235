Thyroidal uptake and radiation dose after repetitive I-131-MIBG treatments: influence of potassium iodide for thyroid blocking. In I-131-MIBG therapy, I-131-iodide can be released from the I-131-MIBG molecule. Hypothyroidism might result from the undesirable irradiation of the thyroid gland. To prevent this, stable iodide such as potassium iodide (KI) is given to oversaturate the thyroid before I-131-MIBG is administered.In the present study, the incidence of hypothyroidism (elevated TSH) was correlated with the thyroidal uptake of I-131 and dose (MIRD dosimetry) after 35 individual treatments in ten patients. Iodine-131-MIBG therapy was performed using a modified dosage of 1.9-11.1 GBq (50-300 mCi) IV. Premedication with KI was done as recommended with a dose of 100 mg KI orally from 2 days before until 4 weeks after I-131-MIBG.The absorbed thyroidal dose amounted to a very variable range of 0.2 (patient # 1) up to 30.0 (patient 3) Gy with 7.1 +/- 7.9 Gy per treatment and 24.1+/- 19.2 Gy per patient (mean+/- SD), despite the same and compliantly taken KI premedication protocol. Up to now, 4/10 or 40% of patients have developed hypothyroidism after a mean follow-up period of 11 months and a mean total administered dose of 18.7 GBq (505 mCi). A trend towards higher thyroidal doses was seen in the hypothyroid patients.This study observes a general high inter- and intra-individual variability in radio-iodide uptake in the thyroid after I-131-MIBG therapy despite KI premedication, as well as possible occurrence of hypothyroidism. A dose-response relationship needs confirmation on a larger cohort of patients to reach statistical value. An alternative thyroid cytoprotection strategy for possible long-term survivors may be considered.
