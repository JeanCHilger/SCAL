Biodistribution on Tc-99m labeled somatostatin receptor-binding peptide (Depreotide, NeoTec) planar and SPECT studies. To determine the biodistribution of Tc-99m labeled somatostatin receptor-binding peptide (Depreotide) on planar and SPECT studies of the thorax and upper abdomen in order to improve diagnostic accuracy.Retrospectively 29 planar and SPECT studies from 28 patients (all males, average age of 65.79) were reviewed. All the patients had been referred for evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules. Two to four hours after IV injection of 555- to 740-MBq (15-20 mCi) Tc-99m Depreotide, anterior and posterior total body images, and anterior, posterior, right lateral and left lateral planar images were obtained, and thoracic SPECT was acquired with a three-head gamma camera. The degree of uptake in the lungs, thoracic cage, and organs of the upper abdomen was rated from "0" to "++++".The range of normal activity in the thorax includes cardiac, "0" pulmonary, "+"The intensity of radioactivity in the sub-diaphragmatic organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys provides useful guidance for the categorization of pulmonary lesions. The uptake of land marks such as the sternum, which is anteriorly located, and the thoracic vertebrae, which are posteriorly located in the thoracic cage, can be used in the localization of a Depreotide avid tumor.
