Moroccan migration to the Netherlands:  the perspective from the regions of origin. The author "presents an analysis of factors explaining Moroccan labour migration to the Netherlands since the 1960s, focusing on the history, ethnology, economy and socio-political structure of the Moroccan Rif.... The Rifians of Northern Morocco make up some 70 [percent of the] 150,000 Moroccans who have settled in the Netherlands.  Labour migration to Western Europe evolved from a traditional pattern of circular migration within North Africa. Since the 1970s settlement in and migration to the Netherlands have become permanent features [in the] changing character of the region of origin. Traditional perceptions of push and pull factors no longer apply.  The region has become dependent on migration and is not integrated into the Moroccan economy as a whole." (SUMMARY IN ENG)
