Assessment of image reconstruction parameters in PET using physical and statistical figures of merit. The aim of this study was to analyze the recommended OSEM image reconstruction parameters in positron emission tomography (PET). Spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast were used as physical figures of merit (FOM). For statistical FOMs, the t-value and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were employed. The spatial resolution was measured with 21 point sources. The signal-to-noise ratio, the contrast, and the t-value were investigated with a whole-body phantom with hollow spheres inserted. A phantom containing line sources was used for ROC analysis. As result, the reconstruction parameters recommended for visual evaluation lead to images with an adequate lesion detectability. The quantitative reconstruction, however, needs improvement.
