Cost-effectiveness of PET in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of positron emission tomography (PET) in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) in community-dwelling patients with mild or moderate dementia who present to specialized AD centers.A decision-analytic model was used to compare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with strategies involving single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and PET as functional imaging adjuncts to the standard clinical work-up. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine changes in test characteristics, health-related quality-of-life survey instruments, therapeutic effectiveness, and treatment rules.The use of PET to confirm the results of the standard clinical work-up cost more but yielded fewer benefits than a strategy in which dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced MR imaging was substituted for the typically performed structural computed tomography. This relationship remained stable in scenarios in which standard diagnostic work-up accuracy, drug treatment effectiveness, and version of the Health Utilities Index were altered. Dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced MR imaging cost US dollars 598800 per QALY gained (range, US dollars 74400 to US dollars 1.9 million per QALY), compared with the cost of the standard diagnostic work-up. Treating all patients with dementia was the dominant imaging strategy, except when side effects in patients with non-AD-related dementia were modeled. In all scenarios, SPECT yielded fewer benefits than other strategies at a higher cost.PET may have high diagnostic accuracy, but adding it to the standard diagnostic regimen at AD clinics would yield limited, if any, benefits at very high costs.
