Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy: 101 consecutive cases from a single surgeon. Intraoperative rapid parathyroid hormone (iPTH) assay is changing parathyroid surgery. One surgeon's experience at a tertiary care hospital was followed as minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) was adopted.In this prospective case study, patients underwent technitium 99m sestamibi scanning, iPTH monitoring, and MIP. A sestamibi-directed incision was made, and iPTH was measured preincision, preexcision of abnormal gland(s), and at 5- and 10-minute intervals. MIP was complete after gland(s) was excised and iPTH fell to less than 50% of preoperative levels. Routine discharge was on the day of surgery with daily calcium and calcitriol to minimize outpatient hypocalcemia. Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism patients were excluded.From December 1999 to June 2002, 101 patients underwent MIP. Patients were 27% men and 73% women, with two reoperations. Preoperation laboratory results averaged serum calcium 11.08 (normal 8.5 to 10.5 mg/dL) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) 169 pg/mL (normal 10 to 55 pg/mL). Average iPTH values at operative intervals were 152, 151, 68, and 50 pg/mL, respectively. Operation demonstrated 12% of patients had four-gland hyperplasia, 3% had double adenomas, 2% had parathyroid carcinomas, and 83% had single adenomas. Discharge on the day of surgery occurred in 83% of single-adenoma patients. Postoperative laboratory results averaged calcium 9.4 mg/dL (p < 0.001 versus preoperation) and PTH 48 pg/mL (p < 0.001). Fifteen patients (16%) had elevated PTH after operation, but without elevated calcium levels. One patient had persistant hyperparathyroidism.MIP with iPTH monitoring is a safe and effective means of treating hyperparathyroidism. This approach allows for limited dissection and early discharge for the majority of patients.
