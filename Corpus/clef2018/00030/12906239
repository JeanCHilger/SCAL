Interpolation artifacts in multimodality image registration based on maximization of mutual information. Mutual information (MI) is an increasingly popular match metric for multimodality image registration. However, its value is affected by interpolation, which may limit registration accuracy. The purpose of this study was to characterize the artifacts from eight interpolators and to investigate efficient strategies to overcome these artifacts. The interpolators were: 1) nearest neighbor 2) linear
