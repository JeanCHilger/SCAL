A study of cerebral circulation following cervical sympathetic ganglion block. Cerebral circulation following cervical epidural block or stellate ganglion block at the transverse process of the 6th cervical vertebra (C6-SGB) was evaluated by single photon emission computed tomography of inhaled Xenon-133. Cerebral blood flow before and 15 min after both blocks was measured in eight patients after cervical epidural block and ten patients after C6-SGB. Cerebral blood flow decreased slightly following cervical epidural block, but it was not a statistically significant difference. Cerebral blood flow following C6-SGB could be separated into two groups in one it increased and in the other it decreased slightly. In conclusion, cerebral circulation is not influenced by cervical epidural block, but it is probably affected by C6-SGB. The manner in which C6-SGB increases cerebral blood flow seems that local anesthetics reached the superior cervical ganglion and block it. C6-SGB without superior cervical ganglion block does not influence cerebral circulation, and it only dilates extracranial vessels.
