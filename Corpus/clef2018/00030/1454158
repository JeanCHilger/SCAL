Acutely administered haloperidol-induced pattern changes of regional cerebral blood flow in schizophrenics. Observation from subtraction of brain imaging with single photon emission computed tomography using technetium-99m hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow in brain images with single photon emission computed tomography using technetium-99m hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime before and after intramuscular injection of haloperidol (0.08 mg/kg) were studied in 5 medicated subjects in their twenties, consisting of 5 schizophrenics and 1 patient with histrionic personality disorder, by a subtraction method of brain images. The haloperidol injection induced two types of perfusion pattern change in 2 of the schizophrenics, a relative hypoperfusion in the frontal lobes in the images prior to injection was converted to a relative hyperperfusion. In the other 3 schizophrenics and in the patient with histrionic personality disorder, the slight left hemispheric dominance was changed to a marked right hemispheric dominance. The results indicate that haloperidol affects perfusion patterns in schizophrenics.
