Detection of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinomas after radiotherapy with technetium-99m tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography in patients with indeterminate magnetic resonance imaging findings. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of technetium-99m tetrofosmin (Tc-99m TF) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of head and neck for detecting suspected recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs) when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are indeterminate. MRI was performed 4 months after radiotherapy and 26 NPC patients with indeterminate MRI findings were included. MRI, Tc-99m TF SPECT, and biopsy were performed within 1 week. The final results were based on histopathologic findings and clinical follow-up for at least 6 months. For detecting recurrent NPC in indeterminate MRI findings, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of Tc-99m TF SPECT were 92.3%, 100.0%, and 96.2%, respectively. Based on this result, we can suggest Tc-99m TF SPECT is effective to detect recurrent NPC when MRI findings are indeterminate. However, further studies including a larger NPC patient population are warranted to determine the exact role and clinical usefulness of Tc-99m TF SPECT to differentiate benign lesions and recurrent NPC when MRI findings are indeterminate.
