Emerging technologies in uroradiologic imaging. Advances in imaging technologies have readily been incorporated into the practice of urology and have led to important advances in patient care and outcomes. In the area of oncology, advances in radiologic imaging are improving the ability of the urologist to diagnose and monitor urologic malignancies. Some of these technologies include positron emission tomography (PET), intraoperative ultrasound (IUS), 3-dimensional computerized tomography (3D-CT), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). We provide an overview of these four emerging imaging modalities and their potential applications and limitations in the diagnosis and management of urologic malignancy.
