A new noninvasive quantification of renal blood flow with N-13 ammonia, dynamic positron emission tomography, and a two-compartment model. In order to determine if dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and N-13 ammonia can be used to quantitate regional RBF (rRBF) noninvasively, six anesthetized dogs were examined with PET imaging after an iv bolus administration of 5 mCi of N-13 ammonia. Renal time activity curves and the arterial input function were derived from regions of interest drawn over the renal cortex and abdominal aorta, respectively. For calculation of rRBF, less than 120 s of the initial data were used to minimize contamination by plasma metabolites of N-13 radioactivity. rRBF was quantitated with a two-compartment model, and the results were compared with simultaneously acquired microsphere blood flow measurement. Fourteen experiments were performed in six dogs, and four regions of interest on renal cortex were selected on each PET image. RBF derived from dynamic PET imaging with N-13 ammonia was linearly related to microsphere (MS) values (rRBF = 1.06 x MS - 0.17 r = 0.91). Mean rRBF in the canine experiments was 4.0 mL/min/g. The results indicate that dynamic N-13 ammonia renal PET can provide noninvasively quantitative rRBF.
