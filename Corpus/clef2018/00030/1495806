SPECT follow-up of cerebral blood circulation after stroke. rCBF SPECT investigations with 99mTc-HMPAO were performed in 22 completed ischemic stroke patients on average 2.5, 16.8 and 38.0 days after stroke onset. As control group, 12 neurologically healthy volunteers were examined with the same method. The overall sensitivity of the rCBF SPECT method in the detection of cerebral blood flow abnormalities was 91%, with a specificity of 83% and an accuracy of 88%. The rCBF study was highly effective, particularly in the acute phase of the disease. Regional increased tracer uptake or a false normal 99mTc-HMPAO distribution due to the developing hyperemia mostly complicated the rCBF image interpretations in the subacute period. In the chronic phase, the spatial resolution of the SPECT system limited the detection of the continuously retracted stroke lesions.
