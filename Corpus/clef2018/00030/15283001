Circadian variation in neuroendocrine response to L-dopa in patients with restless legs syndrome. To investigate circadian changes in dopaminergic function by means of a neuroendocrine challenge (growth hormone and prolactin responses to an acute oral administration of L-dopa) in patients with idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) and controls.Randomized administration of the L-dopa neuroendocrine challenge.Sleep disorders laboratory at a 500-bed academic hospital.Twelve patients diagnosed with idiopathic RLS and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.Following a comprehensive evaluation that included nocturnal polysomnographic study, all participants underwent the L-dopa neuroendocrine challenge on 2 occasions (11 am and 11 pm). Subjects were previously randomly assigned to the time of first challenge (11 am or 11 pm). On each occasion, subjects took 200 mg of L-dopa (plus 50 mg carbidopa) by mouth. Blood was drawn 20 minutes and 5 minutes before administration of the drug, as well as 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 102, and 120 minutes after administration.Prechallenge levels of plasma values of growth hormone or prolactin did not differ in the 2 subject groups. Following only the nighttime administration of L-dopa, RLS patients manifested a more pronounced inhibition of prolactin release and an increase in growth hormone secretion. Prolactin plasma levels were significantly correlated to the periodic limb movement index on the polysomnogram.These findings may reflect enhanced circadian variations in dopaminergic function and support an increased sensitivity at night of dopamine receptors in patients with RLS.
