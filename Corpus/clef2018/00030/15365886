Comparison of polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron) meshes for abdominal wall hernia repair: a chemical and morphological study. For the first time, by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), polypropylene (PP) excised meshes (ethylene oxide sterilized) for abdominal wall hernia repair have been shown to be greatly damaged physically, independently of the implantation time, while the polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or Dacron, ones (gamma radiation sterilized), did not undergo alterations due to the sterilization process and were not damaged, even after long implantation periods. Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) study of PP and PET excised meshes, as well as of their extracts with cyclohexane, has shown the presence of species, such as squalene, palmitic and stearic acid, in some cases, cholesterol, transferred from the surrounding tissues to the polymer during the implantation period. In the case of PP meshes, these small organic molecules would reduce physical and mechanical properties of the material. A hypothesis is presented to account for the better behavior (not in the clinical sense) of PET meshes.
