Biology and control of ticks infesting dogs and cats in North America. At least 15 different infectious agents and diseases are transmitted or produced by ticks parasitizing dogs and cats in North America. Those infectious agents and diseases are distributed among eight different tick species that commonly infest dogs and cats. All but one of these species are hard ticks with a three-host development cycle in which each motile stage (larva, nymph, and adult) feeds on a different host after molting. Tick species, disease occurrence, and peak activity of each tick life stage can vary dramatically depending on geographic and climatic conditions. Gaining an understanding of tick distribution, tick ecology, and seasonal occurrence of different tick life stages can help with the management of tick infestations and reduce the incidence of tick-transmitted diseases in dogs and cats. Control should be based on an understanding and management of ecologic factors responsible for tick infestations and selection of appropriate acaricides. Occasionally, topical acaricides will appear not to have prevented tick infestations. This lack of control may be real or perceived based on reinfestation rates and/or pet owner expectations of product performance.
