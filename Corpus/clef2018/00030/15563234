Phase II study of antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 in children with recurrent and progressive multicentric glioma : a preliminary report. To evaluate the response rates, survival and toxicity of treatment with antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 (ANP) in the first 12 children enrolled in our studies diagnosed with incurable recurrent and progressive multicentric glioma.The patients' median age was 9 years. Six patients were diagnosed with pilocytic astrocytoma, four with low-grade astrocytoma and one with astrocytoma grade 2. In one case of visual pathway glioma, a biopsy was not performed due to a dangerous location. Patients received ANP intravenously initially and subsequently orally. The average duration of intravenous ANP therapy was 16 months and the average dosage of A10 was 7.95 g/kg/day and of AS2-1 was 0.33 g/kg/day. The average duration of oral ANP was 19 months and the average dosage of A10 and AS2-1 was 0.28 g/kg/day. Responses were assessed by MRI according to the National Cancer Institute's criteria and confirmed by PET scans in some cases.Complete response was accomplished in 33%, partial response in 25%, and stable disease in 33% of patients, and there was no progressive disease. One patient was non-evaluable due to only 4 weeks of ANP and lack of follow-up scans. One patient who had stable disease discontinued ANP against medical advice and died 4.5 years later. Ten patients are alive and well from 2 to >14 years post-diagnosis. Only one case of serious toxicity of reversible tinnitus, of one day's duration, was described. The study continues with accrual of additional patients.The results of the present study are favourable in comparison with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. We believe that confirmation of these results through further studies may introduce a new promising treatment for incurable paediatric brain tumours.
