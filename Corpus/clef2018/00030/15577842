Asthma and sensitization in a community with low indoor allergen levels and low pet-keeping frequency. Little is known about causes of asthma and sensitization in desert countries.To investigate risk factors associated with asthma and sensitization in Kuwait.One hundred sixty children (9-16 years) with physician-diagnosed asthma were recruited and matched (age, sex) with 303 healthy controls. Risk factors were assessed by questionnaires, determination of sensitization status (skin tests and IgE), and home allergen exposure (mite, cat, dog, cockroach ELISA).Home allergen levels and frequency of pet ownership were very low (cat, 4.1% dog, 1.5%). The risk of cat sensitization increased significantly among cat owners (odds ratio [OR], 3.53Pet ownership markedly increased the risk of sensitization to pets. Despite low allergen exposure, the pattern of childhood asthma in Kuwait follows that described in Western communities (strong association with sensitization).
