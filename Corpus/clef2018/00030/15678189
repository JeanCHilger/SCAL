Synthesis of 18F-labelled cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors via Stille reaction with 4-[18F]fluoroiodobenzene as radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET). The Stille reaction with 4-[(18)F]fluoroiodobenzene as a novel approach for the synthesis of radiotracers for monitoring COX-2 expression by means of PET has been developed. Optimized reaction conditions were elaborated by screening of various catalyst systems and solvents. By using optimized reaction conditions (18)F-labelled COX-2 inhibitors [(18)F]-5 and [(18)F]-13 could be obtained in radiochemical yields of up to 94% and 68%, respectively, based upon 4-[(18)F]fluoroiodobenzene.
