Force level independent representations of predictive grip force-load force coupling: a PET activation study. The existence of forward internal models is a fundamental principle in theories of predictive motor control. There are indications that internal models are represented in the cerebellum. So far, no conclusive data exist on automated procedures involving predictive motor behavior. In particular, it is unknown whether single or multiple task-specific internal models handle the broad range of behavioral situations in which they occur. Using H2(15)O PET in eight subjects, we examined predictive motor control in an automated grip force-load force coupling task at three differing load force levels. In the experimental condition, subjects pulled a grasped object against an isometric resistance while simultaneously producing anticipatory grip forces. There were three control conditions (pull force isolated grip force isolated
