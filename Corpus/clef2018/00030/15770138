Differentiation between malignant and benign pleural effusion in patients with extra-pleural primary malignancies: assessment with positron emission tomography-computed tomography. We sought to define an accurate diagnostic approach for differentiating benign from malignant pleural effusion on positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT).PET-CT studies of 31 patients with primary extrapleural malignancy and pleural effusion were reviewed retrospectively. CT parameters assessed were size and density (Hounsfield units, or HU) of the effusion and density (HU) and morphology of any solid pleural abnormality. Interpretation of PET data included review of the attenuation-corrected and nonattenuation-corrected images.PET-CT parameters that were found to be significant in identifying malignant pleural effusion included focal increased uptake of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose in the pleura (P<0.0001) and the presence of solid pleural abnormalities on CT (P<0.002): the sensitivity was 86% and 71%, respectively, and the specificity was 90% for each of the 2 parameters. A PET-CT pattern composed of pleural uptake and increased effusion activity on nonattenuation-corrected images was associated with sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 80%, positive predictive value of 91%, negative predictive value of 89%, and accuracy of 90%.On PET-CT, the presence of concomitant pleural abnormalities is the most accurate criterion in determining the malignant nature of pleural effusion.
