Radiopharmaceucticals for cardiovascular imaging. Radionuclide cardiac imaging is a noninvasive technique routinely used to detect coronary artery disease (CAD). This imaging modality includes techniques such as planar, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET) and radionuclide ventriculography--each technique having unique features of its own. Each technique employs various radiopharmaceuticals suitable for assessing different physiological and functional parameters that may become abnormal in the presence of CAD. Various cardiac imaging techniques include myocardial perfusion or blood flow, myocardial metabolism and cardiac function and wall motion. While radionuclide ventriculography gives the global functional status of the heart, SPECT and PET techniques provide information as to the regional blood flow and metabolic status of the myocardium. The following is a review of radiopharmaceuticals that are utilized clinically and in research in different types of nuclear cardiac imaging. Radiopharmaceuticals have been grouped according to the technique employed in which they are used. Various characteristics, merits and disadvantages of each radiopharmaceutical are discussed in detail.
