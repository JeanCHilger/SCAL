Gender differences in a fenfluramine-activated FDG PET study of borderline personality disorder. Neuroimaging studies of impulsive-aggressive subjects with borderline personality disorder (BPD) demonstrate hypometabolism in areas of prefrontal and frontal cortex, and a blunted cortical metabolic response to challenge with serotonergic agonists. Neuroendocrine responses to serotonergic challenge are known to vary greatly by gender, and may be related to sex differences in expression of impulsive aggression. We conducted single-blind, placebo-controlled fenfluramine-activated positron emission tomography (PET) studies in impulsive male and female subjects with BPD to look for gender differences in cortical response. The sample comprised 22 BPD (15 female, 7 male) and 24 control subjects (10 female, 14 male) who received placebo on Day 1 and d,l-fenfluramine on Day 2 before PET neuroimaging. In response to placebo, female, but not male, controls had areas of increased uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose-F18 in prefrontal cortex compared with BPD subjects, with greatest uptake in the medial orbital frontal cortex, bilaterally. Male, but not female, BPD subjects, showed areas of increased glucose utilization compared with controls in large areas of parietal and occipital cortex, bilaterally. In response to fenfluramine (relative to placebo), significant decreases in glucose uptake were found in male, but not female, BPD subjects, centered in the left temporal lobe. Female, but not male, control subjects showed significantly decreased uptake in areas of right frontal and temporal cortex. Covarying for impulsive-aggression rendered nonsignificant the gender differences in responses to placebo or fenfluramine. Gender differences in serotonergic function may mediate differences in behavioral expression of impulsive aggression in subjects with BPD.
