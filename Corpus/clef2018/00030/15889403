Processing content or location: distinct brain activation in a memory task. Objects are defined by their content ("what") and by their location ("where"). In the visual system, processing of these two types of information is segregated into distinct anatomical and functional pathways. Using H2 (15)O positron emission tomography to measure cerebral blood flow, we examined the differences in processing of "what" when compared with "where" information in human memory. We found that the detection of deviations from a previously learned image sequence activates distinct brain regions depending on whether the image's content or its location has changed. When deviations of an image's content had to be detected, the left medial temporal lobe (MTL) activation increased. In contrast, detection of deviations from the learned locations of the objects induced increased activation in the right MTL and in the right parietal cortex. These data demonstrate distinct contributions of the left and right MTL to the processing of "what" vs. "where" in memory.
