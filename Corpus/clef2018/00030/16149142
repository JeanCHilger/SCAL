Role of SPECT/CT in diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomas. To investigate the role of SPECT/CT in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomas whose anatomical positions are not ideal, situated adjacent to the heart, the inferior cava, hepatic vessels or abdominal aorta, etc.The hepatic perfusion, blood pool, and fusion imaging were carried out using SPECT/CT in 54 patients, who were suspected for hepatic hemangiomas. When the anatomical positions were not ideal, the diagnosis was difficult by SPECT only. So the information of computed tomography (CT) was applied to help in diagnosing. The results were recorded as hemangiomas or not.Of the 54 patients, 31 patients were diagnosed as suffering from hepatic hemangiomas. The anatomical positions of eight patients' hepatic hemangiomas (25.81%) were not ideal. Among these lesions of the eight patients, three patients' hepatic lesions were located near to the abdominal aorta, one to the heart, and four to the inferior cava. In addition, six abnormal radioactivity accumulation regions, adjacent to the heart and inferior cava, with the help of CT, were confirmed to be the imaging of inferior cava other than hepatic hemangiomas.When the anatomical positions of hepatic hemangiomas are not good enough for diagnosis, the fusion imaging of SPECT/CT is a simple and efficient method for differential diagnosis.
