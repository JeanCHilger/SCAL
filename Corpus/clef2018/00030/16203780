Gemcitabine radiosensitization after high-dose samarium for osteoblastic osteosarcoma. Osteoblastic metastases and osteosarcoma can avidly concentrate bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals. We sought to increase effectiveness of high-dose (153)Samarium ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate (153Sm-EDTMP, Quadramet) on osteosarcomas using a radiosensitizer, gemcitabine. Fourteen patients with osteoblastic lesions were treated with 30 mCi/kg 153Sm-EDTMP. Gemcitabine was administered 1 day after samarium infusion. Residual total body radioactivity was within the safe range of <3.6 mCi on day +14 (1.1 +/- 0.4 mCi range, 0.67-1.8 mCi). All patients received autologous stem cell reinfusion 2 weeks after 153Sm to correct expected grade 4 hematopoietic toxicity. Peripheral blood progenitor cells were infused in 11 patients
