Readout of the Optical PET (OPET) Detector. The design of an imaging system capable of detecting both high-energy γ-rays and optical wavelength photons is underway at the Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging. This system will noninvasively image small animal models in vivo for the presence of positron emission tomographic (PET) and optical signals. The detector will consist of modules of multichannel photomultiplier tubes (MC-PMT) coupled to arrays of scintillator crystals. The MC-PMT will detect both the photons produced due to bioluminescence and the photons generated by the interaction of γ-rays within the crystals. The long wavelength photons produced through bioluminescence are only slightly attenuated by these crystals and are detected directly at the photocathode of the MC-PMT, resulting in signals of small (5-10 mV) short (~15 ns) pulses. In contrast, annihilation (511 keV) γ-rays interacting in the scintillator crystal send large bursts of photons to the PMT, and result in pulses that can be as large as 500 mV and > 200 ns duration. The processing of pulses with such different characteristics in a single circuit requires significant alteration of the standard pulse processing circuitry used in PET scanners. In this paper, we discuss the requirements of such a circuit and show the results of implementation of one design using single and multiple channel PMTs.
