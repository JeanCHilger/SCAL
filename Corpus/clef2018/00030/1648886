Global and regional cerebral metabolic rate of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose in the presence of ofloxacin, a gamma-aminobutyric acid a receptor antagonist. We investigated the effects of ofloxacin, a new antibacterial quinolone gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor antagonist, on the global and regional cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (cMRgl). Twelve healthy normal male volunteers (mean age, 26.7 years) were studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol of 11 days' duration. Results of a total of 42 positron emission tomography studies were obtained for these subjects: 12 base line, 18 during placebo, and 12 during ofloxacin administration. The conditions under which repeat positron emission tomography studies of the same subject were performed were reproduced as closely as possible. cMRgl was measured in 24 brain regions. The global cMRgl for base line, placebo, and ofloxacin were 8.82 +/- 1.17, 8.24 +/- 1.17, and 8.79 +/- 1.18 mg/min/100 g, respectively (mean +/- 1 standard deviation). The mean global differences between base line and placebo and between ofloxacin and placebo were 5.1 and 6.6%, respectively. Analysis of variance of both the global and the regional cMRgl showed no statistical difference between base-line, placebo, and ofloxacin studies. Variations in cMRgl found in this study were not related to the presence of ofloxacin. Results of our study demonstrate that ofloxacin does not increase or decrease cMRgl beyond the limits of variability of the study.
