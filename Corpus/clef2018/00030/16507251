Cloning and expression of soluble B lymphocyte stimulator. To clone and express soluble B lymphocyte stimulator (sBLyS).Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and used to synthesize cDNA by reverse transcription. sBLyS cDNA was amplified by PCR with specific primers and inserted into a prokaryotic expression vector pET-30a. Recombinant plasmid was transformed into E.coli strain BL21(DE3). sBLyS was expressed in E.coli, purified in vitro, and analyzed with peptide mass fingerprinting and Daudi cell proliferation assay.sBLyS cDNA was cloned. Peptide mass fingerprinting of purified BLyS matched with that of BLyS proteins. Purified sBLyS could stimulate Daudi cell proliferation in vitro.sBLyS with biological activity was successfully expressed and purified.
