Decreased striatal D1 binding as measured using PET and [11C]SCH 23,390 in patients with major depression with anger attacks. This study assessed striatal dopamine 1 (D1) receptor binding in patients with major depressive disorder and anger attacks (MDD+A) and healthy volunteers. We used positron emission tomography with [(11)C]SCH 23,390 to compare 10 patients with MDD+A to 10 healthy volunteers. [(11)C]SCH 23,390 binding in bilateral striata was significantly lower in the MDD+A group when compared to healthy volunteers. These results implicate striatal D1 receptor dysfunction in MDD+A and further suggest an association between dopaminergic transmission and anger or aggression.
