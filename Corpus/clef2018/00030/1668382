Endogenous opiate response to pain in rheumatoid arthritis and cortical and subcortical response to pain in normal volunteers using positron emission tomography. Identification of the main areas in the brain that respond specifically to the "suffering" components of pain has been achieved by using serial dynamic measurements of blood flow as an index of synaptic activity. Specific response to a repeated painful thermal stimulus as compared to a non-painful thermal stimulus in normal male volunteers identified the anterior cingulate cortex and the thalamus contralateral to the side of stimulation as the main sites of significant response. It was concluded that it was these areas where pain was likely to be experienced. Changes in opioid receptor binding in the brain was measured using 11C-diprenorphine and positron emission tomography in three patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In the two patients with active rheumatoid arthritis substantial changes in opioid receptor binding in the brain are described. The significance of these findings are discussed.
