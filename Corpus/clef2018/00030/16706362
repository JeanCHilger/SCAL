The effect of surface free energy parameters of diamond-like carbon films deposited on medical polyethylene terephthalate on bacterial adhesion. Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films were deposited by acetylene plasma immersion ion implantation-deposition (PIII-D) on biomedical polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The capacities of Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE), Escherichia coli (EC), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Candida albicans (CA) for adhesion to PETs are quantitatively determined by the plate counting and Gamma-ray counting of 125I radio labeled bacteria in vitro. The results indicate that the capacities of five types of bacteria for adhesion to PETs are all suppressed by C2H2 PIII-D (P<0.05). The surface energy components of the various substrates and bacteria are calculated based on measurements in water, formamide and diiodomethane and Lifshitz-van del Waals/acid-base approach (LW-AB). The surface free energies obtained are used to calculate the interfacial free energies of adhesion (deltaF(adh)) of five kinds of bacteria on various substrates, and the results show that it is energetically unfavorable for bacterial adhesion to the DLC films already deposited on PET by C2H2 PIII-D.
