Molecular cloning and expression of human PDGF-B chain peptide gene and its effect on cat corneal endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. To construct pET-PDGF-B plasmid with over expression of PDGF and investigate its effects on cat corneal endothelial cells proliferation in vitro.Gene rearrangement technique was used to construct the prokaryotic vector with insertion of pET-PDGF-B. The recombinant PDGF-B was obtained from E. coli BL21 (DE3). The effects of recombinant PDGF-B on proliferation and morphologic changes of cultured cat corneal endothelial cells were assayed by modified tertrozalium salt (MTT), inverted phase contrast microscope and transmission electron microscope.PDGF-B peptide gene was inserted into prokaryotic expression vector pET-28a (+), which was confirmed by sequence analysis a 27,000 protein band was demonstrated as pET-PDGF-B from extraction of E. coli BL21 (DE3) using western blotA constructed pET-PDGF-B plasmid vector over expression of PDGF is produced. Recombinant PDGF-BB promotes cultured cat corneal endothelial cells proliferation.
