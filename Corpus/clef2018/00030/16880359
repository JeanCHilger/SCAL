Biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: are we ready? Although clinical manifestations of cognitive dysfunction and impairments of activities of daily living are the current standard measures for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, biomarkers are receiving increasing attention in research centers as possible early diagnostic measures or as surrogate measures of the ongoing pathology. In preparation for the upcoming development of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed DSM-V) nosology, the American Psychiatric Association has sponsored an effort to reassess the current approaches to diagnosis in dementia in general and Alzheimer's disease in particular. This article focuses on the potential use of biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, in the monitoring of mild cognitive impairment, and as possible prognostic markers in normal controls at risk for dementia. Most advanced information is available with the biomarkers found in the cerebrospinal fluid, but there are many other potential biomarkers using blood, brain imaging, or a combination. The current biomarker approaches to diagnosis are reviewed along with a special emphasis on near-term recommendations and further research directions.
