Outcome of cats adopted from a biomedical research program. Adoption of companion animals retired from biomedical research projects can provide an alternative, humane method for their disposition. For more than a decade, the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine has allowed investigators to arrange for the adoption of nonhuman animals used in their research. This report directed a survey to caregivers (owners) of 458 cats adopted over a 6-year period. The survey determined (a) retention rate of adopted cats in their original homes, (b) characteristics of adopters and cats, (c) adopters' initial expectations and subsequent experiences with the cats, (d) quality of the humananimal bond, and (e) adopters' perceptions of the adoption process. Completed surveys totaled 275 (60.0% response rate) with a median follow-up interval of 38 months. Of cats surveyed, 91.3% were still in their original homes, 91.0% had seen a veterinarian following adoption, and 80.4% were highly valued family members. The procedures followed to place cats in appropriate homes satisfied the vast majority of adopters surveyed. These results suggest that adoption into private homes is a viable alternative for cats who have completed research studies.
