Clinical impact of integrated PET/CT on the management of suspected cervical cancer recurrence. To assess the value and clinical impact of integrated PET/CT using (18)F-FDG in the diagnosis and management of women with suspected cervical cancer recurrence.Fifty-two patients with cervical cancer with suspected recurrence because of clinical, cytological, biochemical and radiological findings were retrospectively evaluated. A final diagnosis of recurrence was confirmed by histologic tissue biopsy or by further clinical or radiological evidence. The clinical impact of information provided by PET/CT on patient management was assessed on the basis of clinical follow-up data concerning further diagnostic or therapeutic approach.Twenty-eight of 32 positive PET/CT scans (87.5%) were proven to have recurrent disease. Seventeen of 20 negative PET/CT scans (85.0%) had no evidence of disease. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PET/CT for detecting recurrence were 90.3%, 81.0%, and 86.5% respectively. PET/CT changed the management of 12 patients (23.1%) by changing treatment plan (5 patients), by initiating unplanned treatment strategy (4 patients), or by obviating the need for planned diagnostic procedures (3 patients). Median duration after performing PET/CT and last follow-up was 12 (range: 6-27) months, and the 2-year disease-free survival rate of patients with negative PET/CT scan for recurrence was significantly better than that of patients with positive PET/CT (85.0% vs. 10.9%, P=0002).In patients with a suspected recurrence of cervical cancer, integrated PET/CT using (18)F-FDG provides good anatomic and functional localization of suspicious lesions, and the better diagnostic interpretation has an impact not only on clinical management and treatment planning of patients, but also on disease-free survival.
