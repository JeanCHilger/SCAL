Feasibility of photofrin II as a radiosensitizing agent in solid tumors--preliminary results. Photofrin II has been demonstrated to serve as a specific and selective radiosensitizing agent in in vitro and in vivo tumor models. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of a clinical application of Photofrin II.12 patients were included in the study (7 unresectable solid tumors of the pelvic region, 3 malignant gliomas, 1 recurrent oropharyngeal cancer, 1 recurrent adenocarcinoma of the sphenoid sinus). The dose of ionizing irradiation was 30-50.4 Gy a boost irradiation of 14 Gy was added for the pelvic region. All patients were intravenously injected with 1 mg/kg Photofrin II 24 h prior to the commencement of radiotherapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) controls and in some cases positron emission tomography (PET) were performed in short intervals. The mean follow-up was 12.9 months.No major adverse events were noted. Minor adverse events consisted of mild diarrhea, nausea and skin reactions. A complete remission was observed in 4/12 patients. A reduction in local tumor volume of >45% was achieved in 4/12 patients. Stable disease was observed in 4/12 patients. 1 patient showed local disease progression after 5 months.The early follow- up results are encouraging regarding the feasibility of the application of Photofrin II as a radiosensitizing agent.
