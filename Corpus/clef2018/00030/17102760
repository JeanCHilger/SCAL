Imaging molecular and cellular events in transplantation. Imaging methods such as nuclear medicine (including positron emission tomography), magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and optical imaging can be used to provide information about the expression of genes, and the location of molecules and cells in intact animals or patients. In the setting of transplantation, this will allow monitoring of inflammatory responses, as well as the state of the graft. In this review, the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to imaging will be discussed, as well as their potential application to transplantation.
