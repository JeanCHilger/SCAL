Radionuclide imaging for hyperparathyroidism (HPT): which is the best technetium-99m sestamibi modality? To determine the utility of available radionuclide imaging modalities for preoperative parathyroid localization, we compared the accuracy of 4 types of technetium-99m ((99)Tc) sestamibi-based scans.Over 5 years, 833 patients with sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism underwent either (99)Tc-sestamibi with planar views (Planar n = 138)Planar scans had significantly more false negatives (no tumor visualized) than SPECT-based scans (P < 0.01), but positive predictive values were similar. A false-negative scan was present in 38% of Planar scans, 27% SPECT, 4% SPECT/(123)I, and 17% SPECT/CT, with single adenoma found at operation in 77%, 64%, 53%, and 74%, respectively. When a scan had a single focus of uptake, SA was found at that location in 77%, 85%, 68%, and 87%, respectively. SPECT, SPECT/(123)I, and SPECT/CT did not significantly reduce the false-positive rate.We recommend obtaining multiplanar SPECT-based imaging, which offers 3-dimensional localization and improved detection of parathyroid tumors when compared with Planar scans. A negative scan did not predict multigland disease.
