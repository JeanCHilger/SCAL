Recovery of total I-131 activity within focal volumes using SPECT and 3D OSEM. We experimentally investigated the SPECT recovery of I-131 activity in multiple spheres located simultaneously at different locations within a cylindrical phantom that had an elliptical cross section. The sphere volumes ranged from 209 cc down to 4.2 cc. A Prism 3000 camera and two types of parallel-hexagonal-hole collimation were employed: high energy (HE) and ultra high energy (UHE). Using appropriately-different 3D models of the point source response function for the two types of collimation, approximately the same recovery of activity could be achieved with either collimation by 3D OSEM reconstruction. The recovery coefficient was greater with no background activity in the phantom by 0.10, on average, compared to that with background. In the HE collimation case, the activity recovery was considerably better for all volumes using 3D OSEM reconstruction than it had been in the past using 1D SAGE reconstruction. Recovery-coefficient-based correction in a simulated patient case involving spherical tumours moderately improved the activity estimates (average error reduced from 14% to 9% for UHE collimation, and from 15% to 11% for HE collimation). For a test case with HE collimation, increasing the projection-image sampling density while decreasing the image voxel size increased the recovery coefficient by 0.075 on average, and, if used in a full set of calibration measurements of recovery coefficient versus volume, might lead to further improvement in accuracy for the patient case.
