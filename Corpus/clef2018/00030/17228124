High accuracy multiple scatter modelling for 3D whole body PET. A new technique for modelling multiple-order Compton scatter which uses the absolute probabilities relating the image space to the projection space in 3D whole body PET is presented. The details considered in this work give a valuable insight into the scatter problem, particularly for multiple scatter. Such modelling is advantageous for large attenuating media where scatter is a dominant component of the measured data, and where multiple scatter may dominate the total scatter depending on the energy threshold and object size. The model offers distinct features setting it apart from previous research: (1) specification of the scatter distribution for each voxel based on the transmission data, the physics of Compton scattering and the specification of a given PET system (2) independence from the true activity distribution
