Experience with palliative [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy in advanced neuroblastoma. Our experience with palliative [131I]metabenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) therapy in 7 patients (6 children and 1 adult) affected by advanced neuroblastoma is reported. All patients (classified as IV stage) showed a progression following initial intensive therapy, including chemotherapy and, in some cases, hemi-body irradiation and surgery for their primary tumor. 131I-MIBG activity ranged for a single course between 2.77 GBq to 5.55 GBq on the basis of age, intensity of uptake, and the hematological assessment. Four patients received only one course of therapy due to progressive disease (2), early death (1) or persistent thrombocytopenia unrelated to 131I-MIBG therapy (1). Two patients received two courses and showed a partial response lasting 4 months and stable disease lasting 3 months respectively. Therapy was thereafter discontinued due to progression. One patient received 4 courses of therapy (cumulative activity = 19.61 GBq) in 5 months. A partial response for 9 months in the bone metastases was documented, but the therapy was discontinued due to persistent thrombocytopenia (58,000 plts/microL) lasting 4 months. Thrombocytopenia was the major side-effect, occurring in 5/7 patients over 8 courses of therapy for a mean period of 37 days (7-120 d). Thus, in our experience thrombocytopenia is the major factor limiting the therapeutic effect of 131I-MIBG therapy in palliative treatment.
