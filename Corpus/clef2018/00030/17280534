SPECT/CT with a hybrid camera: a new imaging modality for the functional anatomical mapping of infections. Evaluation of: Bar-Shalom R, Yefremov N, Guralnik L et al. SPECT/CT using (67)Ga and (111)In-labeled leukocyte scintigraphy for diagnosis of infection. J. Nucl. Med. 47(4), 587-594 (2006). Labeled leukocytes and (67)Ga scan have been proved to be useful to image infectious and inflammatory processes. However, it is well known that nuclear imaging lacks precise anatomical landmarks. When highly specific tracers are used, the background activity may be too low to be used as a framework for spatial orientation. To overcome these drawbacks, the hybrid devices combining positron emission tomography/single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and computed tomography (CT) have been introduced, thereby providing a precise anatomical-functional correlation. The paper under evaluation highlights the emerging role of hybrid SPECT/CT to image infection with labeled leukocytes and (67)Ga. The authors suggest that fusion imaging can be of paramount value to locate the site of infection and to better define the extent of disease.
