Combined modality treatment of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx is a major public health concern it causes substantial morbidity and mortality, and arises chiefly as a result of tobacco and alcohol consumption. Early stage disease is best treated with radiation or surgery alone, but for patients with more locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, combined modality treatment has been shown to benefit selected patients, particularly when cisplatin-based chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy are employed, with or without altered fractionated radiation therapy. Substantial laryngectomy-associated quality-of-life decrements can be avoided in selected, potentially resectable patients with organ-sparing approaches, without sacrificing survival. Recently, trials have addressed the role of targeted systemic agents to the epidermal growth factor receptor, and other targets are under investigation. The addition of induction chemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiotherapy is a promising treatment strategy that warrants further evaluation, but has not yet emerged as a standard of care
