Myocardial and peripheral vascular functional adaptation to exercise training. Exercise training seems to restore impaired vascular function in both peripheral and myocardial vessels in patients with coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease or in patients with risk factors for these diseases. However, the results on the effects of exercise training on vascular function in apparently healthy subjects are controversial. We studied the effects of long-term volitionally increased physical activity on peripheral and myocardial vascular function in nine young healthy male monozygotic twin pairs discordant for physical activity and fitness. The brothers were divided into more (MAG) and less active groups according to physical activity and fitness. The difference between groups in VO(2max) was 18+/-10% (P<0.001). Myocardial perfusion at rest, during adenosine-induced vasodilatation and during cold-pressor test and myocardial oxygen consumption were measured with positron emission tomography. In addition, endothelial function was measured using ultrasound in brachial and left anterior descending coronary arteries, and standard echocardiographic measures were taken. No differences were observed in myocardial perfusion measurements between groups. MAG tended to have a lower oxygen extraction fraction (P=0.06), but oxygen consumption was similar between the groups. No differences were found in coronary artery, myocardial resistance vessel or peripheral endothelial function between groups. These results suggest that when the effects of heredity are controlled, myocardial perfusion reserve and endothelial function, both in peripheral arteries and myocardial vessels, are not enhanced by increased physical activity and fitness in young healthy adult men.
