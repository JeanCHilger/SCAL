Functional neuroimaging in post-traumatic stress disorder. Traumatic stress has a broad range of effects on brain function. Brain areas implicated in the stress response include the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Brain studies in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder replicated findings in animal studies by finding alterations in these brain areas. Brain areas implicated in post-traumatic stress disorder play an important role in the stress response as well as memory, highlighting the important interplay between memory and the traumatic stress response. Future studies are required to assess the relationship between recovery from traumatic stress and changes in brain function.
