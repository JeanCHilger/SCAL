Auditory cortical activation and speech perception in cochlear implant users. Cochlear implantation is generally accepted as a successful means of restoring auditory sensation to profoundly deaf individuals. Although most patients can expect a satisfactory outcome following implantation, some have poor speech perception outcomes. This investigation used [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography to measure cortical activity resulting from auditory stimulation in seven 'good' and four 'poor' cochlear implant recipients. Activations were significantly greater in both the primary and association cortices in the good compared with the poor implant users. We suggest that the ability to access the more specialised speech processing abilities of the auditory association cortices helps determine outcome following cochlear implantation.
