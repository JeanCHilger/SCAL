Liver metastases from colorectal cancer: imaging with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced MR imaging, computed tomography and positron emission tomography. The literature about superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced MR imaging, computed tomography (CT) and PET (positron emission tomography using fluorine-18 labelled fluoro-deoxy-glucose) in detection of liver metastases (LM) from colorectal cancer is reviewed in this update. Special emphasis is given to studies with surgical standard of reference allowing for the lesion-by-lesion sensitivity to be determined. Based on the review, it is concluded that state-of-the-art anatomical imaging, e.g., SPIO-enhanced MR imaging and multidetector CT (MDCT), must be considered more sensitive than PET in detection of individual LM, due to technical developments in MR imaging, such as liver specific contrast agents, modern sequences and high performance gradients, and in modern MDCT have increased the performance of these modalities. MR imaging with a liver specific contrast agent is recommended for the preoperative evaluation before liver surgery for LM because of high sensitivity and better discrimination between small LM and cysts compared to MDCT. PET or PET/CT can be used for detection of extra-hepatic tumor before liver surgery.
