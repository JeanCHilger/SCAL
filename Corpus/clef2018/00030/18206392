Modeling dose-dependent neural processing responses using mixed effects spline models: with application to a PET study of ethanol. For functional neuroimaging studies that involve experimental stimuli measuring dose levels, e.g. of an anesthetic agent, typical statistical techniques include correlation analysis, analysis of variance or polynomial regression models. These standard approaches have limitations: correlation analysis only provides a crude estimate of the linear relationship between dose levels and brain activity ANOVA is designed to accommodate a few specified dose levels
