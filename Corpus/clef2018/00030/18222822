Cross-plane scattering correction-point source deconvolution in PET. The authors propose a new 2-D point source scattering deconvolution method. The cross-plane scattering is incorporated into the algorithm by modeling a scattering point source function. In the model, the scattering dependence on axial and transaxial directions is reflected in the exponential fitting parameters, and these parameters are directly estimated from a limited number of measured point response functions. The results comparing the standard in-plane line source deconvolution to the cross-plane point source deconvolution show that for a small source the former technique overestimates the scatter fraction in the plane of the source and underestimates the scatter fraction in adjacent planes. In addition, the authors also propose a simple approximation technique for deconvolution.
