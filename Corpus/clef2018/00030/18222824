Positron emission tomography with a large axial acceptance angle: signal-to-noise considerations. A volume imaging positron emission tomography (PET) scanner with a large acceptance angle, such as the PENN-PET, offers fine spatial sampling and resolution in three dimensions, and a high sensitivity because of the inclusion of all cross-plane rays. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is used to evaluate image quality for different scanning conditions of the PENN-PET using an activated cylindrical phantom with cold spheres of various sizes. Raising the energy threshold to 400 keV improves the SNR by lowering the scatter fraction, though it also reduces the sensitivity. Increasing the axial acceptance angle from +/-1.3 degrees to +/-6.5 degrees improves the SNR by increasing the sensitivity, even with a two-dimensional reconstruction algorithm, which compromises spatial resolution in the axial direction for points at the edge of the radial field of view. Initial results show that a three-dimensional reconstruction offers an improved SNR over a two-dimensional reconstruction that does not use all cross-plane rays.
