The Theory of Three-Dimensional Image Reconstruction for PET. A review is made of selected recent publications on three-dimensional image reconstruction for PET. A new algorithm is proposed which is designed to fully utilize all emitted gamma rays which can be detected in a truncated spherical detector. By such full utilization of emitted rays the new algorithm should produce images of better statistical accuracy than could be produced by previously known algorithms.
