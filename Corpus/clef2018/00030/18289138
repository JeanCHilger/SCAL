No differences are seen in the regional cerebral blood flow in the restricting type of anorexia nervosa compared with the binge eating/purging type. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is subdivided into the restricting type (AN-R) and the binge-eating/purging type (AN-BP), but differences in cerebral blood flow between patients with these types of AN and healthy controls have not been investigated.The present study was designed to elucidate any such differences using resting single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies to compare the differences in cerebral perfusion among both types of AN and a healthy control group. Resting regional cerebral blood flow was assessed using SPECT with technetium-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime in 13 female AN-R patients, 13 female AN-BP patients, and 10 healthy women as controls with 3-D stereotactic surface projections.The analytic program of the SPECT images showed bilateral decreased perfusion of the subcallosal gyrus (SCG), midbrain and posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) in both AN-R and AN-BP patients, as compared with the controls. There were no clear differences between the AN-R and AN-BP groups. There were no significant differences in cerebral blood flow between patients with AN-R and AN-BP.Abnormalities of the neuronal circuits containing the SCG, midbrain and PCG are possibly relevant to trait-related AN.
