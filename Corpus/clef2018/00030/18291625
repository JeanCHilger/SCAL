Interictal hyperemia correlates with epileptogenicity in polymicrogyric cortex. To investigate pathophysiological factors underlying the presence of interictal hyperperfusion within the limits of the polymicrogyric (PMG) cortex in epileptic patients.Retrospective observational study on interictal perfusion by Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) in 16 patients with PMG and its correlations with a number of clinical and neurophysiological variables. Patients underwent video-EEG monitoring, neurological and psychiatric assessments, invasive EEG, and the interictal SPECT coregistered to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).Patients with interictal hyperperfusion within the PMG cortex had a significantly higher spike rate on interictal EEG than patients with normal perfusion. Interictal hyperperfusion was not correlated to sex, age at epilepsy onset, age at evaluation, number of seizures per month, presence of initial precipitating insult (IPI), abnormal neurological examination, EEG findings, ictal semiology, and seizure outcome. The high interictal spike rate did not correlate to a high frequency of seizures per month.Our work provides further evidences for an intrinsic epileptogenesis of the PMG cortex during the interictal state, which accounts for the major role of PMG tissue in seizure generation. These results might help to increase our understanding about epileptogenesis related to the PMG cortex, providing new tools for more tailored epilepsy surgery in PMG patients.
