Prefrontal hypoperfusion and cognitive dysfunction correlates in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between brain perfusion and cognitive dysfunction in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) patients.Thirteen genetically confirmed SCA6 patients and 21 age- and education-matched control subjects were subjected to single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and neuropsychological tests. Brain perfusion was examined with SPECT analysis, while general cognition, verbal and visual memory, attention, visuospatial ability, language, executive function, depression, and anxiety were examined with the neuropsychological tests.SCA6 patients showed prefrontal hypoperfusion, and impairments of visual memory, verbal fluency, and executive function compared to control subjects. These neuropsychological impairments in SCA6 patients were significantly correlated with a decrease in prefrontal perfusion. This relation was not correlated to other factors, such as age, education and severity of cerebellar ataxia, which are possible relevant factors associated with cognitive performance.SCA6 patients have mild cognitive impairment, and correlating prefrontal hypoperfusion. These results indicate cognitive impairment in SCA6 patients resulting from prefrontal hypoperfusion.
