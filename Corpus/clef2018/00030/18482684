Cerebral kinetics of the dopamine D(2) receptor ligand [(123)I]IBZM in mice. In vivo small animal imaging of the dopaminergic system is of great interest for basic and applied neurosciences, especially in transgenic mice. Small animal SPECT is particularly attractive because of its superior spatial resolution and tracer availability. We investigated the kinetics of the commercial dopamine D(2) receptor (DZR) ligand [(123)I]IBZM in mice as a prerequisite for an appropriate design of translational SPECT imaging between mice and humans.Cerebral kinetics of [(123)I]IBZM under isoflurane anaesthesia were assessed by autoradiography in mice sacrificed at 30, 60, 120 and 200 min after iv injection. To explore the possible effects of isoflurane anaesthesia, an additional mice group was only anaesthetized for 20 min before being sacrificed at 140 min (putative time of single-scan SPECT analysis).Maximum [(123)I]IBZM uptake in the striatum (D(2)R-rich 10.5+/-2.7 %ID/g) and cerebellum (D(2)R-devoidThe present study suggests that [(123)I]IBZM is a suitable ligand for D(2)R-SPECT in mice. Although a single-scan analysis may be a pragmatic semi-quantitative approach, tracer kinetic analyses on dynamic SPECT data should be pursued. The interfering effects of isoflurane anaesthesia need to be considered.
