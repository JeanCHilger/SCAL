A convenient route to [68Ga]Ga-MAA for use as a particulate PET perfusion tracer. A convenient method is described for compounding [(68)Ga]Ga-MAA (MAA=macroaggregated human serum albumin) with the eluate of a commercially available TiO(2)-based (68)Ge/(68)Ga generator. The final [(68)Ga]Ga-MAA product was obtained with an 81.6+/-5.3% decay-corrected radiochemical yield and a radiochemical purity of 99.8+/-0.1% (n=5). Microscopic examination showed the [(68)Ga]Ga-MAA product to remain within the original particle size range. The entire procedure, from generator elution to delivery of the final [(68)Ga]Ga-MAA suspension, could be completed in 25 min. Only 4.4+/-0.9% of the total (68)Ge breakthrough remaining associated with the final [(68)Ga]Ga-MAA product. The procedure allows reasonably convenient preparation of [(68)Ga]Ga-MAA in a fashion that can be readily adapted to sterile product compounding for human use.
