Diagnostic accuracy of integrated FDG-PET/contrast-enhanced CT in staging ovarian cancer: comparison with enhanced CT. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of integrated positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with IV contrast for preoperative staging of ovarian cancer, in comparison with enhanced CT, using surgical and histopathological findings as the reference standard.Forty patients with ovarian cancer underwent FDG-PET/contrast-enhanced CT scans for staging before primary debulking surgery. PET/CT and the CT component separately, were interpreted by two experienced radiologists by consensus for each investigation. Status with regard to lesion inside and outside the pelvis was determined on the basis of histopathology. The significance of differences between the two imaging modalities was determined using the McNemar test.Staging revealed stage I in 18 patients (IA, n=9 IB, n=3Integrated FDG-PET/contrast-enhanced CT is a more accurate imaging modality for staging ovarian cancer and useful for selecting appropriate treatment than enhanced CT.
