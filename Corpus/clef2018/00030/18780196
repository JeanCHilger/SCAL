Brain serotonin transporter binding of [123I]ADAM: within-subject variation between summer and winter data. The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) controls several physiological functions, and a disturbance of the 5-HT system is implicated in many psychiatric conditions. Seasonal variation has been suggested in the 5-HT system. We investigated within-subject seasonal variation in brain serotonin transporter (SERT) binding with the SERT-ligand [(123)I]ADAM and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 12 healthy individuals. No systematic variation was found in the midbrain or thalamus areas between scans done in summer and winter. Our results suggest that factors other than season are more important in causing within-subject variation of brain SERT binding between summer and winter.
