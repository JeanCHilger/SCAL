Computed tomography response, but not positron emission tomography scan response, predicts survival after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for resectable non-small-cell lung cancer. Tumor response is considered a surrogate marker of survival. We investigated whether tumor response based on computed tomography (CT) scan or whole-body [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scan after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is prognostic of survival.Two consecutive phase II clinical trials were jointly analyzed. Patients underwent CT and PET scans before and after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by surgery.Eighty-nine patients were included. Patients with a partial or complete response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors categories (n = 33) had a better overall survival than those with stable or progressive disease (n = 56 median survival time, not reached v 36 months, respectivelyAmong patients with resectable NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we found no evidence that tumor response by PET scan after chemotherapy is prognostic of survival however, response by CT scan was associated with better survival.
