Defining normal distributions of coronary artery calcium in women and men (from the Framingham Heart Study). Coronary artery calcium (CAC) may improve risk stratification for patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) beyond traditional risk factors. Subjects from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring and Third Generation cohorts (48% women mean age 53 years) underwent noncontrast electrocardiographically triggered cardiac multidetector computed tomography. The prevalence of absolute CAC (Agatston score [AS] >0, >100, and >400) and relative age- and gender-specific strata (25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles) were determined in a healthy subset free of clinically apparent cardiovascular disease or CHD risk factors (n = 1,586), the overall sample at risk (n = 3,238), and subjects at intermediate Framingham risk score (FRS
