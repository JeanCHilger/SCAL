Cloning, sequence analysis, and expression of a gene encoding Chromobacterium sp. DS-1 cholesterol oxidase. Chromobacterium sp. strain DS-1 produces an extracellular cholesterol oxidase that is very stable at high temperatures and in the presence of organic solvents and detergents. In this study, we cloned and sequenced the structural gene encoding the cholesterol oxidase. The primary translation product was predicted to be 584 amino acid residues. The mature product is composed of 540 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence of the product showed significant similarity (53-62%) to the cholesterol oxidases from Burkholderia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The DNA fragment corresponding to the mature enzyme was subcloned in the pET-21d(+) expression vector and expressed as an active product in Escherichia coli. The cholesterol oxidase produced from the recombinant E. coli was purified to homogeneity. The physicochemical properties were similar to those of native enzyme purified from strain DS-1. K(m) and V(max) values of the cholesterol oxidase were estimated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. The V(max)/K(m) ratio of the enzyme was higher than those of commercially available cholesterol oxidases. The circular dichroism spectral analysis of the recombinant DS-1 enzyme and Burkholderia cepacia ST-200 cholesterol oxidase showed that the conformational stability of the DS-1 enzyme was higher than that of B. cepacia ST-200 enzyme at higher temperatures.
