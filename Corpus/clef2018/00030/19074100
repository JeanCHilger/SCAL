Investigative tools for diagnosis and management. Recent advances in genomics and proteomics have advanced our understanding of myeloma pathogenesis, recognized novel mediators of disease process, and identified new therapeutic targets. These developments have provided newer diagnostic tools for myeloma, improved monitoring of the disease status and allowed for molecular classification of the disease. The recent advances in investigative techniques that have helped refine the diagnostic work up in myeloma includes use of serum free light chains, especially in oligosecretory myeloma, patients with renal disease and with amyloidosis use of MRI and PET scan in diagnosis and managing bone disease
