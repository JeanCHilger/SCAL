Limited-stage disease: optimal use of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. In the early years of treatment for limited-stage Hodgkin lymphoma there was an understandable focus on disease elimination. This has been replaced by concerns about the amount and balance of different therapies and eventually, as cure rates improve, a desire to individualize management based on risk factors at presentation and response to initial treatment. In limited stage Hodgkin lymphoma, early success was obtained with wide field radiotherapy but later combined modality approaches were employed to overcome the problem of out of field radiotherapy relapses. The acute and delayed toxicity of alkylating agent based therapies led to their replacement with ABVD and concerns about the late toxicity of radiotherapy resulted in smaller field sizes being first assessed in clinical trial and later introduced into clinical practice. The current standard of care of 3 or 4 cycles of ABVD followed by involved-field radiotherapy in clinically staged patients is the culmination of years of work involving many thousands of patients taking part in clinical trials. Our current focus is on the role of PET imaging and whether a response-adapted approach guided by PET can individualize therapy such that radiotherapy and its attendant late toxicity that impacts on future quality of life and survival can be avoided altogether in a subset of patients.
