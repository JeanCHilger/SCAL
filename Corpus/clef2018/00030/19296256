Evaluation of the primary lesion detection in colorectal carcinoma with (18)F-FDG PET-CT. To explore the clinical value of detecting primary lesions of colorectal carcinoma with (18)F-FDG PET-CT.Clinical data of 23 cases of colorectal carcinoma collected from April 2007 to June 2008, including PET-CT, endoscopy, operation and pathology, were analyzed retrospectively.Of the 23 colorectal cancer patients, including 15 males and 8 females, 11 received abdominal CT contrast examination, 7 abdominal CT general examination and 5 chest CT examination. The lesions located in caecum in 5 cases, ascending colon 4 cases, transverse colon 2 cases, descending colon 2 cases, sigmoid colon 4 cases, rectum 6 cases. CT images showed local mass, incrassation and nodes in colon. PET images revealed intensely hypermetabolic lesions. The maximum of standard uptake value (SUVmax) was 11.7+/-9.5, and the delay SUVmax was 14.8+/-11.0. The bigger was the mass, the higher was the SUV. The highest SUV was 44.8. Metastatic lesions were found in 15 cases. More cases and more metastatic lesions were found by (18)F-FDG PET-CT.The primary and metastatic lesions of colorectal carcinoma can be detected sensitively and exactly by (18)F-FDG PET-CT, which is helpful in tumor staging and making the treatment plan.
