Combining chronic kidney disease with 201thallium/123iodine beta methyliodophenyl pentadecanoic acid dual myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography findings is useful for the evaluation of cardiac event risk. Chronic kidney disease is a noteworthy pathophysiology as a risk factor of cardiovascular disease. We investigated the usefulness of combining glomerular filtration rate and 201thallium(201TI)/123iodine-beta-methyliodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (123I-BMIPP) dual myocardial scintigraphic findings for predicting cardiac events.Seventy-five patients suspected of coronary artery disease underwent 201TI/123I-BMIPP dual myocardial scintigraphy. Clinical and nuclear variables were included in the multivariate analysis for predicting hard events (cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction) and soft events (unstable angina, heart failure, and coronary revascularization). Glomerular filtration rate was estimated by the modification of diet in renal disease formula. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to investigate the incremental prognostic value of glomerular filtration rate.During the mean follow-up period of 425 days, eight patients had hard events and 20 patients had soft events. Multivariate analysis revealed that glomerular filtration rate and the sum of total defect score in 123I-BMIPP image were independent predictors of total cardiac events, whereas sex, diabetes, glomerular filtration rate, and the number of abnormal segments in 201TI image were those of hard events. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that greater risk stratification was achieved by adding a glomerular filtration rate of lesser than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 to the sum of the total defect score > or = 5 in the 123I-BMIPP image. Greater risk stratification for hard events was also achieved by adding a glomerular filtration rate of lesser than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 to the number of abnormal segments > or = 2 in 201TI image.Better risk stratification can be achieved by adding glomerular filtration rate to 201TI/123I-BMIPP dual myocardial scintigraphic findings.
