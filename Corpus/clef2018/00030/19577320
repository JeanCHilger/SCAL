Clinical characteristics of pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung. Pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung is a malignant epithelial tumor that contains carcinomatous and sarcomatoid components. Due to its rarity, few studies have been reported, and its clinical and pathological characteristics remain unclear.We retrospectively investigated 22 cases of pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung.Fifteen cases were diagnosed by surgical resection, 4 by autopsy, and 3 by transbronchial biopsy. Nineteen patients were male and 3 were female, and their mean age at diagnosis was 68.3 years (+/-10.1). Eighteen were current- or ex-smokers with substantial smoking histories (mean 46.4 pack-years). Sixteen patients had symptoms: hemoptysis and cough were commonly seen. Chest computed tomography (CT) findings revealed that the tumors were quite large (mean diameter 45.3+/-21.9mm range 14-110mm), and 21 tumors were peripherally located. Positron emission tomography with 18-fluorodeoxy-glucose (FDG-PET) was performed in 12 patients, and the Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) tended to be high (9.44+/-4.98). In the 15 patients who underwent surgical resection, recurrence was commonPulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma has strong malignant potential with frequent distant metastases, as has already been reported. However, this study demonstrated that surgical treatment and appropriate follow-up therapy might result in better prognoses.
