Accuracy of early and delayed FDG PET-CT and of contrast-enhanced CT in the evaluation of lung nodules: a preliminary study on 30 patients. The aim of our prospective study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of early, delayed and dual-time-point positron emission tomography (PET) acquisition with contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) within a PET-CT examination in the evaluation of pulmonary solitary nodules (SPNs).Thirty patients were enrolled in the study. All the patients underwent a dual-time-point PET-CT examination. Whole-body PET images were acquired at 50 min after fluorine18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) administration (early), followed by a chest acquisition (delayed). Lung nodules with maximum standardised uptake value SUVmax > or =2.5 were considered malignant. SUVmax was calculated on early and delayed images SUV increasing > or =10% (Delta SUVmax) was considered suggestive of malignancy. Absence of significant lung nodule enhancement (<15 Delta HU) at CT was considered strongly predictive of benignity. For the CT morphological assessment, the irregularity of the shape of each lesion was rated. PET-CT results were related to histological assays and clinical records. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by area under the receiveroperarting characteristic (ROC) curves analysis.Early and delayed SUVmax of malignant nodules were significantly higher than those of benign disease. Early SUVmax sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 77%, 91%, 79.5% and 66.7% delayed SUVmax corresponding values were 77%, 66%, 74% and 66%In our small series of patients, early and delayed SUVmax showed comparable accuracies, whereas morphological and contrast enhanced CT evaluations showed the lowest accuracies. Dual-time-point SUVmax showed the largest AUC. However, dual-time-point SUVmax was most sensitive, whereas single-time-point SUVmax was most specific.
