New technologies in breast imaging. Large, randomized controlled trials have proven the efficacy of mammography in reducing breast cancer mortality. However, the known deficiencies of mammography have led to the development of new technologies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), digital mammography, computer-assisted diagnosis, positron-emission tomography (PET), technetium 99m sestamibi, and expanding roles for breast ultrasound have been explored as tools in breast cancer detection and evaluation. This article discusses these modalities and their current uses.
