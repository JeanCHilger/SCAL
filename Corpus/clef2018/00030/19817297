Comparison of one-stage direct revascularization and medicine therapy for treatment of ischemic moyamoya disease. To compare the therapeutic effect of one-stage direct revascularization and medicine therapy for the treatment of ischemic moyamoya disease.From March 2002 to March 2008, 18 patients with ischemic moyamoya disease (12 males and 6 females) were treated, aged 9 to 33 years old. Eighteen patients presented with ischemic stroke, including 11 cases of cerebral infarction and 7 cases of transient ischemic attack. According to Chinese ischemic cardiovascular diseases evaluation tools, 17 patients were classified as low risk ischemic stroke and 1 as moderate risk ischemic stroke. Different levels of occlusion branch of the intracranial carotid arteries and pathosis collaterals were identified by DSA. Fourteen patients and 4 patients were showed unilateral and bilateral hypoperfusion of cerebral blood flow by single photon emission computed tomography, respectively. Eleven patients received superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis and 7 patients received medicine (anti-PLT agglutinin and calcium channel blocker).All incisions healed at stage I. There was no stroke events during perioperation. Anastomosis vessel vasospasm occurred in 2 patients 5 days after operation and hyperperfusion syndrome in 1 patient 2 weeks after operation. All patients were followed up 13-32 months (mean 18 months). In 11 anastomosis patients, 6 underwent 6 stroke events within 12 monthsAs long as onset of stroke occurred and ischemic moyamoya disease is diagnosed, one-stage direct revascularization should be performed, which can reduce the rate of stroke recurrence risk and slow down the progression of disease.
