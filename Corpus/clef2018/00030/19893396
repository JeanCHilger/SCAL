C-11 acetate does not enhance usefulness of F-18 FDG PET/CT in differentiating between focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatic adenoma. We assessed the usefulness of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) and C-11 acetate PET (AC PET) in distinguishing hepatic lesions due to consequential disease (hepatocellular adenoma and malignant lesions) from focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) in patients at low risk of malignancy.Thirty-one patients with 43 lesions were prospectively enrolled. The diagnostic work-up included Doppler and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, contrast-enhanced computed tomography, and/or magnetic resonance imaging. Fine needle biopsy was performed if the imaging study was inconclusive. The work-up revealed 36 FNH and 7 consequential lesions (5 hepatocellular adenoma, 1 hepatoma, and 1 metastasis). All patients underwent FDG and AC PET. FDG PET with target/background ratio (T/Br) greater than 1.2 and AC PET with T/Br of less than 1.2 were considered positive test for consequential disease.On FDG PET, we had 6 true-positive out of 7 lesions due to consequential diseases, with a sensitivity of 85.7%, and 33 true-negative out of 36 lesions with FNH, with a specificity of 91.7%. Using AC PET, there were 2 true-positive lesions out of 7 caused by neoplasms, with a sensitivity of 28.6%, and 34 true-negative lesions out of 36 FNH, with a specificity of 94.4%.When the goal is differentiating FNH from liver neoplasms, AC PET offered no additional diagnostic advantage over what is achieved with FDG PET.
