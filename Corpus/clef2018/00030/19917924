N2 disease in patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy: is there a role for posttreatment neck dissection? To determine whether nodal necrosis and node size of 3 cm or larger are risk factors for recurrent neck disease and whether negative computed tomography-positron emission tomography (CT-PET) results 8 weeks or more after therapy indicate complete response in the neck in patients with N2 disease.Retrospective study.State university hospital.Fifty-six patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer and N2 disease treated with chemoradiotherapy were evaluated for persistent or recurrent neck disease. Tumor characteristics analyzed were primary site, T category, nodal size (<3 cm or > or =3 cm), nodal necrosis based on hypodensity of one-third or more of the node, and type of N2 disease (N2a, N2b, or N2c). Forty-eight of the 56 patients underwent CT-PET to determine treatment response after chemoradiotherapy. Clinical examination, imaging, and pathologic specimens were used to confirm disease recurrence.The number of recurrence events, disease-free interval, and positive posttreatment CT-PET result in the neck.Most patients had oropharyngeal tumors (n = 37 66%), T2 tumors (n = 21Posttreatment neck dissections may not be indicated for patients with N2 disease and a negative CT-PET result, even in patients with nodal necrosis and nodes 3 cm or larger.
