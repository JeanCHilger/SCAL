Cerebellar apparent diffusion coefficient changes in patients with supratentorial ischemic stroke. To evaluate apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in cerebellar subregions in patients with stroke.The total counts and ADCs were bilaterally measured on cerebellar white matter, gray matters of medial (G1), intermediate (G2), and lateral zones (G3) on SPECT and ADC maps from 20 patients with supratentorial ischemic stroke within the first 48 h and on day 8 after onset. ADCs were also obtained from 15 age-matched controls.Within 48 h, the ADCs were significantly increased bilaterally in the G3, and tended to be increased bilaterally in the white matter and G1, and contralateral G2 compared with controls. On day 8, the ADCs were significantly increased in all contralateral cerebellar subregions and in ipsilateral G1 and G2, and tended to be increased in ipsilateral G3. The ADC value was significantly higher in contralateral than in ipsilateral white matter on day 8. The interhemispheric asymmetry indices (AIs) of ADC and SPECT were significantly associated with each other in G2 and G3 within 48 h, but not on day 8. The AIs of ADC and SPECT were significantly related to each other in the G3 within 48 h and on day 8.Supratentorial ischemic stroke may cause mild cerebellar vasogenic edema.
