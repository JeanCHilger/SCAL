Disorders of the autonomic nervous system in patients with Brugada syndrome: a pilot study. The aim of this study was to examine autonomic disorders in patients with Brugada syndrome by performing a cardiac sympathetic innervation evaluation, a head-up tilt-test (HUT) and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis.We enrolled 20 patients with Brugada syndrome (mean age 42.5 +/- 8.8 years), 9 with spontaneous and 11 with an induced type 1 electrocardiogram (ECG) in the setting of symptoms and 20 age-matched controls. All subjects underwent a HUT with parallel measurements of plasma catecholamines and cortisol, a (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine single photon emission tomography, and HRV evaluation. Ten control subjects participated in the innervation portion of the study. The tilt-test with clomipramine challenge was positive in 15 of 20 (75%) patients (7 spontaneous, 8 induced) and in 1 in controls (P < 0.01). A sympathoadrenal imbalance was shown in positive tests. The pattern of innervation in all groups was heterogenic and similar to controls with a trend towards lower measurements in patients with a spontaneous type 1 ECG and a positive HUT. HRV analysis did not reveal any significant differences during day and night. Four patients (20%) had sustained ventricular arrhythmias during a follow-up of 31.1 +/- 8.6 months, but no correlations with innervation or response to tilting were found.A high susceptibility to vasovagal syncope was observed in patients with Brugada syndrome, which could be disease-related symptoms. Conversely, sympathetic innervation was observed to follow a physiological, heterogenic pattern however, these factors did not have prognostic value for life-threatening arrhythmias.
