Cardiac PET-CT: advanced hybrid imaging for the detection of coronary artery disease. Hybrid imaging of positron emission tomography (PET) together with computed tomography (CT) is rapidly emerging. In cardiology, this new advanced hybrid imaging modality allows quantification of cardiac perfusion in combination with assessment of coronary anatomy within a single scanning session of less than 45 minutes. The near-simultaneous anatomical evaluation of coronary arteries using CT and corresponding functional status using PET provides a wealth of complementary information in patients who are being evaluated for (suspected) coronary artery disease, and could help guide clinical patient management in a novel manner. Clinical experience gained with this recently introduced advanced hybrid imaging tool, however, is still limited and its implementation into daily clinical practice remains largely unchartered territory. This review discusses principles of perfusion PET, its diagnostic accuracy, and potential clinical applications of cardiac PET-CT in patients with ischaemic heart disease. (Neth Heart J 201018:90-8.).
