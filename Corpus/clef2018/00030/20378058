PET versus PET/CT dual-modality imaging in evaluation of lung cancer. Software coregistration of FDG-PET and CT datasets as well as integrated FDG-PET/CT enable significantly more accurate assessment of NSCLC staging than either modality alone. Integrated FDG-PET/CT has been shown to be more accurate in NSCLC staging than FDG-PET and CT read side by side. However, the benefits of anatometabolic imaging using FDG-PET/CT can only be fully exploited if optimized acquisition protocols are implemented.
