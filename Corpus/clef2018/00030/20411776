The substantia nigra, the basal ganglia, dopamine and temporal processing. It has been proposed that the basal ganglia are important to the temporal processing of milliseconds- and seconds-range intervals, both within the motor and perceptual domains. This review summarizes and discuses evidence from animal, pharmacological, clinical, and imaging research that supports this proposal, with particular reference to the role of the substantia nigra (SN).
