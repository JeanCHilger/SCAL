Positive progress in immunoPET--not just a coincidence. The identification of tumor tissue biomarkers has led to the production, validation, and Food and Drug Administration-approval of a number of antibody-based targeted therapeutics in the past two decades. As a result of the significant role that these immunotherapeutics play in the management of cancer, and the potential utility of complementary imaging agents, immunoPET imaging has generated considerable interest. This update discusses the important factors to consider when designing a PET (positron emission tomography) imaging agent from the molecular target to the biological targeting molecule and radionuclide combination and also reviews recent preclinical and clinical findings in the immunoPET field. Although there are a variety of radionuclides that are currently utilized in PET studies, this update focuses on four of the positron emitters commonly used in labeling proteins: iodine-124, zirconium-89, copper-64, and fluorine-18. Notable advances in the preclinical setting include the continued development of immunoPET probes to predict the biodistribution of related radioimmunotherapeutics, the success of nontraditional radionuclide and antibody fragment combinations, the broader use of zirconium-89, and the recent emergence of (18)F-labeled diabodies for same-day imaging. Antibody-based PET probes constitute a valuable class of molecular imaging agents, and the progress made preclinically should expedite the transition of these targeted diagnostics to clinical applications.
