Relationship between biological marker expression and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in incidentally detected thyroid cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms associated with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) uptake in an incidentally detected thyroid cancer during nonthyroid cancer evaluation. Among 92 patients (10 men and 82 women mean age, 56.2 +/- 10.9 years
