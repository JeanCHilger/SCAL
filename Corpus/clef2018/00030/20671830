Imaging in neuro-ophthalmology: An overview. Advances in neuroimaging and interventional techniques have revolutionized the early diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of neuro-ophthalmic disorders. These techniques include computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT and MR angiographic techniques, catheter digital subtraction angiography, functional MRI, positron emission tomography, and single photon emission computed tomography. In this review, the value of current techniques in the diagnosis, localization, and treatment of various neuro-ophthalmic disorders is described.
