PET imaging for pediatric oncology: an assessment of the evidence. Positron emission tomography (PET) has shown potential benefits when used in therapeutic clinical trials for children with cancer. However, existing trials are limited in scope with small numbers of patients and varied observations, making accurate conclusions about the usefulness of PET scanning impossible. This review examines PET and its applications in pediatric oncology. While evidence is limited, there appears to be a basis for rigorous evaluation of this imaging modality before widespread application without validation from clinical trials.
