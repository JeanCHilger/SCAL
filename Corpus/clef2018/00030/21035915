Metastatic basal cell carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to review our series of metastatic basal cell carcinomas of the head and neck.A retrospective review was conducted for this study.All cases of documented metastatic basal cell carcinomas arising from a primary within the head and neck region and presenting for treatment to one of the authors (Y.D.) were included in this review.Nine patients were available for review. Five patients had extension to but not transgression of the base of skull. Sites for metastatic disease included 4 lungs and 5 parotid glands. All metastatic lesions were treated with surgical excision, and 6 also received postoperative radiation therapy. No patient deaths from disease have been noted at an average follow-up of 4.7 years (range, 3-8.5 years). No evidence of further metastatic disease has been noted in any of these patients on follow-up.Metastatic basal cell carcinoma arising from a head and neck primary is a rare entity. However, initial involvement of the skull base and/or dura by a basal cell carcinoma appears to warrant a complete metastatic workup and metastatic surveillance. When metastatic disease is discovered, it appears to be well treated by surgical resection with/without adjunctive radiation therapy. We do not favor chemotherapy for resectable basal cell carcinomas.
