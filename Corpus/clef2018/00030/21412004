FP-CIT SPECT does not predict the progression of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. FP-CIT (fluoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-4-iodophenyl-nortroptane) SPECT is a well-established nuclear medicine method to support the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we examined the prognostic value of FP-CIT SPECT concerning the PD motor symptoms.All 38 PD patients (age 57 ± 7 years, Hoehn & Yahr stage 1.6 ± 0.8, mean ± SD) underwent a baseline visit and a follow-up visit 3-7 years (5.2 ± 1.3 years) after the baseline visit. Cerebral [(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT was performed only once at the baseline visit. At both visits the motor symptoms bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, postural tremor and axial symptoms were quantified by means of the UPDRS motor scale.There was no significant correlation between the initial striatal FP-CIT uptake and the annual progress of any motor symptom (= difference [(motor symptom at follow-up visit) - (motor symptom at baseline visit)]/time (in years) between assessments).The initial striatal FP-CIT SPECT does not predict the velocity of progress of PD motor symptoms within an interval of 3-7 years.
