Construction of sub-unit dengue vaccines and analysis of its immunogenicity. To construct sub-unit vaccines of dengue virus type 1 to 4 and to analyze its immunogenicity.Envelope domain III s of dengue serotypes 1 and 2, as well as 3 and 4, were spliced by a linker (Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Ser)3 and cloned into vector pET-30a, then transformed into E. coli to express recombinant fusion proteins. The recombinant proteins were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and mixed to immunize BALB/c mice. The neutralizing antibodies were tested by neutralizing assay, as well as in newborn mice challenged intracranially with dengue virus type 1 to 4.Mice immunized with proteins could produce neutralizing antibodies, with titers of 1:34. 9, 1: 45.3, 1: 24.7 and 1:38.4 for DEN-1 to 4 respectively. 100% newborn mice challenged with DEN-1 or 2 in combination with sera from mice immunized with recombinant proteins were protected, whereas 83% protection was obtained when challenged with DEN-3 or 4.The recombinant proteins possess excellent immunogenicity to induce neutralizing antibodies and would be valuable for development of a tetravalent sub-unit vaccine.
