Importance of residual myocardial ischemia after intervention in the genesis of cardiovascular events among patients with chronic coronary artery disease. Recent randomized clinical trials support the strategy of ischemia-guided management for patients with stable ischemic heart disease. The application of serial testing to examine the efficacy of therapeutic intervention for ischemia suppression and to document the extent and severity of ischemia provides an important means to guide clinical decision making. This review provides a synopsis of available evidence on serial testing and meaningful thresholds for application of paired rest/stress myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography imaging.
