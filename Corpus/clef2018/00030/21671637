Post-self-assembly covalent chemistry of discrete multicomponent metallosupramolecular hexagonal prisms. The multicomponent coordination-driven self-assembly of hexakis[4-(4-pyridyl)phenyl]benzene, cis-(PEt(3))(2)Pt(II)(OTf)(2), and amine- or maleimide-functionalized isophthalate forms discrete hexagonal prisms as single reaction products. The amino or maleimide groups decorating the isophthalate pillars of the prisms provide reactive sites for post-self-asssembly modifications. In this communication, we demonstrate that the hexagonal prisms can be functionalized without disrupting the prismatic cores, enabling the incorporation of new functionalities under mild conditions.
