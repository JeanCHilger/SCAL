An effective novel delivery strategy of rasagiline for Parkinson's disease. This is the first report on the efficacy of a new controlled release system developed for rasagiline mesylate (RM) in a rotenone-induced rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). PLGA microspheres in vitro released RM at a constant rate of 62.3 μg/day for two weeks. Intraperitoneal injection of rotenone (2 mg/kg/day) to Wistar rats produced typical PD symptoms. Catalepsy, akinesia and swim tests outcomes in animals receiving RM either in solution or within microspheres showed a reversal in descent latency when compared to rotenone-treated animals, being this reversal specially pronounced in animals receiving RM microspheres (dose equivalent to 1 mg/kg/day RM injected i.p. every 15 days). Nissl-staining of brain sections showed selective degeneration of the substantia nigra (SNc) dopaminergic neurons in rotenone-treated animals which was markedly reverted by RM microspheres. PET/CT with (18)F-DG resulted in mean increases of accumulation of radiotracer in striatum and SNc of around 40% in animals treated with RM microspheres which also had significant beneficial effects on Bcl-2, Bax, TNF-α mRNA and SOD2 levels as detected by real-time RT-PCR. Our results confirm the robust effect achieved by the new controlled release system developed for RM which exhibited better in vivo efficacy than RM given in solution.
