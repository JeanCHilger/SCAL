A nanoscale fluorocarbon coating on PET surfaces improves the adhesion and growth of cultured coronary endothelial cells. Plasma deposition was applied to deposit smooth and nanostructured fluorocarbon coatings on polyethylene terephthalate substrates, with the aim to obtain surfaces with identical chemical composition but different roughness to improve the endothelialization process on PET surfaces. We found that increased roughness was associated with enhanced endothelial cell response, as shown by the ability of cells to grow and adhere to nanostructures. We also observed specific interaction of filopodia protruding from the cell membrane with individual nanostructures, leading to increased cell attachment, spreading and cell viability. Among the modified surfaces, one termed PET-tfl90 emerged as the one capable of best sustaining the formation of a confluent monolayer of endothelial cells. In conclusion, PET modified by nanostructured fluorocarbon film represents an improved graft material, over conventional PET, for endothelial cell adhesion and growth.
