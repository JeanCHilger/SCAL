Prognostic factors in stage III non-small cell lung cancer: a review of conventional, metabolic and new biological variables. Lung cancer is one of the most frequently occurring neoplasms and usually has a poor prognosis because most of the patients present with advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Numerous prognostic factors (PFs) have been studied, but the two most prominent, having both prognostic and operational values, are disease stage and performance status. Even if the literature on PFs in lung cancer is impressive, the number of publications specifically dealing with PFs in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is limited. We reviewed the literature on this topic and separated the available information into three groups: conventional PFs, metabolic criteria (standardized uptake value [SUV] measured on(18)F-FDG-PET) and new biomarkers. Performance status and the distinction between stage IIIA and IIIB confirmed their prognostic value in stage III NSCLC. Other conventional PFs have been suggested such as age, weight loss, response to treatment and some characteristics describing the locoregional extension of the tumour. There is a place for the SUV as a PF for survival in early NSCLC, but its role in stage III NSCLC has to be further assessed. Some new biomarkers involved in cell cycle regulation or in apoptosis have been shown to have potential value. Their role needs to be confirmed in large prospective studies including conventional PFs to determine their independent value as a PF in stage III NSCLC. In conclusion, few PFs have been well evaluated in stage III NSCLC. New studies, taking into account the modifications derived from the 7th international staging system of the UICC, have to be performed.
