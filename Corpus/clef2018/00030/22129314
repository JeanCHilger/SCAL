Antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effect of Santalum album in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. Santalum album Linn (Santalaceae), commonly known as Sandalwood is used traditionally for its antihyperlipidemic and diuretic activity.This study investigated the antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effect of long-term oral administration of the Santalum album pet ether fraction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin at 70 mg/kg body weight. Rats were treated with Santalum album pet ether fraction orally at a dose of 10 µg/kg body weight twice daily for 60 days. Metformin (30 mg/kg body weight) was used as positive control. Lipid profile and glycated hemoglobin were estimated. HPLC profiling of Santalum album pet ether fraction was carried out.Treatment of diabetic rats for 60 days demonstrated reduction in blood glucose level by 140 mg/dl. Metformin treated group showed a decrease in blood glucose by 70 mg/dl, as against an increase in diabetic control group by 125 mg/dl. Total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride (TG) levels were decreased by 22, 31 and 44%, respectively, in treated diabetic rats whereas, cardioprotective, high density lipoprotein (HDL) increased by 46%. In case of metformin, the values were 11, 29 and 15% respectively, while HDL increased by 7%. Significant improvement in atherogenic index from 267 to 139% was observed in treated rats.Santalum album pet ether fraction has potential antihyperlipidemic activity that can help in overcoming insulin resistance.
