Correlation of apparent diffusion coefficients measured by diffusion-weighted MR imaging and standardized uptake values from FDG PET/CT in metastatic neck lymph nodes of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Both diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography are oncological imaging techniques. The aim of this study was to assess any correlation between apparent diffusion coefficients and standardized uptake value in metastatic neck lymph nodes of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.
