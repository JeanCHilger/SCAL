Utility of FDG PET/CT in the assessment of myeloid sarcoma. Myeloid sarcoma (MS) is a rare extramedullary manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia that often presents during remission or disease relapse. With awareness of this clinical entity and the appropriate clinical history, MS can be detected despite its nonspecific radiologic features.This article highlights the utility of (18)F-FDG PET/CT, which has high sensitivity in detecting early MS and provides a systemic overview of tumor burden, and its potential role in monitoring of treatment response.
