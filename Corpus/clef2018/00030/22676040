Recognition of Hg2+ ion through restricted imine isomerization: crystallographic evidence and imaging in live cells. A newly synthesized imine-based receptor (L) showed remarkable specificity toward the Hg(2+) ion in aqueous media over other metal ions. Coordination of L to Hg(2+) induces a turn-on fluorescence response. This was explained based on the restricted imine isomerization along with PET on coordination to Hg(2+). X-ray structural evidence tends to favor a C-C bond rotation rather than C‚ïêN isomerization for adopting a favorable conformation in L for coordination to Hg(2+). This reagent could be used for imaging the accumulation of Hg(2+) ions in HeLa cells.
