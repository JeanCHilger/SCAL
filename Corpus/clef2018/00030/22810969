Positron emission tomography/computed tomography predictors of overall survival in stage IIIC/IV ovarian cancer. To evaluate the role of 2-deoxy-2-(F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for selecting patients with extensive ovarian cancer (OC) for neoadjuvant chemotherapy by evaluating predictors of overall survival in patients with stage IIIC/IV OC.From September 1, 2004, to November 20, 2011, 514 consecutive patients with a pelvic tumor underwent preoperative PET/CT 179 patients had stage IIIC/IV OC. Patients' characteristics were collected from 153 patients with stage IIIC/IV OC who underwent primary surgery. In 152 patients with stage IIIC/IV OC, clinical predictors and PET/CT predictors of survival were evaluated.Median age was 64 years (range, 38-88 years) 87% (113) of the 153 patients had a performance status of less than 2Suggested PET/CT criteria for referral of patients with advanced OC to neoadjuvant chemotherapy are PET/CT stage IV, pleural exudates, and PET-positive large bowel mesentery implants. Evaluation of selection criteria for neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be promoted in prospective clinical trials, with survival as the primary end point.
