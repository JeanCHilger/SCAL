A gated-7T MRI technique for tracking lung tumor development and progression in mice after exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation. A gated-7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) application is described that can accurately and efficiently measure the size of in vivo mouse lung tumors from ∼0.1 mm(3) to >4 mm(3). This MRI approach fills a void in radiation research because the technique can be used to noninvasively measure the growth rate of lung tumors in large numbers of mice that have been irradiated with low doses (<50 mGy) without the additional radiation exposure associated with planar X ray, CT or PET imaging. High quality, high resolution, reproducible images of the mouse thorax were obtained in ∼20 min using: (1) a Bruker 7T micro-MRI scanner equipped with a 60 mm inner diameter gradient insert capable of generating a maximum gradient of 1000 mT/m (2) a 35 mm inner diameter quadrature radiofrequency volume coil
