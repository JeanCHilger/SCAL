Cerebral palsy: initial experience with Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT of the brain. The outlook for children with cerebral palsy is determined by the severity of motor problems and the presence of associated disabilities, in which early detection remains a medical challenge. The authors studied 13 children (aged 13 months to 12 years) with cerebral palsy by means of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain with technetium-99m hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime (HMPAO). In all children with hemiplegia, SPECT demonstrated hypoperfusion in the hemisphere contralateral to the motor deficit. SPECT demonstrated normal findings in patients with mild diplegia bilateral hypoperfusion in the superior motor cortex in patients with moderate di- or tetraplegia
