An examination of the opiate receptor subtypes labeled by [3H]cycloFOXY: an opiate antagonist suitable for positron emission tomography. 17-Cyclopropylmethyl-3,14-dihydroxy-4,5-alpha-epoxy-6-beta-fluoromorp hinan (cycloFOXY) is a fluorinated derivative of naltrexone suitable for labeling opiate receptors using positron emission transaxial tomography. Using the quantitative ligand binding method "binding surface analysis," in vitro autoradiography, and site-directed alkylating agents, [3H]cycloFOXY is shown to label mu and kappa opiate binding sites in vitro. Similar results were obtained using [3H]naloxone. Additional experiments demonstrate that [3H]cycloFOXY administered in vivo also labels mu and kappa binding sites. The relevance of these findings are discussed from clinical and basic science perspectives.
