The early circulatory and ventilatory response to voluntary and electrically induced exercise in man. 1. The ventilatory and circulatory responses to electrically induced leg exercise (EEL) were studied in seven normal subjects and compared with the responses to performing the same exercise voluntarily (EV). 2. EEL was produced by surface electrode stimulation of the quadriceps and hamstring muscle groups. This produced a push-relax pattern of exercise against a spring load and was free of any pain or discomfort. EV, at the same level, was achieved by subjects copying a display of timing and force information on a storage oscilloscope. 3. Cardiac output was estimated using validated Doppler ultrasound measurements of the velocity in the ascending aorta, combined with an estimate of aortic cross-sectional area using M-mode echocardiography. 4. Data from EV and EEL exercise runs were matched, within subjects, for the increase in oxygen consumption during the first 30 s of exercise there were no significant differences between the resting states prior to either form of exercise. 5. The first ten beats of exercise were used to study the circulatory on-transient. The cardiac output responses to both EV and EEL were similar
