Brain interactions in chronic schizophrenics under resting and activation conditions. The metabolic patterns of correlation among brain images obtained during resting conditions and during an eye tracking task were investigated in 12 controls and 18 chronic schizophrenics using positron emission tomography (PET) and deoxy[11C]glucose. Analyses of the interaction between brain regions revealed highly significant differences between groups under both test conditions. Schizophrenics showed lower correlations between anterior and posterior areas and between thalamus and cortical areas than the normals and less change between the baseline and the task than the normals. The schizophrenic subjects showed derangements in the pattern of interactions among brain areas, both under baseline and under activation as compared to the control group.
