Pasteurella multocida bacteremia: report of thirteen cases over twelve years and review of the literature. 13 episodes of bacteremia caused by Pasteurella multocida were seen in a general hospital during a 12-year period. All the patients had an underlying disease (77% had cirrhosis) and 2 were receiving chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy. There was a numerical preponderance of male patients (69%). In 5/13 cases a recent animal-derived trauma could be found. In the other cases the source of the infecting organism was thought to be endogenous (from patients' own pharyngeal commensal flora) or secondary to contact with secretions of a pet animal. The clinical presentation of sepsis caused by this organism was nonspecific. Hypotension was seen in 5 cases. Localized sites of infection were certain in 6 and only clinically suspected in 4 other cases. The overall mortality rate was 31%. The administration of ampicillin seems the appropriate therapy for Pasteurella multocida bacteremia.
