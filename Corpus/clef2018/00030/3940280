Noninvasive in vivo demonstration of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose metabolism beyond the hexokinase reaction in rat brain by 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The metabolism of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in vivo was observed noninvasively in rat brain using 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy following an intravenous injection of FDG (400 mg/kg). At 3 h after infusion, four resonances with discrete chemical shifts were resolved. Chemical shift analysis of these resonances suggested the chemical identity of two of the resonances to be FDG and/or FDG-6-phosphate and 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-delta-phosphogluconolactone and/or 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate. The chemical identities of the other two resonances remain to be elucidated. The present study indicates that the metabolism of FDG in vivo is more extensive than is previously recognized and demonstrates the feasibility of using 19F NMR spectroscopy to follow the 19F-containing metabolites of FDG in vivo.
