99Tcm-pyrophosphate myocardial scintigraphy: the role of volume-rendered three-dimensional imaging in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of volume-rendered three-dimensional imaging in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) using 99Tcm-pyrophosphate (99Tcm-PYP) scintigraphy in a diagnostically difficult group of patients. In total, 117 patients were studied using planar, single photon emission tomography (SPET) and 3-D volume-rendered imaging performed 3 h after receiving 555 MBq (15 mCi) of 99Tcm-PYP intravenously. 555MBq (15 mCi) of 99Tcm-PYP intravenously. Two teams of physicians reported in a blinded and random fashion on each planar, SPET and 3-D rotating image study. Individual reports were compared with reports that used all three imaging modalities in combination. Observer reproducibility was between 85 and 90% and inter-observer team agreement was between 87 and 91%. A score based on clinical history, electrocardiography, serum cardiac enzyme levels and cardiac risk factors was validated and used as a de facto 'gold standard' for AMI for 75 of the subjects for whom all these details were available. The sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of combined planar, SPET and 3-D rotating image modalities were all 84%. Analysis of each modality in isolation showed SPET imaging to have the highest sensitivity (74%) and specificity (89%). In combination with SPET and planar imaging, 3-D rotation image presentation increases diagnostic sensitivity without appreciably altering overall diagnostic accuracy. 99Tcm-PYP myocardial SPET imaging shows good utility in the diagnosis of AMI in diagnostically difficult patients.
