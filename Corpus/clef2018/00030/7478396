Superimposition of PET images using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose with magnetic resonance images in patients with pancreatic carcinoma. Six patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were studied using 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) using positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In all six cases there was avid accumulation of 18F-FDG within the pancreatic tumour and clear visualization of the tumour on the MRI images. Delineation of the tumours was aided by superimposition of the images from the two imaging methods, which was achieved by using a system of surface markers.
