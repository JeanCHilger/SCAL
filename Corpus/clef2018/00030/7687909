The topographic mapping of evoked bioelectrical activity and other methods for the functional neural visualization of the brain. The paper is concerned with comparative characterization of brain functional imaging used in medicine today: bioelectrical activity mapping, assessment of spatial changes in cerebral blood flow by radionuclide and hydrogen clearance, NMR imaging, PET-scan, magnetoencephalography and thermoencephaloscopy. Original researches in neurosurgery clinic with the use of the mapping of evoked potentials enable the conclusion to be drawn about advisability of applying these methods in treatment and diagnostic practice. Besides, the mechanisms of compensation for higher mental functions in organic brain lesions are discussed.
