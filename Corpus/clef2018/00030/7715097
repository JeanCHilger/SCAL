Quantitative analysis of myocardial tracer distribution in patients with ischemic heart disease: comparison of 201T1 and 123I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP). Quantitative assessment of myocardial tracer uptake in stress-delayed thallium and resting BMIPP imagings were performed in 24 patients with coronary artery disease. Each distribution was displayed on the bull's eye polar map and % uptake of each distribution was calculated as a mean value in 9 myocardial segments on the polar map. Redistribution index (% delayed uptake minus % stress uptake on thallium images) and discordance index (% delayed thallium uptake minus % BMIPP uptake) were also calculated. Each parameter was compared to the visual uptake score and wall motion score on contract left ventriculography. Excellent correlations were obtained between % uptake and the uptake score in each tracer. The % thallium and BMIPP uptake also correlated with regional wall motion score. Furthermore, a significant correlation was observed between redistribution and discordance indexes in the mildly hypoperfused segments. These data indicate that the quantitative analysis of thallium and BMIPP distributions seems to be valuable to understand relationship between perfusion and regional wall motion. The discordant BMIPP uptake may represent asynergic but viable segments. However, several important factors, such as attenuation factor should be also taken into consideration for such quantitative analysis.
