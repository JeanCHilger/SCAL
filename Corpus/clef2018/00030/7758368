Serologic response in dogs after a mass primary antirabies vaccination (inactivated vaccine) at Pikine Dakar (Senegal). Mass antirabic vaccination campaign, allowed in 1987, the immunization of 514 pet dogs against rabies at Pikine, a suburban area of Dakar. Dogs received one subcutaneous dose of inactivated tissue culture rabies vaccine (RABISIN, Rhône Mérieux France). Mean antibodies titles in ELISA on days 30, 180 and 360 after vaccination, are respectively 4.78 1.55 and 0.25 IU/ml. In the same time the proportions of protected animals are 74%, 81% and 7%. This results is compared with those obtained in other countries. The rapid decrease of antibodies suggest the role of poor general health of animals such as malnutrition, infections, external and internal parasitemia.
