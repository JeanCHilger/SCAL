Immunoscintigraphy results in the comparison of ocular with cutaneous melanoma. For several years, immunoscintigraphy (IS) using a 99mTc-labeled monoclonal antibody for tumor localization has been used as an additional tool in the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. The aim of our study was to verify previously published data with respect to our own patients and to correlate immunoscintigraphic results with histological findings. In particular, we wanted to compare the outcome of IS in ocular melanoma with that in cutaneous melanoma. We examined 28 patients (15 females, 13 males, average age 64 years) with clinically suspected ocular melanoma. IS was performed using the monoclonal antibody 225.28S (Tecnemab-K-1, Fa. Sorin/Solco), and images were obtained in a standard fashion (planar) as well as with the SPECT technique. In 16 patients, the tumor was examined afterwards histologically. The control group consisted of 102 patients with histologically proven metastasizing cutaneous melanoma who were investigated by IS in an identical fashion. In contrast to the literature published so far, we demonstrated a positive IS reaction in only 42% (and 56% in histologically proven cases, respectively) in our patients with ocular melanoma, while in patients with cutaneous melanoma, we found a sensitivity of more than 80%. In the 3 patients who turned out not to have ocular melanoma, we found one false-positive reaction (subretinal hemorrhage). No correlation was found between the various histological features of ocular melanoma and the immunoscintigraphic results. We conclude that IS using the antibody 25.28S is of limited value in patients with ocular melanoma and should only be recommended in selected cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
