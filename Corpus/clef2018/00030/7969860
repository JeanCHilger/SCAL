Correlations between quantitative EEG and regional cerebral blood flow (SPECT) in patients with partial epilepsy. During interictal periods in 9 patients with partial epilepsy we examined whether there were correlations between the relative power of background EEG (power spectral analysis) and the absolute values of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measured by 99mTc hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) SPECT in each cerebral region. None of the patients had any organic cerebral lesions on X-ray CT examinations, neurological abnormalities or mental retardation. There was an inverse correlation between rCBF and the relative power of the theta band, and a direct correlation between rCBF and that of the alpha band of 10-12.8 Hz, in the right and/or left frontal, parietal and temporal regions. In the occipital regions, there was a direct correlation only between rCBF and the relative power of the beta band. These correlations were noted whether the analyzed regions were epileptic foci or not. These results suggest that background EEG and rCBF changes in epileptic patients are closely coupled.
