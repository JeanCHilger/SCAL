Reproducibility of thallium-201 exercise SPECT studies. A detailed analysis of intrapatient reproducibility of exercise SPECT thallium studies is presented.Twenty patients in stable condition were re-examined with exercise-redistribution SPECT201 Tl within 3-9 days without intervening procedures. At peak stress, 3.5 mCi 201Tl were given intravenously 1 min prior to exercise termination. SPECT imaging started at 5 and 180 min. Acquisition and processing protocols were the same for all studies. Coronary angiography was performed on 19 patients and showed coronary artery disease (CAD) in 18, and no CAD in one one patient did not have coronary arteriography.For 16 of 20 patients, exercise levels and ECG were comparable for both studies. Ten patients reproduced ST-segment depression two reproduced anginaThere was excellent reproducibility of 201Tl SPECT scintigraphy in patients who reproduced exercise test performance and symptoms.
