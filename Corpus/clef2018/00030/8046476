Evaluation of coronary artery disease using technetium-99m-sestamibi first-pass and perfusion imaging with dipyridamole infusion. The aims of this study were: (1) to test whether first-pass radionuclide angiocardiography (FPRNA) adds useful information to perfusion scintigraphy and (2) to assess the relative accuracy of perfusion and functional imaging in combination with dipyridamole for the evaluation of CAD.Thirty patients with angiographically proven CAD (17 with prior infarction) were studied on separate days at rest and with dipyridamole infusion (0.7 mg/kg over 4 min). Tomographic images were evaluated using an uptake score. Dipyridamole FPRNA was considered positive in case of stress-induced wall motion abnormality or ejection fraction decrease.The CAD detection rate of perfusion imaging was 100%, while that of FPRNA was 70% using wall motion criteria, 63% using ejection fraction response and 77% considering any abnormality. For CAD localization, perfusion imaging showed 76% sensitivity, 96% specificity and 82% accuracy. FPRNA results were 50%, 100% and 60%, respectively. Perfusion imaging was significantly superior to FPRNA also excluding from the analysis the infarct-related vessels. FPRNA did not identify multivessel CAD, which was correctly detected by perfusion imaging in most cases. Both techniques were more sensitive in case of > or = 90% stenosis, but the difference was more remarkable for FPRNA (sensitivity 65% versus 14%, p < 0.0005).Dipyridamole FPRNA did not add noteworthy clinical information to perfusion imaging regarding CAD detection and evaluation of disease extent. The main contribution of a positive FPRNA was its relation with coronary obstruction severity. These results confirm the superiority of perfusion over functional imaging in combination with coronary vasodilators.
