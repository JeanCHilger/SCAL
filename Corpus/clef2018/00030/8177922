Dopamine D2 and serotonin S2 receptors in susceptibility to methamphetamine psychosis detected by positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to assess the role of dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum and serotonin S2 receptors in the frontal cortex in the susceptibility to methamphetamine-induced psychosis. Subjects were six men who had previously experienced methamphetamine psychosis (methamphetamine subjects) and 10 age- and sex-matched control subjects. The radiotracer used was 11C-N-methylspiperone. Although binding availability, assessed by dynamic analysis, in the two regions did not differ between the two groups, the ratio of binding availability in the striatum to that in the frontal cortex significantly decreased in the methamphetamine subjects as compared with the control subjects. These findings suggest that an imbalance in the activity of these two receptors may be related to the susceptibility to methamphetamine psychosis.
