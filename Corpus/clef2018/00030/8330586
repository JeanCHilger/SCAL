West syndrome due to perinatal insults. Clinical, neuroradiological data and outcome of epilepsy of 32 patients with symptomatic infantile spasms caused by perinatal insults are reported. Neuroradiological investigations showed focal as well as diffuse cerebral lesions. Fifteen children had a porencephalic lesion, 12 had periventricular leukomalacia and five had diffuse bilateral cerebral atrophy, associated with status marmoratus in one child and bilateral ulegyria in another. Eight patients (25%) had epilepsy following West syndrome. In the group of 15 children with porencephalic cysts, the lesion was always unilateral, but topography and extension varied. Eight children had circumscribed cysts involving the rolandic or parieto-occipital regions, and the outcome of epilepsy was favorable. Seven patients had large lesions involving the frontal lobe, associated with unilateral hemispheric atrophy in four cases. These four children had an unfavorable epilepsy outcome. In the 12 patients with periventricular leukomalacia, all premature, eleven had no seizure relapse after the spasms one of these children had epilepsy. In the five full-term patients with bilateral and diffuse cerebral lesions, three children had epilepsy at the last observation. In children with leukomalacia and in patients with localized porencephalic lesions the outcome of epilepsy appears to be better than in patients with diffuse cerebral lesions or in children with extensive porencephalic cysts, particularly those involving the frontal lobe.
