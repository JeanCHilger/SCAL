Validation of nitrogen-13-ammonia tracer kinetic model for quantification of myocardial blood flow using PET. Positron emission tomography has been shown to provide quantitative estimates of myocardial blood flow using 13N-ammonia and 15O-water. In a validation study, myocardial blood flow was noninvasively determined in 11 open-chest anesthetized dogs using dynamic positron emission tomography. The radiopharmaceuticals 13N-ammonia and 15O-water were intravenously administered and measurements were carried out at rest and following pharmacological vasodilation to assess blood flow over a range from 53 to 580 ml/100 g/min. Quantification of blood flow based on tracer kinetic modeling of 13N-ammonia data correlated closely with myocardial blood flow determined by microspheres (y = 0.944 x +7.22, r = 0.986) and with the 15O-water injection technique y = 1.054 x -15.8 (r = 0.99). The use of 13N-ammonia with positron emission tomography enables the accurate quantification of myocardial blood flow. Using this technique, uncomplicated study protocols simplify the measurement procedures while providing excellent qualitative and quantitative information.
