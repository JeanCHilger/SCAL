Hematocrit has no effect on peritoneal transport indices. To assess the effect of hematocrit (Hct) on peritoneal transport indices (PTi), we studied the relationship between Hct (mean 28.1 +/- 5.1%, range 19.1-41.3%) and PTi with 118 peritoneal equilibration tests (PETs 270 min, 1.36%) on 52 stable patients on peritoneal dialysis. Furthermore, considering a Hct 30% as ideal in peritoneal dialysis (PD), 14 patients who had performed a PET both with a Hct <30% and > or = 30% were checked for any variations in the PTi and blood pressure. We analyzed the subsequent PTi: ultrafiltration
