Peritoneal transport in type I (insulin-dependent) and type II (noninsulin-dependent) diabetic peritoneal dialysis patients. Alterations in the fibrinolytic system have been demonstrated in noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients (NIDDM) but not in insulin-dependent diabetic patients (IDDM). Since the activity of the fibrinolytic system can affect the turnover of extracellular matrix and therefore theoretically can affect the peritoneal transport, we tried to determine if there was a difference in the performance of the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) between IDDM and NIDDM patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD). The PET data from 11 IDDM patients (2 female, 9 male) and 13 NIDDM patients (3 female, 10 male) were reviewed. These two groups of patients were matched in gender, duration of end-stage renal disease, PD, and hypertension, blood pressure, degree of uremia, weekly KT/V, and body surface area. The IDDM patients (41.4 +/- 13.9 years) were younger than the NIDDM patients (58.8 +/- 7.1 years, p = 0.0026). There were no differences in hematocrit and serum chemistry profile including glucose and albumin between the two groups. Our data showed that there was no difference in PET performance between IDDM and NIDDM patients.
