A feasibility study on L-[1-carbon-11]tyrosine and L-[methyl-carbon-11]methionine to assess liver protein synthesis by PET. We studied the potential of L-[1-11C]tyrosine ([1-11C]Tyr) and L-[methyl-11C]methionine ([Me-11C]Met) as tracers for measuring protein synthesis rate (PSR) in the liver by PET and proposed their metabolic models.In the liver and plasma of control and cycloheximide-treated mice injected with [1-14C]Tyr and [Me-3H]Met, incorporation of the radioactivity into the acid-soluble fraction and chloroform/methanol-extract (CM), RNA and protein fractions were measured. Data were compared with those from rat studies with 11C-labeled analogs and PET.In mice, liver uptake of [Me-3H]Met was over twice as large as that of [1-14C]Tyr. Similar uptake patterns of the 11C-labeled analogs were found in rats by PET. In the mouse liver at 1 to 6 hr after injection, approximately 69%-73% of the 14C was detected in the protein fraction, whereas approximately 65%-70% of the 3H was in the CM fraction, which reflected phospholipid synthesis. In plasma, the percentages of the protein fractions were approximately 73%-76% for 14C and approximately 36%-46% for 3H. Gel-filtration analysis suggested that 80% of the 14C-labeled plasma proteins was albumin originating from the liver, which corresponds to approximately 25% of the total labeled proteins synthesized in the liver at 6 hr. When protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide, the liver uptake of the [1-14C]Tyr and the protein-incorporation of 14C in the liver and in plasma were decreased dose-dependently. On the other hand, uptake of [Me-3H]Met was significantly enhanced in the liver due to increased incorporation into the CM fraction.[1-Carbon-11]Tyr can be used for measuring the PSR in the liver by PET. Liver uptake of [Me-11C]Met mainly reflects phospholipid synthesis through the transmethylation process.
