Transmission imaging of large attenuators using a slant hole collimator on a three-headed SPECT system. By combining conjugate views, truncation-free attenuation profiles of patients can be obtained by using slant hole collimators on three-headed SPECT systems. The alterations in reconstruction algorithms necessary for use with slant hole collimators and potential image artifacts are discussed. Based on an evaluation of the size of objects that can be imaged without truncation and the size of the overlap region in the conjugate views, a 15 degrees slant angle was determined to be optimal. Studies with a 30 degrees slant hole collimator verified the ability of slant hole transmission imaging to provide accurate, truncation-free attenuation maps of a 56 cm lateral width phantom. The center of rotation was determined to be dependent on the slant angle and radius of rotation of the slant collimator. These studies also demonstrated that the spatial resolution in the transaxial plane of the attenuation maps depends on radius of rotation of the slant hole collimator, but does not depend on the radius of rotation of an uncollimated transmission source. A multiline transmission source was investigated for use with estimating the attenuation map in Tc-99m labeled sestamibi perfusion imaging.
