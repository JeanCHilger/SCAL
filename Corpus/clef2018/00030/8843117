240 degrees: why not? Single photon emission tomographic imaging of myocardial perfusion with 99Tcm-labelled agents is usually performed with single-detector gamma camera systems and 180 degrees anterior data collection. With multi-detector systems, reconstruction over 180 degrees and 360 degrees has been reported. We used a data set of normal subjects to compare both reconstruction methods. In addition, we tested an alternative approach, reconstructing data from 240 degrees acquisitions, excluding the right posterior views, which provide little myocardial information and which are responsible for a reduced signal-to-noise ratio. On the transverse slices, the known apical distortion with the 180 degrees reconstruction was not noted with the 360 degrees or 240 degrees reconstructions. Using semi-quantitative analysis of apical, mid-ventricular and basal short-axis slices, almost complete overlap was observed between the 240 degrees and 360 degrees circumferential profiles of our 20 normal volunteers, except in the inferior wall where a reduction in activity was noted. However, this finding was less pronounced with the 240 degrees than with the 180 degrees reconstruction. The frequent reduction in activity in the anterior wall was more prominent with the 180 degrees than with the 240 degrees and 360 degrees reconstructions. A 240 degrees acquisition represents a useful compromise between 180 degrees and 360 degrees imaging protocols when a single-detector device is used, allowing more homogeneous tracer distribution and a reduction in the apical distortion without material change of contrast or doubling of the acquisition time.
