Focal cortical dysplasia and epilepsy surgery. We conducted corticectomy in twenty-five patients with intractable partial epilepsy due to focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). MRI could not detect FCDs in three patients, interictal SPECT, however, revealed hypoperfusion corresponding to FCDs in two of these patients, while the FCD in one remaining patient was histologically identified in a resected specimen. The location of FCDs was as follows: the frontal lobe in sixteen patients, the temporal in five, the occipital in two, fronto-parietal in one, and the temporo-parietal in one. Prior to the surgery, twenty-one patients underwent invasive long-term intracranial EEG/CCTV monitoring. Of the fourteen patients who were tracked for longer than 2 years following surgery, eleven belonged to Class I according to Engel's criteria, two to Class II, and one to Class III. We compared intracranial EEG findings (interictal and ictal) between these twenty-one patients and eight patients with frontal lobe epilepsy resulting from different lesions. The results of this comparison, together with the seizure outcome following surgery, indicated that FCD is intrinsically epileptogenic. The invasive long-term monitoring should, as a rule, be performed in all patients with FCDs prior to the corticectomy.
