Whole-body positron emission tomography in clinical oncology: comparison between attenuation-corrected and uncorrected images. The clinical need for attenuation correction of whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) images is controversial, especially because of the required increase in imaging time. In this study, regional tracer distribution in attenuation-corrected and uncorrected images was compared in order to delineate the potential advantages of attenuation correction for clinical application. An ECAT EXACT scanner and a protocol including five to seven bed positions, emission scans of 9 min and post-injection transmission scans of 10 min per bed position were used. Uncorrected and attenuation-corrected images were reconstructed by filtered backprojection. In total, 109 areas of focal fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in 34 patients undergoing PET for the staging of malignancies were analysed. To measure focus contrast, a ratio of focus (target) to background average countrates (t/b ratio) was obtained from transaxial slices using a region of interest technique. Calculation of focus diameters by a distance measurement tool and visual determination of focus borders were performed. In addition, images of a body phantom with spheres to simulate focal FDG uptake were acquired. Transmission scans with and without radioactivity in the phantom were used with increasing transmission scanning times (2-30 min). The t/b ratios of the spheres were calculated and compared for the different imaging protocols. In patients, the t/b ratio was significantly higher for uncorrected images than for attenuation-corrected images (5.0+/-3.6 vs 3.1+/-1.4 P<0.001). This effect was independent of focus localization, tissue type and distance to body surface. Compared with the attenuation-corrected images, foci in uncorrected images showed larger diameters in the anterior-posterior dimension (27+/-14 vs 23+/-12 mm
