Clinical value of triple-energy window scatter correction in simultaneous dual-isotope single-photon emission tomography with 123I-BMIPP and 201Tl. To improve the image quality in simultaneous dual-isotope single-photon emission tomography (SPET) with iodine-123 labelled 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) and thallium-201, we applied the triple-energy window method (TEW) for correction of the cross-talk and scatter artifact. Seventy-one patients with coronary artery disease were included. 201Tl cross-talk into the 123I acquisition window (group 1, n = 30) and 123I cross-talk into the 201Tl window (group 2, n = 41) were studied. In group 1, 123I images were first obtained (single-isotope images), followed by 201Tl injection and SPET acquisition using dual-isotope windows (dual-isotope images). In group 2, the order was reversed. The dual-isotope SPET images with and without TEW were compared with the single-isotope images. Qualitative evaluation was performed by scoring the segmental defect pattern. Detectability of the mismatched fatty acid metabolism on dual-isotope SPET was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Segmental defect pattern agreement between dual and corrected single images was significantly improved by TEW correction (P<0.01). The agreement was particularly improved in segments with absence of uptake. There was no significant difference between TEW-corrected dual-isotope SPET and corresponding single-isotope SPET with regard to either % defect count or background activity. Mismatched fatty acid metabolism depicted by dual-isotope SPET predicted abnormal wall motion more accurately with TEW than without TEW. With TEW, a practical method for scatter and cross-talk correction in clinical settings, simultaneous dual 123I-BMIPP/201Tl SPET is feasible for the assessment of myocardial perfusion/metabolism mismatch.
