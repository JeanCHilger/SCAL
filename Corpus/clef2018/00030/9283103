A comparison of 99mTc-MIBI myocardial SPET with electron beam computed tomography in the assessment of coronary artery disease. We compared technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) myocardial perfusion single-photon emission tomography (SPET) (MPS) and electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) in order to assess their respective value in the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD). 99mTc-MIBI SPET (stress-resting) and EBCT studies were performed in 51 patients with suspected CAD who underwent coronary angiography (CAG). CAG showed that of the 51 patients, 36 had coronary stenosis >/=50% while 15 had normal results. A moderate positive rank correlation was found between coronary calcification detected by EBCT and MPS score (rs=0.5283, P<0.01). The concordance between EBCT and MPS for the evaluation of CAD was 72.5% (37/51). The sensitivity of EBCT in detecting CAD in 51 patients was comparable to that of MPS (81% vs 94%, NS). However, the accuracy of EBCT was lower than that of MPS (78% vs 94%, P<0.025). As regards the detection of individual coronary artery disease, there was no significant difference in sensitivity between EBCT and MPS (65% vs 75%, NS) however, the specificity and accuracy of EBCT were lower than those of MPS (specificity: 77% vs 95%, P<0.00599mTc-MIBI myocardial perfusion SPET and EBCT provide different information in the assessment of CAD. The sensitivity of EBCT for the detection of CAD is comparable with that of MPS however, the specificity and accuracy of EBCT are lower than those of MPS. More reliable results will be obtained if both myocardial perfusion SPET and EBCT are performed.
