Vocal identification of speaker and emotion activates different brain regions. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured in six healthy volunteers by positron emission tomography during identification of speaker and emotion from spoken words. The speaker identification task activated several audio-visual multimodal areas, particularly the temporal poles in both hemispheres, which may be involved in connecting vocal attributes with the visual representations of speakers. The emotion identification task activated regions in the cerebellum and the frontal lobe, suggesting a functional relationship between those regions involved in emotion. The results suggest that different anatomical structures contribute to the vocal identification of speaker and emotion.
