Synthesis and biological evaluation of [11C]MK-912 as an alpha2-adrenergic receptor radioligand for PET studies. In vitro studies showed that MK-912 ((2S, 12bS)1',3'-dimethylspiro(1,3,4,5',6,6',7,12b-octahydro -2H-benzo[b]furo[2,3-a]quinolizine)-2,4'-pyrimidin-2'-one) is a potent alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonist with high affinity (Ki = 0.42, 0.26 and 0.03 nM to alpha2A, alpha2B and alpha2C, respectively) and high selectivity (alpha2A/alpha1A = 240 alpha2A/D-1 = 3600
