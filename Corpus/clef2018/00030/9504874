Comparison of technetium 99m-tetrofosmin and thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomographic imaging for the assessment of viable myocardium in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Tetrofosmin is a new technetium 99m-labeled myocardial perfusion agent that has demonstrated favorable imaging characteristics in recent clinical trials. However, it is not certain whether 99mTc-tetrofosmin compared with thallium 201 would underestimate myocardial viability in regions with left ventricular dysfunction.To this end 15 patients (mean age 52+/-7 years) with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 35%+/-8%) documented on angiography underwent both quantitative rest-redistribution 201Tl and rest 99mTc-tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography imaging. RESULTS Of 240 total segments on rest-redistribution 201Tl protocol 139 (58%) segments had irreversible 201Tl defects. Of these segments 79 (57%) had only mild to moderate reduction of 201Tl uptake (51% to 85% of normal uptake), whereas the remaining 60 (43%) had severely reduced tracer uptake (< or = 50% of normal uptake). On 99mTc-tetrofosmin protocol 180 (75%) segments had abnormal 99mTc-tetrofosmin uptakeThese data show that when the severity of uptake was considered within abnormal segments, a similar amount of 201Tl viable regions were observed by 99mTc-tetrofosmin. Thus these two agents may provide comparable information about myocardial viability when quantitative analysis of defect severity is performed.
