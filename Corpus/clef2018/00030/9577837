A new framework for investigating antipsychotic action in humans: lessons from PET imaging. With a decade of neuroreceptor imaging of antipsychotics behind us, this article attempts to synthesise what has been learnt about the mechanism of action of antipsychotics using these techniques. The data show that: (i) the 'typical' antipsychotics bind mainly to the dopamine D2 receptor, and that 60-80% D2 occupancy may provide optimal antipsychotic response with little extrapyramidal side effects (ii) all the clinically available 'atypical' antipsychotics show a higher occupancy of the 5-HT2 than D2 receptors
