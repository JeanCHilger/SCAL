Somatostatin receptor subtype specificity and in vivo binding of a novel tumor tracer, 99mTc-P829. Recent data suggest that somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) are expressed on various tumor cells. High-level expression of SSTR on the tumor cell surface provides the basis for the successful clinical use of radiolabeled ligands for the in vivo localization of tumor sites. We have characterized the in vitro binding properties of the novel SSTR ligand 99mTc-P829 using primary human tumors (carcinoids, breast cancers, intestinal adenocarcinomas, pheochromocytomas, small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, and melanomas n = 28), various tumor cell lines, and COS7 cells transfected with the human SSTR (hSSTR) subtypes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 99mTc-P829 bound to primary tumor cells and tumor cell lines with high affinity and high capacity. The dissociation constants (Kd) ranged between 1 and 20 nM. 99mTc-P829 also bound with high affinity to the transfected hSSTR2 (Kd, 2.5 nM), hSSTR5 (Kd, 2 nM), and hSSTR3 (Kd, 1.5 nM). Binding of 99mTc-P829 to hSSTR3 was found to be displaceable by unlabeled P829/([ReO]-P829), SST-14, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP
