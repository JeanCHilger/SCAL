Significance of electrocardiographic projection of ST-segment depression during exercise test in the prediction of the location of regional myocardial ischemia. There is still some controversy whether ST segment depression during exercise testing might predict the location of myocardial ischemia. From a population of 1196 patients who underwent myocardial 99mTc-tetrofosmin exercise SPECT scintigraphy, 22 consecutive patients (20 males and 2 females, mean age 54 +/- 10 years) with no previous myocardial infarction, positive exercise testing (> or = 1 mm ST segment depression) performed in pharmacologic wash-out and angiographically documented isolated single vessel coronary artery disease (> or = 70% diameter stenosis in a main coronary artery) were selected. None of the patients showed > or = 1 mm ST segment depression exclusively in inferior leads (II-III-aVF). Eight patients (36%) showed > or = 1 mm ST segment depression exclusively in precordial leads (Group 1). The remaining 14 patients (64%) showed > or = 1 mm ST segment depression in both inferior and precordial leads (Group 2). No differences between groups were observed regarding peak exercise test parameters such as heart rate (124 +/- 28 vs 135 +/- 21 b/min, NS), rate-pressure product (22592 +/- 5323 vs 23118 +/- 4197 mmHg x b/min, NS) and exercise time (14.5 +/- 3.9 vs 15.1 +/- 2.9 min, NS) and the number of stress-induced reversible and partially reversible defects (3.3 +/- 3.4 vs 4.6 +/- 2.8, NS). All reversible and partially reversible defects were seen in the related coronary artery stenosis region. Among Group 1, 5 patient (62.5%) showed a > or = 70% stenosis of left descending coronary artery, 1 patient (12.5%) of left circumflex and 2 patients (25%) of right coronary artery. Similarly, among Group 2, 9 patients (64.3%) showed a significant stenosis of left descending coronary artery, 1 patient (7.1%) of left circumflex and 4 patients (28.6%) of right coronary artery. Thus, we were not able to show a relation between exercise ST segment depression and the location of myocardial ischemia as assessed by myocardial 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT scintigraphy in a population of patients selected on the basis of single coronary artery disease.
