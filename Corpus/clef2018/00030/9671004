Coronary revascularization in the treatment of moderate and severe postischemic left ventricular dysfunction. Chronic postischemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction can improve following coronary revascularization (hibernating myocardium). However, it is not clear whether the severity of LV dysfunction determines functional outcome after revascularization and the accuracy of tests to predict myocardial viability. We studied 47 patients with coronary artery disease and chronic LV dysfunction. Before coronary bypass, patients underwent (18F)2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp to assess viability. Global and regional LV function were assessed before and 4 to 6 months after surgery. Patients were arbitrarily divided into 2 groups with moderate and severe LV dysfunction. Group 1 (n = 26) had an ejection fraction (EF) of < or = 30% and group 2 (n = 21) > 30%. After bypass, the EF (22+/-6% vs 31+/-10% p <0.0001) and global wall motion score (WMS) (2.05+/-0.39 vs 1.56+/-0.34
