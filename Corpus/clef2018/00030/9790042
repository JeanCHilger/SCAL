Tc-99m tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion imaging before and six months after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The role of Tc-99m tetrofosmin single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) in the evaluation of myocardial perfusion before and 6 months after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was assessed in 41 consecutive patients (32 men and 9 women). Twenty-five patients had one-vessel disease, 14 had two-vessel disease, and 2 had three-vessel disease. Thirty-six patients had dilation of one vessel and five patients dilation of two stenosed vessels, with a total of 46 dilated vessels. All patients underwent coronary angiography both before PTCA and 6 months after revascularization. Restenosis was angiographically demonstrated in 16 (39%) patients and 16 (34.8%) vessels. Tc-99m tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT was 81.3% sensitive and 88% specific for the detection of restenosis in the group of patients with a positive predictive value of 81.3% and a negative predictive value of 88%. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 81.3%, 90%, 76.5%, and 89.7%, respectively, for restenosis detection in specific vessels. It was concluded that most patients who underwent successful PTCA (34 of 41, or 82.9%) had significant (P < 0.001) improvement in their scan image 6 months after the angioplasty, and that Tc-99m tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT is an excellent tool to follow these patients because it can detect restenosis accurately and noninvasively.
