No Recirculation After Open Cancellous Bone Grafting. A Case Examined by Positron Emission Tomography. According to the Papineau technique, open autogenous cancellous bone grafting procedures were performed in tibial bone defects. Repeated positron emission tomography (PET) examinations with 2 tracers, [15O]water to assess blood flow and [18F]fluoride to assess bone metabolism, showed no evidence of recirculation of the bone graft within the first week.
