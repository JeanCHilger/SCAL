18FDG-PET imaging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. FDG-PET imaging non invasively studies the glucose metabolism which is usually increased in malignant lesions. We evaluated the clinical performance of PET for detecting pancreatic cancer and its recurrence. In our series of 24 studies, PET appears to complement other imaging modalities. As compared to CT, in particular, it demonstrated fewer false positive results in the pancreas and it was also more sensitive. Moreover, whole-body FDG-PET allows for the entire staging of the disease.
