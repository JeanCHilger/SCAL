Medical confidentiality and electronic patient files. When considering electronic patient files some conditions have to be respected. They are, in particular, confidentiality and informed consent by the patient. Furthermore, undue access to data can be prevented by PET, access authorization and the like. Patients should be allowed to exert control over their medical data. National and international good privacy practice guidelines should be drawn up in order to avoid privacy-erosion.
