Correlation of intellectual impairment in Parkinson's disease with FDG PET scan. This study investigated the relationship between regional glucose metabolism with intellectual impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease using statistical parametric mapping. Regional cerebral glucose metabolism using [18F]deoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans were performed on 10 patients with Parkinson's disease. We used the intellectual impairment score from the UPDRS. PET scans were analyzed with SPM96. Patients showed significant positive correlations with left limbic structures such as the cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and medial frontal gyrus. Patients showed significant negative correlations with associative neocortical posterior structures such as bilateral parietal and occipital gyrus. There were significant relationships between regional glucose metabolism and intellectual impairment.
