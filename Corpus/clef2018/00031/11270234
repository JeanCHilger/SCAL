Neurofunctional tests in presurgical strategies for partial epilepsies. The presurgical evaluation of drug-resistant partial epilepsies primarily relies on two major investigations, including a long term video-EEG monitoring which aimed at recording the patient's typical seizures, and a specifically designed high quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The latter demonstrates an abnormality within the epileptogenic lobe in the majority of cases, which might not, however, necessarily match the epileptogenic zone. Numerous functional neuro-imaging techniques have been progressively added to the pre-surgical evaluation of refractory partial epilepsies, such as the study of cerebral glucose metabolism, benzodiazepine receptor availability, and methionine incorporation using positron emission tomography (PET), the evaluation of ictal cerebral blood flow changes using single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), the measurement of N-acetyl-aspartate concentration with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and the mapping of eloquent areas using functional MRI. These investigations can help to confirm the origin of seizure onset previously suggested by MRI and electro-clinical data, and provide independent prognostic information regarding the chance of a successful surgical treatment. Moreover, functional neuro-imaging data can have a critical diagnostic value when MRI is strictly normal or shows multifocal abnormalities. However, the variety and rapid evolution of functional neuro-imaging techniques makes it difficult to propose a standard protocol. Finally, it remains mandatory to proceed to an intracranial EEG investigation in a substantial number of patients, including the majority of those suffering from an extra-temporal epilepsy.
