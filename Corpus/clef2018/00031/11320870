New insights into brain function by combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional brain mapping. The present paper aims to summarize potential applications of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with functional brain imaging. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a well-established noninvasive tool for stimulating circumscribed areas of the human cortex. Functional imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and electroencephalographic mapping enable assessment of TMS-related functional brain activation. A combination of TMS and functional imaging can be useful in three principal ways. (1) Brain imaging before TMS is helpful in defining the accurate coil position over a distinct cortical area which is targeted by TMS. Since TMS can be used to interfere with regional cortical function during a given task, the effects of focal TMS on task performance can help to clarify the task-specific functional contribution of a given cortical area which has previously shown task-related activation in a functional imaging study. (2) Imaging the brain during TMS is a promising approach for assessing cortical excitability and intracerebral functional connectivity. (3) By evaluating lasting effects of TMS, brain imaging after TMS can be employed to study the plasticity of the human cortex. Moreover, this approach will help to advance our understanding of therapeutical effects related to TMS.
