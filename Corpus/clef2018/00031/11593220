Electrocardiographic evolution after Q-wave anterior myocardial infarction: correlations between QRS score and changes in left ventricular perfusion and function. In the thrombolytic era, conflicting data have been reported on the usefulness of the QRS score in estimating the amount of left ventricular (LV) damage after acute myocardial infarction (MI).We correlated the QRS score with the extent of LV hypoperfusion and ejection fraction (EF) in 95 consecutive male patients with a first anterior Q-wave MI the 6-month evolution of QRS score and changes in LV perfusion and function were also compared. The Selvester-Wagner QRS score was computed from the digitized 12-lead electrocardiogram, both at predischarge and 6 months laterIn patients with recent anterior Q-wave MI, QRS scoring showed a weak, delayed correlation with the amount of LV damage, as estimated by radionuclide techniques. Spontaneous changes in QRS score from predischarge to 6 months seem to be of limited value in identifying patients with late improvement in LV perfusion and function.
