Clinical assessment of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment and diagnosis of colorectal cancers. The clinically useful monoclonal antibodies(Mabs) for colorectal cancers were reviewed. Since 1980's, immunoscintigraphy has been performed for the detection of occult colorectal cancers. However, it may be substituted with the development of positron emission tomography. As for the treatment, some Mabs have been shown to be effective for the adjuvant therapy of postoperative colorectal cancers. Some Mabs to epidermal growth factor receptors(EGFr) are quite promising since they block the functions necessary for the tumor growth and enhance the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy. Recent advances for the development of humanized Mabs will improve the chance of Mabs to be used as an effective adjuvant.
