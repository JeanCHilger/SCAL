Spatial standardization of [15O]-butanol PET images using T1-weighted MRI data. Population averaged brain activation studies require the spatial standardization of the individual perfusion PET images. This procedure is usually supported by T1-weighted MRI images. The authors developed a segmentation technique to improve the automatized transformation of the individual MRI images into Talairach space. It was for the first time in Hungary that population averages of standardized T1-weighted MRI and [15O]-butanol PET images of the brain were created after validation of the procedure using data from 23 healthy volunteers. The newly developed method offers a solution for the automatized processing of primary data from brain activation experiments prior to statistical analysis.
