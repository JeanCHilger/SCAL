The effects of ventilation pattern on carbon dioxide transfer in three computer models of the airways. We investigate the effects on arterial P(CO(2)) and on arterial-end tidal P(CO(2)) difference of six different ventilation patterns of equal tidal volume, and also of various combinations of tidal volume and respiratory rate that maintain a constant alveolar ventilation. We use predictions from three different mathematical models. Models 1 (distributed) and 2 (compartmental) include combined convection and diffusion effects. Model 3 incorporates a single well-mixed alveolar compartment and an anatomical dead-space in which plug flow occurs. We found that: (i) breathing patterns with longer inspiratory times yield lower arterial P(CO(2)) (ii) varying tidal volume and respiratory rate so that alveolar ventilation is kept constant may change both PA(CO(2)) and the PA(CO(2))-PET(CO(2)) difference
