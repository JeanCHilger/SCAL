The role of cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reserve capacity in the diagnosis of chronic hydrocephalus--a PET-study on 60 patients. To investigate the clinical value of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVR) in the management of chronic hydrocephalus. Global cortical CBF and CVR in 60 patients (66 +/- 12 yrs) with chronic hydrocephalus were investigated before, one week (7 d) and 7 months (7 m) after shunting by 15-O-H2O PET (Siemens ECAT 951/31) at rest and after application of acetazolamide (1 g). After 7 months, clinical outcome was assessed according to Stein and Langfitt and patients were classified into responder (n = 31) and non-responder (n = 29). Before Surgery, responder had lower blood flow values compared to non responder (36 +/- 8 vs. 41 +/- 11 ml/100 ml/min p = 0.04), whereas CVR was not different between outcome groups (33 +/- 10 vs. 41 +/- 8%
