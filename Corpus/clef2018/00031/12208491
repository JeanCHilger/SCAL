Cerebral correlates of selective attention in schizophrenic patients with formal thought disorder: a controlled H2 15O-PET study. There is a widespread belief that formal thought disorders may be associated with disturbed selective attention in schizophrenia. Two hypotheses are derived: (1) patients with slightly pronounced formal thought disorders should differ from those with severely expressed formal thought disorders in terms of selective attention and (2) the cerebral correlates of selective attention should be organised differently in mildly versus severely thought-disordered patients. We compared 20 female schizophrenic patients, one-half with mild, one-half with obvious formal thought disorders, and 10 control subjects on a neuropsychological battery and a cognitive activation task for selective attention (Go/NoGo) for the assessment of rCBF using H2 15O-PET. While the first hypothesis has not been confirmed, we found that the cerebral regions activated by selective attention in the two patient groups showed completely differing organisations. Low degrees of formal thought disorders were associated with significant activations in frontal superior gyrus and ventral anterior thalamic nucleus whereas high degrees of formal thought disorders were accompanied by significant activations in fusiform gyrus and precuneus. We suggest that differing task-solving strategies are applied by both clinical subgroups to achieve comparable results on the selective attention paradigm.
