PET diagnostic accuracy: improvement with in-line PET-CT system: initial results. The authors describe the initial application for tumor staging with an in-line system with a positron emission tomographic (PET) scanner and a multi-detector row helical computed tomographic (CT) scanner combined in one machine. Fifty-three patients underwent imaging with four CT tube currents and PET emission and transmission data acquisition. Stepwise analysis of coregistered images revealed a significant (P <.05, McNemar test) improvement in lesion classification between PET images alone and coregistered images from the PET-CT examination.
