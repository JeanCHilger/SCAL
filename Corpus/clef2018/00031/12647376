Usefulness of PET scan guidance in stereotaxic radioneurosurgery using a gamma knife. Integration of the metabolic data of PET in the dosimetry planning of radiosurgical treatment with the Gamma Knife, can optimize the definition of the target volume for infiltrating or ill-defined brain tumors. Our experience of twenty patients treated with this technique demonstrates the interest of this original approach that should improve the results of radiosurgical treatment of cerebral tumors.
