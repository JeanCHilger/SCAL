Positron emission tomography with 18F-dopa: interpretation and biological correlates in nonhuman primates. Positron emission tomography (PET) was carried out, with 18F-DOPA as a ligand, in normal control monkeys and "parkinsonian" monkeys who had been treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. The following approaches were used in data analysis: ratio of 18F accumulation in specific to nonspecific brain areas and 18F-DOPA influx constant obtained using either the actual plasma 18F-DOPA or the 18F activity in a nonspecific brain area as the input function. The results from these analyses were compared to one another and to biological parameters relevant to dopaminergic function. The striatum/cortex ratio and the rate constant calculated from plasma 18F-DOPA appeared to be the most sensitive analytic techniques.
