Age-related decline of cerebral oxygen metabolism in normal population detected with positron emission tomography. Using positron emission tomography (PET), cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) were measured in 32 healthy volunteers aged from 27 to 67 years. In bilateral putamen, left supratemporal, left infrafrontal and left parietal cortices, CMRO2 showed a significant decline during aging. The age-related decline of CBF was seen only at the left superior temporal cortex. The mean CMRO2 was significantly lower in the elder group (over 51 years old) than in the younger group (under 50 years old), whereas no significant difference in mean CBF between the two groups. The poor correlation of CBF to the age could be explained partly by the fact that CBF is easily influenced by the physiological, psychological and/or environmental factors. The age-related changes of CMRO2 were more marked in the association cortices of the left hemisphere than in that of the right hemisphere.
