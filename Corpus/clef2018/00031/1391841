The regional blood flow in intracranial tumors: a comparison of HMPAO-SPECT with a newer magnetic resonance tomographic procedure. We compared the value of gadolinium-enhanced first-pass MRI perfusion studies and HMPAO-SPECT for the assessment of regional cerebral blood flow in a prospective study of 23 intracranial tumour patients. In five tumours with homogeneous hypoperfusion and eight tumours with homogeneous hyperperfusion, tumour blood flow patterns in MRI and HMPAO-SPECT were similar. By contrast, in ten patients with inhomogeneous tumour blood flow pattern only MRI was able to differentiate between tumour areas with no or low flow, tumour tissue with high flow, and perifocal oedema with reduced flow. In HMPAO-SPECT, these inhomogeneous tumours were represented as areas of homogeneously reduced tracer retention corresponding to different tumour constituents and perifocal oedema. In conclusion, the high spatial resolution of MRI enables a detailed analysis of tumour blood flow.
