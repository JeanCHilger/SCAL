Photosensitivity to piroxicam: absence of cross-reaction with tenoxicam. We studied 2 groups of patients. One group of 10 patients had a photosensitive eruption to piroxicam. Another group of 24 patients had positive patch test reactions to thimerosal and thiosalicylic acid and had never taken piroxicam or tenoxicam. Patients were patch tested with thimerosal 0.1% pet., thiosalicylic acid 0.1% pet., salicylic acid 2.0% pet., piroxicam 1 and 5% pet. and tenoxicam 1 and 5% pet. Photopatch tests were also performed with piroxicam and tenoxicam. All 10 patients with photosensitivity to piroxicam had positive patch tests to thimerosal and thiosalicylic acid and 9 of them had positive photopatch tests to piroxicam. 20 out of 24 patients with positive patch tests to thiosalicylic acid also had positive photopatch tests to piroxicam. All the patients tested with salicyclic acid were negative. Out of the 29 patients with positive photopatch tests to piroxicam, none reacted to tenoxicam. In countries with a high incidence of contact sensitivity to thimerosal/thiosalicylic acid, the use of piroxicam should be avoided and replaced by tenoxicam, a drug without reported photosensitivity.
