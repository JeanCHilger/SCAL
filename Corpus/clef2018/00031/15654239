A study of the personal radiation dose received by nuclear medicine technologists working in a dedicated PET center. The use of dedicated PET scanners is becoming more widespread throughout Australia and the world. PET imaging utilizes short-lived (approximately 108 min), high-energy (511 keV) gamma-ray emitters that could result in a high radiation dose being received by staff. As part of a larger staff and area monitoring project, this paper discusses the personal dose equivalent, H(p)(10), received by PET staff working in a dedicated PET center. The typical H(p)(10) received by staff was approximately 1 microSv per minute of close contact with patients, which resulted in an average daily dose for nuclear medicine technologists of approximately 31 microSv. The average daily administered activity to patients at Austin Health was 1,280 MBq.
