Staging in childhood lymphoma: differences between FDG-PET and CT. The clinical value of positron emission tomography using fluorine-18 fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG-PET) in the staging of adult lymphoma has been shown in many studies. However, there are only few data regarding childhood lymphoma. The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare the staging of childhood lymphoma using FDG-PET and the established computed tomography (CT).Whole-body FDG-PET was performed in 25 children with histologically proven Hodgkin's disease (n = 18) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 7) using a dedicated PET. The findings were compared with the CT results. Both examinations, FDG-PET and CT, were assessed by two experienced physicians. In each patient, 30 regions were analysed (22 nodal, 8 extranodal). Each region was assessed using a five value scale (definitely/probably positive, equivocal, probably/definitely negative).662 regions (470 nodal, 192 extranodal) were compared. 91 regions (81 nodal, 10 extranodal 14%) were concordant positive and 517 regions (347 nodal, 170 extranodalStaging of childhood lymphoma using FDGPET shows differences compared with CT resulting in a different staging in 6 of 25 patients. Prospective studies are required to evaluate the impact of these discrepancies on the clinical management of pediatric patients.
