Intensity of 18fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in positron emission tomography distinguishes between indolent and aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. (18)Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) is widely used for the staging of lymphoma. We investigated whether the intensity of tumor FDG uptake could differentiate between indolent and aggressive disease.PET studies of 97 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who were untreated or had relapsed and/or persistent disease and had not received treatment within the last 6 months were analyzed, and the highest standardized uptake value (SUV) per study was recorded. Correlations were made with histopathology.FDG uptake was lower in indolent than in aggressive lymphoma for patients with new (SUV, 7.0 +/- 3.1 v 19.6 +/- 9.3 P < .01) and relapsed (SUV, 6.3 +/- 2.7 v 18.1 +/- 10.9FDG uptake is lower in indolent than in aggressive lymphoma. Patients with NHL and SUV > 10 have a high likelihood for aggressive disease. This information may be helpful if there is discordance between biopsy and clinical behavior.
