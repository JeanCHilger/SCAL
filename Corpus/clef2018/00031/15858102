Fluorocholine PET/CT in patients with prostate cancer: initial experience. Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. Patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer and patients suspected of having recurrent prostate cancer were prospectively evaluated with fluorine 18 fluorocholine (FCH) combined in-line positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT). In 19 patients (mean age, 67 years +/- 8 range, 57-85 years), standardized uptake values of FCH in 17 different tissues were determined by using volumes of interest. In nine patients evaluated at initial staging, histologic findings of the resected prostate were compared to FCH uptake. Only small variations of physiologic tracer accumulation were measured in all organs but the kidneys. Differentiation of benign hyperplasia from cancerous prostate lesions was not possible with FCH PET/CT. However, in patients with recurrent prostate cancer, FCH PET/CT is a promising imaging modality for detecting local recurrence and lymph node metastases.
