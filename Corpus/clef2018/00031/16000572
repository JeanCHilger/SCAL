2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography for the detection of disease in patients with prostate-specific antigen relapse after radical prostatectomy. Retrospective cohort study in 91 patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse following prostatectomy, imaged with 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in a tertiary care cancer center between February 1997 and March 2003. Comparison was made with magnetic resonance imaging (n = 64), bone scan (n = 56), and computed tomography (n = 37). The standard of reference included biopsy or clinical and imaging follow-up. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of PET and correlated PET findings with PSA values, other clinical parameters, and conventional imaging, when available.PET was true positive in 28 of 91 (31%) patients, showing isolated disease in the prostate bed (n = 3) or metastatic disease with (n = 2) or without (n = 23) simultaneous disease in the prostate bed. In detail, PET identified lesions in the prostate bed (n = 5, all true positives), bones (n = 22 20 true positives, 2 false positives), lymph nodes (n = 7FDG-PET detected local or systemic disease in 31% of patients with PSA relapse referred for this test. There is a link to tumor burden and tumor biology in that the probability for disease detection increased with PSA levels.
