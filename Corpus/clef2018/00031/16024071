Proliferative and re-defferentiative effects of photo-immobilized micro-patterned hyaluronan surfaces on chondrocyte cells. A photo-immobilisation procedure was utilised to create two different micro-patterned surfaces (tracks 25 and 5 microm wide) of hyaluronan (Hyal) on polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) previously plasma activated. Aim of the study was to investigate the proliferation and re-differentiation capacity of articular chondrocytes cultured on micro-patterned Hyal, compared to homogeneous Hyal and plain plasma-treated (pt-)PET substrates. Cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, activation and differentiation of articular knee cartilage chondrocytes (Mongrel sheep) were evaluated after 14 days of culture. It was found that micro-patterned Hyal surfaces induced the adhesion, migration and alignment of chondrocytes, as shown by light and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, the same surfaces induced chondrocyte differentiation, with a significant increase of aggrecan and collagen type II production, while homogeneous Hyal and pt-PET surfaces did not.
