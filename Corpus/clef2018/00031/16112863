Facile synthesis and PET imaging of a novel potential heart acetylcholinesterase tracer N-[11C]methyl-3-[[(dimethylamino)carbonyl]oxy]-2-(2',2'-diphenylpropionoxymethyl)pyridinium. A new AChE tracer N-[(11)C]methyl-3-[[(dimethylamino)carbonyl]oxy]-2-(2',2'-diphenylpropionoxymethyl)pyridinium ([(11)C]MDDP, [(11)C]1) has been synthesized in 40-65% radiochemical yield. Initial PET dynamic studies of [(11)C]MDDP in rat heart showed rapid heart uptake and blood pool clearance to give high-quality heart images. Blocking studies of [(11)C]MDDP with pretreatment drug neostigmine in rats found only minor reductions in rat heart [(11)C]MDDP retention. The results suggest that [(11)C]MDDP delineates the heart very clearly, and the uptakes of [(11)C]MDDP in rat heart might be related to non-specific binding.
