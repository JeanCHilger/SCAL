Differentiation of pituitary adenoma and meningioma: visualization with positron emission tomography and [11C]-L-deprenyl. Seven patients with clinically nonsecreting pituitary adenoma and 5 patients with meningioma were examined with positron emission tomography using [11C]-LL-deprenyl and [11C]-LL-methionine. The dynamics of the uptake of [11C]-L-deprenyl in the pituitary adenomas demonstrated a rapid and high uptake immediately after the injection, and, later, an almost constant level was observed that was equal to or higher than that observed in normal brain tissue. In the meningiomas, however, the initially high uptake was followed by a marked decrease with time, reaching a level that was approximately half that observed in brain tissue. The study demonstrated high binding of [11C]-L-deprenyl to monoamine oxidase B in pituitary adenomas, whereas the binding in meningiomas was very low. This fact can be used in the differential diagnosis of pituitary adenoma and parasellar meningioma. Operative samples from 10 patients with meningioma and from 5 patients with pituitary adenoma were analyzed biochemically for activity of monoamine oxidase B, using [14C]-phenyl-ethylamine as substrate. The nonsecreting pituitary adenomas demonstrated high enzyme activity, the secreting adenomas about one-tenth of that of the nonsecreting, and the meningiomas one-thirtieth of that of nonsecreting adenomas.
