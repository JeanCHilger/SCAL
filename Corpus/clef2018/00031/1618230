Lymphoma imaging with a new technetium-99m labelled antibody, LL2. The lesion detection capability of a new technetium-99m labelled B-cell lymphoma monoclonal antibody (MoAb) imaging agent, LL2, was evaluated in 8 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 1 patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The MoAb kit consists of a 1-vial, 1-mg Fab' form of LL2 ready for instant labelling with technetium. The patients were injected with approximately 925 MBq (25 mCi) of 99mTc-LL2 Fab' (1 mg), and planar and single photon emission tomography (SPET) studies were performed at 3-4 h post injection and at 24 h. There was no evidence of thyroid or stomach activity up to 24 h. Uniform splenic uptake was seen in all patients. Two non-lymphoma patients were also administered with the same agent and demonstrated a similar splenic distribution therefore, splenic targeting was not scored as tumour-specific. A total of 29 from 48 tumour sites were detected by scintigraphy, including tumours of various grades and histological types. Excluding 1 patient who had a large tumour burden of over 500 g, 29 of 33 lesions were detected. One patient was free of disease at the time of the study and had a negative scan. Another patient showed excellent targeting of gallium-negative sites in the liver and bone. The bone involvement was not known prior to the antibody study and was subsequently confirmed by a bone scan. Additional sites of MoAb localization could not be followed in this group, since most patients went on to radioimmunotherapy immediately following the 99mTc-LL2 study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
