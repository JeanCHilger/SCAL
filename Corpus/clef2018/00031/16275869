Preservation from left ventricular remodeling by front-integrated revascularization and stem cell liberation in evolving acute myocardial infarction by use of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (FIRSTLINE-AMI). Considering experimental evidence that stem cells enhance myocardial regeneration and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mediates mobilization of CD34+ mononuclear blood stem cells (MNCCD34+), we tested the impact of G-CSF integrated into primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) management of acute myocardial infarction in man.Fifty consecutive patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were subjected to primary PCI stenting with abciximab and followed up for 6 months 89+/-35 minutes after successful PCI, 25 patients were randomly assigned in this pilot study (PROBE design) to receive subcutaneous G-CSF at 10 microg/kg body weight for 6 days in addition to standard care, including aspirin, clopidogrel, an ACE inhibitor, beta-blocking agents, and statins. By use of CellQuest software on peripheral blood samples incubated with CD45 and CD34, mobilized MNCCD34+ were quantified on a daily basis. With homogeneous demographics and clinical and infarct-related characteristics, G-CSF stimulation led to mobilization of MNCCD34+ to between 3.17+/-2.93 MNCCD34+/microL at baseline and 64.55+/-37.11 MNCCD34+/microL on day 6 (P<0.001 versus control)G-CSF and mobilization of MNC(CD34+) after reperfusion of infarcted myocardium may offer a pragmatic strategy for preservation of myocardium and prevention of remodeling without evidence of aggravated restenosis.
