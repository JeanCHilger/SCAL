FDG PET for the assessment of myometrial infiltration in clinical stage I uterine corpus cancer. For surgical planning of uterine corpus cancer, prior knowledge of the depth of myometrial invasion is important. Curative tumour resection is possible in superficial invasion (stages IA and IB), while post-surgical chemotherapy or radiation therapy is required in deep invasion (stage IC). We evaluated the value of positron emission tomography with 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG PET) for estimating the myometrial invasion in uterine corpus cancer.We studied 22 patients with clinical stage I uterine corpus cancer, who underwent FDG PET prior to surgery. Standardized uptake value (SUV tracer activity per injected dose normalized to body weight) was calculated on the PET image. PET findings were compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the surgical staging.The surgical stage was IA in five, IB in 11 and IC in six patients. SUVs in deep invasion (15.69+/-4.73, 8.83-21.84) were significantly higher than those in superficial invasion (9.09+/-3.29, 2.68-15.41) (P<0.005). Using 12.0 as a cut-off value of SUV for the differentiation of these two groups, PET results were correct in 19 patients but were incorrect in three patients. Although both PET and MRI provided correct staging in 14 patients, only MRI overestimated the myometrial invasion in four patients with stage IB and showed inconclusive findings in one patient with stage IC. Four of these five patients were post-menopausal.The cut-off value of SUV (=12.0) may be a useful index for the differentiation of superficial invasion and deep invasion. FDG PET may be feasible for predicting the myometrial infiltration of uterine corpus cancer, especially when uterine atrophy makes it difficult at MRI in post-menopausal patients.
