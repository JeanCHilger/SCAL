Measurement of serotonin transporter binding with PET and [11C]MADAM: a test-retest reproducibility study. [(11)C]MADAM, or [(11)C]N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-methylphenyl thio)benzylamine, is a radioligand suitable for positron emission tomography (PET) studies of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) in man. The purpose of this study was to examine the test-retest reproducibility using a design tailored for future applied studies. Nine healthy male subjects were examined with PET and [(11)C]MADAM under baseline conditions at two occasions 4-8 weeks apart. The subjects participated in a Phase 1 trial to which the present study was an addendum. Eight regions of interest were studied, including frontal cortex, hippocampal complex, and the raphe nuclei. All regions, but the raphe nuclei, were defined on MR-images to which the PET-images were coregistered using SPM2. Binding potentials were calculated using the simplified reference tissue model, with cerebellum as reference region. Test-retest data were calculated from the binding potentials, and included binding potential (BP) quotient, BP difference, and the intraclass correlation coefficient. The quotient was about one in all regions, and the mean difference varied between 0 and 11%. The intraclass correlation coefficient varied between 0.96 and 0.51 in the raphe nuclei and averaged bilateral regions. [(11)C]MADAM was shown to have good to excellent reliability in measurements of 5-HTT binding in brain regions of interest in research on psychiatric disorders.
