Training of staff for the delivery of PET/CT services in the UK. Evidence for the cost effectiveness of PET/CT imaging is now driving the widespread introduction of PET/CT services throughout the UK. The provision of PET/CT facilities will require a workforce of medical, scientific, technical and engineering staff who are adequately trained and fit for purpose. Suitably trained staff in this speciality are scarce. The development and accreditation of training courses and other educational resources for training programmes in all disciplines will therefore be required at a national and regional level. The implementation of PET/CT training can be achieved more cost-effectively by developing multi-professional learning resources whenever possible. It is intended that the recommendations would be implemented by close co-operation of both public and private healthcare providers together with educational establishments.
