Malignant pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas: a phase II study of therapy with high-dose 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG). Thirty patients with malignant pheochromocytoma (PHEO) or paraganglioma (PGL) were treated with high-dose 131I-MIBG. Patients were 11-62 (mean 39) years old: 19 patients males and 11 females. Nineteen patients had PGL, three of which were multifocal. Six PGLs were nonsecretory. Eleven patients had PHEO. All 30 patients had prior surgery. Fourteen patients were refractory to prior radiation or chemotherapy before 131I-MIBG. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) were collected and cryopreserved. 131I-MIBG was synthesized on-site, by exchange-labeling 131I with 127I-MIBG in a solid-phase Cu2+-catalyzed exchange reaction. 131I-MIBG was infused over 2 h via a peripheral IV. Doses ranged from 557 mCi to 1185 mCi (7.4 mCi/kg to 18.75 mCi/kg). Median dose was 833 mCi (12.55 mCi/kg). Marrow hypoplasia commenced 3 weeks after 131I-MIBG therapy. After the first 131I-MIBG therapy, 19 patients required platelet transfusions 19 received GCSF
