A 18F-radiolabeled analogue of CGS 27023A as a potential agent for assessment of matrix-metalloproteinase activity in vivo. The non-invasive measurement of activated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in vivo, which are involved in many pathophysiological and pathological processes occurring in inflammation, cancer and atherosclerosis, is a clinical challenge. A diagnostic tool for the non-invasive detection of MMP activity in vivo is based on MMP inhibitor (MMPI) radiotracers.We chose non-peptidyl broad-spectrum MMPI CGS 27023A 1 as a hydroxamic acid-based lead structure to design such a tracer.The radioligand HO-[(123)I]I-CGS 27023A was able to specifically visualize activated MMPs in vascular lesions of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice in vivo. Based upon this work the radiosynthesis of a fluorinated analogue of the MMP inhibitor CGS 27023A was developed. Its unlabeled counterpart was found to be a potent MMP inhibitor in vitro.Application of this class of MMP-targeting agents in combination with molecular imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography, may emerge as a novel clinical diagnostic tool in the management of human diseases with MMP misexpression and/or dysregulation.
