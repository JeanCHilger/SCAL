Neurovascular coupling and epilepsy: hemodynamic markers for localizing and predicting seizure onset. Hemodynamic surrogates of epileptic activity are being used to map epileptic foci with PET, SPECT, and fMRI. However, there are few studies of neurovascular coupling in epilepsy. Recent data indicate that cerebral blood flow, although focally increased at the onset of a seizure, may be temporarily inadequate to meet the metabolic demands of both interictal and ictal epileptic events. Transient focal tissue hypoxia and hyperperfusion may be excellent markers for the epileptic focus and may even precede the onset of the ictal event.
