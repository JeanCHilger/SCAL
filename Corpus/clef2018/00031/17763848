FET PET for the evaluation of untreated gliomas: correlation of FET uptake and uptake kinetics with tumour grading. Treatment and prognosis of gliomas depend on their histological tumour grade. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential of [(18)F]fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) PET for non-invasive tumour grading in untreated patients.Dynamic FET PET studies were performed in 54 patients who, based on MRI, were estimated to have low grade (LG n = 20), intermediate (WHO II-IIIHistology revealed gliomas in all patients. Using the standard method a statistically significant difference (p = 0.001) was found between LG (n = 20 SUV(max)/BG: 2.16 +/- 0.98) and HG (n = 34Based on the ratio-based method, a statistically significant difference was found between LG and HG gliomas. Due to the interindividual variability, however, no reliable individual grading was possible. In contrast, dynamic evaluation allowed LG and HG gliomas to be differentiated with high diagnostic power and, thus, should supplement the conventional method.
