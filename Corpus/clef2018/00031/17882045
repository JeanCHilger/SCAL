F-18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the follow-up of breast cancer with elevated levels of tumor markers. The value of combined positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in the follow-up of patients with breast cancer with elevated tumor markers but without proven metastases or local recurrence was assessed.Thirty-four women underwent PET/CT. The PET and CT images were first analyzed separately fused findings were then interpreted, blinded to the results of the other modalities. The results of CT, PET, and PET/CT were compared with each other and correlated to the final diagnosis.The PET/CT identified 149 malignant foci in 24 patients (71%). The CT detected 96 of these foci in 18 patients, whereas PET identified 124 foci in 17 patients. Differences between CT and PET were not significant. Differences between PET/CT and CT (P < 0.01) and PET/CT and PET (P < 0.01) were significant. The person-based sensitivity of PET/CT, PET, and CT was 96%, 88% and 96%, respectively. Specificity of PET/CT, PET, and CT was 89%, 78%, and 78%, respectively.The PET/CT is a valuable modality for the follow-up of patients with breast cancer and elevated levels of tumor markers.
