Value of diagnostic procedures in heart failure. Strategy for the diagnosis of heart insufficiency is directed to the accomplishment of distinct therapeutic aims. Main factors for diagnostic approaches are pathophysiology and progression of qualitatively and quantitatively different disturbances in cardiac performance. Anamnesis and clinical investigations are irremissible for the evaluation of congestive heart failure. For the detection of noncongestive cardiac insufficiency investigations during exercise are often necessary. Ventriculography ist the standard reference technique for measurement of the systolic and diastolic ventricular functions. For exercise and follow-up investigations non-invasive methods are widely used. Accepted methods are two dimensional and Doppler-echocardiography, quantitative radiocardiography with single-pass bolus technique, and radionuclid-ventriculography. We found a good correlation for the measurement of stroke volume when comparing impedance cardiography with uniplane ventriculography at rest. M-mode echocardiography did not yield sufficiently reliable volumetric data. The new imaging methods, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance technique, and cine computed tomography are future tools for cardiac output measurements.
