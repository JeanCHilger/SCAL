Stress myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography imaging in the detection of coronary artery disease in woman. To assess the diagnostic efficacy of stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in female coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.Two hundred and fifty-nine consecutive female patients, aged 60 +/- 8, underwent stress myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and coronary angiography with an interval of < 60 days. Among them, 227 patients underwent exercise MPI, injected intravenously with (99m)Tc-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) 740 - 925 MBq when the exercise end point was reached, and 32 patients underwent pharmacologic stress MPI, injected intravenously with persantine or adenosine and then (99m)Tc-MIBI.Among the 227 patients undergoing exercise MPI 79 had significant coronary artery stenosis with the overall sensitivity and specificity for detecting coronary artery disease of 63% and 97% respectively. According to the exercise heart rate, the 227 patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 137) the patients of which achieved adequate exercise end points, and group 2 (n = 90) the patients of which only reached submaximal exercise. The sensitivity of exercise MPI for detecting CAD was 86% in the group 1 and 38% in the group 2. Among the 32 patients who underwent pharmacologic stress MPI 13 had significant CAD with the sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 84% respectively.Stress MPI is an efficient protocol for the detection of CAD in women, and pharmacologic stress MPI is more suitable for the women with decreased exercise capacity and advanced age.
