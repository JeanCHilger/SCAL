Assessment of diastolic function using 16-frame 201Tl gated myocardial perfusion SPECT: a comparative study of QGS2 and pFAST2. The objective of the present study is to investigate the correlations across various types of interface software for (201)Tl gated myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) in calculating two common diastolic function parameters (DFx), peak-filling rates (PFR), and time-to-peak filling (TTPF).A total of 109 patients (66 men and 43 women age 35-78 years) were studied. All patients were classified into three groups (i.e., ND, no-defect groupThe values of LVEF, PFR, and TTPF were assessed in all patients. In both the ND (correlation coefficients were 0.92, 0.79, and 0.99, respectively) and SD groups (correlation coefficients were 0.74, 0.88, and 0.98, respectively), a strong correlation was observed. In contrast, PFR did not show a significant correlation in the LD group.With the two different kinds of software, QGS2 and pFAST2, the calculated PFR was almost equal and showed good correlations in both ND and SD groups. In contrast, the numerical value varied between the two methods, and its correlation was poor in the LD group. However, TTPF showed a good correlation regardless of the presence of perfusion defects, and the values were equal. TTPF was confirmed to be a stable diastolic index across the two kinds of software, QGS2 and pFAST2, in (201)Tl gated MPS.
