Properties of two nuclear pet mutants affecting expression of the mitochondrial oli1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This study details the characteristics of two temperature-conditional pet mutants of yeast, strains ts1860 and ts379, which at the non-permissive temperature show deficiencies in the formation of three mitochondrially encoded subunits of the ATP synthase complex. By analysis of mitochondrial translation products, and of mitochondrial transcription in temperature shift experiments from the permissive (22 degrees C) to the non-permissive (36 degrees C) temperature, it was concluded that the nuclear mutations in both mutants primarily inhibit synthesis of ATP synthase subunit 9, and that reductions in subunit 8 and 6 synthesis are secondary pleiotropic effects. Following transfer to 36 degrees C, cells of mutant ts379 display a near complete inhibition of subunit 9 synthesis within 1 h, coincident with a marked reduction in the level of the cognate oli1 mRNA. On the other hand, near complete inhibition of subunit 9 synthesis in strain ts1860 occurs after 3 h at 36 degrees C, at which time there is little change in the level of subunit 9 mRNA. In both mutants the mRNA levels for subunits 6 and 8 are not significantly affected at the time of inhibition of subunit 9 synthesis. Provision of an alternative source of subunit 8, translated extra-mitochondrially for import into the organelle, does not overcome the mutant phenotype of either mutant at 36 degrees C, confirming that subunit 8 is not the sole or primary deficiency in each mutant. The mutants indicate that the products of a least two nuclear genes (designated AEP1 and AEP2) are required for the expression of the mitochondrial oli1 gene and the synthesis of subunit 9.
