Three-dimensional motion and perfusion quantification in gated single-photon emission computed tomograms. Methods for quantification and display of left ventricular (LV) functional parameters from gated single-photon emission computed tomographs are described. Using previously documented surface detection methods, we developed techniques for calculating global variables, such as volumes and areas, as well as local variables such as segmental motion and local perfusion from gated tomographic radionuclide ventriculograms (TRVG) and gated perfusion tomograms (sestamibi). We have developed three-dimensional displays to allow realistic visualizations of the results. The motion results have been validated using correlative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies motion calculated from user-traced MR images of the heart was compared to motion calculated from automatically detected surfaces in TRVG and sestamibi. The average motion error was calculated to be 0.67 mm in TRVG and -0.21 mm in sestamibi. Errors were largest in basal LV regions
