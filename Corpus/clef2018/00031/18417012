Molecular imaging of atherosclerosis. Techniques are being developed for clinical molecular imaging of atherosclerosis to identify and characterize vulnerable plaques in each vascular territory. Molecular imaging encompasses multiple imaging modalities that depict cellular and subcellular processes. Molecular imaging can provide a "virtual histology" noninvasively about atherosclerotic disease, characterizing vascular lesions with markers of inflammation, angiogenesis, lipid metabolism, and more.
