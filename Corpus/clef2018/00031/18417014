Advances in rubidium PET and integrated imaging with CT angiography. The role of rubidium-82 (Rb-82) positron emission tomography (PET) in the evaluation and care of patients with suspected coronary artery disease is evolving in conjunction with advances in PET instrumentation, data analysis, and clinical research. Instrumentation developments such as three-dimensional acquisition, new scintillator materials, and x-ray CT help to improve the quality of Rb-82 images. New approaches to kinetic modeling and software tools for analysis of clinical Rb-82 studies are being developed and evaluated, enabling quantification of absolute myocardial blood flow and flow reserve. Recent clinical research studies are providing new insights into the value of Rb-82 cardiac imaging compared with single photon emission CT myocardial perfusion imaging. Integrated x-ray CT angiography and Rb-82 PET perfusion imaging on hybrid PET/CT systems is an exciting new prospect. Complementary anatomical and functional information on atherosclerosis and ischemia can be provided in a single imaging session for better diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with coronary artery disease.
