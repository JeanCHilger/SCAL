Diagnostic imaging before liver surgery. In this article the radiological work-up before liver surgery is reviewed. Based upon the latest literature the following is recommended: In patients with liver metastases (LM) or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), dedicated magnetic resonance imaging with liver-specific contrast or modern multislice computed tomography (MSCT) of the liver should be performed before liver surgery. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is the most accurate modality for detection of extra-hepatic tumours in patients with LM from colorectal cancer. When percutaneous radiofrequency ablation is planned, the patient should be evaluated with contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Biopsy should not be performed before liver surgery when typical imaging findings consistent with LM or HCC are present in patients with colorectal cancer or chronic liver disease. Preoperative assessment of resectability of perihilary cholangiocarcinomas is most precisely done with modern MSCT and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography.
