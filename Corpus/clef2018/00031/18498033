Differential effects comparing exercise and pharmacologic stress on left ventricular function using gated Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT. Although post-ischemic stunning has emerged as an important marker for severe coronary artery disease (CAD), differences in stress methods may have different effects on left ventricular (LV) volumes and function.To assess differential effects comparing exercise and pharmacologic stress on the LV measurements, (99m)Tc-sestamibi gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) acquired more than 30 min after stress and at rest was evaluated in 38 patients undergoing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) stress (ATP group) and 38 age-and sex-matched patients subjected to exercise stress (Ex group) among 268 patients with normal SPECT findings.Coronary risk factors and LV volumetric measurements at baseline were similar in the two groups. Compared with volumetric measurements at rest, end-diastolic volume (EDV) increased (72 +/- 21 ml to 74 +/- 21 ml P = 0.01), end-systolic volume increased (25 +/- 12 ml to 28 +/- 13 mlDifferential effects of stress methods on LV volumes persist more than 30 min after the stress. These findings should be kept in mind when interpreting post-ischemic stunning.
