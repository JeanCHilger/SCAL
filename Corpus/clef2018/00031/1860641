Noninvasive measurement of liver regeneration with positron emission tomography and [2-11C]thymidine. The feasibility of liver regeneration determination with [2-11C]thymidine and positron emission tomography was investigated in partially hepatectomized rats. Serial tomographic scans were performed over a 120-minute period after injection of [2-11C]thymidine together with tritium-labeled thymidine. Within 10 minutes after injection, positron emission tomography scans showed a twofold higher hepatic uptake in regenerating than in nonregenerating livers. Time-activity curves over the liver area indicated that the maximal uptake was followed by a faster decrease of 11C radioactivity in controls than in regenerating animals, so that total 11C activity remaining in the liver at 120 minutes accounted for 68% of maximum in regenerating and only 38% in controls. Tissue distribution studies performed at 120 minutes showed that total 11C radioactivity, expressed in percent injected dose per gram, was six times higher in regenerating livers than in controls (0.62% +/- 0.07% in regenerating livers and 0.10% +/- 0.03% in nonregenerating livers P less than 0.001) and correlated with 3H radioactivity measured in the nuclear fraction (r = 0.92
