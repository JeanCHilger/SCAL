Coronary and peripheral endothelial function in HIV patients studied with positron emission tomography and flow-mediated dilation: relation to hypercholesterolemia. The mechanisms underlying increased cardiovascular risk in HIV patients in antiretroviral therapy (ART) are not known. Our aim was to study the endothelial function of the coronary arteries by cardiac perfusion positron emission tomography (PET), in HIV patients with normal or high cholesterol levels. Flow mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery and circulating endothelial markers were also assessed.HIV patients in ART with total cholesterol <or= 5.5 mmol/L (215 mg/dL n = 13) or total cholesterol >or= 6.5 mmol/L (254 mg/dLIn ART-treated HIV patients with a low overall cardiovascular risk, no sign of endothelial dysfunction was found not even in hypercholesterolemic patients. Also, the increased level of plasma endothelial markers found in HIV patients was not related to hypercholesterolemia.
