The MAO-A genotype does not modulate resting brain metabolism in adults. Variation in the monoamine-oxidase-A (MAO-A) gene has been associated with volumetric changes in corticolimbic regions with differences in their response to relevant emotional tasks. Here we show no changes in baseline regional brain metabolism as a function of genotype indicating that, unchallenged, corticolimbic activity is not modulated by the MAO-A genotype.
