Molecular imaging of matrix metalloproteinase in atherosclerotic lesions: resolution with dietary modification and statin therapy. This study sought to evaluate the feasibility of noninvasive detection of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in experimental atherosclerosis using technetium-99m-labeled broad matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (MPI) and to determine the effect of dietary modification and statin treatment on MMP activity.The MMP activity in atherosclerotic lesions contributes to the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques to rupture.Atherosclerosis was produced in 34 New Zealand White rabbits by balloon de-endotheliazation of the abdominal aorta and a high-cholesterol diet. In addition, 12 unmanipulated rabbits were used as controls and 3 for blood clearance characteristics. In vivo micro-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging was performed after radiolabeled MPI administration. Subsequently, aortas were explanted to quantitatively measure percent injected dose per gram (%ID/g) MPI uptake. Histological and immunohistochemical characterization was performed and the extent of MMP activity was determined by gel zymography or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.The MPI uptake in atherosclerotic lesions (n = 18) was clearly visualized by micro-SPECT imaging MPI uptake was markedly reduced by administration of unlabeled MPI before the radiotracer (n = 4). The MPI uptake was also significantly reduced after diet withdrawal (n = 6) and fluvastatin treatment (n = 6)The present data show the feasibility of noninvasive detection of MMP activity in atherosclerotic plaques, and confirm that dietary modification and statin therapy reduce MMP activity.
