Association between anxiety disorder and the extent of ischemia observed in cardiac syndrome X. A possible link between the heart and brain has been reported for cardiac syndrome X. Anxiety disorder could be a pathophysiological mechanism for this cardiac chest pain. To the authors' knowledge, a quantitative analysis correlating anxiety with the extent of ischemia has not been done.In this pilot study, we evaluated 20 patients with typical chest pain and completely normal coronary angiograms. These patients were screened with the State Scale and Trait Scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). All patients underwent myocardial perfusion scintigraphic imaging. The scintigrams were scored by three experienced readers having no knowledge of the STAI screening results. Patients with a low trait anxiety had significantly less ischemic segments on the myocardial perfusion imaging than patients with a high trait anxiety (1.8 +/- 1.9 vs 3.5 +/- 0.6, P < .05). For state anxiety, no significant differences could be found.Cardiac syndrome X patients with high trait anxiety are at risk of having more ischemia.
