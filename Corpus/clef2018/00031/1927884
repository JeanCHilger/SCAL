Comparison of thallium-201 SPECT and planar imaging methods for quantification of experimental myocardial infarct size. To compare single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and planar thallium-201 (TI-201) myocardial perfusion imaging methods for quantification of left ventricular infarct size, 12 dogs with 6 to 8 hours of closed-chest coronary occlusion and 5 normal dogs were studied. After intravenous administration of TI-201, SPECT and three-view planar images were obtained. After the animals were put to death, hearts were sliced and stained with triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) for planimetric determination of left ventricular infarct size. Infarct size on each SPECT slice and planar image was defined as the percentage of circumferential count profiles falling below the limits derived from normal dogs. Infarct size as a percentage of left ventricular mass was determined from SPECT and planar images before and after correcting for differences in myocardial slice mass from apex to base. The correlation coefficients, the concordance correlation coefficients (reflecting closeness to the line of identity), and the mean absolute deviations of the four methods versus TTC staining were 0.83, 0.77, and 5.1% (SPECT, no correction) 0.85, 0.84, and 3.7% (SPECT with correction)
