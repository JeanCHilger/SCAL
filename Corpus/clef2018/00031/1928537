Human exposure to rabies from pet wild raccoons in South Carolina and West Virginia, 1987 through 1988. During 1987 and 1988, exposures to eight pet wild raccoons in South Carolina and West Virginia resulted in administration of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis to 19 children and 26 adults. All eight raccoons appeared normal at the time of capture, and three had no signs of illness when sacrificed. The direct medical cost resulting from these exposures was $23,714 ($527 per person). Regulations and public education may help decrease this type of rabies exposure.
