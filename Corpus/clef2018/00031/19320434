SPECT and PET imaging of EGF receptors with site-specifically labeled EGF and dimeric EGF. We describe a new generation of tracers for molecular imaging of the cell surface receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF). These receptors play a key role in the progression of many tumors and are major drug development targets. Our tracers are based on a recombinant human EGF expressed with a cysteine-containing tag that enables facile site-specific radiolabeling with (99m)Tc for single photon emission computed tomography or site-specific conjugation of (64)Cu PEGylated chelators for positron emission tomography. These tracers retain EGF activities in vitro and display selective and highly specific focal uptake in tumors in vivo. We expect that nuclear imaging of EGF receptors with these tracers will be useful for clinical diagnosis, therapeutic monitoring, and development of new drugs and treatment regimens.
