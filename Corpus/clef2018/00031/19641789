Synthesis of polyfunctional quinolizidine alkaloids: development towards selective glycosidase inhibitors. A highly divergent route to a variety of quinolizidine alkaloids is described. The enantiomeric precursors and utilized for the synthesis of these alkaloids were constructed stereospecifically from the PET cyclization of the corresponding acetylene tethered alpha-trimethylsilyl amine moieties and , respectively, both of which were synthesised from D-ribose. The polyhydroxy quinolizidine alkaloid was found to be a selective inhibitor of alpha-galactosidase with Ki 83.9 microM. The amine analogs , and are found to be selective and potent inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase with Ki 28, 120 and 140 microM, respectively.
