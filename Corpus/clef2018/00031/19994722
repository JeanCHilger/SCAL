Advanced new neurosurgical procedure using integrated system of intraoperative MRI and neuronavigation with multimodal neuroradiological images. The purpose of this paper is to describe the newly-established technique in the field of neurological surgery for fusion imaging of three-dimensional magnetic resonance image (3D-MRI) and/or three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) for brain tumor surgery. Combining neuronavigation technology and intraoperative MRI, this method remarkably demonstrates spatial relationships of neurovascular structures and/or skull base landmarks and is very useful for intraoperative evaluation of completed neurosurgical operations. Using the navigation system and intraoperative MRI during surgery, it is possible to resect the brain tumor maximally and preserve essential neurological functions. Furthermore, advanced multimodal neuroradiological images such as functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and positron emission tomography (PET) clearly demonstrate the dominant cortex including the speech center, primary motor gyrus, primary sensory gyrus, and support high-quality operation with less invasive surgery. In conclusion, multimodal neuroradiological images are very useful for invasive noncircumscribed brain tumors such as glioma and, in combination with such highly technological analyses, advanced neurosurgical procedures are possible.
