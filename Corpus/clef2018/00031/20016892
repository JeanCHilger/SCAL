Efficacy of using a standard activity of (131)I-MIBG therapy in patients with disseminated neuroendocrine tumours. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the response to standard activity of (131)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) in patients with disseminated neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), comparing overall survival of patients with symptomatic response, tumour size (as assessed by CT) and relevant plasma tumour markers.A retrospective review of patients who had undergone (131)I-MIBG treatment between March 2001 and December 2006 was carried out. The administered activity of (131)I-MIBG was 5.5 GBq (NETs) and 7 GBq (phaeochromocytoma). Three cycles of treatment were planned with an interval of 10-12 weeks. A pre-therapy scan with (123)I-MIBG was performed to ascertain appropriate biodistribution.Thirty-eight patients were identified. Only two patients developed significant bone marrow suppression. Symptomatic response: data were available in 37 of 38 patients: 15 patients had improved symptoms, 19 had no improvement in symptoms and 3 were asymptomatic. In those with a symptomatic response, the median overall survival was 58 months vs no response of 20.0 months (p = 0.001). CT response: in those with stable disease, the median overall survival was 58 months compared with progressive disease of 16.0 months. The difference between these groups was significant (p = 0.006). Hormonal response: this was available in only 20 of 38 patients. The median overall survival was the same for patients that had increased hormone levels and patients that had stable/decreased hormone levels (48 months).Standard activity (131)I-MIBG is well tolerated. Symptomatic response to treatment is a significant predictor of overall survival. Whilst CT response also appears to predict survival, hormonal levels do not appear to correlate with survival.
