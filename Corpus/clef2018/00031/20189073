Positive correlation between serum liver enzyme levels and standard uptake values of liver on FDG-PET. The aim of the study is to assess the relationship between serum liver enzyme level, hepatic virus infectious state, and standard uptake value of liver on 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET).It is the retrospective review study from September 2005 to September 2007. A total of 354 healthy subjects referred from the Department of Community Medicine and Health Examination Center of our hospital for health screening were reviewed retrospectively and recruited for analysis. Whole-body FDG-PET, serum liver enzyme levels [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or SGOT and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or SGPT], and hepatic B (HBV)/hepatic C virus (HCV) infectious states by checking serum antibodies were performed in all subjects. The mean and maximal values of standard uptake values (SUV) of liver were calculated. The relationships between serum liver enzyme levels, hepatic virus infectious states, and standard uptake values of liver on FDG-PET were evaluated.There is statistically significant positive correlation between SGOT/SGPT and SUV of liver on FDG-PET. However, there are no significant differences in the SUV of liver on FDG-PET between HBV/HCV infection and nonhepatic virus infection subjects.High FDG uptake in the liver because of high level of SGOT/SGPT may lower the diagnostic sensitivity of hepatic malignant or infectious lesions on FDG-PET. For avoiding false-negative findings, careful evaluation of liver on FDG-PET and correlation with other clinical manifestations should be recommended in patients with high level of SGOT/SGPT. Nevertheless, neither HBV/HCV infectious states significantly influences on the SUV of liver on FDG-PET.
