Studies on cerebral processing of pain using functional imaging : Somatosensory, emotional, cognitive, autonomic and motor aspects. Functional neuroimaging methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide fascinating insights into the cerebral processing of pain. Neuroimaging studies have shown that no clearly defined "pain centre" exists. Rather, an entire network of brain regions is involved in the processing of nociceptive information, which leads to the subjective impression of "pain". Sophisticated study designs nowadays permit the characterisation of different components of pain processing. In this review, we summarise neuroimaging studies, which contributed to the characterisation of these different aspects of cerebral pain processing, such as somatosensory (discrimination of different stimulus modalities, noxious vs non-noxious, summation), emotional, cognitive (attention, anticipation, distraction), vegetative (homeostasis) and motor aspects.
