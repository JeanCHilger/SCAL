Cerebral serotonin transporter binding is inversely related to body mass index. Overweight and obesity is a health threat of increasing concern and understanding the neurobiology behind obesity is instrumental to the development of effective treatment regimes. Serotonergic neurotransmission is critically involved in eating behaviour cerebral level of serotonin (5-HT) in animal models is inversely related to food intake and body weight and some effective anti-obesity agents involve blockade of the serotonin transporter (SERT). We investigated in 60 healthy volunteers body mass index (BMI) and regional cerebral SERT binding as measured with [(11)C]DASB PET. In a linear regression model with adjustment for relevant covariates, we found that cortical and subcortical SERT binding was negatively correlated to BMI (-0.003 to -0.012 BP(ND) unit per kg/m(2)). Tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption did not affect cerebral SERT binding. Several effective anti-obesity drugs encompass blockade of the SERT
