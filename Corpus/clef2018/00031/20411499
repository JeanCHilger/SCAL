Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based surveillance of type A influenza viruses in wild and domestic birds of the Lebanon. A total of 1 330 oropharyngeal swabs collected from wild and domestic birds in Lebanon were examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for type A avian influenza virus (AIV) during the migratory season between the autumn of 2005 and winter of 2006. Twenty-five species of birds were included in the study. There are 14 species of migratory wild birds, 4 species of resident wild birds, 3 species of pet birds and 4 species of farm birds. The number and percentage of positive type A avian influenza viruses in collected oropharyngeal swabs was 190 positive out of 1 330 samples tested (14.3%). The 190 oropharyngeal samples positive for AIV were further tested by specific RT-PCR for H5 and H7 subtypes. The 190 AIV-positive samples were all negative for H5, while 13 of the 190 (6.8%) were positive for H7. The H7-positive samples were confined to sparrows (resident wild bird species) and to backyard chicken in the south province, located 10-20 km from the Israeli-Lebanese border.
