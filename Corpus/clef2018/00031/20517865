Neuroimaging in Alzheimer's disease: findings in plasmapheresis with albumin. Changes in cerebral function were evaluated in patients with Alzheimer disease treated or not with plasmapheresis with Human Albumin Grifols 5%. Sequential brain single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance imaging techniques were used.Brain SPECT (99mTc-ECD) studies were obtained at baseline (double headed gammacamera Siemens Ecam, LE-HR, 30 sec/image/3 degrees, 128 x 128). Studies were quantified by means of SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) and Neurogam. Changes between baseline and after a follow-up period of up to 12 months were evaluated in patients undergoing or not the plasma exchange treatment program. All the studies were double blinded and referenced to a normal age-matched database. Comparisons were performed individually and between groups: treated (plasma exchange) versus non treated group, and baseline versus post follow-up analysis.Significant differences in the areas of Brodmann were observed between the treated and the control groups and after the follow-up period. Regarding the hippocampal uptake, significant differences were observed between the treated and the control groups. Together with the clinical findings, these preliminary results provide biological evidence to the hypothesis that plasmapheresis with Human Albumin Grifols 5% can play a role in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
