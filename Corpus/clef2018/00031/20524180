Acetaldehyde plasma polymer-coated PET fibers for endothelial cell patterning: Chemical, topographical, and biological analysis. The objective of this study was to produce fibrous biomaterials with cell adhesive and cell repulsive capabilities for biomedical applications. To this aim, the surface of 100-mum diameter polyethylene terephthalate fibers were functionalized with acetaldehyde plasma polymer deposition followed by carboxymethyl dextran grafting onto the aldehyde-coated surfaces via a polyethyleneimine interlayer. The performance of the surface modification steps were confirmed by surface chemical composition analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, surface topography analysis by atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The acetaldehyde plasma polymer-coated and polyethyleneimine-grafted substrates promoted human umbilical vein endothelial cells attachment, spreading and actin filaments/focal adhesions formation. In contrast, carboxymethyl dextran-grafted substrates resisted cell adhesion. These observations demonstrate that the current surface-modified polymer fibers can be used in tissue engineering applications, such as cell patterning substrates or vascular prosthesis development.
