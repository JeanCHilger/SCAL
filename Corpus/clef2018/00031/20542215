Contributions of nuclear medicine to the diagnosis and follow-up of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The optimal treatment of patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors requires accurate staging. Nuclear medicine is an imaging technique that provides functional information. In gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors this information is obtained from radiotracers providing data on amine synthesis (MIBG) and/or somatostatin receptor expression (111-In-octreotide, 68Galio-DOTATOC) by the tumoral cell, both in primary and metastatic tumors. The accumulated experience shows that nuclear medicine techniques are essential in the management of these patients. The indications in the diagnosis, extension study and follow-up of these tumors, as well as the distinct radiotracers available, are reviewed.
