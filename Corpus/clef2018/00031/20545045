A correlation study between maximum standardized uptake values and pathology and clinical staging in nonsmall cell lung cancer. To investigate the relationship between maximum standardized uptake value and pathological type, degree of differentiation, tumor size, and clinical staging of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).This study included 135 cases with pathologically proven NSCLC. Correlations between maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and pathological type, degree of differentiation, tumor size, and clinical staging were analyzed.There was a significant correlation between the SUVmax of NSCLC and the pathological type (r= 0.391, P= 0.000) the SUVmax of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was higher than that of adenocarcinoma (AC) (P =0.000), and the SUVmax of AC was higher than that of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (P = 0.004). There was a positive correlation between the SUVmax of AC and the degree of differentiation (r= 0.222, P = 0.044)There was a correlation between the SUVmax of NSCLC and the pathological type and tumor size. A positive correlation was found between the SUVmax of AC and the degree of differentiation and clinical staging. There were no correlations between the SUVmax of SCC and the degree of differentiation or clinical staging.
