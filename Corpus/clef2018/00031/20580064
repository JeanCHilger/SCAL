The predictive value of measurement of SUVmax and SCC-antigen in patients with pretreatment of primary squamous cell carcinoma of cervix. Use of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and serum squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) antigen (SCC-ag) as predictors for poor prognosis of pretreatment of primary SCC of cervix.The distribution of cases that scored positive for each of the biological parameters examined was correlated with maximum SUV (SUVmax) of PET/CT and serum SCC-ag for 52 participants prior to radiotherapy (RT) with or without concurrent chemotherapy (CCRT) with pretreatment of primary SCC of cervix.There were significant correlations between the SUVmax of the primary tumor and tumor maximum size (P=0.027), and the lymph node metastasis (P=0.039). The serum SCC-ag had a statistically significant association with the clinicopathological parameters such as FIGO stage (P=0.045) and tumor maximum size (P=0.008), although there was no correlation noted between the SUVmax of the primary tumor and the serum SCC-ag (R=0.155). The high SUVmax of the primary tumor (≥ 15.6) plus lymph node metastasis (a short-axis diameter of over 10mm with a SUVmax ≥ 3.5) were significant predictors for poor prognosis when compared with the low SUVmax of the primary tumor (<15.6) or the high SUVmax of the primary tumor plus negative lymph node metastasis (a short-axis diameter of under 10mm or SUVmax <3.5) (overall survival rate P=0.0211).The present findings indicate that the high SUVmax of the primary tumor plus lymph node metastasis with pretreatment of primary SCC of cervix may be associated with a poor prognosis.
