The clinical application value of PET/CT in adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma features. The goal of our study was to demonstrate the clinical usefulness of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) features, through evaluating the relationship between the intrathoracic lymph node metastases and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), tumor size of the primary tumor and the ratio of BAC component and analysing the correlation of SUVmax, tumor size and the ratio of BAC component.This was a retrospective study. Forty-five patients with focal peripheral lung adenocarcinoma with BAC features were included in this study and underwent the PET/CT scan. Twenty-one patients were women and 24 were men. None of the patients had insulin-dependent diabetes and the serum glucose levels in all patients just before (18)F-FDG was injected were less than 120 mg/dl. The diagnosis of the lesion was made by surgical histopathology.All patients underwent successful surgery, and pathologic examination confirmed that 34 of 118 excised nodal groups in 18 patients were proved to be positive for malignancy. Univariate analysis revealed 3 potential factors related to intrathoracic lymph node metastases: SUVmax (P = 0.002) the ratio of BAC component (P = 0.002)PET/CT would be clinically useful for adenocarcinoma with BAC features, because SUVmax obtained by PET/CT can predict the incidence of intrathoracic lymph node metastases at preoperative stages and even for inoperable patients.
