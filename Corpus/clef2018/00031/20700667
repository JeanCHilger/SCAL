A practical method of determining cross-calibration factors of PET scanners by moving a point-like (22)Na radioactive source. Thus far, cylindrical phantoms with (18)F or (68)Ge/(68)Ga have been used in the standard techniques for determining the cross-calibration factors (CCFs) of PET scanners. This paper describes a new practical method that uses a point-like (22)Na radioactive source for determining CCFs.A point-like (22)Na radioactive source (about 700 kBq) was equipped with a spherical aluminium absorber capsule to ensure the symmetry of the emitted photons. During measurements, the source was moved in the axial direction to cover the whole axial field of view (FOV) of a clinical PET scanner, SET-2400 W. The region-of-interest (ROI) values obtained in reconstructed images without scatter and attenuation corrections were used to calculate the CCFs of the PET scanner.The CCFs obtained by the proposed method agreed with those obtained by the standard cross-calibration (CC) method within a precision of 1.5% (σ). The temporal variations in the CCFs by the standard CC method were reproduced by the proposed method with a precision better than 1%.The CC method with a moving (22)Na point-like radioactive source is practically useful for determining the CCFs of PET scanners and monitoring their variations.
