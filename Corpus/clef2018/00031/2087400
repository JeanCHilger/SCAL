Serial changes of the myocardium in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy followed by cardiac nuclear imaging. 5 years' observation. In order to evaluate the natural course of Duchenne's cardiomyopathy (DMD), 201T1-SPECT and RI cardioangiography with 99mTc-albumin were performed in 14 patients. They were examined once a year for five years except for 6 patients. Hypo-perfusion were observed in both posterior-inferior and anterior wall at 12 years of age and extended to the lateral wall and septum with aging. The degree of cardiac involvement was different in each case. Systolic parameters (LVEF, 1/3 EF, 1/3 ER-mean) tended to decrease with aging from 15 years of age. Diastolic parameters (%EFV, 1/3 FF, 1/3 FR mean) decreased gradually after 16 years of age. Hypokinetic changes of regional wall motion were observed at 15 years of age and they became severely with aging. Although phase delay appeared visually at 16 years of age, standard deviation of phase angle increased from 15 years of age. Follow up studies by 201T1 myocardial SPECT and gated pool scintigraphy revealed well the progression of cardiac involvement in patients with DMD.
