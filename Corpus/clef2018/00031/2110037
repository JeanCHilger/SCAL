Validation of [1-11C]acetate as a tracer for noninvasive assessment of oxidative metabolism with positron emission tomography in normal, ischemic, postischemic, and hyperemic canine myocardium. Extraction and clearance kinetics of [1-11C]acetate were examined in 65 experiments in 30 open-chest dogs. Twenty-nine studies were performed at control, 13 during ischemia, eight after reperfusion, 13 during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, and two during alteration of cardiac workload. [1-11C]Acetate was injected directly into the left anterior descending coronary artery, and myocardial tissue-time activity curves were recorded with a gamma probe. The single-pass extraction fraction averaged 64.2 +/- 9.7% in control, 65.3 +/- 9.1% in ischemia, 70.0 +/- 4.4% in reperfusion, and 46.5 +/- 7.4% in dipyridamole-induced hyperemia groups. 11C clearance was biexponential in all cases. The rate constant k1 for the first rapid clearance phase correlated closely with myocardial oxygen consumption (r = 0.94) in control, ischemia, reperfusion, and dipyridamole-induced hyperemia groups. Monoexponential fitting of only the first linear part of the clearance curve yielded the rate constant kmono, which also correlated with myocardial oxygen consumption (r = 0.96). Arterial lactate concentrations and the amount of free fatty acid oxygen equivalents consumed by the myocardium were shown to have a small but statistically significant impact on the relation between [1-11C]acetate clearance rate constants and myocardial oxygen consumption. The fraction of 14CO2 activity contributing to overall 14C activity leaving the myocardium after simultaneous injection of [1-14C]acetate (n = 24) was relatively high in all cases (97.4 +/- 2.5% in control, 89 +/- 2.6% in ischemia, 94.1 +/- 3.5% in reperfusion, and greater than 99% in dipyridamole groups), indicating that externally measured 11C clearance corresponds to CO2 production and thus to tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. In conclusion, the results validate the use of [1-11C]acetate as a tracer of oxidative myocardial metabolism for use with positron emission tomography.
