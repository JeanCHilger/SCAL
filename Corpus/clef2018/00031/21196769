The effect of revascularization of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis on coronary flow reserve and peripheral endothelial function. Patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) are at increased risk of heart disease because of associated hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiac failure and chronic kidney disease. Although suggested to be beneficial, the cardiac effects of renal artery revascularization have not been well characterized. Our aim was to analyze the effects of percutaneous dilatation of renal artery stenosis (RAS) in ARVD patients on coronary and peripheral vascular function.Nineteen ARVD patients [11 females and 8 males, age at study entry (mean ± SD) 69 ± 10 years] were treated by dilatation of unilateral (n = 9) or bilateral (n = 10) RAS, mainly because of uncontrolled or refractory hypertension. The patients were studied before and after the procedure (103 ± 29 days). They underwent echocardiography and peripheral artery endothelial function testing using flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of brachial artery at rest and during reactive hyperemia. Myocardial blood flow was measured using quantitative PET perfusion imaging at baseline and during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia.Peripheral endothelial function, tested by FMD, as well as systolic blood pressure and left ventricular mass were improved in patients with bilateral RAS. However, myocardial perfusion and coronary flow reserve (CFR) did not change after the RAS dilatation.This is the first study to analyze the stage of myocardial perfusion and CFR in ARVD patients. Although peripheral endothelial function, systolic blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy were improved in patients with bilateral RAS by revascularization of RAS, it did not have any effect on coronary perfusion.
