Myocardial perfusion imaging analysis in patients with regurgitant valvular heart disease. We noticed that there was decreased correlation of the findings from myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and cardiac catheterization (CATH) in patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) and aortic regurgitation (AR) compared to patients without valve disease.Through a systematic review of MPI records at the Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans' Hospital between 1998 and 2008, we identified 58 patients with at least moderate MR or AR by echocardiogram who underwent cardiac catheterization within 6 months of the MPI study. A control group was formulated with 60 patients who did not have significant MR or AR on echocardiogram and who had both MPI and CATH. Correlation between MPI and CATH was graded as complete, partial, or absent.Correlation between MPI and CATH was lower in the valve disease patients (study group) when compared to controls. Correlation was complete in 76% of study patients and 90% of controls, partial in 15% of study patients and 5% of controls, and absent in 9% of study patients and 5% of controls. Differences between the groups were significant (P < .05).Patients with regurgitant valvular heart disease may have myocardial perfusion abnormalities that are not associated with angiographic critical coronary stenosis.
