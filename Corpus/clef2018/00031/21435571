Multimodal image registration for preoperative planning and image-guided neurosurgical procedures. Image registration is the process of transforming images acquired at different time points, or with different imaging modalities, into the same coordinate system. It is an essential part of any neurosurgical planning and navigation system because it facilitates combining images with important complementary, structural, and functional information to improve the information based on which a surgeon makes critical decisions. Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) has been one of the pioneers in developing intraoperative registration methods for aligning preoperative and intraoperative images of the brain. This article presents an overview of intraoperative registration and highlights some recent developments at BWH.
