Performance measurements for the PET/CT Discovery-600 using NEMA NU 2-2007 standards. The aim of this study was to assess the performance measurements of the new PET/CT system Discovery-600 (D-600, GEMS, Milwaukee, WI).Performance measures were obtained with the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) NU 2-2007 procedures.The transverse (axial) spatial resolution FWHMs were 4.9 (5.6) mm and 5.6 (6.4) mm at 1 and 10 cm off axis, respectively. The sensitivity (average at 0 and 10 cm) was 9.6 cps/kBq. The scatter fraction was 36.6% (low energy threshold: 425 keV). The NEC peak rate (k=1) was 75.2 kcps at 12.9 kBq/cc. The hot contrasts for 10, 13, 17, and 22 mm spheres were 41%, 51%, 62%, and 73% and the cold contrasts for 28 and 37 mm spheres were 68% and 72%.The Discovery-600 has good performance for the NEMA NU 2-2007 parameters, particularly in improved sensitivity compared to the scanners of the same Discovery family, D-ST and D-STE.
