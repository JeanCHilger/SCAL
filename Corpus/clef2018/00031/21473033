 Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, is transported across the presynaptic neuron membranes (1, 2) by the dopamine transporter (DAT) and results in termination of the signaling action of the molecule (3). High densities of this transporter are present in certain regions of the brain, such as the putamen, caudate, nucleus accumbens, and the olfactory tubercle, whereas the substantia nigra, amygdala, and hypothalamus show comparatively low amounts of the DAT (4, 5). Negligible amounts of DATs are found in the cerebellum. The DAT has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders including Parkinson’s disease (6-8), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (9), supranuclear palsy (10), Tourette’s syndrome (11), and cocaine addiction (12, 13). Because of the involvement of DAT in a variety of neurological disorders, positron emission tomography (PET) is often used for the non-invasive imaging to determine the density of DAT in different regions (12) and to visualize the localization of therapeutic drugs (14) and cocaine (15) in the brain. Therefore, the use of PET tracers is considered useful for the detection of neuropsychiatric diseases (including cocaine addiction) and to monitor the efficacy of drugs used to treat these conditions (16). To this end, several
