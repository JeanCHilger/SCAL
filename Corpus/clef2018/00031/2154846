Liver regeneration and restoration of liver function after partial hepatectomy in patients with liver tumors. Liver regeneration and restoration of liver function were studied in six patients who underwent partial hepatectomy with removal of 30-70% of the liver. Liver volume and liver regeneration were studied by single-photon computed tomography (SPECT), using 99mTc-colloid as tracer. The method was assessed in 11 patients by comparing the pre- and post-operative volume measurements with the volume of the resected liver mass. The correlation coefficient between these methods was 0.899 (P less than 0.01). Liver function was determined by measuring the galactose elimination capacity and the caffeine clearance. After a postoperative follow-up period of 50 days the liver had regenerated maximally to a volume of 75 +/- 2% of the preoperative liver mass. Maximal restoration of liver function was achieved 120 days after operation and amounted to 75 +/- 10% for the caffeine clearance and to 100 +/- 25% for the galactose elimination capacity. This study shows that SPECT is a useful method for assessing liver regeneration in patients after partial hepatectomy. Our study furthermore shows that caffeine clearance correlates well with total liver volume, whereas the galactose elimination capacity overestimates total liver volume after partial hepatectomy.
