Relation between presynaptic and postsynaptic dopaminergic functions measured by positron emission tomography: implication of dopaminergic tone. Both presynaptic and postsynaptic dopaminergic functions can be estimated by positron emission tomography (PET). While both presynaptic and postsynaptic dopaminergic functions would be regulated by corresponding genes and related to personality traits, the relation between presynaptic and postsynaptic functions in terms of interindividual variation has hardly been investigated. In the present study, both striatal dopamine D(2) receptor binding and endogenous dopamine synthesis rate were measured in the same healthy subjects using PET with [(11)C]raclopride and l-[β-(11)C]DOPA, respectively, and these two parameters were compared. Two PET studies with [(11)C]raclopride and l-[β-(11)C]DOPA were performed sequentially at rest condition on 14 healthy men. For [(11)C]raclopride PET, the binding potential was calculated by the reference tissue model method. For l-[β-(11)C]DOPA PET, the endogenous dopamine synthesis rate was estimated by graphical analysis. A significant negative correlation was observed between the binding potential of dopamine D(2) receptors and endogenous dopamine synthesis rate (r = -0.66, p < 0.05). Although the interindividual variation of binding potential of [(11)C]raclopride would be due to both the interindividual difference in the receptor density and that in the concentration of endogenous dopamine in the synaptic cleft, the negative correlation between parameters for both presynaptic and postsynaptic functions might indicate a compensative relation between the two functions.
