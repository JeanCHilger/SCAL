Integrated SPECT/CT for assessment of haemodynamically significant coronary artery lesions in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Early risk stratification in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) is important since the benefit from more aggressive and costly treatment strategies is proportional to the risk of adverse clinical events. In the present study we assessed whether hybrid single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) technology could be an appropriate tool in stratifying patients with NSTE-ACS.SPECT/CCTA was performed in 90 consecutive patients with NSTE-ACS. The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction risk score (TIMI-RS) was used to classify patients as low- or high-risk. Imaging was performed using SPECT/CCTA to identify haemodynamically significant lesions defined as >50% stenosis on CCTA with a reversible perfusion defect on SPECT in the corresponding territory.CCTA demonstrated at least one lesion with >50% stenosis in 35 of 40 high-risk patients (87%) as compared to 14 of 50 low-risk patients (35% TIMI-RS<3Noninvasive assessment of coronary artery disease by SPECT/CCTA may play an important role in risk stratification of patients with NSTE-ACS by better identifying the subgroup requiring intervention.
