89Zr radiochemistry for positron emission tomography. The positron emitting isotope (89)Zr is an ideal radionuclide for use in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). This article reviews the cyclotron physics of (89)Zr production, and the chemical separation methods for isolating it from yttrium target material. (89)Zr coordination with the bifunctional chelate desferrioxamine B is discussed, along with the common procedures for attaching the chelate to mAbs. The review is intended to detail the procedure for creating (89)Zr labeled mAbs, going from cyclotron to PET.
