86Y based PET radiopharmaceuticals: radiochemistry and biological applications. Development of targeted radionuclide therapy with (90)Y labeled antibodies and peptides has gained momentum in the past decade due to the successes of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and (90)Y-DOTA-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide in treatment of cancer. (90)Y is a pure Î²(-)-emitter and cannot be imaged for patient-specific dosimetry which is essential for pre-therapeutic treatment planning and accurate absorbed dose estimation in individual patients to mitigate radiation related risks. This review article describes the utility of (86)Y, a positron emitter (33%) with a 14.7-h half-life that can be imaged by positron emission tomography and used as an isotopically matched surrogate radionuclide for (90)Y radiation doses estimations. This review discusses various aspects involved in the development of (86)Y labeled radiopharmaceuticals with the specific emphasis on the radiochemistry and biological applications with antibodies and peptides.
