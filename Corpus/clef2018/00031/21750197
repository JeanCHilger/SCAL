Absolute quantification of [(11)C]docetaxel kinetics in lung cancer patients using positron emission tomography. Tumor resistance to docetaxel may be associated with reduced drug concentrations in tumor tissue. Positron emission tomography (PET) allows for quantification of radiolabeled docetaxel ([(11)C]docetaxel) kinetics and might be useful for predicting response to therapy. The primary objective was to evaluate the feasibility of quantitative [(11)C]docetaxel PET scans in lung cancer patients. The secondary objective was to investigate whether [(11)C]docetaxel kinetics were associated with tumor perfusion, tumor size, and dexamethasone administration.Thirty-four lung cancer patients underwent dynamic PET-computed tomography (CT) scans using [(11)C]docetaxel. Blood flow was measured using oxygen-15 labeled water. The first 24 patients were premedicated with dexamethasone. For quantification of [(11)C]docetaxel kinetics, the optimal tracer kinetic model was developed and a noninvasive procedure was validated.Reproducible quantification of [(11)C]docetaxel kinetics in tumors was possible using a noninvasive approach (image derived input function). Thirty-two lesions (size ≥4 cm(3)) were identified, having a variable net influx rate of [(11)C]docetaxel (range, 0.0023-0.0229 mL·cm(-3)·min(-1)). [(11)C]docetaxel uptake was highly related to tumor perfusion (Spearman's ρ = 0.815P < 0.001), but not to tumor size (Spearman's ρ = -0.140Quantification of [(11)C]docetaxel kinetics in lung cancer was feasible in a clinical setting. Variable [(11)C]docetaxel kinetics in tumors may reflect differential sensitivity to docetaxel therapy. Our findings warrant further studies investigating the predictive value of [(11)C]docetaxel uptake and the effects of comedication on [(11)C]docetaxel kinetics in tumors.
