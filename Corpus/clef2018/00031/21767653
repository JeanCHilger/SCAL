Genotype specific age related changes in a transgenic rat model of Huntington's disease. We aimed to characterize the transgenic Huntington rat model with in vivo imaging and identify sensitive and reliable biomarkers associated with early and progressive disease status. In order to do so, we performed a multimodality (DTI and PET) longitudinal imaging study, during which the same TgHD and wildtype (Wt) rats were repetitively scanned. Surprisingly, the relative ventricle volume was smaller but increased faster in TgHD compared to Wt animals. DTI (mean, axial, radial diffusivity) revealed subtle genotype-specific aging effects in the striatum and its surrounding white matter, already in the presymptomatic stage. Using ¹⁸F-FDG and ¹⁸F-Fallypride PET imaging, we were not able to demonstrate genotype-specific aging effects within the striatum. The outcome of this longitudinal study was somewhat surprising as it demonstrated a significant differential aging pattern in TgHD versus Wt animals. Although it seems that the TgHD rat model does not have a sufficient expression of disease yet at the age of 12 months, further validation of this model is highly beneficial since there is still an incomplete understanding of the early disease mechanisms of Huntington's disease.
