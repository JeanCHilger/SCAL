Validation of image-derived arterial input functions at the femoral artery using 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography. The use of image-derived arterial input functions (IDAIF) for the dynamic quantification of bone metabolism using 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography 18F-PET is an attractive alternative to direct arterial blood sampling.(a) To validate a method for obtaining the IDAIF by imaging the femoral artery against a method for deriving the IDAIF at the aorta that was previously validated against direct arterial sampling. (b) To compare the accuracy of bone plasma clearance measurements (Ki) at the total hip site obtained using the femoral artery IDAIF against Ki values at the same site obtained using the aorta IDAIF.Twelve healthy postmenopausal women with a mean age of 62.6 years (range, 52.3-70.6 years) had 60-min dynamic 18F-PET scans of the lumbar spine and proximal femur 2 weeks apart. The femoral artery IDAIF was obtained from the proximal femur scan using four different algorithms: (a) fixed partial volume correction (PVC) method (b) variable PVC methodWhen the femoral artery IDAIF methods were compared with the aorta IDAIF in terms of the area under the curve AUC values calculated in 4-min time intervals over 0-60 min, the absolute root mean square errors were: (a) fixed PVC, 0.52 (b) variable PVC, 0.54We have demonstrated that it is possible to measure regional bone turnover at the hip without the need to perform direct arterial sampling to acquire the arterial input function (AIF). The differences in the Ki values obtained at the hip by using aorta IDAIF and any of the four image-based AIF methods at the femoral artery were small and clinically insignificant. The performance of fixed PVC, variable PVC and Cook-Lodge method was similar although the latter was less robust than the other two methods.
