Synthesis of complexes bearing NH,NMe-substituted NHCs by oxidative addition of 2-halogenato-N-methylbenzimidazoles to Ni(0). Reaction of 2-X-N-methylbenzimidazole (X = chloro, iodo) with Ni(0) complexes in the presence of dppe or PEt(3) and an external proton source yielded via an oxidative addition reaction nickel(II) complexes bearing NH,NMe-functionalized NHC ligands.
