MR-PET fusion imaging in evaluating adnexal lesions: a preliminary study. The objective of this preliminary study was to examine the effects of combined magnetic resonance/positron emission tomography (MR-PET) evaluation in the morphofunctional characterisation of ovarian lesions.From June 2008 to September 2010, we evaluated 24 patients (mean age 44Â±10 years range 24-74) with ovarian lesions incidentally detected on ultrasonography (US) and/or multislice computed tomography (CT). All patients underwent MR imaging of the pelvis and total-body CT-PET. PET and MR images were subsequently fused at postprocessing using specific anatomical criteria. Results were compared with the histological examination.Of the 24 examined lesions, 19 were malignant and five were benign on histological examination. MR, CT-PET and MR-PET sensitivity was 84%, 74% and 94%, respectively and specificity 60%, 80% and 100%, respectively. Positive (PPV) and negative predictive (NPV) values were 93% and 44% for CT-PET, 89% and 50% for MR and 100% and 83% for MR-PET, respectively.Pelvic MR-PET fusion imaging provides advantages in terms of sensitivity and especially specificity compared with MR imaging or CT-PET alone. The added value of this fusion imaging modality lies in combining the benefits of the morphological evaluation provided by MR imaging and the metabolic assessment provided by PET.
