Lymphadenectomy in penile cancer. In contrast to many cancers, squamous cell carcinoma of the penis can be cured despite the presence of lymph node metastases. This characteristic is shared with testicular cancer. But unlike testicular cancer, penile carcinoma is not chemosensitive and, therefore, the focus of management has been on surgery. This article addresses all aspects of imaging and minimally invasive methods of detecting lymph node involvement. It focuses on the indications of surgical management of the regional nodes, the extent of the surgery, and its complications. Also, neoadjuvant therapy is covered.
