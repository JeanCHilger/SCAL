¹⁸F]GE-180: a novel fluorine-18 labelled PET tracer for imaging Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO. A series of tricyclic compounds have been synthesised and evaluated in vitro for affinity against Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) and for preferred imaging properties. The most promising of the compounds were radiolabelled and evaluated in vivo to determine biodistribution and specificity for high expressing TSPO regions. Metabolite profiling in brain and plasma was also investigated. Evaluation in an autoradiography model of neuroinflammation was also carried out for the best compound, 12a ([(18)F]GE-180).
