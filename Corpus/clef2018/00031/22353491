Sex-specific differences in GABA(A) -benzodiazepine receptor availability: relationship with sensitivity to pain and tobacco smoking craving. Sex differences exist in tobacco smoking behaviors. Nicotine, the primary addictive ingredient in tobacco smoke, indirectly affects γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) function. Previous studies reported sex-by-smoking interactions in brain GABA levels. The goal of the present study was to evaluate if there is a sex-by-smoking interaction at the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptors (GABA(A)-BZRs), as well as relationships between GABA(A)-BZR availability and behavioral variables before and after 1 week of smoking cessation. Twenty-six women (8 non-smokers, age 36.0 ± 13.4 years 19 smokers, age 34.6 ± 8.9 years) and 25 men (8 non-smokers, age 37.9 ± 13.8 years
