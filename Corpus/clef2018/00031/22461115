Comparative role of PET and Kt/V determination in pediatric chronic peritoneal dialysis. Nutritional state and growth are considered as prognostic markers of chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) adequacy in pediatric patients. The euvolemia, blood pressure control, and metabolic and electrolytic equilibrium are parameters to be achieved by PD treatment.To describe the chronic PD prescription parameters of a cohort of pediatric patients and to compare the obtained hemodynamic, antrophometric and adequacy results with those suggested by the literature.Retrospective analysis based on clinical records evaluation of 30 pediatric patients undergoing PD for more than 6 months from January 1998 to May 2005.In the present study, 17/30 (56.7%) were boys. Chronic kidney disease was secondary to uropathy in 66.7% of the cases. The infusion volume was > 1,000 ml/m2 in 9 patients. The peritoneal membrane was characterized as high (27.8%), high-average (33.3%), low-average (22.2%) and low transporter (16.7%). The weekly urea Kt/V was > 2.1 in all the evaluated patients. Blood pressure parameters above the 95th percentile despite the use of antihypertensive medication were observed in 5/30 patients, four of whom with CKD secondary to glomerulopathy. The initial and final Body Mass Index and weight for height ratio were preserved in 83.3% (25/30) patients.Elevated indexes of small solutes removal are easily attained in pediatric PD patients and do not imply optimal clinical management do not imply optimal climanagement.
