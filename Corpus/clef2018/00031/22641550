Evaluation of coronary artery abnormalities in Williams syndrome patients using myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and CT angiography. Sudden death risk in Williams syndrome (WS) patients has been shown to be 25-100 times higher than in the general population. This study aims to detect coronary artery anomalies and myocardial perfusion defects in WS patients using noninvasive diagnostic methods.This study features 38 patients diagnosed with WS. In addition to physical examination, electrocardiography, and echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) angiography and rest/dipyridamole stress technetium-99m sestamibi ((99m)Tc-sestamibi) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) were performed.Twenty-one (55%) patients were male 17 (45%) were female. The average patient age was 12 Â± 5 years (2.5-26 years)Coronary artery abnormalities are relatively common in WS patients and are often accompanied by SVAS. CT angiography and dipyridamole (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT MPS seem to be less invasive methods of detecting coronary artery anomalies and myocardial perfusion defects in WS patients.
