Association between gallium-67 uptake by lung foci and sputum smear status in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Rapid determination of the inflammatory and sputum smear status in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is crucial for clinical decision making. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between gallium-67 (Ga-67) uptake by lung foci and sputum smear status in patients with PTB. We also attempted to predict the patients with acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear-positive PTB by means of a semiquantitative measurement of Ga-67 uptake ratio using single-photon emission computed tomography images.Ninety-five patients with PTB were enrolled in this retrospective study. A volume-of-interest method was used to quantify Ga-67 uptake in single-photon emission computed tomography images. The Ga-67 uptake ratio was defined as the maximum voxel value of the pulmonary lesion divided by the maximum voxel value of normal lung tissue.The Ga-67 uptake ratio was higher in patients with active PTB than in those with inactive PTB (3.11 ± 1.52 vs. 1.42 ± 0.14, P<0.01). In active PTB, the Ga-67 uptake ratio was higher in smear-positive patients than in smear-negative patients (3.41 ± 1.60 vs. 2.16 ± 0.61, P<0.01). In patients with AFB smear grades 1+, 2+, and 3+, the Ga-67 uptake ratios were 2.51 ± 0.81, 3.30 ± 1.57, and 4.23 ± 1.73, respectively. The correlation between Ga-67 uptake ratio and AFB smear grading was statistically significant (Spearman's ρ=0.60, P<0.01). In receiver operating characteristic curve analyses, the area under the curve for the Ga-67 uptake ratio was 0.95 ± 0.02 (P<0.01) for predicting active PTB and 0.87 ± 0.04 (P<0.01) for predicting smear-positive active PTB.In patients with active PTB, more-intense Ga-67 uptake was associated with more AFB load in the sputum - that is a greater potential to transmit PTB. This finding might facilitate clinical decision making for immediate isolation and treatment to reduce transmission of PTB.
