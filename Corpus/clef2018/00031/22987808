Orthotopic VX rabbit tongue cancer model with FDG-PET and histologic characterization. We present our experience with the use of an immunocompetent medium-sized animal model of tongue cancer that may be suitable for imaging and surgical studies.A New Zealand white rabbit model of tongue cancer was created by injecting a VX tumor cell suspension grown in culture into the tongue of our model. The tumor was examined 7 days following implantation by physical examination, photography, and (18) fluoro 2-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). At 12 days postimplantation, the model was again studied as described above prior to euthanization, and then tongue excision and bilateral neck dissections were performed. All tissue was examined by histology.We confirmed a successful orthotopic tongue cancer model that resulted in cervical nodal metastases.This model may be a useful model of orthotopic head and neck cancer for future surgical or imaging research.
