Positron emission tomography of fluorine-18-deoxyglucose and image-guided phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy in brain tumors. Positron emission tomography (PET) of 2(18F)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and volume-selective phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) are methods used to assess the energy metabolism of the brain. Both methods were studied with respect to their contribution to differential diagnosis in 23 patients with various brain tumors. The various neuroectodermal tumors differed with respect to their metabolic rate for glucose (MRGL). Benign and malignant tumors could be better differentiated by using tumor metabolism relative to contralateral brain and by evaluating heterogeneities in tumors. Low-grade gliomas usually showed normal 31P-MR spectra high-grade gliomas were characterized by reduced and often split phosphodiester peaks and alkaline pH. Meningiomas, which had variable MRGL, typically showed extremely low phosphocreatine levels, reduced phosphodiesters, and alkaline pH. We concluded that FDG-PET and 31P-MRS examine different aspects of tumor metabolism. Therefore, both can contribute independently and complementarily to the differential diagnosis of brain tumors.
