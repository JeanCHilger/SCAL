Segmental analysis of SPECT 99mTc-methoxy isobutyl isonitrile and 201Tl myocardial imaging in ischaemic heart disease. To study the potential usefulness of 99mTc-methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) as a substitute for 201Tl in assessing patients with ischaemic heart disease, 24 patients underwent 1 day rest and exercise 99mTc-MIBI single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) 1 week after SPECT exercise 201Tl. All patients were catheterized within 1 month after myocardial imaging. In 17 patients, resting first pass radionuclide angiography (FPRNA) was performed with 99mTc-MIBI. The heart to lung ratio for 99mTc-MIBI and 201Tl was calculated both at rest and exercise. The segmental analysis for myocardial perfusion reveals that 87/96 segments (91%) were correctly classified by SPECT 201Tl and 84/96 segments (88%) were correctly classified by 99mTc-MIBI. A significant correlation was present between LVEF measured by 99mTc-MIBI FPRNA and contrast ventriculography (r = 0.85, P less than 0.0001). The heart to lung ratio both at rest and exercise for 99mTc-MIBI is significantly higher than 201Tl (P less than 0.01 and less than 0.001 respectively). We conclude that 99mTc-MIBI is a promising agent for simultaneous evaluation of myocardial perfusion and cardiac function.
