Brain perfusion SPECT using an annular single crystal camera: initial clinical experience. The annular single-crystal brain camera (ASPECT) is a digital SPECT system with a single-crystal sodium iodide thallium Nal(Tl) ring detector and collimator system designed to view the patient's head from three angles simultaneously. The ring is rotated concentrically to the detector for three-dimensional reconstruction over a 21.4 cm (diameter) by 10.7 cm (length) field of view. We evaluated the system clinically by imaging a Hoffman brain phantom and seven subjects, of whom two were normal controls, three had previous cerebral infarction and two had dementia. The ASPECT system produced tomographic images of high spatial resolution. In normal subjects, the separation of striata from thalami by the posterior limbs of the internal capsules was much clearer on ASPECT images than on rotating gamma camera images. The high spatial resolution obtained with the ASPECT system translates into superior anatomical representation of the brain compared to the standard rotating gamma camera.
