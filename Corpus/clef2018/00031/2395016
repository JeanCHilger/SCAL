Iodine-125-MIBG to treat neuroblastoma: preliminary report. Three children with Stage III neuroblastoma were treated with [125I]MIBG in a phase I toxicity study. Concepts of the treatment were: in small tumors, the absorbed dose of radiation from MIBG labeled with 131I is reduced but the absorbed dose from [125I]MIBG is less affected and many recurrences of neuroblastoma arise from small tumors. Two patients exhibited only modest thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, the most sensitive indices of radiation toxicity, after receiving 261 and 407 mCi, and 83 and 104 rad of whole-body radiation. One patient died of progressive neuroblastoma
