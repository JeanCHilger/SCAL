Nuclear medical diagnosis of hip joint diseases in adults. Skeletal scintigraphy has a high sensitivity but low specificity in early detection and follow up of hip diseases. Unexplained hip pain or indistinct X-rays may be the reason for scintigraphic examination. On the other hand, there is a wide range of clinical indications for nuclear medicine examination, such as metastatic and primary malignant disease, tumor-like lesions, inflammatory, infectious, degenerative and avascular diseases, and posttraumatic and postoperative changes. White blood cell scintigraphy is highly sensitive and highly specific in the detection of infectious disease of the hip. In the vast majority of cases, physiologic or postoperative granulocytic accumulation can be differentiated from infectious accumulation, which requires therapy.
