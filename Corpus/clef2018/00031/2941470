Frontal cortex and basal ganglia metabolic rates assessed by positron emission tomography with [18F]2-deoxyglucose in affective illness. Twenty affective disorder patients (16 bipolar and 4 unipolar) and 24 normal controls received scans with positron emission tomography (PET) using [18F]2-deoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer. Subjects received a series of brief electrical stimuli to their right arms during FDG uptake. Patients with bipolar affective illness had significantly lower frontal to occipital glucose metabolic rate ratios (relative hypofrontality) and significantly lower metabolic rates in their basal ganglia in comparison to whole slice metabolism than normal controls. Patients with unipolar illness showed significantly higher frontal to occipital ratios, and also showed relatively decreased metabolism in the basal ganglia. All results in unipolar patients should be considered exploratory due to the small number of patients. Clinical depression ratings correlated negatively with whole slice metabolic rate.
