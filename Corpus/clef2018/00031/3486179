Regional lung hematocrit in humans using positron emission tomography. Regional lung hematocrit ratio (R) was measured in five normal subjects and five patients (2 with pneumonia, 2 with nephrotic syndrome with anemia, and 1 with pancreatitis) using positron emission tomography, a red cell marker 11CO, and a plasma marker [methyl-11C]albumin). The measurements were made in a transaxial thoracic section at midheart level with the subject in supine posture and with a spatial resolution of 1.7 cm. The normal regional hematocrit ratio (means +/- SE) calculated for the lung was 0.90 +/- 0.014, 0.94 +/- 0.023 for the thoracic wall, and 1.00 +/- 0.003 for the heart chambers. The regional lung hematocrit ratio in the patients ranged between 0.81 and 0.86. No correlation was found among the regional lung hematocrit ratio and regional blood volume, lung extravascular density, and the peripheral hematocrit (obtained from venous blood samples). To the extent that 70% of the pulmonary blood in the field of view is in larger vessels with normal hematocrit, the hematocrit in the capillary bed is approximately two-thirds that of the peripheral venous value. Blood volume measurements on the basis of single vascular tracers need to take account of these results.
