No-carrier-added N-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)spiroperidol: biodistribution in mice and tomographic studies in a baboon. Two potential radioligands, no-carrier-added (NCA) N-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)spiroperidol (3) and N-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)spiroperidol (4) have been synthesized for PET imaging of dopamine receptors in humans. Compounds 3 and 4 were synthesized by N-alkylation of spiroperidol with NCA 1-bromo-2-[18F]-fluoroethane (2b), 1-[18F]fluoro-3-iodopropane (2c) and 1-bromo-3-[18F]fluoropropane (2d) respectively. The biodistribution of 4 in mice showed that the mouse brain uptake of radioactivity was similar to that of [18F]-N-methylspiroperidol (1.1% of the administered dose), but the activity in bone (femur) increased with time. The kinetic distribution of compound 4 in baboon brain was similar to that of [18F]-N-methylspiroperiodol, and the striatal accumulation of radioactivity was also blocked stereoselectively by butaclamol. The ratio of striatum to cerebellum radioactivities at 3 hr after injection was 5.9. Analysis of the metabolic stability of 4 in mouse brains for 1 hr indicated that, like [18F]-N-methylspiroperidol, it is relatively stable to metabolic transformation in the central nervous system. These results suggest that compound 4 may be a useful radioligand for PET studies of the dopamine receptor in humans.
