Colored spatial mapping electrocardiography for detecting myocardial infarction. Colored spatial mapping electrocardiography (ECG) was developed for practical use from Frank lead vectorcardiography using a microcomputer system (CERX-CQ3001). Compared to body surface electrocardiography this new device facilitated easy recording and analysis for display on eight-colored spatial mapping electrocardiography at points equivalent to those on a terrestrial globe at intervals of 20 degrees longitude and 10 degrees latitude. In this study, the extent and direction of the Q waves were easily recognized with the aid of a colored display and mapping electrocardiography. To quantitatively evaluate infarct size, the total Q wave area (sigma Aq) was calculated from the mapping electrocardiograms of 12 patients with anteroseptal myocardial infarction, and compared with thallium defect scores obtained by single photon emission CT (SPECT) and the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF). Defect scores were calculated using short-axis images. Sigma Aq was correlated with defect scores and EF (r = 0.83, 0.45, respectively). This new type of colored spatial mapping electrocardiography proved useful for detecting myocardial infarction and for evaluating infarct size.
