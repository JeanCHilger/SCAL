Noninvasive tomographic measurement of regional cerebral blood flow. The measurement of the regional cerebral bloodflow by means of the dynamic single-photon-emission-computed tomography is a method of examination which is completely free of risk for the patient, causes no inconvenience and can be repeated whenever it seems necessary. This method gives a quantitative explanation for the distribution of the effective cerebral perfusion and can only be substituted by the very complicated positron-emission-computed tomography. As well as the exact assessment of the hemodynamic relevance of cerebral vascular disease, this method enables us to prove whether or not in various types of psychiatric disorders an interference in the regional perfusion exists. This method can also contribute to the clarification of pathogenic mechanisms, as well as to the nosological classification of specific psychopathological conditions.
