Prediction of improvement in left ventricular function with iodine-123-IPPA after coronary revascularization. Iodine-123-phenylpentadecanoic acid (IPPA) is a synthetic fatty acid suitable for myocardial imaging. This study is the result of a Phase I/II trial to evaluate IPPA's ability to predict functional recovery in patients undergoing coronary revascularization.Twenty-three patients with documented coronary disease underwent sequential SPECT imaging with IPPA before and radionuclide ventriculography both before and 8 wk after revascularization. Software was developed to evaluate myocardial IPPA metabolism and to determine the fraction of the left ventricle with intermediate metabolism.There was a significant correlation between initial IPPA uptake and final LVEF. The fractional area of the left ventricle demonstrating IPPA metabolism in the intermediate metabolic range was significantly higher in patients who demonstrated a 5% or greater increase in EF after revascularization (0.90 +/- 0.08 versus 0.78 +/- 0.17, p = 0.04). When only the patients who received complete revascularization were evaluated, there was a more significant difference (improved 0.92 +/- 0.05 versus 0.74 +/- 0.17, p = 0.011). Taking a lower limit of 1 s.d. from the mean, (87%) the six patients who had > or = 5% increase in LVEF after revascularization had more than 87% of the left ventricle in the intermediate metabolic range, whereas seven of ten patients whose change in LVEF was < 5% had less than 87% in the intermediate metabolic range (p = 0.011).In this initial experience, the amount of myocardium in the intermediate metabolic range is associated with improvement in LVEF after revascularization, especially in patients receiving complete revascularization.
