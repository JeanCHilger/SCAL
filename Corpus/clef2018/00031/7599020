Procaine-induced increases in limbic rCBF correlate positively with increases in occipital and temporal EEG fast activity. Previous independent EEG and PET studies suggest that administration of intravenous procaine hydrochloride selectively activates limbic brain structures. To further elucidate procaine's effects and explore the relationship between quantitative EEG (qEEG) and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), we simultaneously recorded qEEG and sampled rCBF using O-15 water PET in 20 healthy volunteers during single-blind injections of saline (baseline condition) followed by intravenous procaine (1.84 mg/kg). After thorough screening of EEG records, a subgroup of 7 subjects with EEG data relatively free of both muscle and movement artifacts was selected for analysis. Quantitative spectral EEG data from right occipital and temporal leads were then correlated with each subject's PET rCBF values on a pixel by pixel basis, both at baseline and after procaine. The most striking finding was that the increases in occipital and temporal omega activity from baseline to procaine positively correlated with rCBF increases in the amygdala and its efferents (p < .05), in a pattern very similar to the rCBF increases seen after procaine administration. This suggests that omega activity may reflect activation of deeper brain limbic structures. Also, the convergence of EEG and PET data further supports procaine's selective limbic activation.
