Single-photon emission computerized tomography in craniocerebral injuries in children. The recognition of the localization and spread of traumatic damage to the brain in craniocerebral injury in children is a pressing problem. The authors studied the possibilities of monophoton emission computed tomography (MECT) with the use of the radiopharmaceutical preparation Ceretec in recognition and visualization of foci of traumatic damage to the brain in these patients. The study was conducted on 20 children with severe craniocerebral trauma in parallel with verification by computed X-ray tomography, electroencephalography and mapping of the brain potentials, and rheoencephalography. The results of the study showed high diagnostic possibilities of the method in detecting ischemic foci in the brain. A craniocerebral trauma in children was found to be characterized by multiple ischemic deficits in the damaged and intact hemispheres and particularly in the basal parts of the brain. The information obtained by the MECT method is independent in character and is not a duplicate of the findings of CT, EEG, REG, sonography, etc.
