High-resolution renal SPECT in eight minutes using a multi-detector gamma camera. Planar renal scintigraphy with Tc-99m DMSA has become established as a standard diagnostic test to determine if a kidney has been scarred by infection. It has been suggested that high resolution SPECT may improve the sensitivity of detection of renal scars. To determine if it is possible to produce good quality renal SPECT with a short acquisition time, 10 adults were examined with a new multi-detector gamma camera using 8 minute, 16 minute, and 32 minute acquisitions. The number of defects seen (N = 16) with an 8 minute acquisition was not significantly different from the defects (N = 15) seen using a 16 minute and a 32 minute acquisition. In adults when imaging with a multi-detector gamma camera there was no clinical advantage in using an acquisition of longer than 8 minutes.
