Short-dwell peritoneal dialysis: increased use and impact on clinical outcome. We reviewed 216 patients on peritoneal dialysis over a 3-year period to assess the effects on patient outcome of short-dwell dialysis (SDD), defined as dwell time below 4 hours with a daily dry (empty peritoneum) interval. Forty-nine patients (23%) required SDD for improved management of ultrafiltration failure (82%), effective blood pressure control (8%), abdominal wall hernia (4%), hydrothorax (4%), and patient convenience (2%). Ultrafiltration failure was recognized as the inability to achieve resolution of clinical overhydration, confirmed by the peritoneal equilibration test (PET), demonstrating high membrane glucose transport (absorption) and observed retention of dialysate volume. Daytime ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (DAPD) was used by 69% of patients and nightly peritoneal dialysis (NPD) with cyclers by 31%. Only one patient (hydrothorax) transferred to hemodialysis. Observations include sustained hydration and blood pressure control in all patients with maintenance of biochemical dialysis adequacy, less reliance on very hypertonic solutions, an increase in dry weight in 25% of patients, decreased use of antihypertensive agents, effective management of hernia and hydrothorax in 3 of 4 patients, and satisfactory patient tolerance of DAPD and NPD regimens, and daily dry intervals. Factors promoting SDD include improved understanding of PET studies, use of disconnect systems, and improvement in cycler design. We anticipate increasing use of SDD as recognition of its usefulness and application techniques expands.
