A PET study of somatosensory discrimination in man. microgeometry versus macrogeometry. The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured with 15O-butanol and positron emission tomography (PET) in 10 healthy subjects in order to compare cerebral activation involved in the somatosensory discrimination of microgeometric features with cerebral activation associated with the discrimination of macrogeometric features. Subjects performed two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) discriminations of pairs of stimuli from a series of quantified standardized stimuli that differed in roughness (microgeometry), and a separate 2-AFC task of smooth tactile stimuli that differed in length (macrogeometry). Results are presented from three conditions: (1) a roughness discrimination task (2) a length discrimination task
