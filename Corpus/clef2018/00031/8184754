In vivo myocardial microcirculation: evaluation with a whole-body x-ray CT method. The detailed anatomic geometry of the myocardial microvasculature is unresolvable by current "whole body" imaging techniques. An index of microvascular patency can however be provided by monitoring the intramyocardial blood content by whole body imaging methods. Both spatial distribution and intracyclic changes of regional intramyocardial blood volume can be estimated by whole-body imaging techniques such as x-ray CT and SPECT. Examples of how these methods can be used are provided.
