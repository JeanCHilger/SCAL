A test-retest study of cerebral blood flow during somatosensory stimulation in depressed patients with schizophrenia and major depression. Six depressed patients with schizophrenia and 6 depressed patients with major depression were investigated before and during somatosensory stimulation (SS) with Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT. 8 controls were investigated only under resting conditions. The results can be summarized as follows: 1. Both psychiatric patient groups were hypofrontal (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) compared to controls. 2. Hypofrontality was further enhanced by SS, significantly only in affective psychoses in the right inferior frontal lobe and in the right frontal hemisphere in total, in schizophrenia in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 3. Within the frontal lobes different regions were affected by SS in the two diagnostic groups. 4. In the right inferior parietal lobe SS response was significantly different in the two illnesses with schizophrenia showing a relative decrease, affective psychoses showing a relative increase of activity. 5. SS produced an increase of cerebral blood flow in subcortical regions (statistically significant contralateral to SS in thalamus and basal ganglia, ipsilateral to SS in cerebellum), a pattern which was common to all psychiatric patients. 6. Somatosensory cortex flow was not changed by SS. In conclusion, we could not fully confirm our hypotheses that similar blood flow abnormalities in different illnesses during SS are only caused by similarities in depressive psychopathology. Instead, depressed patients with schizophrenia were different from depressed patients with major depression in showing decreased activity in interrelating brain regions participating in an attentional network.
