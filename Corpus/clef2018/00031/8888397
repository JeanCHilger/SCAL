High-energy (511-keV) imaging with the scintillation camera. A dual-head scintillation camera has been adapted for high-energy (511-keV) imaging by extending the useful energy range and linearity maps to 560 keV, implementing high-energy sensitivity maps, and developing high-energy collimators. High-energy parallel-hole collimators have inferior spatial resolution and sensitivity relative to the low-energy, high-resolution collimators commonly in use. With high-energy parallel-hole collimators, phantom studies show that the limit for detectability of "hot" lesions is 1.5 cm and 1.3 cm in diameter or larger for 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake ratios of 5:1 and 10:1, respectively, if one assumes adequate counting statistics. Dual-isotope, single-acquisition techniques for using technetium-99m methoxy isobutyl isonitrile and FDG have been developed and proved useful in identification of ischemic but viable myocardium. High-energy fan-beam collimators have superior spatial resolution but inferior sensitivity relative to low-energy, high-resolution collimators. Metabolic images of the brain obtained with FDG demonstrate spatial resolution comparable with that of positron emission tomography, but such studies are often limited by inadequate counting statistics.
