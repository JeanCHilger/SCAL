Cardiac involvement in facio-scapulo-humeral muscular dystrophy: a family study using Thallium-201 single-photon-emission-computed tomography. Fifteen persons from two consecutive generations of one family affected with facio-scapulo-humeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) were clinically and neurophysiologically examined. Diagnostic muscle biopsies were obtained from two members. Linkage analysis showed that all four affected members of the family inherit the same 4q35 haplotype giving a lod score of z = +1.44. Six family members were examined by ECG at rest and under stress, by two-dimensional echocardiography, and by cardiac Thallium-201 single-photon-emission computed tomography (Tl-201-SPECT) under dobutamine stress and at rest. Abnormal reduced Tl-201 uptake in cardiac SPECT was only found in the affected members of the family. Therefore we suggest that cardiac Tl-201-SPECT abnormalities in FSHD reflect cardiomyogenic changes in this type of muscular disease.
