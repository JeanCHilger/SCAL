111In octreotide scintigraphy in the evaluation of head and neck lesions. To evaluate indium 111 octreotide scintigraphy for the detection of suspected neuroendocrine lesions of the head and neck.After receiving 6 mCi of 111In octreotide, 22 patients with suspected lesions of the head and neck were examined with both planar and single-photon emission CT (SPECT). Static images, obtained at 4 hours, included the head/neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Additional SPECT images were obtained at 4 or 24 hours. Studies were compared with available conventional radiologic examinations (12 CT, 11 MR, and three angiographic studies) as well as with clinical and pathologic findings.Eighteen of the 22 patients had abnormal findings at scintigraphy. Eleven paragangliomas were seen in 10 patients, metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma in three patients, thyroid adenoma in two patients, and Merkel cell tumor, carcinoid, and plasmacytoma in one patient each. Surgical confirmation was available in 13 patients. The smallest lesion detected was 1.5 cm. There was one false-positive and one false-negative examination.111In octreotide scintigraphy is a useful imaging tool for the detection of primary and metastatic neuroendocrine tumors of the head and neck that are larger than 1.5 cm. This technique enables distinction of glomus tumors from other masses (such as neuromas) and can be used in the postoperative setting to distinguish scar from recurrent paraganglioma. Since it is an examination of the entire body, it has great utility for detecting multicentric paraganglioma and for screening patients with familial paraganglioma.
