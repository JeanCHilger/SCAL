Description of a novel eukaryotic deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase in Leishmania major. A Leishmania major full-length cDNA encoding a functional dUTP nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase EC 3.6.1.23) was isolated from a cDNA expression library by genetic complementation of dUTPase deficiency in Escherichia coli. The cDNA contained an open reading frame that encoded a protein of 269 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 30.3 kDa. Although eukaryotic dUTPases exhibit extensive similarity and there are five amino acid motifs that are common to all currently known dUTPase enzymes, the sequence of the protozoan gene differs significantly from its eukaryotic counterparts. None of the characteristic motifs were readily identifiable and the sequence encoded a larger polypeptide. However, the products of the reaction were dUMP and PPi, competition experiments with other deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates showed that the reaction is specific for dUTP, and the protozoan gene complemented dUTPase deficiency in Escherichia coli. The gene is of single copy
