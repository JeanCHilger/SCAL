Dose-dependent reduction of cerebral blood flow during rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human sensorimotor cortex. Rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was used to stimulate the primary sensorimotor cortex in six healthy volunteers while regional changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) were simultaneously measured by means of positron emission tomography. A figure-eight TMS coil (Cadwell Corticoil) was positioned, using frameless stereotaxy, over the probabilistic location of the left primary sensorimotor cortex, and a series of brief 10-Hz trains of TMS was delivered at subthreshold intensity during each of six 60-s scans. The scans differed in the number of trains delivered, namely 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 trains/scan, respectively. In the left primary sensorimotor cortex, CBF covaried significantly and negatively with the number of stimulus trains. These CBF decreases may reflect TMS-induced activation of local inhibitory mechanisms known to play a role in TMS-related phenomena, such as the electromyographic silent period.
