Myocardial perfusion imagings in acute coronary syndromes. Stress myocardial perfusion imaging(MPI) is one of the most important clinical tools for the evaluation of chronic coronary artery disease. In acute coronary syndromes (ACS), resting MPI was applied in several emergency hospitals in Japan for the purpose of differential diagnosis, estimation of area at risk or myocardial stunning. It was also reported that the severity and the poor prognostic outcome could be predicted using myocardial fatty acid imaging in patients with ACS. However, benefits and clinical utilities of MPI in ACS remains still under clinical investigation with cost-effective aspect.
