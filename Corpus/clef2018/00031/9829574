Cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with frontotemporal dementia. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a dementia syndrome characterized by peculiar behavioral changes arising from frontotemporal involvement and distinct from Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this study was to elucidate the specific patterns in cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with FTD and to compare them with the patterns in patients with AD and normal elderly subjects using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and PET.Twenty-one patients with a clinical diagnosis of FTD [mean age 67.0 +/- 7.0 yr, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score 18.7 +/- 5.7], 21 age-, sex- and dementia-severity-matched patients with probable AD (mean age 66.9 +/- 7.1 yr, MMSE score 20.2 +/- 5.5) and 21 age- and sex-matched normal control subjects (mean age 66.8 +/- 5.7 yr) were studied. The cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglc) was measured with FDG and PET. Absolute measures of regional CMRglc were compared among the three groups. One-way ANOVA and the posthoc Tukey HSD test were used for statistical analyses.In the FTD group, CMRglc was preserved only in the left cerebellum, right sensorimotor area and occipital lobes. The CMRglc was significantly lower in the FTD group as opposed to the AD group in the hippocampi, orbital gyri, anterior temporal lobes, anterior cingulate gyri, basal ganglia, thalami, middle and superior frontal gyri and left inferior frontal gyrus.Although metabolic abnormality in FTD is predominant in the frontal and anterior temporal lobes and the subcortical structures, it is more widespread than has been previously stressed. These findings document an FTD-specific cerebral involvement and facilitate differential diagnosis of degenerative dementias.
