Imaging of dopamine transporters with iodine-123-FP-CIT SPECT in healthy controls and patients with Parkinson's disease. Several SPECT studies reported decreased striatal 123I-N-omega-fluoropropyl-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodoph enyl)nortropane ([123I]FP-CIT) binding in patients with Parkinson's disease. For application in routine clinical studies, information on the reliability and reproducibility of the [123I]FP-CIT SPECT technique is critical. This study reports on the reliability and reproducibility of [I23I]FP-CIT SPECT in healthy control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease using two different analysis protocols: the conventional region of interest (ROI) protocol and a newly developed, fully automatic, operator-independent volume of interest (VOI) protocol.We performed repeated [123I]FP-CIT SPECT scans in 6 healthy control subjects and 10 patients with Parkinson's disease to measure scan-to-scan variations. Scintigraphic data were analyzed 3 hr after injection of the radiotracer.In controls, the mean test/retest for the ratio of the striatal-to-nonspecific [123I]FP-CIT uptake were (3.79 +/- 0.67/3.82 +/- 0.74) and (4.16 +/- 0.70/4.08 +/- 0.97) for the ROI and VOI technique, respectively. No significant differences were measured between test/retest studies. The mean test/retest variability for the ROI technique was low (7.25%) with excellent reliability (rho = 0.99). In addition, the mean test/retest variability for the VOI technique was also low (7.47%) with very high reliability (rho = 0.95). In Parkinson's disease patients, we found mean test/retest for the striatal-to-nonspecific [123I]FP-CIT ratio of (1.78 +/- 0.23/1.79 +/- 0.25) and (1.83 +/- 0.31/1.85 +/- 0.35) using the ROI and VOI technique, respectively. Also in patients, these results did not differ significantly between test/retest studies. The mean test/retest variability for the ROI technique was low (7.90%) with excellent reliability (rho = 1.00). In addition, the mean test/retest variability for the VOI technique was also low (7.36%) with high reliability (rho = 0.96).Reliable and reproducible results were obtained with the ROI, as well as the VOI technique, for the analysis of striatal dopamine transporters with [123I]FP-CIT SPECT in healthy controls and Parkinson's disease patients. The use of an operator-independent method will be a great advantage in routine clinical studies.
