Autoradiography of neurotransmitter receptors in whole human brain hemisphere sections. Autoradiography is one of our most important tools to gain knowledge about neurotransmitter-receptors playing a key-role in information transmission between neurons. Autoradiography, in its most sophisticated form, is performed on whole human hemispheric sections. The main objective of the authors is to present this application of autoradiography. This in vitro method produces images with high spatial resolution that enable us to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the regional distribution of the receptors under study. With this technique both the different receptor systems in various physiological and pathological conditions of the brain and the pharmacological parameters of the radioligand, itself, used for a given investigation can be analysed. As a consequence, the results of autoradiography can be successfully used in drug development and trial, brain research and, indirectly, in the every day practice of physicians (diagnosis, differentialdiagnosis, therapy). Autoradiography plays an important role in the validation of in vivo techniques (positron emission tomography, single photon emission tomography) and results in a more complex (in vivo and in vitro) insight into the neurochemical organisation of the brain.
