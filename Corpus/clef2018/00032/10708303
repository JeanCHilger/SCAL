2Beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4- and 2-[18F]fluoromethylphenyl)tropanes: specific probes for in vivo quantification of central dopamine transporter sites. Dopamine reuptake transporter binding kinetics of 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-[18F]fluoromethylphenyl)tropane (p-FWIN) and 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(2-[18F]fluoromethylphenyl)tropane (o-FWIN) were determined in vervet monkeys using positron emission tomography (PET). Ligand localization was rapid and specific to the striatum with kinetic estimates comparable with those of 11C-labeled WIN 35,428 (CWIN). Binding was more specific with p-FWIN than with CWIN or o-FWIN. The relatively longer half-life of the 18F radiolabel enabled longer acquisition times with p-FWIN, resulting in less variability in the kinetic estimates.
