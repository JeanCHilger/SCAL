Functional imaging of brain areas involved in the processing of coherent and incoherent wide field-of-view visual motion. The brain areas involved in processing wide field-of-view (FOV) coherent and incoherent visual stimuli were studied using positron emission tomography (PET). The brains of nine subjects were scanned as they viewed texture patterns moving in the roll plane. Five visual conditions were used: (1) coherent clockwise (CW) wide-FOV (>100 degrees) roll motion (2) coherent counter-clockwise (CCW) wide-FOV roll motion
