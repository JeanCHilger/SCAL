Infarct size and recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias after defibrillator implantation. Infarct size as determined by perfusion imaging is an independent predictor of mortality after implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (VA). However, its value as a predictor of VA recurrence and hospitalisation after ICD implantation is unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether infarct size as determined by perfusion imaging can help to identify patients who are at high risk for recurrence of VA and hospitalisation after ICD implantation. We studied 56 patients with CAD and life-threatening VA. Before ICD implantation, all patients underwent a uniform study protocol including a thallium-201 stress-redistribution perfusion study. A defect score as a measurement of infarct size was calculated using a 17-segment 5-point scoring system. Study endpoints during follow-up were documented episodes of appropriate anti-tachycardia pacing and/or shocks for VA and cardiac hospitalisation for electrical storm (defined as three or more appropriate ICD interventions within 24 h), heart failure or angina. After a mean follow-up of 470+/-308 days, 22 patients (39%) had recurrences of VA. In univariate analysis, predictors for recurrence were: (a) ventricular tachycardia (VT) as the initial presenting arrhythmia (86% vs 59% for patients without ICD therapy, P=0.04), (b) treatment with beta-blockers (36% vs 68%, P=0.03) and (c) a defect score (DS) > or = 20 (64% vs 32%, P=0.03). In multivariate analysis, VT as the presenting arrhythmia (chi2=5.51, P=0.02) and a DS > or = 20 (chi2=4.22, P=0.04) remained independent predictors. Cardiac hospitalisation was more frequent in patients with a DS > or = 20 (44% vs 13% for patients with DS < 20, P=0.015) and this was particularly due to more frequent hospitalisations for electrical storm (24% vs 3% for patients with DS < 20, P=0.037). The extent of scarring determined by perfusion imaging can separate patients with CAD into high- and low-risk groups for recurrence of VA and cardiac hospitalisation after ICD implantation.
