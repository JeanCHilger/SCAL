Clinical imaging of cancer metastasis. Tumour imaging is an essential part of the practice of oncology, with a crucial role in screening programmes and in diagnosis and staging of established disease. Furthermore, the assessment of tumour size by imaging, usually with computer tomography (CT) scanning, is a key component in determining the tumour response to therapy both in clinical trials and in daily oncology practice. Techniques such as CT, ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide high resolution anatomical images with detailed structural information. However, these imaging modalities yield limited functional information on the tumour tissues and often cannot distinguish residual disease from non-viable or necrotic tumour masses, nor can they detect minimal residual disease. In contrast, radiopharmaceutical imaging and, in particular, positron emission tomography (PET) can give some functional information about the underlying tissues. The possibility of refining these techniques and also the emergence of newer imaging modalities that can detect changes in cancers at the physiological, cellular or molecular levels, gives rise to the notion that these methods will have implications for drug development strategies and also future clinical management. In this review, we briefly discuss the current role of imaging in clinical practice, describe some of the advances in imaging modalities currently undergoing evaluation, and speculate on the future role of these techniques in developmental therapeutics programmes.
