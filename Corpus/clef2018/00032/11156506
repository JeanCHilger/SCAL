Surgical treatment of intractable epilepsy in children: indication for resective surgery. Good surgical outcome can be expected for intractable epilepsy in children by resective surgery when a focal cortical abnormality is demonstrated by neuroimaging studies such as MRI, SPECT, and PET. Improvement in behavioral and cognitive development can be expected with seizure cessation after surgery. Early surgical intervention for intractable epilepsy in children is considered a safe and effective choice of treatment to avoid cognitive delay and learning disability.
