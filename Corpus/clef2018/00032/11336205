Multicriterion cross-entropy minimization approach to positron emission tomographic imaging. A multicriterion cross-entropy minimization approach to positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging is described. An unexplored multicriterion cross-entropy optimization algorithm based on weighted-sum scalarization is used to solve this problem. The efficacy of the algorithm is compared with that of the single-criterion optimization algorithm and the convolution backprojection method for image reconstruction from computer-generated projection data and Siemens PET scanner data. The algorithms described have been implemented on a PIII/686 microcomputer.
