The clinical use of imaging techniques with exercise testing. The addition of nuclear imaging techniques to basic exercise electrocardiography (ECG) has provided significant diagnostic and prognostic information in the evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease. During the last decade, new classes of isotopes (technetium-and rubidium-based perfusion agents) and refinements in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) have become better accepted. These new studies have added to the diagnostic armamentarium available to physicians, but at considerable costs with an estimated 4.8 million procedures performed this year. Nuclear imaging techniques can assess myocardial blood flow (perfusion imaging) or function (ventriculography). Another imaging modality, stress echocardiography, has also achieved widespread acceptance with clinical guidelines for its use published in 1997. This review addresses these imaging techniques in diagnostic evaluation of the patient with suspected coronary artery disease.
