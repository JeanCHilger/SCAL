High resolution SPECT in small animal research. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is a technique used to assess physiological and biochemical processes under in vivo conditions. SPECT generates tomographic images from blood flow, glucose metabolism and receptor characteristics using radioactively labelled substances. This paper reviews the state of the art of in vivo imaging of laboratory animals in modified human and dedicated animal SPECT scanners. SPECT cameras with special collimators currently reach spatial resolutions up to 1 mm and sensitivities of about 1000 cps/MBq, allowing observation of receptor activity concentration changes in the pico-mole range. The time resolution of such cameras strongly depends on the pharmacological behaviour of the tracer and can range from several minutes to hours. Within these limits the functional characterization of many processes is possible. SPECT also offers the possibility to set up dynamic study protocols and repeated measurements of the same animal. This technique reduces the need for sacrificing animals, as was commonly practiced before the development of animal cameras. Animal SPECT gives the opportunity to monitor physiological and biochemical processes in animals in vivo, without interfering with the system under observation, and may become a valuable adjunct to the instrumentation (autoradiography, in vitro methods) of animal research.
