FDG PET studies during treatment: prediction of therapy outcome in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Positron emission tomography (PET) provides metabolic information of tissues in vivo. The purpose of this study was to assess the value of PET with 2-[(18) F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in prediction of therapy outcome (tumor response, survival, and locoregional control) in locally advanced HNSCC.Between 1993 and 1999 47 patients underwent PET before (PET(1)) and after (PET(2)) 1 to 3 weeks of radical treatment with evaluation of metabolic rate (MR) and standardized uptake value (SUV) of FDG. All patients received radiotherapy, and 10 also received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Median follow-up time was 3.3 years.Low and high MR FDG at PET(2), with median value as cutoff, was associated with complete remission in 96% and 62% (p =.007), with 5-year overall survival in 72% and 35% (p =.0042) and with local control in 96% and 55% (p =.002), respectively.FDG PET in the early phase of treatment of HNSCC is associated with tumor response, survival, and local control.
