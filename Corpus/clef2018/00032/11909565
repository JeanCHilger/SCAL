Usefulness of dobutamine Tc-99m sestamibi-gated single-photon emission computed tomography for prediction of left ventricular ejection fraction outcome after coronary revascularization for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging allows analysis of myocardial perfusion and assessment of baseline global and regional left ventricular (LV) function and their changes during low-dose dobutamine infusion. The study examined whether the changes in LV ejection fraction induced by dobutamine and evaluated using technetium-99m sestamibi- gated SPECT predict the evolution of ejection fraction after revascularization in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Thirty-seven patients underwent resting and dobutamine nitrate-enhanced sestamibi-gated SPECT before revascularization and baseline-resting sestamibi gated SPECT after intervention to assess global functional changes. A postrevascularization improvement in ejection fraction > or =5 U was defined as significant. At follow-up, ejection fraction increased significantly in 19 patients. According to receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, an increase in ejection fraction > or =5 U during dobutamine was the optimal cutoff value for predicting a significant postrevascularization improvement, with 79% sensitivity, 78% specificity, and 78% accuracy. A significant correlation was found between dobutamine and postrevascularization ejection fraction (r = 0.85 p <0.0001). The increase in ejection fraction during dobutamine is a good predictor of an improvement in ejection fraction after revascularization. This represents another important diagnostic contribution obtained using gated SPECT imaging for the assessment of myocardial viability in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
