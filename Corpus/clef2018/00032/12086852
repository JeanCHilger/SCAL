Positron emission tomography imaging analysis of G2A as a negative modifier of lymphoid leukemogenesis initiated by the BCR-ABL oncogene. G2A is a lymphocyte-expressed G protein-coupled receptor whose genetic ablation results in the development of autoimmunity. Using HSV-TK reporter gene directed positron emission tomography (PET), we demonstrate that prior to any indication of the onset of illness, mice transplanted with BCR-ABL transduced G2A-deficient bone marrow harbor expanded populations of leukemic cells compared to recipients of wild-type bone marrow. The target cell type and anatomical locations of leukemia development are indistinguishable in animals transplanted with G2A+/+ or G2A-/- cells. Shorter disease latency in the G2A-deficient background is associated with an increased rate of cellular expansion. PET can be successfully applied to the temporal and spatial analysis of Bcr-Abl driven leukemic progression and should have utility for the study of other leukemias and lymphomas.
