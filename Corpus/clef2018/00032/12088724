Radiosynthesis and mouse brain distribution studies of [11C] CP-126,998: a PET ligand for in vivo study of acetylcholinesterase. The selective, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor 5,7-Dihydro-7-methyl-3- [2-[1-(phenylmethyl]-4-piperidinyl]ethyl]-6H-pyrrolo[3,2-f]-1,2-benzisoxazol3-6-one (CP-126,998) was labeled with C-11 iodomethane via base-promoted alkylation of the lactam nitrogen. [11C] CP-126,998 was synthesized in good radiochemical yield (13-29% non-decay corrected) and high specific radioactivity (177-418 GBq/micromol). In vivo mouse biodistribution studies reveal [11C] CP-126,998 to localize preferentially in striatal tissue, a region known to be rich in acetylcholinesterase. Competitive blocking studies using a variety of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (diisopropylfluorophosphate, tacrine, CP-118,954) verified the specificity of the PET radiotracer for brain acetylcholinesterase.
