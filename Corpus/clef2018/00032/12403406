Fabricated hyalS micropatterns and surface guidance of NCTC 2544 continuous cell line: an in vitro study. Surface topography is important in establishing tissue organisation adjacent to implants, smooth surfaces generally being associated with fibrous encapsulation. By virtue of its large hydrated molecular volume and its capacity to form molecular matrix, hyaluronic acid can expand the interfibrillar collagen spaces to allow the movement of cells, although it can also hamper their locomotion. Low molecular-weight hyaluronan can also stimulate cell proliferation, especially at low concentrations. The aim of the present work was to evaluate in vitro the growth and migratory behaviour of NCTC 2544 keratinocytes cultured on different materials microstructured with hyaluronic acid or sulfated hyaluronic acid to assess the possibility of using these devices in the repair process of soft tissues. Ultrastructural morphological analyses, morphometric evaluations and detection of cytoskeletal elements were performed. Our observations provide evidence that micrometer-size parallel grooves of hyaluronic acid can influence cell growth behaviour since cells seeded onto the microstructured substrate arranged themselves according to a shape and an orientation that clearly reflected the chemotropism exerted on them by the two forms of acid. These data also highlight the importance of accurate microtexture fabrication. We intend to follow up these in vitro studies with in vivo experimental applications using PET and gelatin substrates structured with HyalS to evaluate wound healing responses, and to extend our investigations of the cytoskeletal modifications induced by different microstructures.
