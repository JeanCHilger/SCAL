Assessment of myocardial viability using coronary zero flow pressure after successful angioplasty in patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction. To investigate the relation between coronary flow reserve (CFR), coronary zero flow pressure (Pzf), and residual myocardial viability in patients with acute myocardial infarction.Prospective study.Primary care hospital.27 consecutive patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction.F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) was used in 27 patients who underwent successful intervention within 12 hours of onset of a first acute anterior myocardial infarction. Within three days before discharge they had < 25% stenosis in the culprit lesion as determined by angiography 24 (3) days after acute myocardial infarction. Pzf and the slope index of the flow-pressure relation (SIFP) were calculated from the simultaneously recorded aortic pressure and coronary flow velocity signals at peak hyperaemia.%FDG was quantified by comparing FDG uptake in the infarct myocardium with FDG uptake in the normal myocardium.There was a correlation between %FDG and CFR, where y = -1.477x + 62.517, r = -0.072 (NS). There was also a correlation between %FDG and SIFP, where y = -0.975x + 60.542, r = -0.045 (NS), and a significant correlation between %FDG and Pzf, where y = -0.98x + 85.108, r = -0.696 (p < 0.001).CFR does not correlate with FDG-PET at the time of postreperfusion evaluation of residual myocardial viability. The parameter that correlates best with residual myocardial viability is Pzf and this may be a useful index for predicting patient prognosis.
