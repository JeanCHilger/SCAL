Bioartificial pancreas transplantation at prevascularized intermuscular space: effect of angiogenesis induction on islet survival. Bioartificial pancreas (BAP) transplantation offers a potential treatment of diabetes mellitus. The optimal site for BAP transplantation has not yet been established.To monitor the effect of induction of neovascularization at the intermuscular space on islet survival after allogenic transplantation of BAP.Angiogenesis was induced at the intermuscular space of diabetic Lewis rats by implanting a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) mesh bag, which enclosed a collagen sponge and biodegradable gelatin microspheres containing basic fibroblast growth factor. After confirmation of angiogenesis, BAP was prepared by mixing of 5% agarose with approximately 2,800 isolated rat (Sprague-Dawley) islets and transplanted into the prevascularized PET mesh bag.Neovascularization was observed in and around the PET mesh bag within 10 days after implantation as confirmed by macroscopic and microscopic examinations. In the presence of a collagen sponge, new blood vessels penetrated into the PET mesh bag and formed a vascular bed. After transplantation, normoglycemia was achieved in the rats within 3 days and maintained for >35 days. The rats gradually gained body weight, and the results of intravenous glucose tolerance test showed normal patterns of blood glucose clearance 1 month after transplantation.It can be concluded that the prevascularized PET mesh bag enabled transplanted BAP to survive and maintain function, thus indicating a potential site for BAP transplantation.
