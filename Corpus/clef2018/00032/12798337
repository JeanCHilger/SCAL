Synthesis of radiolabeled biphenylsulfonamide matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors as new potential PET cancer imaging agents. Novel matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor radiotracers, (S)-3-methyl-2-(2',3',4'-methoxybiphenyl-4-sulfonylamino)-butyric acid [(11)C]methyl ester (1a-c), (S)-3-methyl-2-(2',3',4'-fluorobiphenyl-4-sulfonylamino)-butyric acid [(11)C]methyl ester (1d-f), and (S)-3-methyl-2-(4'-nitrobiphenyl-4-sulfonylamino)-butyric acid [(11)C]methyl ester (1g), a series of substituted biphenylsulfonamide derivatives, have been synthesized for evaluation as new potential positron emission tomography (PET) cancer imaging agents.
