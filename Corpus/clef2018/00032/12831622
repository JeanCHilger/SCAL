Construction of vector of his-tagged cytoplasmic fragment of human toll like receptor 4 and its expression in E.coli. To construction of vector of his-tagged cytoplasmic fragment of human Toll like receptor 4 (hTLR4) and its expression in E.coli.hTLR4 cytoplasmic cDNA codon domain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into pET-DsbA2.0 plasmid expressing His-DsbA fusion protein. After being identified by the assay of restrictional enzyme and sequencing, His-Dsb A fusion proteins were induced with isopropy-beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and further purified.A fusion protein with molecular weight of 42 kd was obtained.hTLR4 which was constructed and expressed successfully under nondenaturing conditions provides a tool for further studies.
