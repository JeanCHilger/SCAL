Intact implicit memory in patients with frontal lobe lesions. Patients with frontal lobe lesions and control subjects were administered tests of word-stem completion priming. In this implicit memory test, subjects are first presented words (e.g. MOTEL, PARADE) in an incidental learning paradigm. Following word presentation, subjects are shown word stems (e.g. MOT, PAR) and asked to produce the first word that comes to mind. Patients with frontal lobe lesions exhibited normal levels of word-stem completion. These findings indicate that implicit memory can operate normally despite damage to the prefrontal cortex. The present results substantiate previous neuropsychological and positron emission tomography findings which indicate that word priming depends critically on posterior cortical areas.
