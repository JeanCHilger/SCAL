Positron emission tomography imaging-directed stereotactic neurosurgery. The diagnostic yield of stereotactic biopsies depends upon safely sampling the most representative regions of masses. Potentially, localization information presently available from CT and MR scans might be improved by considering regional levels of cerebral metabolism by PET. In 10 selected stereotactic biopsies of intracranial mass lesions, PET scans were obtained using the Siemens CTI system the Kelly-Goerss Compass system was used as the stereotactic development platform. PET-[18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) images provided clinically significant information by appropriately directing biopsy efforts when CT and MRI was inconclusive or misleading. PET-FDG images can be successfully incorporated into routine image-directed stereotactic surgery.
