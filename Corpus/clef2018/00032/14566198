In vivo neuroimaging correlates of the efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. The advent of neuroimaging technology has brought with it a deeper understanding of brain function and structure in health and psychiatric illness. This article overviews pertinent findings from neuroimaging studies in mood and anxiety disorders. Paroxetine is a particularly well-studied psychopharmacologic agent in this regard. The findings of neuroimaging studies of paroxetine will be placed into perspective for a better understanding of the interaction of this selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the brain that mediate clinical efficacy. When considered in the context of a burgeoning literature on neuroimaging research of the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders, the findings of paroxetine studies suggest a neurobiological explanation for the mechanisms whereby chronic administration of paroxetine affects neural systems involved in the pathophysiology of major depression and several anxiety disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and social anxiety disorder.
