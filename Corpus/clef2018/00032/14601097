Detection of recurrent oral squamous cell carcinoma by [18F]-2-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography: implications for prognosis and patient management. Patients with recurrent oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have a dismal prognosis and represent a therapeutic challenge. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan with [(18)F]-2-fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) can improve early cancer detection. The current study evaluates the prognostic value of [(18)F]FDG-PET scan in patients with recurrent OSCC.The authors studied 97 patients with previously resected OSCC who were restaged by PET scanning. Of the 97 patients, 64 had no evidence of clinical disease and 33 were suspected of having disease by imaging, clinical findings, or pathologic evaluation. The median follow-up period was 35.4 months after a PET scan. The end points included disease recurrence, a disease recurrence-free period 6 months after a PET scan, or death.The overall sensitivity of a PET scan did not exceed 90% and its specificity varied from 67% for local disease recurrence/second primaries to 99% for lymph node metastasis. Increased [(18)F]FDG uptake predicted increased hazard of death (hazard ratio: 6.83 P = 0.00034) and proved to be a highly predictive marker of disease status. A significant association was established for incremental standardized uptake values and 3-year patient survival (P=0.0089), indicating that intense glucose metabolism in the tumor is a negative marker of survival in recurrent OSCC. Overall, survival was longer in patients with a negative rather than a positive PET scan (P < 0.00001).PET scanning was found to be highly valuable for diagnosing OSCC recurrence in a postoperative setting. It provided prognostic information and played an important role in patient counseling and management.
