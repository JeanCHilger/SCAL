Results of multimodality roentgenoradiologic examination of patients with initial cerebrovascular insufficiency. Altogether 49 patients with the initial grade of cerebrovascular insufficiency were examined. The investigation was carried out using magnetic resonance tomography (MRT), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In 39 (79.6%) cases, different lesions of the basic cerebral arteries, including mild atherosclerotic stenosis and kinking, were revealed. Analysis of the results of MRA showed that 9 (18.3%) patients had an abnormal structure of the circle of Willis. This should be taken into account while the hemodynamic importance of lesions of the cerebral arteries is estimated. 21 (142.8%) patients had craniovertebral dysplasia and 10 suffered from disturbances of venous circulation. Perfusion tomoscintigraphic examination discovered hypoperfusion of the brain tissue in all the cases and the lowered cerebrovascular reserve during the orthostatic test in 29 (59.1%) patients.all the above-indicated noninvasive tests proved to be reliable for assessment of brain circulation in the initial grade of cerebrovascular insufficiency and for decision and control of the treatment.
