Biological distribution of 131I-HAb18F(ab')2 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Before 131I-HAb18F(ab')2 administration, 24 cases of mid-term or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) were given Lugol's Liquid to block the thyroid gland, and submitted to hepatic colloid imaging. The cases were randomly divided into 3 groups. Then 131I-HAb18F(ab')2 was injected into the target hepatic artery with doses of 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 mCi/kg, respectively. At the followed 10, 48, 96 and 192 hours, 131I-HAb18F(ab')2 distribution in human body was acquired by whole body dynamic image with Single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT). The results showsed that 131I-HAb18F(ab')2 in tumor tissue was significantly higher than that in normal liver tissue and other organs. This difference became obvious as time passed. 131I-HAb18F(ab')2 is stable in human body and it can combine with HCC tissue specifically. So it is a new medicine deserving further research for the treatment of HCC.
