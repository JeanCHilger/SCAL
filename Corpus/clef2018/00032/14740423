The use of (18F)fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the assessment of large vessel vasculitis. FDG-PET scan has recently been introduced as a diagnostic means to assess large vessel involvement in giant cell arteritis (GCA). Its use in Takayasu arteritis, idiopathic periaortitis and multifocal fibrosclerosis--although more limited, due to the relative rarity of these conditions compared to GCA--is discussed as well.
