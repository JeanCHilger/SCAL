Significance of extension of exercise-induced ischemia toward apex of left ventricle. The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of extension of exercise-induced ischemia toward apex of left ventricle.After injections of technetium-99m tetrofosmin at peak ergometer exercise and thallium-201 at 3 min post-exercise, dual-isotope single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were obtained simultaneously with cross-talk compensation using triple-energy window in 70 patients (65.8+/-9.5 years) with angiographically proven ischemic heart disease. The left ventricle was divided into a total of 18 areas in 3 levels of apical, middle, basal, and the extent and localization of ischemia to long axis of left ventricle were measured at peak exercise and 3 min into the recovery.Of 57 patients with exercise-induced reversible ischemia, in 25 patients with the ischemia in 2 levels to long axis of left ventricle, the ischemia extended mainly to the middle and basal levels (p<0.0001) and was localized during recovery mainly in the basal level (p<0.0005). In 21 patients with the ischemia in all 3 levels, the ischemia was localized during recovery mainly to the middle and basal levels (p<0.05). The persistence of ischemia in apex at post-exercise reflected the delay of recovery from ischemia on the whole of left ventricle and was related to the enlargement of resting end-diastolic volume of left ventricle as compared to the quick recovery of ischemia in apex (p<0.0005 and p<0.05, respectively).Although the ischemia recovers earliest in the peripheral apical level within exercise-induced ischemic territory, the delay of recovery from the ischemia in the apical level may be related to the development of heart failure, independent of intensity of occurred ischemia during exercise.
