Bone and gallium scans in postradiotherapy osteonecrosis of the jaw. The role of radiographic and nuclear imaging in evaluation of postradiotherapy osteonecrosis of the jaw was studied. Patients who had received imaging at diagnosis and following hyperbaric oxygen therapy were studied. Radiographic changes did not correlate with the clinical status of patients. All bone scans were abnormal at the time of diagnosis of osteonecrosis, but remained abnormal following changes in the clinical status of patients. Thus, the bone scan may aid in the detection of osteonecrosis. Gallium uptake did not aid i diagnosis, but did correlate with clinical findings following treatment. Persisting positive gallium scans may indicate the need for surgery following hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
