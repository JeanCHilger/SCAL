Preoperative localization of parathyroid glands. Use of MRI, scintigraphy, and image fusion. Minimally invasive resection of hyperfunctional parathyroid glands is an alternative to open surgery. However, it requires a precise preoperative localization. This study evaluated the diagnostic use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, parathyroid scintigraphy, and consecutive image fusion.17 patients (9 women, 8 men age: 29-72 yearsIn 14/17 patients, a single parathyroid adenoma was found. There were 3 cases with hyperplastic glands. MRI detected 10 (71%), scintigraphy 12 (86%) adenomas. Both modalities detected 1/3 patients with hyperplasia. Image fusion improved the anatomical assignment of the 13 scintigraphic foci in five patients and was helpful in the interpretation of inconclusive MR-findings in two patients.Both MRI and (99m)Tc-MIBI scintigraphy sensitively detect parathyroid adenomas but are less reliable in case of hyperplastic glands. In case of a scintigraphic focus, image fusion considerably improves its topographic assignment. Furthermore, it facilitates the evaluation of inconclusive MRI findings.
