Role of skeletal scintigraphy in advanced retinoblastomas. To document the incidence of skeletal metastases exclusively in advanced cases of retinoblastoma and to rationalize the use of preoperative skeletal scintigraphy in such patients.Preoperative bone scans of 36 consecutive patients with advanced retinoblastoma who underwent skeletal scintigraphy during 1998 to 2003 were analyzed retrospectively. Bone scans were classified as: Grade 1 (high probability scan for skeletal metastases), Grade 2 (equivocal malignant or benign abnormalities), or Grade 3 (normal or certainly benign lesions).Grade 1 scan was found in 3 (8.33%) patients bone metastases were confirmed by additional investigations. Grade 2 scan was found in 5 (13.88%) patientsRoutine preoperative bone scan is not justified in patients with locally advanced retinoblastoma. Bone scan should only be performed in patients with documented extraocular metastatic disease.
