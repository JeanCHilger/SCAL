Role of the cerebellum in implicit motor skill learning: a PET study. To depict neural substrates of implicit motor learning, regional cerebral blood flow was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) in 13 volunteers in the rest condition and during performance of a unimanual two-ball rotation task. Subjects rotated two balls in a single hand a slow rotation (0.5 Hz) was followed by two sessions requiring as rapid rotation as possible. The process was repeated four times by a single hand (Block 1) and then by the opposite hand (Block 2). One group of volunteers began with the right hand (n = 7), and the other with the left (n = 6). Performance was assessed by both quickness and efficiency of movements. The former was assessed with the maximum number of rotation per unit time, and the latter with the electromyographic activity under constant speed of the movement. Both showed learning transfer from the right hand to the left hand. Activation of cerebrum and cerebellum varied according to hand. Activation common to both hands occurred in the bilateral dorsal premotor cortex and parasagittal cerebellum, right inferior frontal gyms, left lateral cerebellum and thalamus, supplementary motor area, and cerebellar vermis. The left lateral cerebellum showed the most prominent activation on the first trial of the novel task, and hence may be related the early phase of learning, or "what to do" learning. Left parasagittal cerebellum activity diminished with training both in first and second blocks, correlating inversely with task performance. This region may therefore be involved in later learning or "how to do" learning. The activity of these regions was less prominent with prior training than without it. Thus the left cerebellar hemisphere may be related to learning transfer across hands.
