Extent of myocardial scarring on nonstress delayed-contrast-enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging correlates directly with degrees of resting regional dysfunction in chronic ischemic heart disease. Hyper-enhancement on delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) is a marker of irreversible myocardial injury. Both reversible and irreversible ischemically injured regions of myocardium develop reductions in systolic function compared with unaffected regions. This study evaluated whether there is a relationship between myocardial hyper-enhancement from remote scarring on DE-MRI and the degree of myocardial circumferential shortening (%CS) as determined with dynamic MRI tissue tagging (TAG-MRI) in the setting of chronic ischemic heart disease (CIHD).Thirty-five patients with CIHD and 8 control patients underwent nonstress, resting DE-MRI and TAG-MRI. A total of 168 CIHD and 96 control segments from the basal- and middle-thirds of the left ventricle (LV) were selected to achieve a balanced test set. With a 16-segment model, segmental myocardial scarring was graded on the basis of the amount of hyper-enhancement on DE-MRI. With TAG-MRI images, segmental %CS was calculated.Patients with CIHD had lower LV ejection fraction compared with the control patients (28% vs 67%). The %CS of normal segments was notably different from %CS of CIHD segments, regardless of the presence or absence of myocardial hyper-enhancement on DE-MRI. Among the CIHD segments, however, %CS correlated inversely with the amount of myocardial hyper-enhancement from scarring (P <.0001, r = -0.38).On cardiac MRI for CIHD, myocardial hyper-enhancement correlates inversely with %CS, supporting the direct relationship between the amount of remote myocardial scarring determined with nonstress DE-MRI and baseline resting functional impairment.
