Influence of infarct-zone viability detected by rest Tc-99m sestamibi gated SPECT on left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction treated by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the acute phase. The purpose of this study was to assess the value of technetium 99m sestamibi gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in predicting the evolution of left ventricular volumes in patients treated successfully in the acute phase of a myocardial infarction (MI).Twenty-nine patients with acute MI and early percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) were included in this study. A rest Tc-99m sestamibi electrocardiography (ECG)-gated SPECT study was performed 21 +/- 5 days after PTCA. The myocardial perfusion index was calculated by use of a semiautomatic sectorial analysis. All patients had contrast ventriculography performed during the acute phase and 6 months later. The patients were separated into two groups according to the absence (group I, n = 21) or presence (group II, n = 8) of end-systolic enlargement. The perfusion index in the infarct sectors was -2.29 +/- 2.90 SD in group I and -6.40 +/- 2.85 SD in group II ( P < .01). With a cutoff value of -2.46 SD, the sensitivity and specificity of Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT for the prediction of end-systolic volume enlargement were 100% and 62%, respectively. When the functional data from ECG-gated acquisitions were added, specificity increased to 86%.Despite successful PTCA in the acute phase of MI, an increase in end-systolic volume was observed at 6 months in 28% of patients. Tc-99m sestamibi ECG-gated SPECT performed 3 weeks after the acute phase could predict this enlargement with a high accuracy.
