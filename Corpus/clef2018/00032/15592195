Observer variability in the evaluation of dual-isotope Tl-201/Tc-99m sestamibi rest/stress myocardial perfusion SPECT in men and women with known or suspected stable angina pectoris. Observer variability of dual-isotope myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with single photon emission computed tomography has rarely been investigated. The aim of our study was to evaluate the interpretive reproducibility with this technique.We report on 507 patients with known or suspected stable angina who were studied before coronary angiography. A 1-day thallium 201/technetium 99m sestamibi rest/stress MPI protocol was used. MPI was interpreted by 2 independent observers without knowledge of clinical data, using a 20-segment scoring model. By consensus, the overall rate of abnormal MPI was 49% (59% in men and 34% in women). The interobserver agreement for the whole group (kappa = 0.85) and for men and women separately (kappa = 0.86 and 0.82, respectively) was excellent with regard to the overall diagnosis (normal, reversible, or fixed defects) as well as left anterior descending and left circumflex artery vascular territories (kappa = 0.85 and 0.82, respectively). However, in the right coronary artery territory, agreement was excellent in men (kappa = 0.83) but moderate in women (kappa = 0.57).In a relatively large group of men and women with stable angina pectoris, interpretive reproducibility (overall and individual vessel diagnosis) was excellent, except in the right coronary artery territory of women, in which it was moderate.
