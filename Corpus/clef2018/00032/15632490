Functional neuroimaging and cognitive rehabilitation for people with traumatic brain injury. Cognitive deficits are a common consequence of traumatic brain injury. Although such deficits are amenable to rehabilitation, methods for individualizing cognitive interventions are still unrefined. Functional neuroimaging methods such as positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging are emerging as possible technologies for measuring and monitoring the cerebral consequences of plasticity associated with brain injury and for evaluating the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions. Functional neuroimaging may even enable more customized and efficient selection, design, or adaptation of individual cognitive rehabilitation programs. We review the current literature on functional neuroimaging after traumatic brain injury, relating these findings to cognitive rehabilitation. Overall, functional neuroimaging after traumatic brain injury has shown reliable differences in brain activity within several regions of frontal cortex, partly but not uniformly consistent with neuropsychological and structural findings in traumatic brain injury. We also outline a number of promising research opportunities for applying functional neuroimaging in traumatic brain injury settings, along with associated challenges.
