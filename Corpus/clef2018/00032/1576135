Kinetics and dynamics of acute rejection after heterotopic heart transplantation. Right cervical, heterotopic heart transplantation was performed in 18 mongrel dogs. Study design was based on three different groups (n = 3 x 6). Standard immunosuppression consisted of triple drug therapy in all dogs. Groups II and III received high dose steroids during acute rejection. In group III the native hearts of previous recipients (groups I and II) were used as donors for heterotopic transplantation ("domino" principle). The hearts were examined by daily transmural biventricular biopsies and graded according to Billingham classification. Cytoimmunologic monitoring (n = 345 activation index from peripheral and coronary sinus blood) and fast Fourier transformation ECG (n = 80
