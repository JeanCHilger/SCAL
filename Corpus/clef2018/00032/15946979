Computed tomography and 18F-FDG positron emission tomography for therapy control of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients: when do we really need FDG-PET? The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) and [(18)F]fluoro-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for prediction of progression-free survival of Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients after completion of therapy.CT and FDG-PET were performed in 40 HD, 17 indolent NHL and 44 aggressive NHL patients (29 women, 72 men aged 41+/-14 years) in a median of 2 months after therapy. Progression-free survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Independent prognostic factors were identified by means of Cox proportional hazards model.CT imaging results were progressive disease (PD) in five, stable disease (SD) in 57, and partial response (PR) or complete remission (CR) in 39 patients. FDG-PET suggested residual lymphoma in 24 patients. Three-year progression-free survival rates after exclusion of five PD patients were: 100% (PET negative CT: PR or CR), 81% (PET negativeAmong lymphoma patients with PR and SD on CT, FDG-PET discriminated those destined to progress into a low risk of < or =20% and a high risk for recurrence of > or =80%.
