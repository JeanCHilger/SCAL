Neuroimaging studies of violence and antisocial behavior. The neurobiological basis of violence and antisocial behavior is poorly understood. Lesion studies have implicated the frontal and temporal lobes in such phenomena. Recent neuroimaging studies have provided more detailed information on the neurobiological correlates of violence and antisocial behavior. Moreover, the results of such imaging studies extend findings from prior lesion studies. These results suggest that violent and antisocial behavior is associated with disruptions in frontotemporal neural systems. This article reviews the neuroimaging literature on violence and antisocial behavior and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the different methods that have been used in such studies. The author reviews findings from cerebral psychophysiology studies (electroencephalographic studies and evoked potentials), as well as from studies using positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The article concludes with a discussion of useful directions for future research. It is clear that the use of neuroimaging methods in combination offers the greatest promise for progress in the understanding of the neural basis of violence and antisocial behavior.
