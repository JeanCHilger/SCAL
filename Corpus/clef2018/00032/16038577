Quinone-sensitized steady-state photolysis of acetophenone oximes under aerobic conditions: kinetics and product studies. Oxidation of oximes via photosensitized electron transfer (PET) results in the formation of the corresponding ketones as the major product via oxime radical cations and iminoxyl radicals. The influence of electron-releasing and electron-accepting substituents on these reactions was studied. The observed substituent effect strongly supports formation of iminoxyl radicals from the oximes via an electron transfer-proton transfer sequence rather than direct hydrogen atom abstraction. Correlation of the relative conversion of the oximes with Hammett parameters shows that radical effects dominate for the meta-substituted acetophenone oximes (rho(rad)/rho(pol) = 5.4 r2 = 0.93), whereas the para-substituted oximes are influenced almost equally by radical and ionic effects (rho(rad)/rho(pol) = -1.1
