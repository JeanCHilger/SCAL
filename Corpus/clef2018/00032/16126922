Myocardial perfusion after angioplasty in patients suspected of having single-vessel coronary artery disease: improvement detected at rest-stress first-pass perfusion MR imaging--initial experience. To prospectively assess myocardial perfusion before and after successful intervention in patients suspected of having single-vessel coronary artery disease by using a steady-state free precession (SSFP) perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequence.Local ethics committee approval and informed consent were obtained. Rest-stress perfusion MR imaging studies were performed in 18 patients with coronary artery disease (12 men, six women mean age, 58.6 years +/- 13.6 [standard deviation]In the area of the stenosed vessel, MPRI was 1.04 +/- 0.24 before treatment and 2.18 +/- 0.57 several days afterward (P < .001). In remote areas, MPRI was 2.42 +/- 0.44. In the stent group, MPRI increased by 156%, from 0.99 +/- 0.20 before stent placement to 2.53 +/- 0.53 after (P < .001). Similarly, in the PTCA only group, MPRI increased by 72%, from 1.08 +/- 0.27 before PTCA to 1.87 +/- 0.39 after (P < .001). At follow-up in patients without recurring chest pain, MPRI was 2.14 +/- 0.37 in the area of the treated artery and 2.29 +/- 0.47 in remote areas (P = .06).The MPRI, derived from rest-stress examinations, can provide information on success of interventional procedures in stenosed coronary arteries.
