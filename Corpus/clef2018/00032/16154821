Functional imaging techniques for evaluation of sarcomas. Sarcomas are often characterised by significant histopathologic heterogeneity, both between and within tumours. This heterogeneity reflects physiologic, biochemical and genetic processes that are amenable to characterisation by functional imaging. Although anatomically based imaging modalities such as plain radiography, X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remain the primary diagnostic modalities for staging sarcomas, nuclear medicine approaches including gamma camera scintigraphy and positron emission tomography (PET) are being used increasingly to provide complementary information in specific clinical situations. These include biopsy guidance within anatomically complex masses, staging, therapeutic response assessment and evaluation of residual mass lesions after treatment. This review aims to address the range of nuclear medicine techniques available for evaluation of bone and soft tissue sarcomas. A subsequent review discusses the clinical application of these techniques with a particular focus on PET.
