Reversal of polarization in amidophosphines: neutral- and anionic-kappaP coordination vs. anionic-kappaP,N coordination and the formation of nickelaazaphosphiranes. Nickel(ii) chloride reacts with the bis(tert-butylamino)diazadiphosphetidine {Bu(t)(H)NP(micro-NBu(t))(2)PN(H)Bu(t)} to form trans-[{Bu(t)(H)NP(micro-NBu(t))(2)PN(H)Bu(t)}(2)NiCl(2)]. In solution and the solid-state each heterocyclic ligand coordinates nickel through one phosphorus atom only. For comparison the solid-state structure of the known trans-[NiCl(2)(PEt(3))(2)] was also determined and it was found that the two complexes have almost identical bond parameters about nickel. The nickel-amidophosphine complexes [{Bu(t)OP(micro-NBu(t))(2)PNBu(t)}NiCl(PBu(n)(3))], [(PBu(n)(3))ClNi{Bu(t)NP(micro-NBu(t))(2)PNBu(t)}NiCl(PBu(n)(3))], and [{Me(2)Si(micro-NBu(t))(2)PNBu(t)}NiCl(PBu(n)(3))] were synthesized and X-ray structurally characterized. In these mono- and di-nuclear nickel complexes the nickel ions are coordinated in pseudo square-planar fashions, by one trialkylphosphine ligand, one chloride ligand and one kappaP,N-coordinated amidophosphine moiety from tert-butylamido-substituted heterocycles. Attempts to create nickel complexes chelated in a kappa(2)P fashion by the o-phenylenediamine-tethered mono- and di-anionic 1-{Me(2)Si(micro-NBu(t))(2)PN} 2-{Me(2)Si(micro-NBu(t))(2)PNH}C(6)H(4) and 1,2-{Me(2)Si(micro-NBu(t))(2)PN}C(6)H(4), respectively, afforded instead [1,2-{Me(2)Si(micro-NBu(t))(2)PN}{Me(2)Si(micro-NBu(t))(2)PN}C(6)H(4)NiCl] and [1,2-{Me(2)Si(micro-NBu(t))(2)PN}{Me(2)Si(micro-NBu(t))(2)PN}C(6)H(4)Ni{PEt(3)}], each complex having kappaP,N and kappaP coordinated amidophosphine ligands.
