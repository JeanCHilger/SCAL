Image fusion of coronary tree and regional cardiac function image using multislice computed tomography. Although trials of image fusion, such as positron emission computed tomography and multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT), have already demonstrated clinical usefulness, fusion of the coronary artery image and functional image by MSCT alone has not been reported yet. Here, a new idea of data analysis is proposed in which both regional cardiac function and the responsible coronary arteries can be assessed by a fused image.The study group comprised 5 patients with coronary artery disease. At the first procedure, 3 dimensional (D) volume rendering coronary artery (3D-CTA) was extracted. At the second procedure, the systolic regional wall thickening was calculated and the color 3D functional surface map of systolic wall thickening (3D-SWT) was generated. At the final procedure, 3D-SWT was superimposed on the left ventricular surface with 3D-CTA using a transparency. In all 5 patients, image fusion of the coronary tree and cardiac function was correctly generated. Image fusion can be displayed as clear 3D images, offering better orientation to help assess both the coronary artery and regional function.Image fusion of coronary computed tomography angiography and the functional map by MSCT is potentially a new method of assessing both the coronary artery and cardiac function.
