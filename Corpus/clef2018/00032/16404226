Correlation of preoperative thallium SPECT with histological grading and overall survival in adult gliomas. The management and prognosis of a glioma depend on the tumour's histological grade. Thus, preoperative prediction of the grade is routinely needed to indicate whether surgery or biopsies are required. It has been proposed that thallium single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), in a relative short series, will aid this prediction.To confirm the correlation between the results of preoperative thallium SPECT and grade of tumour as well as patient survival, and to define the cut-off value of the optimal thallium index for the detection of high grade gliomas in a large series of patients.One hundred and eighteen patients treated for glioma were retrospectively included in this study. All patients underwent preoperative 201Tl SPECT upon initial presentation and were referred for neurosurgery. Initial scintigraphic findings were correlated with the histological grade of the tumour and overall patient survival.Thallium uptake was highly correlated with histological grade the mean thallium indices for low grade and high grade gliomas were 1.8 and 4.9, respectively. On the basis of receiver operating characteristic analysis, the optimal cut-off value of the thallium index for the detection of high grade glioma was determined. By using 2.2 as the value for the threshold thallium index, the sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 72%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the overall survival curves, as a function of the thallium index, indicated that it was correlated with the overall survival (P<0.001).Thallium SPECT provides useful information about the histological grade of the tumour and overall patient survival. Additionally, in spite of its relatively weak resolution, it appears to be a powerful routine clinical tool for the management of gliomas.
