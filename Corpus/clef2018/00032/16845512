Assessment of the short-lived non-pure positron-emitting nuclide (120)I for PET imaging. The non-pure positron-emitting iodine isotope (120)I (T(1/2)=81 min) is a short-lived alternative to (124)I. (120)I has a positron abundance more than twice that of (124)I and a maximum positron energy of 4 MeV. This study was undertaken to evaluate and characterise the qualitative and quantitative PET imaging of (120)I.(120)I was produced via the (120)Te(p,n) reaction on highly enriched (120)Te. The measurements were done with the Siemens scanner HR+ and the 2D PET scanner GE PC4096+. A cylinder containing three cold inserts and a phantom resembling a human brain slice were used to evaluate half-life, positron abundance and background correction. To analyse the image resolution, a -mm tube placed in water was filled with (120)I and (18)F. Comparisons with (18)F, (124)I and (123)I (measured with SPECT) were made using the Hoffman 3D brain phantom.The half-life of 81.1 min was reproduced by the PET measurements. The PET-based positron abundance ranged from 47.9% to 55.0%. The reconstructed image resolution found with the HR+ was 5.4 mm FWHM (12.3 mm FWTM), in contrast to 4.6 mm (8.6 mm) when using (18)F. Erroneous positive and negative numbers of radioactivity found in the cold inserts became nearly zero when the background of gamma-coincidences was corrected for. Images of the Hoffman phantom were inferior to those obtained when (18)F or (124)I was applied but superior to the (123)I-SPECT images.Our data show that (120)I of high radionuclidic purity can be regarded as a suitable nuclide for the PET imaging of radioiodine-labelled pharmaceuticals.
