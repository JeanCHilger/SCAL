Scar burden by myocardial perfusion imaging predicts echocardiographic response to cardiac resynchronization therapy in ischemic cardiomyopathy. About 30% of patients with heart failure do not respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). We hypothesized that scar burden can predict poor response to CRT in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM).Fifty patients (age, 68.5 +/- 9.2 years 84% menEchocardiographic response, defined as > or = 15% relative increase in LVEF, was documented in 28 (56%) patients. The mean SPS (18.8 +/- 11.3 vs 33.7 +/- 11.1 P = .000025) and the average scar density in the segments immediately adjacent to the LV lead (0.70 +/- 0.91 vs 1.64 +/- 0.82Higher overall scar burden, a larger number of severely scarred segments, and greater scar density near the LV lead tip portend an unfavorable response to CRT in ICM patients. Prospective confirmation of these findings is warranted.
