Development and validation of a liquid chromatographic method for the analysis of positron emission tomography radiopharmaceuticals with Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)-KMnO(4) chemiluminescence detection. A sensitive, selective and rapid high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with chemiluminescence (CL) detection was developed and validated for the analysis of positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceuticals. This method is based on the CL reaction of PET compounds with tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) [Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)] and acidic potassium permanganate [KMnO(4)]. After optimization of the reaction conditions, 12 of the 14 PET compounds investigated could be successfully detected and showed good performance in terms of sensitivity, linearity and reproducibility. In particular, for compounds with a tertiary amine functional group, the limits of detection were ppb levels for a 20 microL injection volume. Finally, this method was used to determine PET compounds for calculating of specific radioactivity in pharmaceutical samples.
