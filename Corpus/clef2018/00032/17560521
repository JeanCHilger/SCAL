Contemporary imaging for thyroid cancer. Thyroid nodules are extremely common in the adult population of the United States, and the incidence of thyroid cancer continues to increase. Preoperative ultrasonography is a crucial component of the work up of thyroid nodules. Recent studies evaluating (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron-emission-tomography, with or without simultaneous computed tomography imaging, are encouraging for its potential utility in thyroid cancer in patients who have an elevated serum thyroglobulin level and a negative (131)I scan.
