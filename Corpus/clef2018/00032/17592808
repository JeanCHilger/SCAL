Bowel imaging: a reassessment. Part 2: CT and MRI. This is the second part of a review of bowel imaging. While the first part addressed conventional X-ray techniques and ultrasonography, the second part discusses the diagnostic features of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including virtual colonography and PET-CT in the diagnosis of bowel disorders. Indications, performance and the diagnostic impact of the different methods are presented and discussed in the context of competitive methods such as (capsule-)endoscopy.
