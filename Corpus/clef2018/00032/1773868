Lupus anticoagulant in pre-eclampsia and intra-uterine growth retardation. In a prospective study we proposed to identify the relationship between the level of lupus anticoagulant activity in pre-eclampsia and in growth retardation among 88 pregnant women. In 23 women suffering from severe pre-eclampsia (PET), and 22 women with fetal growth retardation, the mean anticardiolipin binding index was significantly higher than 43 controls (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.005, respectively). The mean kaolin cephalin clotting time (KCCT) was significantly higher in patients with severe PET than in the control group (P less than 0.05). In intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR), patients with 610-2452 g infants had significantly higher anticardiolipin binding index than those with 2500-3200 g infants (P less than 0.05). The Caesarean section rate was 46% in the patients with intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR), 43% in the PET patients, and 2% in the control group.
