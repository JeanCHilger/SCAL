PET kinetic analysis: wavelet denoising of dynamic PET data with application to parametric imaging. Physiological functions (e.g., cerebral blood flow, glucose metabolism, and neuroreceptor binding) can be investigated as parameters estimated by kinetic modeling using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images. Imaging of these physiological parameters, called parametric imaging, can locate the regional distribution of functionalities. However, the most serious technical issue affecting parametric imaging is noise in dynamic PET data. This review describes wavelet denoising of dynamic PET images for improving image quality in estimated parametric images. Wavelet denoising provides significantly improved quality directly to dynamic PET images and indirectly to estimated parametric images. The application of wavelet denoising to radio-ligand and kinetic analysis is still in the development stage, but even so, it is thought that wavelet techniques will have a substantial impact on nuclear medicine in the near future.
