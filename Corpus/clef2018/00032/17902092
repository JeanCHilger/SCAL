Limited additional value of positron emission tomography in staging oesophageal cancer. The detection of distant metastases in patients with oesophageal cancer may be improved with [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), preventing unnecessary surgical explorations. The aim of this study was to assess the additional value of FDG-PET after a state-of-the-art preoperative staging protocol.All patients in this prospective cohort study were staged with multidetector computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasonography and external ultrasonography of the neck, both combined with selective fine-needle aspiration cytology. Patients considered eligible for curative surgery after these investigations underwent FDG-PET.FDG-PET revealed suspicious hot spots in 30 (15.1 per cent) of 199 patients. Metastases were confirmed in eight (4.0 per cent). In six of these, distant metastases were confirmed before surgery, but exploratory surgery was necessary for histological confirmation in the other two. All eight upstaged patients had clinical stage III-IV disease before FDG-PET (6.6 per cent of 122 with stage III-IV disease). In seven patients (3.5 per cent) hot spots appeared to be synchronous neoplasms, mainly colonic polyps. However, those in the remaining 15 (7.5 per cent) were false positive, leading to unnecessary additional investigations.FDG-PET improves the selection of patients with oesophageal cancer for potentially curative surgery, especially in stages III-IV. However, the diagnostic benefit is limited after state-of-the-art staging, and so broad implementation in daily clinical practice is questionable.
