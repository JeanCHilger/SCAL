New techniques in nuclear cardiology: SPECT, PET and antimyosin. Nuclear Cardiology offers non-invasive techniques of high reproducibility for cardiovascular assessment. These techniques have advanced enormously in the latest years. The advances in areas such as general technology and computer systems, medicine, immunology and research, allow us to obtain and interpret cardiac information with immediate or potential clinical applications unavailable few years ago. This paper describes 3 of these new techniques in nuclear cardiology: Single Photon Computed Tomography (SPECT) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and
