Female breast surface radiation exposure during FDG PET/CT examinations. The combined positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) scanners have been developed in which CT data can be used for both anatomical landmarks and attenuation correction of PET images. However, this modality potentially introduces more radiation burden to patients compared to conventional PET scanning as a result of the added radiation exposure received from CT examination. The purpose of our study was to determine the breast radiation doses of combined PET/CT examination.Patients' superficial breast doses were calculated using thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) placed onto the surface of the breasts. TLDs were positioned before FDG injection and removed after 24 h. We also determined the average superficial and glandular breast radiation doses from the anthropomorphic dosimetric phantom imaged using similar CT protocol (low dose) to the patients' study.The mean superficial breast dose of the breast skin measured from the PET/CT studies was 14.42+/-2.41 mGy. The average superficial and glandular breast doses of the anthropomorphic phantom measured from the low-dose CT was 9.50 mGy and 5.94 mGy, respectively.This study showed that radiation exposure to the breasts during PET/CT was higher than the recommended doses. Therefore, combined PET/CT scanning must be used for essential indications, particularly in women of reproductive age and preferentially a low-dose CT protocol should be implemented to avoid overexposure in such patients.
