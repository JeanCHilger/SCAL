Feasibility of a rapid protocol of 1-day single-isotope rest/adenosine stress Tc-99m sestamibi ECG-gated myocardial perfusion imaging. We previously developed a new rapid protocol for single-isotope rest/adenosine stress technetium 99m sestamibi (MIBI) electrocardiography-gated myocardial perfusion imaging examination. The feasibility and limitations of this rapid protocol are unclear.We examined 422 patients who underwent rest acquisition, which eliminates the waiting time, after injection of low-dose MIBI and drinking 400 mL of water. The patients immediately underwent adenosine stress. Stress acquisition was performed 1 hour after injection of high-dose MIBI. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting significant coronary stenoses were 93% and 70%, respectively. The frequency of significant (moderate or severe) inferior wall artifacts on the rest single photon emission computed tomography images among all patients was 16.3%. The frequency of significant artifacts in patients aged 70 years or older was significantly lower than that in patients aged less than 70 years (11.9% vs 26.9%, P = .0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that age less than 70 years and prior myocardial infarction were predictors of significant artifacts on resting images (P < .0001 and P < .05, respectively).Our rapid protocol for MIBI myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) provides high-quality images and good patient throughput, and it is effective at reducing the total examination time.
