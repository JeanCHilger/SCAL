Simultaneous in vivo positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are widely used in vivo imaging technologies with both clinical and biomedical research applications. The strengths of MRI include high-resolution, high-contrast morphologic imaging of soft tissues the ability to image physiologic parameters such as diffusion and changes in oxygenation level resulting from neuronal stimulation
