Neuromodulation of cerebral blood flow by spinal cord electrical stimulation: the role of the Italian school and state of art. Hosobuchi first studied the effect of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in human beings along with the demonstration that SCS can improve peripheral blood flow. Following these clinical and experimental observations Hosobuchi first used cervical SCS for the treatment of cerebral ischemia in man. Further experimental reports suggested so far that SCS 1) drastically prevents cerebral infarction progression along with a reduction in infarct volume in cats 2) improves clinical symptoms of patients in persistent vegetative states
