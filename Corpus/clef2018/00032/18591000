Striatal dopamine transporter in different disability stages of Parkinson's disease studied with [(123)I]beta-CIT SPECT. Six healthy controls and eighteen patients with Parkinson's disease in different disability stages were studied with SPECT using [(123)I]beta-CIT to label the striatal dopamine transporter. The mean uptake of [(123)I]beta-CIT in the putamen was reduced to 54% of the control mean and to 65% of the average control value in the caudate nucleus. In patients with totally, or predominantly unilateral symptoms the reduction was greater on the side opposite to the predominant symptoms (to 56% of the control mean in the contralateral putamen and to 77% in the ipsilateral putamen). There was a significant negative correlation between [(123)I]beta-CIT uptake in the putamen and the Hoehn and Yahr stage (r = -0.81, p < 0.0001). An analysis of covariance was performed using age and disease duration as covarianes, and the correlation between putaminal [(123)I]beta-CIT uptake and parkinsonian disability according to the Hoehn and Yahr stage remained significant (r = -0.75, p = 0.02). A similar correlation was seen in the caudate nucleus (r = -0.79, p < 0.0001) between the uptake of [(123)I]beta-CIT and the Hoehn and Yahr stage. The correlation also remained significant after correction for the duration of disease and age of the patients (r= -0.76, p = 0.02). The present results show that [1231],Q-CIT SPECT is a useful method to study the function of presynaptic dopaminergic terminals in PD, and might be used in the early diagnosis and follow-up of the disease.
