Nephrotoxicity of mala fide melamine: modern era milk scandal. Nephrotoxicity of melamine was first suggested in pets leading to pet food recall in 2007. Melamine was deemed a very low human risk, until recent reports of acute renal failure from melamine adulterated milk in China. Melamine allows for fraudulent dilution of milk by inflating protein levels due to its high nitrogen content. Exact pathophysiology linking melamine to kidney disease is unclear. It is advisable to avoid melamine until we gain a more scientific understanding of this new entity in humans.
