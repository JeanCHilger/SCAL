Radiochemical studies relevant to 86Y production via 86Sr(p,n)86Y for PET imaging. A novel production technique of yttrium-86 based on bombardment of deposited strontium carbonate was investigated. (86)Y was produced via proton-induced reactions on SrCO(3) target that was prepared by the sedimentation method. Production yield of 0.37mCi/microAh at 30 microA was measured by means of gamma-ray spectrometry for natural target. The separation of (86/87/88)Y from Cu and Sr was carried out by two ion-exchange columns.
