Gene expression of LOX-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 in pre-atherosclerotic mice. To identify markers of the earliest stage of atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, we evaluated the gene expression of lectin-like oxidized-low-density-lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in very young pre-atherosclerotic mice. Furthermore, the plasma levels of the soluble VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were compared to the gene expression profiles. Gene expressions of LOX-1 and VCAM-1 were up-regulated in young apoE(-/-) mice, and thus, it seems probable that these genes play a role in pre-atherosclerosis. Contrarily, the gene expression profile of ICAM-1 did not show any apparent differences between the groups, questioning the involvement of this molecule in the early development of atherosclerosis. Plasma levels of sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 were similar in all mice and did not correlate with the vascular gene expression of the corresponding genes. It therefore seems likely that these circulating markers are not suited to detect early atherosclerosis.
