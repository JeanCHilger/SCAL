Clinical and [123I]FP-CIT SPET imaging follow-up in patients with drug-induced parkinsonism. We recently found that patients with drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) may have normal (group I) or abnormal (group II) putamen [(123)I]FP-CIT DAT (dopamine transporter) binding. In this study we reassessed clinical features and DAT binding in 19 of the original 32 patients (10 of group I and 9 of group II) after a 19-39-month follow-up period and tested the effects of chronic levodopa treatment in both cohorts of patients. In group I patients, [(123)I]FP-CIT SPET (single photon emission tomography) was still normal in all patients at follow-up DAT binding and UPDRS (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) motor score values did not differ from baseline. In group II patients, [(123)I]FP-CIT SPET was still abnormal at follow-up
