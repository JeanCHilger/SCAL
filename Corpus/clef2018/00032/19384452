Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy 2007 in Germany--results of the query and current status. This third survey of the working group Cardiovascular Nuclear Medicine of the German Society of Nuclear Medicine in cooperation with the working group Nuclear Cardiology of the German Cardiac Society was to deliver information on the procedures and in particular on the development of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) from 2005 to 2007.370 questionnaires (222 private practices (PP), 117 hospitals (HO), 31 university hospitals (UH)) were evaluated.MPS of 114,374 patients were reported, 83% were investigated with 99mTc-perfusion tracers. 76% [2006=74%] were performed in PP, 15% [2006=17%] in HO and 9% [2006=9%] in UH. Diabetics represented 21% of all MPS patients in 2007. Data of 215 institutions which participated all from 2005 to 2007 showed an increase in MPS of 2.3% (PP +6.8%, HO -4.5%, UH -18.2%). The type of stress was pharmacological in 27% [2006 = 27%] 67% adenosine (of these 25% with exercise), 31% dipyridamole (of these 55% with exercise), and 2% dobutamine. Gated SPECT was performed in 47% [2006 = 42%] of all rest and in 44% [2006 = 39%] of all stress MPS. 61% [2006 = 83%] of all institutions did not apply perfusion scores. 20% [2006 = 24%] of the institutions reported changes in the use of MPS by competing methods.There is a small increase of MPS between 2005 and 2007 despite competing methods. Gated SPECT has experienced more acceptance, but is still underrepresented. As compared to the European average and general standards of MPS a considerable backlog accounts to pharmacological stress tests, gated SPECT and perfusion scores.
