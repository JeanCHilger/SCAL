Gastric carcinoma surgery outcomes during 2004-2008. Gastric carcinoma is a malignancy, frequently manifesting itself in late stages, with metastatic spread into lymph nodes. Resection is the only curative therapy. A total of 149 gastric carcinoma patients were operated in the Ist Surgical Clinic during the studied five- year period. The pre-operative disease staging included the PET-CT examination, as a standard. Total gastrectomy (GE) was completed in 109 subjects, while 12 subjects underwent subtotal GE. The both procedures included D2 lymphadenectomy. In selected cases, the surgery included upper polar resection (7 subjects). Paliative resections or explorations were performed in 21 subjects. During the postoperative period, no complications were recorded in 90% of the patients, however, two subjects exited. The postoperative complications recorded included adhesive ileus in a single subject, subphrenic absces in two subjects, esophago-jejuno-anastomosis fistule in 8 subjects and a duodenal stub fistule in one female patient. Total or subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy are standard procedures in gastric carcinoma patients. Mortality and morbidity rates of radical surgical procedures for gastric carcinoma should correspond with data presented in the literature.
