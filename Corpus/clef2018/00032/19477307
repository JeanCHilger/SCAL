Analysis of functionalized polyethylene terephthalate with immobilized NTPDase and cysteine. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was functionalized to introduce carboxyl groups onto its surface by a carboxylation technique. Surface and bulk properties, such as possible surface deterioration, surface roughness and the mechanical strength of the carboxylated polymers, were studied and compared with those of aminolyzed and hydrolyzed PET. Atomic force microscopy studies showed that unlike aminolysis and hydrolysis, which increased the surface roughness significantly due to cracking and pitting, the surface roughness of unmodified and carboxylated PET were comparable. While hydrolysis and aminolysis of PET resulted in significant loss of strength, tensile testing revealed that unmodified and carboxylated polymers had similar strength. The development of mechanically stable, functionalized PET would vastly improve the biomedical applications of this polymer. To understand the potential for improving biomedical applications, biologically active molecules, namely nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NTPDase) and cysteine, were immobilized on the carboxylated PET using amide bonds. NTPDase was also immobilized to aminolyzed PET using imine bonds, while cysteine was immobilized on aminolyzed PET using both imine and amide bonds. Attachment of NTPDase and cysteine was verified by analyzing the NTPDase activity and the cysteine surface concentration. The stability of these immobilizations was also studied.
