Preparation of carbon nanotube bioconjugates for biomedical applications. Biomedical applications of carbon nanotubes have attracted much attention in recent years. Here, we summarize our previously developed protocols for functionalization and bioconjugation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) for various biomedical applications including biological imaging using nanotubes as Raman, photoluminescence and photoacoustic labels
