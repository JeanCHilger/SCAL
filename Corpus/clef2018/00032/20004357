Stem cell therapy in acute myocardial infarction: a review of clinical trials. Stem cells (SCs) possess the ability to differentiate into cells of various tissues. Although the differentiation of SCs into functional cardiomyocytes has been difficult to demonstrate in humans, clinical trials using SCs in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have demonstrated variable results. Interpretation of these trials has been difficult because of multiple variables, which include differences in trial design, cell type, timing of cell delivery, and outcome measurements. Herein, a summary of all clinical trials in subgroups of direct injection, indirect mobilization, and combination approaches of SC therapy in AMI is provided with significant findings in each group.
