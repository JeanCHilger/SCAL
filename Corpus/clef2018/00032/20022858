Surgery within multimodal therapy concepts for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC): the MRI approach and review of the literature. Radical esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy remains the only curative therapy for patients with resectable esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC), however, combined treatment modalities may improve survival. Based upon more than 1300 consecutive esophageal resections, we present our current multidisciplinary ESCC approach with analysis in the context of recently published RCTs.Subject to tumor staging, patients with resectable ESCC receive either a neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (uT3N+) or are referred to primary surgery (uT1/2N0). By Medline searches (1997-2009), all published RCTs containing multimodal ESCC therapy concepts were identified and a systematic review was generated.From July 2007 to June 2009, 62 patients with ESCC were treated in our department (40 multimodal treatment concept, 21 primary surgery, 1 definite radiochemotherapy). The R0 resection rate was 78%, in hospital mortality 4.8%. 60% of patients showed a good response to neoadjuvant treatment. 18-month follow-up data revealed absence of tumor recurrence in 7 patients (18%). Our approach is aligned to the current published literature including 12 studies in this review. In line with our institutional experience, neodjuvant radiochemotherapy tends to improve overall survival and increases the likelihood of R0 resection. However, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates are increased. Adjuvant treatment failed to demonstrate any improvement in prognosis. For palliation, concurrent radiochemotherapy is the treatment of choice.The MRI approach can be aligned to the most recent published data. Surgical resection remains the principle treatment for patients with resectable ESCC. Although multimodal therapy concepts tend to improve survival rates, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates are increased.
