Radiolabelling of proteins with fluorine-18 via click chemistry. The study describes for the first time the application of Cu(I)-mediated 1,3-dipolar [3+2]cycloaddition for the labelling of proteins with the short-lived positron emitter fluorine-18 as exemplified with azide-functionalized human serum albumin (HSA).
