Lys(DOTA)4]BVD15, a novel and potent neuropeptide Y analog designed for Y1 receptor-targeted breast tumor imagin. We substituted a truncated neuropeptide Y (NPY) analog, [Pro(30), Tyr(32), Leu(34)]NPY(28-36)NH(2) also called BVD15, at various positions with DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-10-tetraacetic acid) and evaluated the effect of the coupling position with the binding affinity for NPY Y(1) receptors (NPY1R). Our data suggest that [Lys(DOTA)(4)]BVD15 (K(i)=63+/-25 nM vs. K(i)=39+/-34 nM for BVD15) is a potent NPY analog suitable for radiolabeling with metallo positron emitters for PET imaging of breast cancer.
