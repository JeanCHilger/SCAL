Vegetative state (prolonged coma) as manifestation of stable pathological state. Complex examination of 25 patients in vegetative state was performed before and after correction of secondary brain damage. Catamnesis over a period of at least 6 months was traced. Preliminary results showed that better recovery of consciousness and cognitive functions was observed if before treatment diffuse glucose hypometabolism was significantly more widespread than morphological changes. Minimal positive dynamics was detected in cases in which the reduction of glucose metabolism was minimal. This and other paradoxical results become explainable if to consider vegetative state as stable pathological state of the brain. This open new approaches to treatment of this group of patients.
