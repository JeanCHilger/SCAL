A multi-component fiber-reinforced PHEMA-based hydrogel/HAPEX™ device for customized intervertebral disc prosthesis. Spinal disease due to intervertebral disc degeneration represents a serious medical problem which affects many people worldwide. Disc arthroplasty may be considered the future ''gold standard'' of back pain treatment, even if problems related to available disc prostheses are considered. Hence, the aim of the present study was to improve the artificial disc technology by proposing the engineering of a pilot-scale device production process for a total multi-component intervertebral disc prosthesis. The device is made up of a poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PHEMA/PMMA) (80/20 w/w) semi-interpenetrating polymer network (s-IPN) composite hydrogel reinforced with poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fibers as annulus/nucleus substitute, and two hydroxyapatite-reinforced polyethylene composite (HAPEX™) endplates in order to anchor the multi-component device to the vertebral bodies. Static and dynamic-mechanical characterization show appropriate mechanical behavior. An example of engineering of a suitable pilot-scale device production process is also proposed in order to manufacture custom made implants.
