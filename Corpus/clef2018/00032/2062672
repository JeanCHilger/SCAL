Cerebral blood flow in AIDS-related neurotoxoplasmosis: a preliminary 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT study. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated by gamma camera 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT in 11 patients with AIDS-related neurotoxoplasmosis and correlated with neurological findings and the results of CT and MRI. Evident CBF abnormalities were observed in all patients with involvement of at least two cerebral lobes. In 10 patients the abnormalities were bilateral and in 8 patients basal ganglia were involved no specific hypoperfusion pattern was however evident. Focal lesions were found in 7 patients by CT (sensitivity: 63.6%) and in 10 patients by MRI (sensitivity: 90.9%). It may be concluded that neurotoxoplasmosis in AIDS patients is associated with a high prevalence of focal cortical and subcortical hypoperfusion but that the scintigraphic findings are not specific
