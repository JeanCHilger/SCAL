 Gliomas are the most common form of malignant brain tumors in humans. Although surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy alone, or a combination of these therapies, comprise the most common treatment methods for this ailment, the prognosis for the patient is usually very poor (1). As an alternative, investigators have been exploring the use of receptor-based therapy for this cancer because with this technique the anti-cancer drugs can be targeted specifically to the tumor. Because the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) is known to be overexpressed in many glioma tumor types, it has been targeted for the treatment of this cancer with small-molecule drugs (SMDs) or antibodies (Abs) directed against the EGFR (click here for references: PubMed). The EGFR is a membrane-bound receptor with an extracellular region that can bind several different ligands, and it mediates its activity through an intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) signaling pathway. This receptor has been shown to have a major role in the pathogenesis and progression of different cancers, as detailed elsewhere (2, 3). When a ligand, including an anti-EGFR Ab, is bound to the EGFR, the TK signaling pathway is activated and the receptor-ligand complex is rapidly internalized by the cell (4). The phenomenon of receptor internalization has been used by some investigators in an effort to improve the detection or treatment for a disease, including cancers, by linking a toxin, a SMD, or a radionuclide to Abs directed to a specific receptor (5-7). Dadparvar et al. used anti-EGFR Abs labeled with radioactive indium (
