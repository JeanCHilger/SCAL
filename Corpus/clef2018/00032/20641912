3-(3-(3-[ The current state of molecular genetics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) focuses on four genes: the β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) gene, the presenilin 1 gene, the presenilin 2 gene, and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene (2). The ε4 allele of the APOE gene is associated with an increased risk for late-onset AD (>50 years of age). Few of the imaging studies to date have been based on these genetic abnormalities. The characteristic neuropathology is neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. The result of the phenotypic changes is caused by an alteration in the processing of β-APP favoring the production of the potentially toxic Aβ42 protein. Binding of radioligands to Aβ42 protein
