IRDye 700DX-Labeled annexin V The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) that mediates its activity (cell development, proliferation and migration etc.) through an intracellular kinase (TK) is overexpressed in several different types of cancers, including that of the colorectal area. Because of its cancer-promoting activity, the EGFR has been targeted to treat the malignancies with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed toward its extracellular domain, with inhibitors against the TK, or with a combination of the two treatment methods (1-3). Although the United States Food and Drug Administration has approved these therapies for cancers, the response rate to a single agent treatment, particularly for colorectal cancer (CRC), is low, and it is difficult to predict which patient is likely to respond to the therapy (4, 5). Often biopsies have to be performed on the patients to predict possible cancer treatment outcomes, with mAbs targeting the EGFR or with drugs directed toward the intracellular TK, and no noninvasive biomarkers are available to determine the prognosis or to monitor therapy response (5). Biopsies, however, carry a risk of infection for the patient, the tissue must be examined microscopically by a specialist for diagnosis, and sampling of a small fraction of the tumor can result in false negative observations. Manning et al. developed IRDye 700DX-labeled annexin V (NIR700DX-Annexin V), an apoptosis biomarker, in an effort to develop a noninvasive, near-infrared optical imaging technique to determine the efficacy of cetuximab in mice bearing human CRC cell line xenograft tumors (4). The investigators also used IRDye 800CW-labeled EGF (NIR800-EGF) to assess the inhibition of cetuximab signaling in the tumor cells, and they used 3â€™-[
