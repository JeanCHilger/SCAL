2-((2-((Dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl)thio)-5-[ Serotonin (5-HT) is now known to serve as the gastrointestinal signaling molecule and participate in the development of alcohol dependence (1, 2). It is also involved in a variety of physiological functions such as the post-meal satiety process, as well as the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, anxiety, and depression (1-3). Imaging and data obtained by the analysis of resected tissue of epileptic patients and studies in animal models have provided much evidence that endogenous 5-HT, the activity of its receptors, and pharmaceuticals with 5-HT agonist and/or antagonist activities are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy (4). Thus, imaging of the 5-HT system (SERT) is considered important to understand a variety of neurological and psychiatric functions and disorders. A variety of drugs have been labeled with radioactive iodine (
