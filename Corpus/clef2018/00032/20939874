Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the seminal vesicles presenting with Lambert Eaton syndrome: a case report. Primary tumors of seminal vesicles are rare and only a few cases have been reported. Diagnosis is difficult due to the absence of early clinical signs. Prognosis is generally poor.We present the case of a 70-year-old Caucasian man with a seminal vesicle mass and concomitant lymph node metastasis detected by computed tomography and body positron emission tomography/low-dose computed tomography scan carried out for evaluation of Lambert Eaton syndrome. Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy showed a poorly differented neuroendocrine carcinoma with an immunhistochemical profile similar to small cell lung cancer. Following chemotherapy the disease was stable and active surveillance was initiated.Lambert Eaton syndrome may be the initial symptom of a seminal vesicle mass. Diagnosis needs to be obtained by transrectal biopsy and chemotherapy may delay progression of the tumor.
