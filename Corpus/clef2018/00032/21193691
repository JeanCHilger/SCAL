Influence of diabetes mellitus on prognostic utility of imaging of myocardial sympathetic innervation in heart failure patients. Patients with diabetes mellitus have accelerated progression of heart failure and often have impaired cardiac sympathetic innervation. The present study examines the implications for heart failure progression of cardiac sympathetic denervation, assessed by I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging, in diabetic compared with nondiabetic subjects.We evaluated 343 diabetic and 618 nondiabetic subjects with New York Heart Association class II or III heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% over a median follow-up of 17 months. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the influence of clinical variables, b-type natriuretic peptide, plasma norepinephrine, left ventricular ejection fraction, and I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging parameters on time to a heart failure event. The late heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratio and the interaction term of diabetes mellitus with the prospectively selected late H/M ratio <1.6 were independent predictors of heart failure progression, providing incremental prognostic information beyond that available from all other variables. In diabetic subjects, late H/M ratio <1.6 was associated with a 2.99-fold greater 2-year rate of heart failure progression (33.5%) than late H/M ratio ≥1.6 (11.2% event rate).The combination of diabetes mellitus and I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine H/M ratio is an independent predictor of heart failure progression, confirming the high risk of diabetic subjects with impaired cardiac sympathetic nerve function.
