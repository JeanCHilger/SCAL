Value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in positron emission tomography/computed tomography in predicting survival in multiple myeloma. We assessed the role of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) of bone marrow and the extramedullary lesion with the highest SUV(max) in positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients in predicting overall survival (OS).A total of 61 newly diagnosed patients (55 MM and 6 plasmacytoma) were enrolled in the study [37 men and 24 women with a median age of 57 years (range 28-80 years)]. The SUV(max) of bone marrow and the extramedullary lesion in PET/CT was correlated with the levels of β(2)-microglobulin, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, creatinine, per cent of bone marrow plasma cells, serum free light chain (FLC) ratio, International Staging System (ISS) score and Durie-Salmon stage.The extramedullary lesion with the highest SUV(max) showed significant correlation with bone marrow fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake (p = 0.027) and near significant correlation with ISS (p = 0.048). Bone marrow SUV(max) correlated significantly with the per cent of bone marrow plasma cell count (p = 0.024), CRP (p = 0.012) and ISS (p = 0.013). In stage III MM the mean values of SUV(max) in extramedullary lesions were significantly higher than stages I and II (6.23 ± 6.32 vs 2.85 ± 3.44, p = 0.023). The serum FLC ratio did not show any correlation with SUV(max) of lesions and bone marrow (p > 0.05). Forty-four MM patients with FDG-positive lesions in PET/CT showed inferior 5-year estimated survival (61.73%) when compared to 11 patients without FDG-positive lesions, all of whom were alive (p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis an extramedullary lesion with the highest SUV(max) was the only independent predictor of OS (p = 0.03).PET/CT allows identification of high-risk myeloma patients, and extramedullary lesions with the highest SUV(max) independently predict inferior OS.
