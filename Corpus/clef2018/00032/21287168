Iterative reconstruction or filtered backprojection for semi-quantitative assessment of dopamine Dâ‚‚ receptor SPECT studies? In routine clinical practice striatal dopamine D(2) receptor binding is generally assessed using data reconstructed by filtered backprojection (FBP). The aim of this study was to investigate the use of an iterative reconstruction algorithm (ordered subset expectation maximization, OSEM) and to assess whether it may provide comparable or even better results than those obtained by standard FBP.In 56 patients with parkinsonian syndromes, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans were acquired 2 h after i.v. application of 185 MBq [(123)I]iodobenzamide (IBZM) using a triple-head gamma camera (Siemens MS 3). The scans were reconstructed both by FBP and OSEM (3 iterations, 8 subsets) and filtered using a Butterworth filter. After attenuation correction the studies were automatically fitted to a mean template with a corresponding 3-D volume of interest (VOI) map covering striatum (S), caudate (C), putamen (P) and several reference VOIs using BRASS software.Visual assessment of the fitted studies suggests a better separation between C and P in studies reconstructed by OSEM than FBP. Unspecific background activity appears more homogeneous after iterative reconstruction. The correlation shows a good accordance of dopamine receptor binding using FBP and OSEM (intra-class correlation coefficients S: 0.87 C: 0.88Iterative reconstruction of IBZM SPECT studies for assessment of the D(2) receptors is feasible in routine clinical practice. Close correlations between FBP and OSEM data suggest that iteratively reconstructed IBZM studies allow reliable quantification of dopamine receptor binding even though a gain in diagnostic power could not be demonstrated.
