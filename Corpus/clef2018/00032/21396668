Functional assessment of nigro-striatal pathway with FP-CIT in patients with multiple system atrophy subtype C. To assess the functional state of nigro-striatal pathway using FP-CIT-I-123 in patients with clinical diagnosis of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) subtype C.We included 10 patients with a clinical diagnosis of MSA-C and compared them with 10 patients diagnosed with essential tremor (controls) and 10 with Parkinson Disease (PD). The studies are evaluated by the striatum/occipital index (S/O). We calculated the diagnostic validity of the procedure by ROC curve analysis.The average value of the S/O index showed a mean of 1.48 (0.23), 1.59 (0.17) and 1.22 (0.16) respectively for MSA-C, control group (p=0.25) and PD (p=0.00). ROC curve analysis: Az: 0.650 sensitivity: 0.50FP-CIT study does not exclude completely the existence of an MSA-C. From a functional point of view, there does not always seem to be a consistency between the state of the nigro-striatal pathway and the existence of parkinsonism.
