¹⁸F-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography in cardiac sarcoidosis. Cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) is a rare and potentially life-threatening disease that causes conduction disturbance, systolic dysfunction, and most notably sudden cardiac death. Accurate diagnosis of CS is thus mandatory however, a reliable approach that enables diagnosis of CS with high sensitivity and specificity has yet to be established. Recent studies have demonstrated the promising potential of (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) in the diagnosis and assessment of CS. Indeed, (18)F-FDG PET provides a wide variety of advantages over previous imaging modalities
