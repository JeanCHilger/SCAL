An approach to imaging adult congenital heart disease: pitfalls and pearls. Noninvasive cardiovascular evaluation of an adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patient is a multimodality endeavor that can include chest roentgenograms, electrocardiograms, echocardiography (including stress, three-dimensional, intravascular and intracardiac ultrasound, and transesophageal), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), computed tomography angiography (CTA), single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) perfusion imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET). The cost-benefit ratio and limitations of each modality should always be considered (Table 1). Adults with ACHD often need repetitive imaging, making them vulnerable to radiation-induced cancer hence, modalities using ionizing radiation should be minimized. A transthoracic echocardiogram remains the initial noninvasive modality of choice due to its real-time imaging capability with excellent temporal resolution and its ability to quickly assess hemodynamics along with anatomic delineation. A transesophageal echocardiogram is extremely helpful in further defining intracardiac anatomy and guiding surgical and interventional procedures. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is an adjunctive modality to an echocardiogram because ACHD patients frequently have intra-thoracic abnormalities (e.g., adhesions from multiple cardiac operations and lung disease) that can limit the resolution of the ultrasound beam. A CMR is especially helpful in periodic evaluation of the right ventricle, visceral situs, extracardiac anatomy, lesions of the pericardium, pulmonary veins, systemic veins, pulmonary arteries, and aorta. For real-time CMR, special techniques such as echo planar can be used
