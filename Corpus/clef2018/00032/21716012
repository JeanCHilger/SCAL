Comparison of C-11 methionine and C-11 choline for PET imaging of brain metastases: a prospective pilot study. The aim of the study was the comparison of C-11 methionine (MET) and C-11 choline (CHO) in the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of brain metastases in correlation to the histopathology findings in stereotactic biopsy.In all, 8 patients underwent MET and CHO PET and magnetic resonance imaging, in 7 of these, the metastases were previously treated by radiation therapy. Histopathologic diagnosis was made for each patient by frame-based stereotactic serial biopsy. Standardized uptake values of tumor uptake and lesion-to-normal brain tissue ratios (LNRs) of the lesions were determined. LNRs for each tracer were compared with the histopathology findings and follow-up.In 6 patients, biopsy revealed viable metastases, 1 patient suffered from tumor recurrence in follow-up and 1 patient was tumor free in biopsy and follow-up. In the last mentioned patient, LNR was the lowest determined in all patients for CHO, but not for MET. Mean standardized uptake values of the lesions were in median 1.8 for MET and 1.1 for CHO, median LNRs were 1.5 for MET and 6.6 for CHO. LNRs for CHO were significant higher than those for MET (P = 0.007).In the direct comparison to the well-established amino acid tracer MET, CHO seems to be promising for the imaging of brain metastases because of significantly higher LNRs in tumor tissue compared with MET without evidence for a lower specificity of CHO uptake.
