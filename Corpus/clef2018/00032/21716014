Detection of recurrence in glioma: a comparative prospective study between Tc-99m GHA SPECT and F-18 FDG PET/CT. Early and correct diagnosis of tumor recurrence and its differentiation from therapy-related changes is crucial for prompt and adequate management of glioma patients. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacies of Tc-99m glucoheptonate (GHA) single photon emission tomography (SPECT) and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in detection of recurrence in patients with glioma.A total of 90 patients with histopathologically proven glioma who had suspicion of recurrence clinically or on magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated using Tc-99m GHA SPECT and FDG PET/CT. Combination of clinical follow-up, repeat imaging, and biopsy (when available) was taken as gold standard.On the basis of gold standard, 59 patients were positive and 31 were negative for tumor recurrence. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of GHA SPECT were 85%, 97%, and 89%, respectively, whereas those of FDG PET/CT were 70%, 97%, and 80%, respectively. On subgroup analysis, GHA SPECT performed better than FDG PET/CT in all grades except for grade II gliomas, where both were equally effective. In all, 15 patients had intermodality discordance, with GHA SPECT being correct in 13 of them.GHA SPECT appears to be a better imaging modality than FDG PET/CT for detection of recurrent gliomas.
