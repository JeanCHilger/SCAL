Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: is there a correlation between dopamine transporter density and cerebral blood flow? Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most frequent behavioral problems in school-age children. Although the etiology remains unclear, the involvement of the dopaminergic system has been suggested by genetic studies that report an overexpression of the dopamine transporter (DAT) gene. In spite of these abnormalities being directly related to the decrease of dopamine (DA) in the striatum (STR), abnormalities in brain perfusion have also been observed in cortical-subcortical structures. Functional neuroimaging studies have suggested that the DA concentration may cause changes in the cerebral blood flow (CBF). The objective of our study was to evaluate the relationship between DAT density in STR and cortical-subcortical impairment in CBF. Based on the hypothesis that there is a correlation between DA availability and brain perfusion, we postulated that individuals with ADHD, with a higher DAT density in the basal ganglia, will have lower perfusion in the fronto-striatal-cerebellar networks. We used Tc-99m TRODAT-1 SPECT to measure DAT density and Tc-99m ECD SPECT to assess brain perfusion. Ten adolescents diagnosed with ADHD by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria were investigated. Analysis with Statistical Parametric Mapping 5 corrected for multiple comparisons, using small volume correction, showed a significant negative correlation between the DAT density in the STR and CBF in the cingulate gyrus, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and cerebellum (pFDR <0.01). Our findings suggest that higher DAT density in the STR was associated with a decrease in the regional CBF in the cortical and subcortical attention network.
