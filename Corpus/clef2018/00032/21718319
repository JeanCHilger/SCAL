Positron emission tomography findings in clinical mimics of lymphoma. The use of positron emission tomography (PET) scans is rapidly evolving in the diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance of lymphoma. However, significant challenges exist in differentiating lymphomatous from benign lesions. Herein we describe the clinical and radiographic uptake patterns seen in common clinical mimics of lymphoma, including infections such as human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis, inflammatory disorders such as sarcoidosis and connective tissue disorders, and other benign lymphoproliferative disorders such as Kikuchi's disease and Rosai-Dorfman disease. The clinical utility of PET scans has encompassed varying fields, not just oncology. Future challenges with the use of improved radiopharmaceuticals in accurately defining and differentiating lesions that would affect clinical treatment would be of paramount importance.
