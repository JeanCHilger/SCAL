Systolic right ventricular adaptive changes in athletes as predictors of the maximal functional capacity: a pulsed tissue Doppler study. The aim of this study was to extend the analysis of the systolic right ventricular (RV) adaptation to combined endurance and strength training, to assess the utility of tissue Doppler imaging in detecting the degree of these changes and to find independent RV predictors of the maximal functional capacity.Standard Doppler and TDI were used to assess cardiac parameters at rest in 37 elite male athletes (16 wrestlers, 21 water polo players) and 20 sedentary subjects of similar age. Progressive maximal test on treadmill was used to assess VO2max. The obtained parameters were adjusted for HR, FFM, and BSA.Wrestlers showed higher VO2max than controls, but lesser than water polo players. RV diameter was larger in athletes. Right atrial pressure (RVE/e) was higher in water polo players than in other groups. Systolic function assessed by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and RVs' was the highest in wrestlers. Global RV systolic parameters myocardial performance index (MPI) and preejection time/ejection time index (PET/ET) were similar. On multivariate analysis systolic parameters were independent predictors of VO2max only in wrestlers: RVs' (beta=3.18, P=0.001) and RV ET (beta=2.32, P=0.001). RVE/e` correlated with RVs' (r=-0.57, P=0.000). TAPSE correlated with RV ET (r=0.32, P=0.015) and RVs` (beta=0.28, P=0.033).Systolic function assessed by TAPSE and RVs` has more improved in less endurance athletes. RVs`and TDI ejection time predict VO2max in wrestlers, and possibly in other athletes with lesser right atrial pressure. TDI enables quantifying RV adaptation degree in athletes, but complementary to M-mode technique.
