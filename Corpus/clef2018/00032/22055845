Automated preparation of the dopamine D2/3 receptor agonist ligand [11C]-(+)-PHNO for human PET imaging studies. Carbon-11 labelled (+)-4-Propyl-3,4,4a,5,6,10b-hexahydro-2H-naphtho[1,2-b][1,4]oxazin-9-ol ([(11)C]-(+)-PHNO) is used as a high-affinity state, dopamine D(2/3) receptor ligand in clinical PET studies. To facilitate its use, robust, rapid, efficient and GMP compliant methods are required for the manufacturing and QC testing processes. Additionally, to allow for full quantification of the resulting signal in the CNS, a reliable method is required to establish the parent plasma concentration over the course of the scan. This paper provides high-quality methods to support clinical application of [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO.
