Imaging myocardial inflammation of various etiologies with 99mTc-depreotide SPET/CT. Previous reports suggested the accumulation of technetium-99m-depreotide trifluoroacetate ((99m)Tc-D) at the sites of active infection or inflammation.  Binding of depreotide to over-expressed somatostatin receptors in activated lymphocytes and macrophages probably accounts for the depiction of inflammation.  We speculated that myocardial inflammation could also be illustrated by (99m)Tc-D scintigraphy. We report on 3 patients with the clinical diagnosis of myocarditis  of various etiologies, in which (99m)Tc-D SPET/CT demonstrated obvious tracer uptake in the myocardium of the left ventricle.  In conclusion, we suggest that depreotide imaging can depict myocardial inflammation, thus supporting clinical diagnosis.
