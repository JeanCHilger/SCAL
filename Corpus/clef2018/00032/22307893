Prognostic value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil: comparisons of volume-based metabolic parameters. The prognostic significance of volume-based metabolic parameters measured by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT ((18) F-FDG PET/CT) is not established. We evaluated the prognostic value of metabolic parameters in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tonsil.We enrolled a total of 69 patients with SCC of the tonsil who underwent pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET/CT. We measured maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and asymmetry indices (of SUV(max), MTV, and TLG). The prognostic significance of these parameters and clinical variables was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.Multivariate analyses with adjustments for age, sex, and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage showed that only TLG (hazard ratio = 1.020, 95% confidence interval 1.003-1.037, p = .023) was an independent predictive factor associated with decreased overall survival.TLG is a significant independent metabolic prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with SCC of the tonsil.
