A case of a superficial carcinoma of the esophagus with isolated lymph node metastasis around the abdominal aorta. Superficial carcinoma of the esophagus with isolated para-aortic lymph node metastasis is quite rare. A 56-year-old female demonstrated a type 0-IIa+IIb lesion in the middle thoracic esophagus on endoscopic examination. Enhanced computed tomography and positron emission tomography demonstrated two swollen lymph nodes on the right side of the inferior vena cava, but did not demonstrate either a primary lesion or regional lymph node metastasis. A retroperitoneal videoscopic lymph node biopsy was thus performed, and the histopathological diagnosis was metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma. Induction chemotherapy was administered with cisplatin/5-FU, and followed by definitive chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin/5-FU plus 60 Gy radiation. The patient showed satisfactory responses in both the primary and metastatic lesions. This is the first case report describing superficial carcinoma of the esophagus with isolated lymph node metastasis around the abdominal aorta. A precise histological diagnosis of the lymph node is quite important in such cases, and an adequate curative effect can be expected.
