Staging and functional characterization of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare tumors of the adrenal medulla and extra-adrenal sympathetic chromaffin tissues their anatomical and functional imaging are critical to guiding treatment decisions. This study aimed to compare the sensitivity and specificity of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) for tumor localization and staging of PPGLs with that of conventional imaging by [(123)I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine single photon emission CT ((123)I-MIBG SPECT), CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).A total of 216 patients (106 men, 110 women, aged 45.2 Â± 14.9 years) with suspected PPGL underwent CT or MRI, (18)F-FDG PET/CT, and (123)I-MIBG SPECT/CT. Sensitivity and specificity were measured as endpoints and compared by the McNemar test, using two-sided P values only.Sixty (28%) of patients had nonmetastatic PPGL, 95 (44%) had metastatic PPGL, and 61 (28%) were PPGL negative. For nonmetastatic tumors, the sensitivity of (18)F-FDG was similar to that of (123)I-MIBG but less than that of CT/MRI (sensitivity of (18)F-FDG = 76.8% of (123)I-MIBG = 75.0%Compared with (123)I-MIBG SPECT and CT/MRI, both considered gold standards for PPGL imaging, metastases were better detected by (18)F-FDG PET. (18)F-FDG PET provides a high specificity in patients with a biochemically established diagnosis of PPGL.
