The prognosis of a normal Tl-201 stress-only SPECT MPI study. Stress-only Tc-99m SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) decreases test time and patient radiation exposure with a proven benign prognosis of a normal study. The imaging sequence of Tl-201 MPI always starts with the stress portion therefore, no pre-test decisions are needed regarding the imaging sequence. The recent intermittent Tc-99m shortage afforded the unique opportunity to study an unselected group of patients undergoing Tl-201 imaging.We retrospectively reviewed all the patients who had SPECT MPI with Tc-99m or Tl-201 over a 1-year period. When Tc-99m was not available, patients received Tl-201. All stress Tl-201 images were routinely processed, and if normal, rest imaging was not done. When Tc-99m was used, patients with lower pre-test probability were selected for a stress-first protocol. We compared the all-cause mortality of patients with normal Tl-201 studies to those with normal stress-only and rest-stress Tc-99m studies using the Social Security Death Index. Unadjusted and risk-adjusted survival analysis was performed. Specific causes of death (cardiac or non-cardiac) were determined by medical record review and contact with treating physicians.A total of 3,658 patients underwent stress MPI during this time period. Of the 1,215 patients who had Tl-201 MPI, 716 (67%) had a normal stress-only study. Out of 2,443 patients who underwent Tc-99m MPI, 70% had normal perfusion with 1,098 normal stress-only studies and 493 normal rest-stress studies. The average follow-up was 23.3 Â± 5.3 months. Unadjusted all-cause mortality at the end of follow-up was 7.1% in the Tl-201 stress-only group, 6.3% for Tc-99m stress-only patients, and 4.3% in the Tc-99m rest-stress cohort. After controlling for confounding variables, survival was similar in the three groups (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.62-1.82, P = .82 for normal Tl-201 stress-only compared to normal Tc-99m rest-stress). The risk-adjusted 1-year survival was between 98.5 and 98.8% in the three groups.Normal stress-only Tl-201 SPECT MPI study has a similarly benign prognosis when compared to Tc-99m rest-stress and Tc-99m stress-only normal SPECT MPI studies. The stress-first design allowed for early triage of over 60% of patients and marked improvement in laboratory efficiency due to shortened test time.
