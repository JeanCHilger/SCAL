Mu opiate receptors are selectively labelled by [3H]carfentanil in human and rat brain. [11C]Carfentanil is a potent opioid agonist currently in use as a specific PET (position emission tomography) scan radioligand for brain mu opioid receptors. In order to investigate the receptor interactions of carfentanil in detail [3H]carfentanil was used as a radioligand for labelling receptors in rat and human brain tissue homogenates. [3H]Carfentanil was found to bind saturably and with high affinity (KD = 0.08 +/- 0.01 nM) to membranes prepared from human cortical (Bmax = 42 +/- 3 fmol/mg) and thalamic (Bmax = 84 +/- 3 fmol/mg) tissues and rat cortex (Bmax = 82 +/- 4 fmol/mg) and diencephalon (Bmax = 105 +/- 5 fmol/mg). Association (1.23 +/- 0.19 X 10(10) Mol-1 X min-1 and dissociation rate (0.19 +/- 0.03 min-1) constants were determined in human cortical tissues results from studies in rat cortical, and rat diencephalon tissue homogenates produced similar kinetic rate constants. Competition studies with a variety of drugs indicated that [3H]carfentanil interacts primarily with mu opioid receptors in the four tissues studied
