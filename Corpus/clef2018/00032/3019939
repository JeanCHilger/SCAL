A 122Xe-122I generator for remote radio-iodinations. A 122Xe-122I generator system is described that produces 122I extraction efficiencies of approximately 60%. Radiocontaminants were less than 0.1% at the time of 122I removal following a 10 min ingrowth period. The chemical form of 122I was identified as [122I]iodide, and the [122I]iodide was remotely incorporated into radiopharmaceuticals for PET studies with an overall efficiency of as much as 40%.
