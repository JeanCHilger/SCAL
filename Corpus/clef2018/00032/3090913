Toxic and protective constituents in pet foods. An analytical survey of mutagens, nitrosamines, polychlorinated biphenyls, toxic elements, and gamma-emission, as well as the toxicologically protective constituents zinc, selenium, and vitamin C, in 48 pet foods was conducted. Aside from high concentrations of fluoride and iodide in some samples and the expectedly higher concentrations of mercury and selenium in certain cat foods containing fish, the samples were notably free of the other toxic constituents. Direct-acting and promutagens and nitrosamines were not detectable in any of the samples. gamma-Emission was very low in all of the foods. Polychlorinated biphenyls were only detected in one cat food.
