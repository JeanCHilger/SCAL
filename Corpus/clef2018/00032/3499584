Tomographic studies of rCBF with 99mTc-HM-PAO SPECT in comparison with PET in patients with primary brain tumors. 99mTc-hexamethyl-propyleneamine-oxime (HM-PAO) was developed as a radiotracer of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with SPECT. THe purpose of this study was to investigate if HM-PAO is able to trace rCBF in primary brain tumors. In 10 patients with glioblastoma grade IV the intracerebral distribution of HM-PAO was studied in comparison with C15O2 steady state inhalation technique and PET for rCBF evaluation. In all instances the cerebral HM-PAO distribution was comparable with rCBF pattern as confirmed by a significant correlation of tumor to cortex ratios. The results indicate the clinical usefulness of HM-PAO for tracing rCBF in brain tumors.
