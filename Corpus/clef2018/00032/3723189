Iodine-123-4-amino-3-iodobenzylguanidine, a new sympathoadrenal imaging agent: comparison with iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine. Iodine-123-4-amino-3-iodobenzylguanidine ([123I]AIBG), an analog of 123I metaiodobenzylguanidine ([123I]MIBG), has an advantage in having a more rapid and simple synthesis. This, combined with animal data that suggested a greater affinity of the new radiopharmaceutical for the autonomic innervation of the myocardium led us to study the biodistribution of [123I]AIBG in three men with metastatic pheochromocytoma. In all instances, [123I]AIBG revealed the same metastatic deposits shown by [123I]MIBG. Iodine-123 AIBG uptake, however, was greater than [123I]MIBG in lung, gut, and spleen. These higher backgrounds may pose diagnostic problems in some cases.
