Inner connections within domain of dementia praecox: role of supervisory mental processes in schizophrenia. Kraepelin's conclusion that there were underlying common features justifying the amalgamation of catatonia, hebephrenia and paranoia hallucinatoria to form a single illness is confirmed by factor analytic studies delineating the various dimensions of schizophrenic psychopathology. Neuropsychological studies reveal that the three cardinal dimensions reflect disorder of the supervisory mental processes responsible for initiation, selection and monitoring of self-generated mental activity. Brain-imaging studies indicate that the underlying neuropathology entails disordered functional connectivity within the neural networks in multimodal association cortex that are the substrate of the supervisory mental processes, consistent with Kraepelin's own speculation about the essential nature of the condition.
