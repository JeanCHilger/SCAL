Neuroimaging studies in children with temporal lobectomy. Twenty-eight children with intractable seizures who subsequently underwent a temporal lobectomy were studied by electroencephalogram (EEG), prolonged video EEG telemetry, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the localization of epileptogenic foci. MRI showed abnormalities indicating epileptogenic foci in 21/25 patients and a increased signal intensity in 7/11 patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). SPECT showed corresponding abnormalities in 17/22 patients, including an interictal decrease in regional cerebral blood flow corresponding to the epileptogenic zone in 15. CT showed localized abnormalities in 16/28. All 12 patients with benign, slow-growing neoplasms showed an abnormality on CT scan. In children, MRI is essential in localizing epileptogenic abnormalities, especially MTS and cortical dysplasia. SPECT contributes to the localization of epileptogenic foci, which are often coincident with EEG abnormalities, particularly in single pathology. CT depicts benign neoplasms with calcification in the temporal lobe, which are likely to provoke complex partial seizures.
