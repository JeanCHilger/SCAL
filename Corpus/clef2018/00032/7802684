Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of type 1 and type 2A phosphatases, modulates the activation of phospholipase D in formyl peptide- and mastoparan-stimulated human neutrophils. The activation of phospholipase D (PLD) induced by formyl peptides (fMLP), as evaluated by production of tritiated phosphatidylethanol (PEt) and phosphatidic acid (PA) in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), was markedly enhanced (50-125%) by low okadaic acid concentrations (0.25-0.5 microM) but inhibited by higher concentrations (2-3 microM), although the drug caused protein hyperphosphorylation. Both effects of okadaic acid were amplified when PLD activation was primed with cytochalasin B. Stimulation of PMN with mastoparan, a wasp venom toxin that activates Pertussis toxin(PTX)-sensitive G proteins, resulted in a weak calcium-dependent production of PEt which was respectively enhanced and inhibited by okadaic acid (1-2 microM) in unprimed and cytochalasin-primed PMN. The results show that low okadaic acid concentrations primed fMLP-mediated activation of PLD, in keeping with a down-regulatory role of protein phosphatases. The contrasting effects of okadaic acid in mastoparan-stimulated PMN further suggest that protein phosphatases may regulate the generation of second messengers through alteration of major signaling events at/or downstream of PTX-sensitive G proteins (Gi).
