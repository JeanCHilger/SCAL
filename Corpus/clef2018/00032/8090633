Lung activity in 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy: distribution and correlation with hemodynamic parameters. The aim of this study was 1. to investigate whether the pulmonary activity in 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy can be accurately quantified from the anterior SPECT projection, 2. to determine the pattern of the intrapulmonary Tl distribution, and 3. to assess the influence of parameters of left ventricular function on the lung/heart ratio (LHR). Scintigraphic images of 85 patients were analysed. In 24 patients planar anterior imaging of the thorax was performed in addition to myocardial SPECT, in 41 patients radionuclide ventriculography was performed within 4 weeks after Tl scintigraphy.1. pulmonary Tl-content can be quantitated from the anterior SPECT projection with sufficient accuracy, 2. a lower thallium activity was registered over the apical part of the lung as compared to the basal part, and 3. in the multiple regression analysis the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) during exercise and heart rate during exercise (HRex) exhibited the strongest relation to LHR. After correction with regard to HRex the elevated LHR points to a pathological LVEF during exercise.
