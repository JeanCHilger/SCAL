Comparison of planar and SPECT 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy in calculating differential kidney function. An extensive study to compare planar and single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) determination of differential kidney function (DKF) has been carried out. The study has demonstrated that it is possible to use SPECT differential kidney function in place of that obtained using planar scintigraphy. The SPECT DKF value correlated with the planar DKF value. Gradient shaded three-dimensional surface images, reoriented transaxial, sagittal and coronal slices were produced during the same processing method.
