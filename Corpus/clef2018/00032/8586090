Where are we with nuclear medicine in pediatrics? The practice of nuclear medicine in children is different from that in adults. Technical considerations including immobilization, dosing of radiopharmaceuticals, and instrumentation are of major importance. Image magnification and the capability to perform single-photon emission tomography are essential to performing state of the art pediatric nuclear medicine. New advances in instrumentation with multiple detector imaging, the possibility of clinical positron emission tomography imaging in children, and new radiopharmaceuticals will further enhance pediatric scintigraphic imaging. This review highlights advances in pediatric nuclear medicine and discusses selected clinical problems.
