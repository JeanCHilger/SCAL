Social function of pets (author's transl). The present paper is an abridged version of one written in 1974. Only one of several functions of small pets, viz. their social function, is discussed, both the positive and the negative aspects being considered. A test developed in Great Britain serves to show how important a pet may be. The reasons for which man regards his animals as important are more within the scope of the psychologist bus are also referred to in the paper. An entirely new social function, especially of dogs, is the role of therapeutic aids in the psychotherapy of children. This method is used specifically by the American psychiatrist B. M. Levinson. Drawbacks to pets are inadequate hygiene, agressiveness and zoonoses, though veterinarians may play an important role in overcoming these disadvantages.
