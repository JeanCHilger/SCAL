Occurrence of thermotolerant Campylobacter species in domestic and wild monkeys from Peru. The isolation rate of thermotolerant campylobacters in pet monkeys and wild monkeys was established. Campylobacter spp. were isolated in 31.9% of the first (pet) group, being less frequent (20.9%) in the second (wild) (P > 0.05). In both groups, only biovars I and II of C. jejuni ssp. jejuni and both biovars of C. coli were isolated (Lior's scheme). Campylobacter lari was not isolated. The results show that domestic and wild monkeys can harbour Campylobacter in their intestinal tract and would be considered as reservoirs of these bacteria.
