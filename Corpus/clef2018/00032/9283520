Importance of estimated functional capacity as a predictor of all-cause mortality among patients referred for exercise thallium single-photon emission computed tomography: report of 3,400 patients from a single center. We sought to determine the relative influence of estimated functional capacity and thallium-201 (Tl-201) single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) findings on prediction of short-term all-cause and cardiac-related mortality.Decreased functional capacity and abnormal Tl-201 SPECT findings are predictive of increased cardiovascular risk and mortality. However, the relative importance of these variables as predictors of all-cause mortality is not well established.Analyses were based on 3,400 consecutive adults undergoing symptom-limited exercise Tl-201 SPECT testing at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation between September 1990 and December 1993 none had previous invasive procedures, heart failure or valve disease. Estimated functional capacity, classified by age and gender, and thallium perfusion defects, expressed as a stress extent thallium score on a 12-segment scale, were analyzed to determine their relative prognostic importance during 2 years of follow-up.Of 3,400 patients, 108 (3.2%) died during follow-up 32 deaths were identified as cardiac related. On univariable analysis, estimated functional capacity was a strong predictor of death, with 62 (57%) deaths occurring in patients achieving < 6 metabolic equivalents (METs) (log-rank chi-square 86, p < 0.0001). On multivariable analysis, the strongest independent predictors of all-cause mortality were fair or poor functional capacity (adjusted relative risk [RR] 3.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.36 to 6.64, chi-square 27, p < 0.0001) and age (adjusted RR for 10 years 2.25, 95% CI 1.80 to 2.80, chi-square 27, p < 0.0001). The presence of SPECT thallium perfusion defects was a less powerful predictor of death (for each two additional segments with defects, adjusted RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.43, chi-square 5, p = 0.02). Cardiac mortality was predicted by both fair or poor functional capacity (adjusted RR 4.37, 95% CI 1.59 to 12.00, chi-square 8, p = 0.004) and by stress extent thallium score (adjusted RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.11, chi-square 13, p = 0.0003).In this clinically low risk group, estimated functional capacity was a strong and overwhelmingly important independent predictor of all-cause mortality among patients undergoing exercise Tl-201 SPECT testing. The extent of myocardial perfusion defects was of comparable importance for the prediction of cardiac mortality.
