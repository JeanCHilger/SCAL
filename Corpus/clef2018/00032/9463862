Nutrition and osteochondrosis. Developmental orthopedic disease is a group of musculoskeletal disorders that occur in growing animals (most commonly fast growing, large breed dogs). Osteochondritis dissecans and canine hip dysplasia are the overwhelming majority of the diagnoses in those musculoskeletal problems with a possible nutritional-related etiology. Nutritional management alone will not completely control osteochondrosis or any of the developmental bone diseases. However, osteochondrosis and other developmental orthopedic diseases can be influenced during growth by feeding technique and nutrient profile. Dietary deficiencies are of minimal concern in this age of commercial foods specifically prepared for young, growing dogs. The potential for harm is in overnutrition from excess consumption and over supplementation.
