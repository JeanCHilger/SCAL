Streptokinase in acute stroke: effect on reperfusion and recanalization. Australian Streptokinase Trial Study Group. The Australian Streptokinase Trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, in which streptokinase (SK, 1.5 million IU I.V.) was given within 4 hours of stroke onset. In a subset of 37 patients, 99mTc-labeled D,L-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and/or transcranial Doppler (TCD) studies were performed before and after therapy to test the hypothesis that SK may improve the hemodynamic measures of reperfusion/recanalization rates (TCD parameter) within 24 hours. Eighteen patients received SK and 19 placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups, and there were no differences in clinical outcomes assessed at 3 months after stroke. Although there was no increase in the group mean perfusion defect or volume on SPECT after thrombolytic therapy, a larger number of patients demonstrating the combined end point of reperfusion or recanalization was seen in the SK group (13/14, 93%) than in the placebo group (7/14, 50% p = 0.01). Although SK given within 4 hours of acute ischemic stroke appears to improve arterial patency/tissue reperfusion, this effect is neither early nor extensive enough to influence overall clinical outcome.
