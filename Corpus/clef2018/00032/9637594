Lateral frontal lobe seizures. On the basis of cytoarchitectural and functional studies, the frontal lobe can be subdivided into the primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, prefrontal cortex, and the limbic and paralimbic cortices. However, we are still a long way from clearly identifying individual frontal lobe epilepsies. Instead, we are limited to a discussion of frontal lobe seizures arising from various regions of the frontal lobe. Supplementary motor area epilepsy and perirolandic epilepsy have been quite well defined, in contrast to syndromes involving other regions of the frontal lobe. Recent technological advances in neuroimaging, electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography and detailed videotape analysis of seizure semiology may enable us to delineate these frontal lobe syndromes with better accuracy, thereby improving outcome after epilepsy surgery.
