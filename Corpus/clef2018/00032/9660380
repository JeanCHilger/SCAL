Cerebral hypoperfusion during acute Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease is a febrile disease of children notable for systemic vasculitis. There have been many previous reports of various complications, including disorders of the central nervous system. We evaluated cerebral perfusion during the acute stage in patients with Kawasaki disease.Single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime was performed in 21 children with acute stage Kawasaki disease. Follow-up SPECT and MRI were performed about 1 month after the first SPECT in patients who exhibited abnormal SPECT findings during the acute stage.In 6 of 21 children SPECT imaging demonstrated localized cerebral hypoperfusion without abnormal neurological findings or clinical symptoms, and the follow-up SPECT and MRI approximately 1 month after the first SPECT revealed no abnormalities.Some patients with Kawasaki disease have transient localized cerebral hypoperfusion at the acute stage.
