Association between [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and postoperative histopathology, hormone receptor status, thymidine labelling index and p53 in primary breast cancer: a preliminary observation. To investigate the possible role of positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the prognostic evaluation of primary breast cancer, we studied 86 patients with T1-3 (TNM classification) breast tumours before surgery and compared the tumour FDG uptake, calculated as a standardized uptake value (SUV), with postoperative histopathological findings, steroid hormone receptor status of the tumour, thymidine labelling index (LI) and tissular expression of p53. SUV was significantly higher in infiltrating ductal carcinomas (n = 68 median SUV = 5.6) than in lobular ones (n = 18
