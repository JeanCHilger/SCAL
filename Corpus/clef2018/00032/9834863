Effects of spinal cord stimulation on regional myocardial blood flow in patients with refractory angina. A positron emission tomography study. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an alternative therapy in patients with refractory angina pectoris when coronary revascularization cannot be performed. Several hypotheses have been given to explain the effects of SCS in reducing the number and the intensity of anginal crises. These hypotheses include possible variations in myocardial blood flow (MBF). The aim of our study was to assess regional MBF in a group of patients with spinal cord stimulator, using positron emission tomography (PET).We studied 15 patients (9 male and 6 female), mean age 74 +/- 7 years, who were carriers of a spinal cord stimulator implanted 17 +/- 14 (range 1-48) months before. All patients had been affected with angina pectoris that was refractory to maximal tolerated pharmacological therapy. Eight patients had had a previous myocardial infarction and four patients had undergone a revascularization procedure. Every patient underwent two PETs with nitrogen-13-ammonia as the perfusion tracer. The first one was performed with the stimulator switched off for at least 20 hours, and the second one with the stimulator switched on for at least 4 hours. The quantitative evaluation of regional MBF (anterior, inferior, lateral, septal walls and apex) was performed with Patlak graphic analysis. The normal value of basal MBF in our laboratory is 0.6-1 ml/min/g.The mean value of MBF increased from 0.72 +/- 0.33 ml/min/g with the stimulator off, to 0.80 +/- 0.33 ml/min/g with it on (p = 0.004). An increase in regional myocardial perfusion, with the stimulator on as opposed to off, was observed in 47 (62%) of the 75 regions studied. With the stimulator on, in comparison with off, the value of MBF increased from 0.45 +/- 0.11 ml/min/g to 0.56 +/- 0.19 (p = 0.0001) in the 35 regions with low basal MBF (< 0.6 ml/min/g), and from 0.77 +/- 0.14 ml/min/g to 0.92 +/- 0.29 ml/min/g (p = 0.013) in the 23 regions with basal MBF between 0.6 and 1 ml/min/g. Instead, in the 17 regions with high basal MBF (> 1 ml/min/g) it decreased with the stimulator on instead of off, going from 1.22 +/- 0.20 to 1.13 +/- 0.22 ml/min/g (p = 0.112).Our study suggests that the beneficial effects of SCS in refractory angina may also be related to an increase in mean MBF and to a redistribution of MBF between the regions with low or normal basal flow and the regions with high basal flow.
