Primary and reoperative parathyroid operations in hyperparathyroidism of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Operation and reoperation for hyperparathyroidism in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is controversial regarding surgical strategy, preoperative localization, and biochemical indexes of recurrence.Fifty patients with MEN 1 with hyperparathyroidism were followed up 2 to 27 years after subtotal (SPX n = 35) or total parathyroidectomy with forearm autografiing (TPXPersistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism was seen in 66% and 20% of patients after SPX involving extirpation of at least 3 glands and TPX, respectively, and 100% after single-gland excision as a primary procedure. After reoperation, hypercalcemia was reversed in 33% of patients by SPX and 61% by intended TPX procedures. All patients received vitamin D substitution after TPX, but restricted thyroid function allowed withdrawal in all but 10 patients (36%). Intact serum parathyroid hormone levels in nongrafted and grafted arms rose with time, but only exceptional ratios localized graft recurrence. Localization of recurrent hyperparathyroidism was achieved with 11C-labeled methionine positron emission tomography.MEN 1 hyperparathyroidism has a high risk of recurrence, and operation may include primarily SPX of at least 3 glands or TPX, although the latter includes a higher risk of long-term hypoparathyroidism. Reoperation should involve TPX with recognition of the enhanced recurrence rate in individuals with postoperative hyperparathyroidism.
