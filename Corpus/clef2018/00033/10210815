Cerebral blood flow velocity and perfusion in purulent meningitis: a comparative TCD and 99M-TC-HMPAO-SPECT study. In 15 patients (median age 33 years range 17-74 years) suffering from acute pneumococcal (10 cases) and meningococcal (five cases) meningitis, cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) was measured in the M1 - segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) by transcranial Doppler sonography, and cerebral perfusion changes were evaluated by 99m-Tc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime single photon emission computed tomography (HMPAO SPECT). The objective of the study was to test whether increased CBFV during the acute phase of purulent meningitis reflects hyperemia, and to evaluate focal perfusion abnormalities and their correlation to CBFV changes. In eight patients with marked side-differences in CBFVs during the acute phase of the disease SPECT scans were normal in five. In three patients unilateral perfusion defects correlated with the side of higher CBFV. In seven patients presenting with symmetrically elevated CBFV, SPECT scans were normal in four and revealed focal abnormalities in the remaining three. Follow up SPECT scans were normal in 14/15 patients. The results of our study suggest that elevated CBFV in acute bacterial meningitis does not reflect cerebral hyperemia. Focal cerebral perfusion defects occur independently from functional alterations in the cerebral macrovasculature. A causative pathophysiologic relationship of high CBFV and focal perfusion defects cannot be drawn from these data.
