PET study of the human foveal fixation system. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to investigate the functional anatomy of the foveal fixation system in 10 subjects scanned under three different conditions: at rest (REST), during the fixation of a central point (FIX), and while fixating the same foveal target during the presentation of peripheral visual distractors (DIS). Compared with the REST condition, both FIX and DIS tasks activated a common set of cortical areas. First, in addition to the involvement of the occipital visual cortex, both the frontal eye field (FEF) and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) were bilaterally activated. Right frontal activation was also found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the inferior part of the precentral gyrus, and the inferior frontal gyrus. These results suggest that both FEF and IPS may constitute the main cortical regions subserving bilaterally the foveal fixation system in humans. The remaining right frontal activations may be considered as part of the anterior attentional network, supporting a role for the right frontal lobe in the allocation of the attentional mechanisms. Compared with the FIX condition, the DIS task also revealed the perceptual and cognitive processes related to the presence of peripheral visual distractors during foveal fixation. In addition to a bilateral activation of the V5/MT motion-sensitive area, a right FEF-IPS network was activated which may correspond to the engagement of the visuospatial attention. Finally, normalized regional cerebral blood flow (NrCBF) decreases were also observed during both DIS and FIX condition performance. Such NrCBF decreases were centered in the superior and middle temporal gyri, the prefrontal cortex, and the precuneus and the posterior retrosplenial part of the cingulate gyrus.
