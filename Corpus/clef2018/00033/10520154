Malassezia pachydermatis: a review. Malassezia pachydermatis is of importance in both veterinary and human medicine. Its taxonomic status and physiological characteristics are now better understood. Skin disease associated with this lipophilic yeast is now commonly recognized, especially in dogs. However, further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms which allow this yeast to proliferate and induce disease. Skin colonization is common in pet carnivores which consequently constitute a source of M. pachydermatis for susceptible humans. In the future, the development of efficient typing systems should allow better understanding of the transmission mechanisms.
