On the oxygenation of hemoglobin in the human brain. We test three hypotheses arising from a model of oxygen delivery to brain tissue. The hypotheses claim that mitochondrial oxygen is negligible in brain tissue such that oxygen consumption depends solely on the mean capillary oxygen tension for a given capillary density that capillary density is adjusted to satisfy the average steady-state oxygen requirement
