Myocardial perfusion at rest and during stress. MR signal characteristics of persistent and reversible myocardial ischemia. Performance of combined rest/stress MR perfusion studies and the analysis of qualitative signal intensity parameters in comparison with 99mTc-SestaMIBI SPECT in patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD).Sixteen patients with CAD underwent MR myocardial perfusion assessment at rest and after dipyridamole-induced hyperemia. Qualitative parameters (SI increase, SI upslope) of the SI time-curves were evaluated and characteristics of normal, reversible and persistent hypoperfused myocardium as assessed by 99mTc-SestaMIBI SPECT were compared.Compared with the rest values, normal myocardium showed a significant increase of the SI upslope during hyperemia (P < 0.001), whereas persistent (P = 0.07) and reversible (P = 0.15) hypo-perfusions showed only minor changes. SI increase over baseline also showed a significant increase only in normal myocardium (P < 0.001). At rest, reversible ischemic areas showed no significant differences from normal myocardium, whereas during hyperemia SI increase was significantly lower (P = 0.02).Qualitative SI parameters of a combined rest/stress MR myocardial perfusion study allow to differentiate normal from reversibly or persistently hypoperfused myocardium.
