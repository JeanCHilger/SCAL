6-O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-6-O-desmethyldiprenorphine ([18F]DPN): synthesis, biologic evaluation, and comparison with [11C]DPN in humans. 6-O(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-6- -desmethyldiprenorphine ([18F]DPN) was developed and biologically evaluated. Results of animal experiments, binding studies in vivo, and a human PET study are reported and compared with those of [11C]DPN.[18F]DPN was obtained by 18F-fluoroethylation of 3-O-trityl-6-O-desmethyldiprenorphine and subsequent deprotection in good radiochemical yields (23% +/- 7% 100 min[18F]DPN shows high affinity to opioid receptors. Parametric images (impulse response function at 60 min) of this human study showed a binding pattern of [18F]DPN equal to that of a control group (n = 9 healthy volunteers) after administration of [11C]DPN.The advantage of the longer half-life of 18F will allow extended scanning periods, more flexible interventions (e.g., displacement studies), and DPN to be available to PET centers without an on-site cyclotron.
