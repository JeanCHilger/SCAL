A SPECT study of the effect of vagal nerve stimulation on thalamic activity in patients with epilepsy. The mechanism by which vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) exerts an anticonvulsant effect in humans is unknown. This study used (99m)Tc-HMPAO single photon emission tomography (SPECT) to examine the effects of VNS on regional cerebral activity in thalamic and insular regions. Seven subjects with epilepsy who had been receiving vagal nerve stimulation for at least 6 months underwent SPECT scanning with simultaneous scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recording. Subjects were studied in two states during VNS activity and during a comparison condition of VNS inactivity. A region of interest analysis demonstrated that rapid cycling stimulation (7 seconds on, 12 seconds off) was associated with relatively decreased activity in left and right medial thalamic regions. No systematic stimulation-related changes were observed on visual or spectral analysis of EEG data. The thalamus is involved in modulation of ongoing cortical EEG activity in animals. Our results support the hypothesis that VNS may exert an antiepileptic action by an effect on thalamic activity.
