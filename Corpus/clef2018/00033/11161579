Prostaglandin E2 concentrations in naturally occurring canine cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine the PGE2 concentration in naturally-occurring cancer in pet dogs and in canine cancer cell lines in order to identify specific types of canine cancer with high PGE2 production which could serve as preclinical models to evaluate anticancer strategies targeting PGE2. PGE2 concentrations were measured by enzyme immunoassay in canine melanoma, soft tissue sarcoma, transitional cell carcinoma, osteosarcoma, and prostatic carcinoma cell lines in 80 canine tumor tissue samples including oral melanoma (MEL), oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (TCC), lymphoma (LSA), mammary carcinoma (MCA), osteosarcoma (OSA), prostatic carcinoma (PCA)
