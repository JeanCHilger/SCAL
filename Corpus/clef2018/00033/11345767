A new protocol of dual energy acquisition on stress 201Tl and rest 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial scintigraphy. We carried out stress 201Tl (Tl) and rest 99mTc-tetrofosmin (TF) myocardial scintigraphy with dual energy acquisition in 24 patients with suspected ischemic heart disease performed coronary arteriography and elucidated the sensitivity of this method. One hour after light meal eating, TF (555 MBq) was injected intravenously at rest and after 3 minutes from injection of TF exercise or pharmacologic stress was performed. During stress Tl (111 MBq) was injected intravenously before end-point or at adequate point of pharmacologic stress. Dual energy acquisition using triple energy windows (TEW) was started after 5 minutes (early) and 4 hours (delayed) from stress. The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp) and accuracy (Ac) in diagnosis of non-infarcted branches by using Tl (early)-TF (rest) and Tl (early)-Tl (delayed) were 79% vs. 53% (Sn), 78% vs. 96% (Sp) and 79% vs. 71% (Ac) respectively. Accordance of uptake score of infarcted region between TF (rest) and Tl (delayed) was 70%. In conclusion, this protocol is seemed to be useful as usual protocol for detection of myocardial ischemia and viability during about only 1 hour.
