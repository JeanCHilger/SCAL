18F-FDG injections produced by a solid phase 18F-fluorination (FDG MicroLab): effects of 18F-FDG and the components on endotoxin and sterility tests. Effects of 18F-FDG and components of the injections on endotoxin tests (Limulus tests) and sterility tests (Blood culture system) were determined with 18F-FDG injections produced by a solid phase 18F-fluorination (FDG MicroLab, GE). 18F-FDG injections with endotoxins shortened the time for gelling (turbidimetry), compared with that of the control (saline). Blood culture systems inoculated with 18F-FDG injections and microorganisms showed positive results within 72 h of incubation for every species of microorganisms used in the present study (Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium sporogenes, Micrococcus luteus). These results were quite similar to those for the control samples inoculated with saline and the microorganisms. Consequently, 18F-FDG and the components of the injections produced by the present methods may not significantly affect the endotoxin tests and sterility tests.
