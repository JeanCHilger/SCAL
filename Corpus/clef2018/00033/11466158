Regional cerebral blood flow in cocaine- versus methamphetamine-dependent patients with a history of alcoholism. Although abuse of cocaine or methamphetamine usually takes place in the context of heavy drinking, there is little information on the effects of such substance use comorbidity on brain perfusion. We explored similarities and differences in the effects of these two drugs in combination with alcohol on brain function using SPECT. Global and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) were examined in 7 abstinent cocaine-dependent alcoholics (CDA mean age = 39.2 yr, S.D. = 9.2 yr), 7 abstinent methamphetamine-dependent alcoholics (MDA
