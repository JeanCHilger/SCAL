Brain metabolic changes associated with symptom factor improvement in major depressive disorder. Symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) have been linked to regional brain function through imaging studies of symptom provocation in normal control subjects and baseline studies of subjects with MDD. We examined associations between change in depressive symptom factors and change in regional brain metabolism from before to after treatment of MDD.Thirty-nine outpatients with MDD underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scanning before and after treatment with either paroxetine or interpersonal psychotherapy. Associations were determined between changes in regional brain metabolism and changes in four Hamilton Depression Rating Scale factors (anxiety/somatization [ANX], psychomotor retardation [PR], cognitive disturbance [COGN], and sleep disturbance) and two corresponding Profile of Mood States subscales (tension [TENS] and fatigue [FATIG]).Improvement in ANX, PR, TENS, and FATIG factors was associated with decreasing ventral frontal lobe metabolism. Improvement in ANX and TENS was also associated with decreasing ventral anterior cingulate gyrus (AC) and anterior insula activity, whereas improvement in PR was associated with increasing dorsal AC activity. COGN improvement was associated with increasing dorsolateral prefrontal cortex metabolism.Brain regions that show significant relationships with symptom provocation in normal control subjects have similar relationships with MDD symptoms as they improve with treatment.
