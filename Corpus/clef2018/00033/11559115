Expression of soluble form carp (Cyprinus carpio) ovarian cystatin in Escherichia coli and its purification. A DNA encoding thioredoxin-mature carp ovarian cystatin (trx-cystatin) fusion protein was ligated into a pET-23a(+) expression vector and then transformed into Escherichia coli AD494(DE3) expression host. After induction by isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, a high level of the soluble form of recombinant trx-cystatin was expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli. The recombinant trx-cystatin could be purified by Ni(2+)-NTA agarose affinity chromatography. The molecular mass (M) of the recombinant trx-cystatin was approximately 28 kDa composed of recombinant thioredoxin (16 kDa) and recombinant mature carp ovarian cystatin (12 kDa). Both recombinant trx-fused and mature carp ovarian cystatins were stable at pH 6-11. No obvious decrease in activity was observed even after 5 min of incubation at 60 degrees C. They exhibited papain-like protease inhibition activity comparable to that of the mature carp ovarian cystatin, which could inhibit papain and mackerel cathepsins L and L-like, but not cathepsin B.
