Synthesis of ring- and side-chain-substituted m-iodobenzylguanidine analogues. With the goal of developing MIBG analogues with improved targeting properties especially for oncologic applications, several radioiodinated ring- and side-chain-substituted MIBG analogues were synthesized. Except for 3-[(131)I]iodo-4-nitrobenzylguanidine and N-hydroxy-3-[(131)I]iodobenzylguanidine, the radioiodinated analogues were prepared at no-carrier-added levels from their respective tin precursors. The radiochemical yields generally were in the range of 70-90% except for 3-amino-5-[(131)I]iodobenzylguanidine for which a radiochemical yield of about 40% was obtained. While the silicon precursor N(1),N(2)-bis(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-N(1)-(4-nitro-3-trimethylsilylbenzyl)guanidine did not yield 3-[(131)I]iodo-4-nitrobenzylguanidine, its deprotected derivative, N(1)-(4-nitro-3-trimethylsilylbenzyl)guanidine was radioiodinated in a modest yield of 20% providing 3-[(131)I]iodo-4-nitrobenzylguanidine. Exchange radioiodination of 3-iodo-4-nitrobenzylguanidine gave 3-[(131)I]iodo-4-nitrobenzylguanidine in 80% radiochemical yield. No-carrier-added [(131)I]NHIBG was prepared from its silicon precursor N(1)-hydroxy-N(3)-(3-trimethylsilylbenzyl)guanidine in 85% radiochemical yield.
