Influence of the critical EEG pattern on blood flow variations measured by single photon computed emission tomography. Anatomo-electro-clinical correlation's using stereo-electro-encephalography (SEEG) or electro-cortico-graphy (EcoG) are the gold standard for delineating the epileptic zone (EZ) in patients with partial epilepsy. These two techniques reflect the temporal and spatial dimensions of the epileptic fit. More recently, ictal Single Photon Computed Tomography (SPECT) compared with interictal SPECT allows anatomo-clinical correlations. SPECT reflects variations of the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during the seizure. These variations of the rCBF are linked with the electrical activity but the relations between electrical activity and rCBF have not been well studied and it is still difficult to compare ictal/interictal SPECT with the SEEG and EcoG data to delineate the EZ. From the few published studies, we know that, if the injection of the SPECT tracer is performed at the onset of the seizure, while the fast ictal discharge is still going on, we shall observe a local hyperperfusion in the region where the discharge started and in the region where it propagated secondarily. If the tracer injection is performed late during the seizure, or after the end of it, we shall observe a local hypoperfusion in these regions, this has also a good localizing value. Time of injection must be known, as it represents a key issue for SPECT interpretation.
