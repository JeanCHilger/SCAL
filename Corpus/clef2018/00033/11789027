99mTc-Tetrofosmin pinhole-SPECT (P-SPECT) and radioguided sentinel node (SN) biopsy and in breast cancer axillary lymph node staging. We compared 99mTc-Tetrofosmin P-SPECT with radioguided SN biopsy in 101 T1/T2 BC pts to predict axillary lymph node status. The day before surgery all pts underwent lymphoscintigraphy (LS) to mark the SN, following subdermal injection of 99mTc-colloidal sulphur surrounding the breast lesion. LS was combined with pre and intraoperative gamma probe. Previously, all pts had also undergone P-SPECT. ALND was performed in all cases. The SN(s) was detected in 97/101 cases (96%) by LS and gamma probe in the 4 missed cases P-SPECT predicted lymph node status. In the 97 comparable cases, radioguided SN biopsy showed a slightly higher accuracy than P-SPECT (94.8% vs 93.8%), but a higher false-negative rate (14.3% vs 8.6%)
