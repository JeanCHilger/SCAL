Normal pressure hydrocephalus and cerebral blood flow: a review. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a neurological disease which poses both diagnostic and therapeutic problems for the clinician. The measurement and characterisation of cerebral blood flow has been proposed as a tool for resolving such problems as well as elucidating its pathophysiology. We review the results of studies in which this tool has been applied to normal pressure hydrocephalus patients and consider the merits of the techniques that have been utilised. Finally, consideration is given to feasible future studies and the methods that could be employed in the study of cerebral blood flow and metabolism in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus.
