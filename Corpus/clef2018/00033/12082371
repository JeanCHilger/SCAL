Imaging of thoracic occupational and environmental malignancies. The imaging features of occupational lung cancer are similar to those of nonoccupational cancer.

Mesothelioma remains a largely incurable tumor, though treatment options are expanding. CT, MRI, and PET scanning may all have complementary roles in staging mesothelioma.
