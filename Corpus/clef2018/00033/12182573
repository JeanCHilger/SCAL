Modulation of boradiazaindacene emission by cation-mediated oxidative PET. [reaction: see text] Bright green boradiazaindacene fluorescence is quenched by an oxidative photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the excited state fluorophore to the bipyridyl unit complexed to metal cations. The closed shell diamagnetic cation Zn(II) is one of the most effective quenchers of fluorescence in this system, demonstrating that the quenching is not simply related to the facilitated intersystem crossing. The molecule also acts as a NOR logic gate with two chemical inputs, TFA and Zn(II).
