Odorant differentiated pattern of cerebral activation: comparison of acetone and vanillin. Whether different odorous compounds (odorants) are processed by different cerebral circuits is presently unknown. A first step to address this complicated issue is to investigate how the cerebral regions mediating signals from olfactory (i.e., unimodal) odorants, differ from those mediating the olfactory + trigeminal (i.e., bimodal) odorants. [15O]-H2O-PET scans were conducted in 12 healthy females during three separate conditions: birhinal, passive smelling of: 1) the unimodal odorant vanillin 2) the bimodal odorant acetone
