Activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 by the nitric oxide-cGMP-cGMP-dependent protein kinase axis regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 13 in vascular endothelial cells. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are synthesized in response to diverse stimuli, including cytokines, growth factors, hormones, and oxidative stress. Here we show that the nitric oxide (NO) donor 2-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide (DEA-NO) and NO from murine macrophages transcriptionally regulate MMP-13 expression in vascular endothelial cells (BAEC). The cGMP analog, 8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP) mimicked the effect of NO, whereas incubation with the guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one, or the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) inhibitor phenyl-1,N (2)- etheno-8-bromoguanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer (PET) reduced the stimulatory effect of DEA-NO on the activation of the MMP-13 promoter. Overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKG1-alpha resulted in a 5- to 6-fold increase of the MMP-13 regulatory region over control cells. On the other hand, incubation with the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor 2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone (PD98059) significantly reduced DEA-NO and 8-Br-cGMP promoter activation and mRNA expression of MMP-13 in transfected BAEC. Moreover, a complex between PKG1-alpha and the G-protein Raf-1, an upstream activator of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway, was detected in cells overexpressing PKG1-alpha or treated either with DEA-NO or 8-Br-cGMP. Thus, we propose that the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway enhances MMP-13 expression by the activation of ERK 1,2. This effect of NO may be important in the context of pathophysiological conditions such as inflammation or atherogenesis [corrected].
