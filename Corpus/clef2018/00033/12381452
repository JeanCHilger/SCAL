Tc-99m]-sestamibi uptake and washout in locally advanced breast cancer are correlated with tumor blood flo. To determine the influence of breast tumor blood flow on MIBI kinetics, we compared MIBI uptake and washout to [O-15]-water PET estimates of blood flow in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.Prior to therapy, 37 patients underwent MIBI and [O-15]-water PET imaging 22/37 also had MIBI washout analysis. Twenty-five patients underwent serial imaging over the course of chemotherapy.MIBI uptake and blood flow had a significant positive correlation pre-therapy. The change in MIBI uptake over the course of therapy also correlated with the change in blood flow. The half-time of MIBI washout inversely correlated with blood flow, indicating faster MIBI washout with higher blood flow.Blood flow strongly influences early MIBI uptake and can be a factor affecting the rate of MIBI washout in breast tumors. We present a model of MIBI kinetics in tumors which forms a hypothesis for further mechanistic studies of MIBI uptake and washout in breast cancer.
