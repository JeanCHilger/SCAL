Expression, refolding, and activation of the catalytic domain of human blood coagulation factor XII. Human blood coagulation factor XII (FXII 80 kDa) contains a C-terminal serine protease zymogen domain, which becomes activated upon contacting a negative surface. Activated FXII (alphaFXIIa) brings about reciprocal activation of FXII and kallikrein that by further hydrolysis produces the free catalytic domain (betaFXIIa
