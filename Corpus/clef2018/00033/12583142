The research on applications of diagnostic software in single photon emission computed tomography. In this paper, the structure of software system, the principles of overlay programming and the running mechanism of the programs for the Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography(SPECT) made by French SOPHA MEDICAL Corp. are analyzed in detail. On this basis, a method of extending functions of the system is introduced too. All the results of the extension in software functions for organ volume determination and of the measurements for living animals have proved the correctness and reliability of the method.
