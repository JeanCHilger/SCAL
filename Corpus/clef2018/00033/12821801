Stereoscopic processing in the human brain as a function of binocular luminance rivalry. We investigated the neural substrates of a recent model of human stereodepth perception by obtaining measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using PET. Subjects experienced the perceptual properties of stereopsis by viewing rival-luminance stereograms displaying an identical random-dot pattern in their central portion while the backgrounds exhibited correspondent dots contrasting in black/white luminance. The stereoscopic vision induced by retinal luminance rivalry coincided with a significant elevation of rCBF in the dorsal visual pathway. Area V5 (MT) was activated bilaterally by the experimental condition while the remaining active loci were restricted to the right hemisphere. The neural sites that responded to this novel stereoscopic stimulus are similar to those activated by traditional stereograms containing horizontal disparities.
