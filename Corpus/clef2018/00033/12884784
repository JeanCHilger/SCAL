Evaluation of lesions of malignant lymphoma using histograms of regional SUV. We designed new evaluation method using histogram of regional standardized uptake value (SUV) of every pixels of box shape volume of interest (VOI) on 18F-FDG PET. We evaluate lung and liver of normal volunteers and also the lesions of 4 cases of patients with non Hodgikin's malignant lymphoma using this method. SUV of pixels of pretreatment lesions shows log-normal distribution, whereas SUV of lung and liver show normal shape distribution. The next day of chemotherapy, 2 cases of them showed changes of distribution pattern from long-normal to normal with decrease of component of higher SUV values. No remarkable changes of distribution pattern were observed on other 2 cases, whereas decrease of regional mean values and max values of SUV were observed. And these findings were continued to 3 weeks later. These findings suggest that regional evaluation using histograms of SUV gives additional and predictive information for tumor therapies soon after the end of course.
