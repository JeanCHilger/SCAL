Relation between microvolt-level T-wave alternans and cardiac sympathetic nervous system abnormality using iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We examined the relation between microvolt-level T-wave alternans and cardiac sympathetic nervous system abnormality using iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Our results strongly indicate that cardiac sympathetic denervation and accelerated sympathetic nervous activity play important roles in the presence of microvolt-level T-wave alternans in patients with idiopathic-dilated cardiomyopathy.
