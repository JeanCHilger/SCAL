Short-term memory dysfunction in Kleine-Levin syndrome. A previous investigation at our department of a young man with typical Kleine-Levin syndrome revealed short-term memory dysfunction as well as hypoperfusion of the temporal lobes on single photon emission tomography (SPECT) (CERETEC) examination, 6 and 7 years after recovery, suggesting long lasting or even permanent cerebral dysfunction.We investigated four cases with classical adolescent Kleine-Levin syndrome characterized by hypersomnia and typical associated symptoms. We used neuropsychological testing and SPECT (CERETEC) of the brain. The results from the previous report related to above is included.Examination with SPECT (CERETEC) during remission revealed hypoperfusion of the temporal lobes and fronto-temporal region in two of four cases. There were normal findings in two. Neuropsychological testing performed during remission showed reduction in the short-term memory capacity in all four cases.It is striking that all the cases investigated showed short-term memory dysfunction. One patient who had recovered from paroxysmal symptoms (hypersomnia attacks and bulimia) 6 years earlier showed progress in the short-term memory dysfunction. A pathologic condition in the temporal lobes may be suspected in Kleine-Levin syndrome.
