Expectation enhances the regional brain metabolic and the reinforcing effects of stimulants in cocaine abusers. The reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse result from the complex interaction between pharmacological effects and conditioned responses. Here we evaluate how expectation affects the response to the stimulant drug methylphenidate in 25 cocaine abusers. The effects of methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) on brain glucose metabolism (measured by [18F]deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography) and on its reinforcing effects (self-reports of drug effects) were evaluated in four conditions: (1) expecting placebo and receiving placebo (2) expecting placebo and receiving methylphenidate
