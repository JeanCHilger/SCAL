Radioimmunolocalization of head and neck tumors with a new monoclonal antibody against the EGF receptor. Preliminary results. To show the results of Radioimmunodetection (RID) using Cuban monoclonal antibody (MoA) anti-egf-ior-egf-r3 labeled with 99mTc for the detection of primary tumors and/or metastases of head and neck epithelial malignant tumors.Thirteen patients aged from 16-62 years (mean: 54.8 years) with primary tumors and metastases in the regional cervical lymph nodes were retrospectively evaluated. The labelling dose was 1480-2220 MBq (40-60 mCi). Planar images were performed after 10 minutes and together with SPECT images after 18-24 hours following MoA administration. The matrix was 128 x 128. SPECT images were reconstructed using the Butterworth 4/16 filter. A positive result was defined when the lesions were visualized.RID localized 11 of the known primary tumors in the 13 patients studied. In the two other patients, in whom the primary tumor site was unknown, cervical lymph node metastases were found. The results of 3 of the RID were false negative but in the other 10, RID was able to localize the primary tumor and cervical lymph node metastases. Sensitivity was 77 % and the predictive positive value was 100 %.The results of this study show that the Cuban MoA ior-egf-r3 can be employed for RID of primary head and neck tumors and their metastases. The radiation dose is adequate for RID.
