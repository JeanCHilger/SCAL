Positron emission tomography and its role in the evaluation of brain tumors. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a newly evolving, biological method for quantitative imaging of regional function and metabolism within various organs of the living human body. Whereas existing conventional tomographic imaging modalities--CT and MRI--provide only anatomical information, positron emission tomography provides quantifiable information about organ metabolism and function. Brain tumors are the disease entities for which positron emission tomography is most widely applied. PET has the great potential for providing clinically important information about disease processes. PET has not only had a major impact on the diagnostic role of radiology in brain tumors, but also has potential role for therapeutic application to brain brachytherapy.
