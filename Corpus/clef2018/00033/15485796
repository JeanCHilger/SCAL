Diagnostic value of 99mTc-MIBI brain SPECT for brain glioma. To evaluate the value of (99m)Tc-MIBI brain single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in diagnosis of glioma.Fifty-nine patients with glioma, 6 with brain abscess and 9 healthy controls underwent (99m)Tc-MIBI brain SPECT, and the diagnostic indices such as the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated. The tumor to non-tumor (T/NT) ratios were calculated according to the region of interest (ROI) and compared between the glioma group, healthy control group and brain abscess group by t test.Among the 59 cases of glioma, 51 showed positive results in (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT, along with one of the healthy controls and 4 of brain abscess patients. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the diagnosis were 86.4%, 66.7% and 82.4%, respectively. The T/NT ratio of brain glioma group was 2.6+/-1.2, significantly higher than that of normal group (t=3.6199, P<0.001) and brain abscess group (t=2.1327, P<0.05).(99m)Tc-MIBI brain SPECT is sensitive for diagnosis of brain glioma, and can distinguish malignant from benign lesions effectively.
