Diagnosis and therapy of diseases of the endocrine system: new trends in nuclear medicine. Diagnosis and therapy of endocrine disorders in nuclear medicine has been improved through the implementation of new techniques especially with positron emission tomography (PET). In modern concepts of parathyroid gland surgery an exact anatomic localisation of adenomas is necessary, which may be achieved with MIBI-Scintigraphy being the most sensitive method in primary hyperparathyroidism. The optimal access to localise adenomas is the investigation with combined SPECT/X-CT systems. The use of such systems for diagnosing neuroendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal system may also be helpful. For neoplasms of the adrenal gland PET systems could be used to differentiate between benign and malignant entities or to detect primary tumours. In case of incidentalomas J131-Norcholesterol and MIGB-scintigraphy has been proven helpful. Indications for nuclear medicine studies to detect abnormalities of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal system are established rarely.
