Photoinduced electron transfer reactivity of aza[60]fullerene: three discrete functionalization pathways with a single substrate. Azafullerenium carbocation, C59N+, shows photoinduced electron transfer (PET) reactivity toward benzyltrimethylsilane. The reaction between (C59N)2 and benzyltrimethylsilane gives three different aza[60]fullerene monoadducts depending on the reaction conditions used.
