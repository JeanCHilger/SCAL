Role of nuclear cardiology in advancing cardiac surgery. Cardiac surgeons are commonly faced with issues regarding the balance between the potential risk and the potential benefit of a surgical procedure. Nuclear cardiology procedures [myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) and positron emission tomography (PET)] provide the surgeon with objective information that augments standard clinical and angiographic assessments with respect to diagnosis, prognosis, and potential benefit from intervention. Development of the technology and methodology of gated MPS acquisition and interpretation allows assessment of the extent and severity of hypoperfused but viable myocardium, as well as global LVEF and LV volume measurements, diastolic function, and LV geometry. With PET, myocardial metabolism and blood flow reserve can also be measured. This chapter provides insight into the current evidence regarding settings in which nuclear cardiology procedures are helpful to the surgeon in assessment of patients having or being considered for cardiac surgery in the setting of coronary artery disease (CAD). Overall, a risk-benefit approach to MPS results is proposed, with principal focus on identifying patients at risk for major cardiac events who may benefit from a surgical procedure.
