Dobutamine stress echocardiography--methodology, clinical applications and current perspectives. Dobutamine stress echocardiography is often used as a non-invasive diagnostic modality for detection of coronary artery disease. In terms of accuracy it rivals SPECT scintigraphy. Application of non-coronary artery disease has made it an attractive diagnostic tool. However, like all diagnostic modalities it has its inherent limitations. Quantitation of stress echocardiography can resolve most of the problems surrounding its use.
