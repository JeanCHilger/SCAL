In vivo biodistribution of ginkgolide B, a constituent of Ginkgo biloba, visualized by MicroPET. The in vivo dynamic behavior of ginkgolide B (GB), a terpene lactone constituent of the Ginkgo biloba extracts, in the living animal was visualized by positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging using a GB analogue labeled with the positron emitter (18)F. The in vivo imaging studies, combined with ex vivo dissection experiments, reveal that GB exists in 2 forms in the body: the original GB with its lactone rings closed and a second form with one of the rings open. The original GB in plasma is taken up rapidly by various organs including the liver, the intestine and possibly the stomach. Consequently, in plasma, the proportion of the ionized form of GB increases dramatically with time. Thereafter the ratio between the 2 forms appears to shift slowly towards equilibrium. The results suggest that more attention needs to be focused on in vivo dynamics between the 2 forms of GB.
