Patients with known or suspected lung cancer: evaluation of clinical management changes due to 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) study. To determine prospectively from the referring physician's point of view the impact of F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-FDG PET) results on the management decisions in patients with known or suspected lung cancer.Seventy-five consecutive patients (58 men, 17 women age range, 33-82 yearsBefore the PET study, the planned management for the overall patient population was as follows: further diagnostic investigations in 44 cases (58%), medical therapy in 17 (23%), surgical treatment in nine (12%) and wait-and-see in five (7%). After the PET study, further diagnostic tools were indicated in 27 cases (36%), medical therapy in 17 (23%), surgical treatment in 28 (37%) and wait-and-see in three (4%). Relative to the initially planned strategy, changes in patient management after PET imaging occurred in 34 (45%) cases. Overall, the most relevant variation after PET concerned the surgical treatment strategy. The highest percentage (67%) of changes in management after PET was found in patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule the percentages of changes of the three patient groups were significantly different (chi-squared testIn patients with known or suspected lung cancer, F-FDG PET results determined significant variations in major clinical management decisions.
