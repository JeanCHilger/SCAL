Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: evaluation with positron emission tomography. The pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease remains under investigation, but may be related to increased inflammatory or cellular activity. This activity may be detectable with physiologic imaging.We investigated the role of physiologic imaging using (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scans in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).Seven male patients with histologically confirmed IPF underwent (18)FDG-PET scans. Scans were analyzed qualitatively and interpreted as positive or negative. Patients also underwent pulmonary function tests and computed tomography (CT) scans.The average total lung capacity was 71 +/- 22% predicted (mean +/- SD) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was 44 +/- 14% predicted. All had changes consistent with IPF on chest CT and 2 patients had ground glass attenuation. Six of seven patients (86%) had a positive (18)FDG-PET scan. Changes in the (18)FDG-PET scan were seen in 1 patient corresponding to changes in clinical status.Our findings suggest that (18)FDG-PET scans may be helpful in the evaluation of IPF. Increased activity suggests active disease and changes in response to therapy.
