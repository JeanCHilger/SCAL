Synthesis of nickel-monocarbollide complexes by oxidative insertion. Treatment of the 11-vertex carborane anion [closo-2-CB(10)H(11)](-) with Ni(0) reagents in tetrahydrofuran (THF) affords-via oxidative insertion reactions-12-vertex Ni(II) complexes, isolated as the salts [N(PPh(3))(2)][2,2-L(2)-closo-2,1-NiCB(10)H(11)] (L = CO (1a), CNBu(t) (1b), and CNXyl (1c Xyl = C(6)H(3)Me(2)-2,6)
