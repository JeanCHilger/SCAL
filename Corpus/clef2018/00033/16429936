Improvement in bone homeostasis following autologous chondrocyte implantation of the knee. This retrospective review and clinical follow-up demonstrates the effectiveness of autologous chondrocyte implantation of the knee. From September 1995 to June 2001, 24 patients with average follow-up of 26.5 months were evaluated. The mean Lysholm score improved from 43.58 before surgery to 71.42 at most recent follow-up, the modified Cincinnati knee score for overall clinician evaluation improved from 2.96 to 6.92, and the mean modified Cincinnati knee score for overall patient evaluation improved from 3.21 to 6.13 at P <.05. Seventy-nine percent of patients responded that they would have the same knee surgery again and 83% rated the results of their knee surgery as good to excellent. Limited radionuclide bone scans with single photon emission computed tomography were completed in 11 of the patients to assess the physiology and homeostasis of subchondral bone adjacent to treated articular cartilage defects. A trend was identified suggesting improvement in subchondral bone scores at a mean of 29.6-months follow-up compared to preoperative bone scan assessment. There also was a trend towards greatest improvement correlating with the patients with the best clinical scores. The results of this study suggest that autologous chondrocyte implantation of the knee can be successful in improving pain and function in patients with articular cartilage defects.
