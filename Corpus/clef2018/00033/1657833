New rapid analysis method demonstrates differences in 6-[18F] fluoro-L-dopa plasma input curves with and without carbidopa and in hemi-MPTP lesioned monkeys. Kinetic modeling of the PET tracer 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa ([18F]Dopa), used to measure presynaptic dopamine function, requires the accurate determination of the plasma input curve. We have developed a new method that uses alumina extraction preceded by cation and anion exchange resins to determine the parent compound, [18F]Dopa and its critical metabolite 3-O-methyl-6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa. Using this method we found that carbidopa increases the plasma input of [18F]Dopa while decreasing the rate of metabolite formation, and that previous drug treatment can significantly effect [18F]Dopa metabolism.
