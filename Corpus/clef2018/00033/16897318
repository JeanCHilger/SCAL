Longitudinally quantitative 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose micro positron emission tomography imaging for efficacy of new anticancer drugs: a case study with bortezomib in prostate cancer murine model. The aim of this study was to validate quantitative metabolic response of tumors to a treatment measured by longitudinal 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) micro positron emission tomography (microPET) as a robust tool for preclinical evaluation of new anticancer agents.Severe combined immunodeficiency mice with CWR22 xenografts were intravenously treated with bortezomib (Velcade) at 0.8 mg/kg on days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 and imaged with FDG microPET before, during and after treatment. Quantitative indices of tumor FDG uptake were developed.FDG microPET images successfully revealed the gradual reduction of tumor FDG uptake on day 4 onward despite no absolute tumor shrinkage. The standardized uptake values of FDG in tumors was reduced to 43% of the baseline values. Using the total tumor FDG uptake as the viable tumor burden, we found 86% tumor inhibition, compared to a 55% tumor growth inhibition in tumor volume measurement.FDG microPET imaging can provide an additional dimension of the efficacy of anticancer therapies that may otherwise be underestimated by tumor volume measurement.
