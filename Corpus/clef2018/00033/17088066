Synthesis, characterization, and in vivo skeletal localization of a new (99m)Tc-based multidentate phosphonate chelate: 5-Amino-1,3-bis(ethylamine-(N,N dimethyl diphosphonic acid) acetamido) benzene. The tetraphosphonate ligand, 5-amino-1,3-bis(ethylamine-(N,N-dimethyl diphosphonic acid) acetamido) benzene (IPTMP) used in the present study was prepared from 5-nitroisophthalate dimethylester to label with radionuclide for targeted diagnosis and therapy. The synthesized multidentate phosphonate ligand was characterized on the basis of spectroscopic techniques, which exhibited good metal ion control properties when complexed to (99m)Tc with high in vitro and in vivo stability. Excellent quality bone images of rabbit were imaged showing rapid clearance of background activity and visualization of skeleton at 1h.
