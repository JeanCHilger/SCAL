Writer's cramp: restoration of striatal D2-binding after successful biofeedback-based sensorimotor training. Previous studies of writer's cramp have detected cerebral sensorimotor abnormalities in this disorder and, more specifically, a reduced striatal D2-binding as assessed by [(123)I]IBZM SPECT. However, empirical data were lacking about the influence of effective biofeedback-based sensorimotor training on D2 receptor binding.To determine whether there is a restoration of D2-binding after successful sensorimotor treatment, pre- and posttreatment SPECTs were compared in five patients with writer's cramp and correlated with improvement in handwriting.After treatment, the clinical and electromyographic picture appeared substantially improved connected with a significant increase in D2-binding to nearly normal levels similar to normative data in age/sex-matched healthy subjects.The current study supported the view that writer's cramp results from a plastic adaptation of a rectifiable nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and that effective sensorimotor training leads to increased efficacy of striatal dopaminergic transmission.
