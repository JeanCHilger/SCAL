Considerations in treatment planning for esophageal cancer. Radiation therapy is an important component of the multidisciplinary management of esophageal cancer. In this article, we review the current approaches to achieving the desired dose to the esophagus and regional lymph nodes, with an emphasis on the dose constraints to adjacent normal structures, particularly the heart and lungs. The application of newer technologies such as positron-emission tomography/computed tomography scanning and intensity-modulated radiation therapy is also explored.
