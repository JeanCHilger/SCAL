Neural correlates of naming newly learned objects in MCI. Our objective was to study the neural correlates of naming of newly learned unfamiliar objects in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in age-matched controls, by using positron emission tomography (PET). Prior to the PET scanning, each subject underwent a 4-day long training period in which 40 names of rare unfamiliar objects were taught. The stimuli consisted of five categories: unfamiliar objects for which both the name and the definition (=semantic support) were given during training, unfamiliar objects with only the name given, unfamiliar objects with no information given, familiar objects and visual noise patterns. The unfamiliar objects mainly represented ancient domestic tools unknown to modern-day people. When naming newly learned objects trained without semantic support, the MCI group showed increased activation in the anterior cingulate when compared with the controls. Our results suggest that the naming of newly learned objects posed additional executive and attentional demands on the patients.
