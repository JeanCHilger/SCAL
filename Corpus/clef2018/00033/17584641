D2 receptor expression on immortalized human neural progenitor cell line hNPC-TERT in vitro and in vivo. To observe D(2) receptor expression on human neural progenitor cell line hNPC-TERT before and after transplantation into rabbit central nervous system.D(2) receptor expression on cultured hNPC-TERT cells was verified and quantitatively analyzed with immunofluorescence assay and receptor radio ligand binding assay, respectively. 3 x 10(6) hNPC-TERT cells were implanted in the spinal cord of New Zealand rabbit with HeLa cells as the control. Two days after implantation, positron-emission tomography (PET) scan with (11)C-raclopride as the radiotracer was performed in the living animals or for the isolated spinal cords, and cryosections of the spinal cord containing the implanted cells were prepared for immunofluorescence assay.Cultured hNPC-TERT cells showed high expression of D(2) receptor (Bmax=8 x 10(4)). PET scans of the rabbits identified visible radioactive accumulations at the site where hNPC-TERT cells were implanted but not at the site of HeLa cell implantation. Region of interest analysis showed a significant difference between the two cells in the maximal standard uptake value at the cell implantation sites. The results were further confirmed with ex vivo PET imaging of the spinal cord and tissue immunofluorescence assay.Human neural progenitor cells hNPC-TERT highly express dopamine D(2) receptors and retain this capacity after implantation into the spinal cord, suggesting their potential for treatment of such nerve system disease as Parkinson syndrome.
