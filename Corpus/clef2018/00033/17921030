Clinical acceptance of a molecular imaging agent: a long march with [99mTc]TRODAT. In the past 10 years, significant progress has been made in using a technetium-99m dopamine transporter imaging agent, [99mTc]TRODAT, for routine clinical studies. Developing a molecular imaging agent from bench to the bedside is more than a simple scientific venture. Currently, Taiwan is the only place where [99mTc]TRODAT is approved for routine clinical use in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The trials and tribulations of developing [99mTc]TRODAT for routine clinical use in Taiwan provide an interesting case study in how to (critics may say, how not to) develop a molecular imaging agent.
