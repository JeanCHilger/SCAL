Surveillance in testicular cancer: who, when, what and how? Surveillance as a management strategy in stage 1 testicular germ cell tumour (GCT) is increasing in popularity due to the recognition of the long-term side effects of treatment. Imaging, in particular computed tomography (CT), plays a central part in the surveillance protocols. There is a tendency towards less frequent use of imaging as supported by recent trials in non-seminomatous GCT but further studies are needed with respect to the assessment of seminoma and to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instead of abdominal CT.
