Cerebrovascular responses to incremental exercise during hypobaric hypoxia: effect of oxygenation on maximal performance. We sought to describe cerebrovascular responses to incremental exercise and test the hypothesis that changes in cerebral oxygenation influence maximal performance. Eleven men cycled in three conditions: 1) sea level (SL) 2) acute hypoxia [AH
