Triple antimicrobial therapy and acid suppression in dogs with chronic vomiting and gastric Helicobacter spp. Helicobacter pylori is a common cause of gastritis and peptic ulcers in humans. Many dogs, including those with gastritis and chronic vomiting, are infected with Helicobacter spp.Triple antimicrobial therapy will eradicate Helicobacter infection, improve gastritis, and reduce clinical signs. The addition of acid suppression medication will not improve results.Twenty-four pet dogs with chronic vomiting and gastric Helicobacter spp.Dogs were randomly assigned to triple antimicrobial therapy with or without famotidine. Gastroduodenoscopy was performed 4 weeks and 6 months after therapy. Helicobacter spp status was determined by histologic assessment of gastric mucosal biopsy specimens.Eradication rates for each treatment were not significantly different and combined were 75 and 42.9% at 4 weeks and 6 months, respectively. A greater improvement in gastritis scores occurred in dogs that became Helicobacter spp negative. Overall, the frequency of vomiting was reduced by 86.4%, but there were no differences between treatments.Eradication rates of Helicobacter spp with both treatments were not significantly different. Eradication rates at 6 months were modest, and more effective treatments should be developed. Acid suppression is not a necessary component of treatment protocols for dogs. Eradication of gastric Helicobacter spp was associated with improvement in gastritis scores. Dramatic reduction of the vomiting frequency occurred with both treatment protocols. Gastric Helicobacter spp may cause or contribute to chronic vomiting and gastritis in some dogs.
