Age-related decrease in cardiopulmonary adrenergic neuronal function in children as assessed by I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging. Radioiodinated metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging has been used to evaluate adrenergic nerve activity in different organs. Cardiac and pulmonary MIBG uptake is important in predicting the prognosis of certain cardiopulmonary diseases. It has been reported that cardiac MIBG uptake decreases with age and is significantly lower in the elderly. However, there has been no systemic study on age-related changes in cardiac and pulmonary MIBG uptake in children. This study was undertaken to determine the changes in MIBG uptake in the developing heart and lung in children and adolescents.MIBG scans of 44 children (16 female and 28 male age range, 2 months to 19 years) without abnormal uptake were selected from a large pool of patients with whole-body MIBG imaging performed for evaluation of neuroblastoma. All of the selected subjects had a normal physiologic distribution of MIBG and no history of heart or lung diseases. The patients were divided into 4 groups by age: group 1, 0 to 24 monthsCardiac and pulmonary MIBG uptake is inversely related to age in children.
