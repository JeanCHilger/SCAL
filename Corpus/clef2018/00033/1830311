Calcium-sensitive cls mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae showing a Pet- phenotype are ascribable to defects of vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase activity. Ca(2+)-sensitive mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae showing a Pet- phenotype (cls7-cls11) have lesions in a system for maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (Ohya, Y., Ohsumi, Y., and Anraku, Y. (1986) J. Gen. Microbiol. 132, 979-988). Genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated that these Pet- cls mutants are related to defects in vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase. CLS7 and CLS8 were found to be identical with the structural genes encoding subunit c (VMA3) and subunit a (VMA1), respectively, of the enzyme. In addition, these five mutants all had vma defects no vacuolar membrane ATPase activity was detected in the cls cells, and the cls mutants showed a loss of ability to acidify the vacuole in vivo. Measurements of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) in individual cells showed that the average [Ca2+]i in wild-type cells was 150 +/- 80 nM, whereas that in five Pet- cls cells was 900 +/- 100 nM. These data are consistent with the observation that vacuolar membrane vesicles prepared from the Pet- cls cells have lost ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake activities. The cls defects of vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase resulted in pleiotropic effects on several cellular activities, including Ca2+ homeostasis, glycerol metabolism, and phospholipid metabolism. The mutants showed an inositol-dependent phenotype, possibly due to alteration in regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis
