Effects of housing characteristics and home environmental factors on respiratory symptoms of 10,784 elementary school children from northeast china. Only few studies have assessed the relative impact of housing characteristics and home environmental factors on asthma and asthma-related symptoms in Chinese children, and to our knowledge, few studies have elaborated respiratory symptoms and allergies in this context.It was the aim of this study to assess the effects of housing characteristics, pet keeping, home decorations and other indoor environmental factors on respiratory health of Chinese children.We studied 10,784 children (6-13 years old) from 12 districts in Liaoning province, Northeast China. Information on respiratory health, housing characteristics and environmental pollution was obtained by a standard questionnaire from the American Thoracic Society.Prevalence of asthma-related symptoms was higher for those living along the main stem of traffic, and for those with a house nearby a pollution source. Lower prevalence rates of respiratory morbidity were associated with households with a bigger area of residence and more rooms. Pet keeping was associated with doctor-diagnosed asthma (OR = 1.52 95% CI 1.25-1.84). Home decorations also increased the risk of doctor-diagnosed asthma (OR = 1.72Home environmental factors are particularly important for the development of respiratory morbidity among children.
