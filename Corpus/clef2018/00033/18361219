The role of myocardial scintigraphy in the assessment of coronary artery disease. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the assessment of myocardial perfusion was introduced in the early 1970s, following pioneer studies of Gould et al. It has rapidly become one of the most used noninvasive technique for the assessment of myocardial ischemia. Thanks to the current technetium based tracers that allow electrocardiogram gated synchronization, it is possible to assess the regional ventricular systolic function and the evaluation of myocardial perfusion as well. In the last twenty years, beyond its diagnostic role, myocardial SPECT has become also a prognostic technique. Indeed, it has acquired a role for the short-term prediction of major coronary events in a large cohort with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of this review is to give an update of the correct use and interpretation of myocardial SPECT in patients with known or suspected CAD and without left ventricular dysfunction.
