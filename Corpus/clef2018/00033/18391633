Recent developments in urologic oncology: positron emission tomography molecular imaging. Traditional morphologically based imaging modalities in uro-oncology are now being complemented by the functional and molecular imaging technique positron emission tomography (PET). This review highlights the most important recent developments.Prostate cancer: PET imaging with the new radiotracers 11C-choline, 18F-fluorocholine, and 11C-acetate show promising results. The role of anti-1-amino-3-18F-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid remains to be elucidated further. 18F-fluoride PET is useful for the detection of bone metastases. Bladder cancer: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT with delayed images after a diuretic and oral hydration may improve detection of locally recurrent or residual bladder tumours. Both 18F-FDG PET and 11C-choline PET may be useful for staging of bladder cancer. Renal cancer: 18F-FDG PET has a role in staging and restaging of the disease. Recently, 124I-cG250 PET has shown promising results in the detection of clear-cell renal carcinoma. Testicular cancer: 18F-FDG PET is useful in staging and follow-up after treatment. There are no important recent developments with new radiopharmaceuticals in testicular cancer.The utility of PET molecular imaging in uro-oncology expanded due to the new metabolic PET tracers with more favourable properties.
