Imaging of thymic epithelial neoplasms. Thymic epithelial neoplasms are uncommon lesions. Affected patients may be asymptomatic or may present with thoracic complaints or paraneoplastic syndromes. Asymptomatic lesions may be discovered incidentally during chest radiography or during other chest imaging studies. This article addresses the imaging evaluation of patients who have thymic epithelial neoplasms, specifically covering the use of chest radiography, CT, MRI, and positron emission tomography.
