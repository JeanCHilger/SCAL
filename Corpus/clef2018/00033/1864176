99mTc-CPI myocardial perfusion tomography for evaluation of coronary artery disease. Stress 99mTc-carbomethoxy isopropyl isonitrile myocardial perfusion tomography (Tc-CPI MPT) was performed in 24 controls with normal coronary arteriograms or stenosis less than 50% and 30 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (stenosis greater than 50%). The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CAD with Tc-CPI MPI was 90% and 96% respectively. The sens by Tc-CPI MPI was 89% for the patients with one-vessel involvement, 88% for two-vessel involvement, 100% for three-vessel involvement. The sens for the detection of LAD, LCX and RCA involvement was 86%, 86% and 80% respectively. The spec were 100%, 100% and 91% respectively. It is concluded that TC-CPI MPT is a valuable technique for diagnosing CAD.
