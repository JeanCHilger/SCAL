(18)F]-labeled isoindol-1-one and isoindol-1,3-dione derivatives as potential PET imaging agents for detection of beta-amyloid fibril. In this study a novel series of isoindol-1-one and isoindol-1,3-dione derivatives for beta-amyloid-specific binding agents is described. Twelve compounds were synthesized and evaluated via a competitive binding assay with [(125)I]TZDM against beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta42) aggregates. Two new [(18)F]-labeled isoindole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as potential beta-amyloid imaging probes based on the in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles. The preliminary results suggest that these [(18)F]18b and [(18)F]18c are promising positron emission tomography (PET) imaging probes for studying accumulation of Abeta fibrils in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.
