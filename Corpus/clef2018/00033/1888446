Assessment of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in ischemic stroke using Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT--comparison with CT and MR findings. To assess the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in ischemic stroke, we analyzed the findings of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using technetium-99m hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (Tc-99m HMPAO). The SPECT images revealed abnormal areas of decreased perfusion in 29 out of 31 subjects (93.5%), which represented a higher detection rate than those for CT and MR (89.5%, respectively). Also, the areas of decreased perfusion were frequently larger than the lesions on CT and MR. Areas of decreased perfusion remote from the CT/MR lesions were found in 10 patients, including 8 with crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD). Thus, studies of rCBF by Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT can be useful in the assessment of ischemic stroke.
