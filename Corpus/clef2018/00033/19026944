In vivo imaging of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 in pancreas using an (18)F epoxide derivative of tetrabenazine. Development of imaging agents for pancreatic beta cell mass may provide tools for studying insulin-secreting beta cells and their relationship with diabetes mellitus. In this paper, a new imaging agent, [(18)F](+)-2-oxiranyl-3-isobutyl-9-(3-fluoropropoxy)-10-methoxy-2,3,4,6,7,11b-hexahydro-1H-pyrido[2,1-a]isoquinoline [(18)F](+)4, which displays properties targeting vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) binding sites of beta cells in the pancreas, was evaluated as a positron emission tomography (PET) agent for estimating beta cell mass in vivo. The hydrolyzable epoxide group of (+)4 may provide a mechanism for shifting biodistribution from liver to kidney, thus reducing the background signal.Both (18)F- and (19)F-labeled (+) and (-) isomers of 4 were synthesized and evaluated. Organ distribution was carried out in normal rats. Uptake of [(18)F](+)4 in pancreas of normal rats was measured and correlated with blocking studies using competing drugs, (+)dihydrotetrabenazine [(+)-DTBZ] or 9-fluoropropyl-(+)dihydro tetrabenazine [FP-(+)-DTBZ, (+)2].In vitro binding study of VMAT2 using rat brain striatum showed a K(i) value of 0.08 and 0.15 nM for the (+)4 and (+/-)4, respectively. The in vivo biodistribution of [(18)F](+)4 in rats showed the highest uptake in the pancreas (2.68 %ID/g at 60 min postinjection). In vivo competition experiments with cold FP-(+)-DTBZ, (+)2, (3.5 mg/kg, 5 min iv pretreatment) led to a significant reduction of pancreas uptake (85% blockade at 60 min). The inactive isomer [(18)F](-)4 showed significantly lower pancreas uptake (0.22 %ID/g at 30 min postinjection). Animal PET imaging studies of [(18)F](+)4 in normal rats demonstrated an avid pancreatic uptake in rats.The preliminary results suggest that the epoxide, [(18)F](+)4, is highly selective in binding to VMAT2 and it has an excellent uptake in the pancreas of rats. The liver uptake was significantly reduced through the use of the epoxide group. Therefore, it may be potentially useful for imaging beta cell mass in the pancreas.
