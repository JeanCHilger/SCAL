Imaging of the chest. Imaging of the chest made considerable progress over the past twenty years. Nevertheless, a chest X-ray remains one of the most informative and hence frequently used diagnostic procedures in daily medical practice. The choice of additional imaging techniques has to be based on pertinent differential diagnostic considerations. Basic knowledge of the various radiological techniques facilitates and improves the diagnostic process and a common terminology enhances the communication between the clinician and the radiologist. Modern radiological procedures are less invasive as compared to some historical procedures, are well tolerated by the patients and have a high sensitivity and specificity.
