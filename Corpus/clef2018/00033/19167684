Phase II study of risk-adapted therapy of newly diagnosed, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma based on midtreatment FDG-PET scanning. In newly diagnosed aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a positive midtreatment fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scan often carries a poor prognosis, with reported 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rates of 0% to 30% after standard therapy. To determine the outcome of early treatment intensification for midtreatment PET-positive disease, a phase II trial of risk-adapted therapy was conducted. Fifty-nine newly diagnosed patients, 98% with B cell lymphoma, had PET/CT performed after 2 or 3 cycles of first-line chemotherapy. Those with negative PET on semiquantitative visual interpretation completed standard therapy. Those with positive PET received platinum-based salvage chemotherapy, high-dose therapy, and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Midtreatment PET was positive in 33 (56%) 28 received ASCT with an actuarial 2-year EFS of 75% (95% confidence interval, 60%-93%). On intention-to-treat analysis, 2-year EFS was 67% (53%-86%) in all PET-positive patients and 89% (77%-100%) in PET-negative patients. No association was found between the International Prognostic Index category and the midtreatment PET result. The favorable outcome achieved here in historically poor-risk patients warrants further, more definitive investigation of treatment modification based on early PET scanning.
