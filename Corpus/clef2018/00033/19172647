Functional brain areas associated with manipulation of a prehensile tool: a PET study. Using PET, brain areas representing the use of a well-learned tool (chopsticks) were investigated in 10 normal common users. The experimental task was to hold the tool in their right hand and use it to pick up and transport a small pin from a table. Data for the same task performed using only the fingers were also obtained as a control. The results showed an extensive overlap in activated areas with and without the use of the tool. The tool-use prehension, compared to the finger prehension, was associated with higher activities in the caudal-ventral premotor, dorsal premotor, superior parietal, posterior intraparietal, middle temporal gyrus, and primary sensory, occipital cortices, and the cerebellum. These are thus considered to be the human cortical and subcortical substrates representing the use of the tool studied. The activity of the posterior intraparietal area was negatively correlated with the number of drops of the pin, whereas occipital activity was positively correlated with the same error parameter. The caudal-ventral premotor and posterior intraparietal areas are together known to be involved in tool use-related modulation in peripersonal space. The correlation results suggest that this modulation depends on the level of performance. The coactivated left middle temporal gyrus further suggests that familiarity with a tool as well as the knowledge about its usage plays a role in peripersonal space modulation. Superior parietal activation, along with occipital activation, indicates the involvement of visual-spatial attention in the tool use, possibly reflecting the effect of interaction between the prehension (task) and the tool.
