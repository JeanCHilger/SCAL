High tumor metabolic activity as measured by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is associated with poor prognosis in limited and extensive stage small-cell lung cancer. We investigated the prognostic effect of incorporating metabolic assessment by (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose uptake on positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) into a conventional staging system in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).Seventy-six consecutive patients with pathologically proven SCLC were enrolled. All patients underwent standard treatment after pretreatment (18)F-FDG-PET/CT scanning. The mean values of maximal standardized uptake values (meanSUV(max)) of the malignant lesions upon (18)F-FDG-PET/CT were calculated. The Cox proportional hazards model was used with performance status, lactate dehydrogenase, stage, and meanSUV(max).Patients with high meanSUV(max) were significantly related with the established poor prognostic factors, such as higher lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.04) and extensive disease (ED P = 0.01). Furthermore, in multivariate analysis, patients with high meanSUV(max) were associated with poor survival outcomes compared with patients with low meanSUV(max) [adjusted hazard ratio, 3.74In SCLC, tumor metabolic activity as assessed by FDG-PET is a significant prognostic factor and identifies subgroups of patients at higher risk of death in both LD and ED SCLC.
