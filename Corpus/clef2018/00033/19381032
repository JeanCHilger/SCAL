Concurrent chemoradiation experience of the local relapse of rectal cancer patients. We have reported the concurrent chemoradiation experience of local relapse of rectal cancer patients. From October 2004 to January 2007 we have treated consecutive 10 patients with radiation and the concurrent chemotherapy by CPT-11+S-1. Of 10 lesions, 5(50%)had a complete response, 2(20%)a partial response, 3(30%)a stable disease, yielding an overall response rate of 70%. Three year survival and relapse free survival was 64% and 22 months, respectively. Four patients live without cancers, 3 patients died with cancers and 2 patients live with cancers. Three patients had acute complication(more than Grade 2)including 3 appetite losses. The concurrent chemoradiation is feasible for out-patients and seems to offer good results for the local relapse of rectal cancer patients.
