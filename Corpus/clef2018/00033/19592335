PET/CT based radiotherapy treatment planning in head and neck cancers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the experiences of PET/CT based radiation planning in patients suffering from head and neck cancer. PET/CT based 3D-conformal irradiation was used in eleven patients between March 2008 and February 2009. In six of the eleven cases the therapeutic plan was modified after PET/CT examination, as the previously determined lymph node negative state proved to be lymph node positive. For that reason, the treatment needed to be completed by chemotherapy and in some cases clinical target volume and planning target volume have been also modified. PET/CT examination has a decisive influence on therapeutic planning and on the planning process in patients with head and neck cancer.
