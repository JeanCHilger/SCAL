Pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of stereoisomers in radiopharmacy. Nowadays stereochemistry and biologic stereospecificity are involved in the search for new radiopharmaceuticals. This article reviews: 1) The factors involved in selective distribution of stereoisomers: first-pass effect, binding to plasma proteins, enzyme effect and membrane transport 2) the distinction between pharmacologic specific receptors and acceptor sites
