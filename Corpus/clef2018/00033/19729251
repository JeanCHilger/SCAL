Autotransplantation of cryopreserved minor salivary glands: a new approach for management of radiation-induced xerostomia. To date, it still is impossible to successfully prevent radiation-induced xerostomia. Therefore, further research, particularly regarding treatment, is urgently warranted. Lower labial mucosa with its submucosal minor salivary glands (MSGs) of approximately 2.5 x 3 cm can be prepared by means of a surgical knife or Ellman Surgitron high-frequency/low-temperature radiosurgical device. Also we can consider area of the palatine fovea to find and remove MSGs. We can find locations containing more MSGs via scintigraphy techniques and positron emission tomography. Removing of MSGs can be done 1-2 weeks before start of radiotherapy. Subsequently the MSGs containing complex graft should be cryopreserved via liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. Autotransplantation surgery will be carried out 2-3 months after radiotherapy. The frozen tissue could be thawed rapidly in a 37 degrees C water bath for 2-3 min. Host site should be as far as possible to the radiation zone and has a good blood supply. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (30 treatment sessions before and 10 sessions after re-implantation) is strongly recommended. An aggressive short or medium-term antibiotic treatment will necessary to avoid infection. Immunosuppressive treatment will not require. The main criticism with this hypothesis is viability and usefulness of MSGs containing graft, after being frozen and subsequently thawed.
