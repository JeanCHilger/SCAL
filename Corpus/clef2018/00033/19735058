Chemotherapy with paclitaxel and gemcitabine in progressive medullary and thyroid carcinoma of the follicular epithelium. Nine patients (mean age 53) with metastasizing, progressive, medullary (MTC), thyroid carcinoma and progressive, nonradioiodine accumulating thyroid carcinoma of the follicular epithelium (follicular carcinoma, FTC and papillary carcinoma, PTC) were treated with a combination of paclitaxel and gemcitabine between 2004 and 2006. Tumors were histologically classified as follicular in 5 patients (56%), as papillary in 2 patients (22%), and medullary in 2 patients (22%). Paclitaxel (90-100 mg/m (2)) and gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m (2)) were applied for two, three, or 6 cycles every three weeks, depending on response and side effects. The effect of therapy was evaluated by radiographic imaging (CT images) and [(18)F]FDG-PET. All patients with papillary, follicular, or medullary thyroid carcinoma had continuous progression during restaging 14.8+/-8.8 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy, including one patient with stable disease after 3 cycles, but continuous progression after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Paclitaxel and gemcitabine are not a valid chemotherapy option, in particular in patients with progressive, nonradioiodine-accumulating follicular thyroid carcinoma, who were already treated by other chemotherapeutic agents.
