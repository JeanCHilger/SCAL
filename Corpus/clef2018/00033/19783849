Risk assessment of importation of dogs infected with Echinococcus multilocularis into the UK. A risk assessment was undertaken to assess the likelihood of importation of dogs infected with Echinococcus multilocularis should the requirement for treatment with praziquantel be relaxed under the Pet Travel Scheme. The analysis suggested that for every 10,000 dogs going on a short trip to Germany, the probability of at least one returning to the UK infected is approximately 98 per cent. If the dogs had been longer-term residents, this probability rises to over 99 per cent. This indicates that if praziquantel treatment of dogs on importation into the UK is abandoned, then it is almost inevitable that E multilocularis will be introduced.
