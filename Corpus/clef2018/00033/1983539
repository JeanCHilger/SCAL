Percutaneous endoscopic tracheostomy. Between 6/88 and 8/89 61 critically ill patients (sepsis, ARDS, pneumonia, multiple trauma, etc.) underwent elective percutaneous endoscopic tracheostomy (PET). Following dilation up to 36 Fr. a number 6-10 tracheostomy tube was introduced. The patients were ventilated 17 (2-68 days) before and 28 (4-160) days after PET. One patient died from cardiac arrest, and in 4 patients, because of tube obstruction or cuff defect, reintubation was necessary. Additionally 2 significant infections and a minor bleeding and a emphysema occurred. Elective percutaneous tracheostomy performed in the ICU seems to be a simple and cost-effective procedure.
