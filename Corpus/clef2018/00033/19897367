Bioisosterism of urea-based GCPII inhibitors: Synthesis and structure-activity relationship studies. We report a strategy based on bioisosterism to improve the physicochemical properties of existing hydrophilic, urea-based GCPII inhibitors. Comprehensive structure-activity relationship studies of the P1' site of ZJ-43- and DCIBzL-based compounds identified several glutamate-free inhibitors with K(i) values below 20nM. Among them, compound 32d (K(i)=11nM) exhibited selective uptake in GCPII-expressing tumors by SPECT-CT imaging in mice. A novel conformational change of amino acids in the S1' pharmacophore pocket was observed in the X-ray crystal structure of GCPII complexed with 32d.
