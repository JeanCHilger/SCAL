Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by lymph nodes of HIV patients is inversely related to CD4 cell count. To assess prospectively the relationship between fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by lymph nodes, the number of sites of lymph node involvement and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell count. An inverse relationship, if existing, between these variables would provide indirect support for the concept of homing induced apoptosis.We evaluated the intensity and extent of fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in lymph nodes of HIV patients under antiviral treatment by means of PET imaging. Quantitative results obtained were related to CD4 cell count and viral loads. Correlation analysis was performed using a nonparametric test and correction for multiple comparisons.Predominant sites of lymph node involvement were the cervical and axillary regions, followed by the inguinal region. CD4 cell count was inversely correlated to the average of the averaged standardized uptake values (SUV) of involved lymph nodes and to the number of sites of lymph node involvement. Viral load was positively correlated to the average of the averaged SUV-mean values of involved lymph nodes and also to the number of sites of lymph nodes involved. An inverse correlation between CD4 cell count and viral load was identified.The inverse relationship between CD4 cell count and the average of the averaged SUV-mean values of involved lymph nodes and between CD4 cell count and the number of sites of lymph node involvement observed, indirectly supports the theory of CD4 cell depletion through forced lymph node homing.
