Synthesis and characterization of iodinated tetrahydroquinolines targeting the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPR30. A series of iodo-substituted tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinolines was synthesized as potential targeted imaging agents for the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPR30. The affinity and specificity of binding to GPR30 versus the classical estrogen receptors ER alpha/beta and functional responses associated with ligand-binding were determined. Selected iodo-substituted tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinolines exhibited IC(50) values lower than 20 nM in competitive binding studies with GPR30-expressing human endometrial cancer cells. These compounds functioned as antagonists of GPR30 and blocked estrogen-induced PI3K activation and calcium mobilization. The tributylstannyl precursors of selected compounds were radiolabeled with (125)I using the iodogen method. In vivo biodistribution studies in female ovariectomized athymic (NCr) nu/nu mice bearing GPR30-expressing human endometrial tumors revealed GPR30-mediated uptake of the radiotracer ligands in tumor, adrenal, and reproductive organs. Biodistribution and quantitative SPECT/CT studies revealed structurally related differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles, target tissue uptake, and metabolism of the radiolabeled compounds as well as differences in susceptibility to deiodination. The high lipophilicity of the compounds adversely affects the in vivo biodistribution and clearance of these radioligands and suggests that further optimization of this parameter may lead to improved targeting characteristics.
