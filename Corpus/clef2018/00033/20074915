The functional neuroanatomy of mental pain in depression. This study aimed at determining the functional neuroanatomy of mental pain, a hitherto neglected symptom in the study of depression, which according to DSM-IV is stronglylinked with suicide. Mental pain (measured with the Orbach & Mikulincer Mental Pain Scale), suicidal ideation (measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression), hopelessness (measured using Beck's Hopelessness Scale), and regional cerebral blood flow as measured with single photon emission computed tomography were assessed in 39 depressed individuals. Levels of mental pain were significantly and positively associated with suicidal ideation and levels of hopelessness. When compared with patients with low levels of mental pain, those with high levels of mental pain showed relatively increased perfusion in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, occipital cortex and inferior frontal gyrus and in the left inferior temporal gyrus, and relatively decreased perfusion at the medulla. The findings indicate that mental pain in depressed patients is associated with an increased risk of suicide and that high levels of mental pain are associated with changes in perfusion in brain areas that are involved in the regulation of emotions. Further study is warranted to understand whether this association reflects increased emotional processing or decreased cognitive control over mental pain in depressed individuals.
