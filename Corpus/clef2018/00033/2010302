CT-SPECT fusion for analysis of radiolabeled antibodies: applications in gastrointestinal and lung carcinoma. Fusing or image registration improves the information obtained by correlating images from various imaging modalities. We "fused" radiolabeled antibody SPECT with CT in patients with colorectal or lung cancer. We identified corresponding landmarks on cross-sectional images and used standard graphics algorithms for untilting to match planes of reconstruction and for two-dimensional warping or transformation of images or regions of interest. Fusing localizes activity on SPECT to specific anatomic structures and decreases SPECT false positives and CT false negatives.
