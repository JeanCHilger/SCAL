Myocardial MIBG scintigraphy: a useful clinical tool? : A retrospective study in 50 parkinsonian patients. Meta-iodbenzylguanidine scintigraphy (MIBG scintigraphy) shows reduced uptake in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD), but not in other parkinsonian or dementia syndromes. We retrospectively reevaluated 50 patients. Concordance rate between last clinical diagnosis and scintigraphy diagnosis was only given in two-thirds of the patients. Confounding factors were: decreasing heart/mediastinum ratio (HMR) with progressive age, higher HMR in women and possibly interference with antihypertensive medication. Standardization of the methods and precise clinical guidelines are warranted for better clinical use.
