Imaging brain trauma. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in children and young adults, yet effective treatments are lacking, in part because critical aspects of TBI neurobiology and natural history are not understood. We review recent advances in neuroimaging and discuss how they are helping to address these fundamental gaps.Novel imaging methods provide detailed information on how TBI affects anatomical integrity (diffusion tensor imaging voxel-based morphometryRefinements in neuroimaging offer a window into the complex neuroanatomical and neurophysiological disturbances induced by TBI. Research is needed to understand how these alterations evolve with time and in response to therapeutic interventions.
