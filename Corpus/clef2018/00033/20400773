The determination of patient dose from (18)F-FDG PET/CT examination. The use of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) system has heightened the need for medical diagnosis. However, the patient dose is increasing in comparison to whole-body PET/CT dose. The aim of this study is to determine the patient effective dose in 35 oncology Thai patients with the age range of 28-60 y from PET scan using [fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and from CT scan. Cumulated activity and residence time of various organs were calculated from time-activity curves by using S-value based on the body mass. Mean organ absorbed dose and the effective dose from CT scan were calculated using the Medical Internal Radiation Dosimetry method and Monte Carlo simulation, respectively. The average whole-body effective doses from PET and CT were 4.40 + or - 0.61 and 14.45 + or - 2.82 mSv, respectively, resulting in the total patient dose of 18.85 mSv. This can be used as the reference dose in Thai patients.
