In vivo imaging and monitoring of transplanted stem cells: clinical applications. Regenerative medicine using stem cells has appeared as a potential therapeutic alternative for coronary artery disease, and stem cell clinical studies are currently on their way. However, initial results of these studies have provided mixed information, in part because of the inability to correlate organ functional information with the presence/absence of transplanted stem cells. Recent advances in molecular biology and imaging have allowed the successful noninvasive monitoring of transplanted stem cells in the living subject. In this article, different imaging strategies (direct labeling, indirect labeling with reporter genes) to study the viability and biology of stem cells are discussed. In addition, the limitations of each approach and imaging modality (eg, single photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and MRI) and their requirements for clinical use are addressed. Use of these strategies will be critical as the different regenerative therapies are being tested for clinical use.
