Imaging diagnostics of the prostate. Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy of men with approximately 32,000 new cases of prostate cancer in Germany and approximately 11,000 men who would die of the disease each year. For early diagnosis of prostate cancer PSA testing is used, whereas at present screening cannot be recommended due to the lack of confirmed medical and economic benefits. Regarding the imaging modalities, ultrasound of the prostate, currently performed in combination with elastography and histoscanning, magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate in combination with endorectal coils and positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET-CT) are the methods of choice. Using these methods benign prostatitis can be differentiated from prostate cancer and staging of the tumor can be accomplished. On the other hand using these imaging methods it is possible to define the dominant intraprostatic lesion with different sensitivities and specificities, which is important for minimally invasive therapeutic strategies.
