 Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is the formation of blood clots in veins and is also known as venous thromboembolism (VT), is preventable, yet it occurs in the lower extremities of approximately two million Americans each year (1). A majority of DVT patients will experience pulmonary embolism (PE ~30% are symptomatic, and another 40% are asymptomatic and at high risk) because the blood clot is unstable and can travel to, and lodges in, the lungs. An estimated 100,000 individuals are reported to die every year as a result of PE, and an equal number of people may die from PE-associated conditions such as heart disease and cancer (1). Contrast-enhanced venography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of DVT, but compression ultrasonography is usually the most common technique used to detect VT in the lower extremities. The primary limitation of these procedures is that neither technique can distinguish between chronic and unstable thrombi (2). Formation of a blood clot is a complex process that requires recruitment of platelets (thrombocytes are cytoplasmic bodies derived from megakaryocytes and have many other functions besides facilitating blood clot formation) for the formation of a thrombus, and the process is described in detail elsewhere (3). One of the important components of the blood clotting process is platelet activation, which leads to the expression of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor (GPIIb/IIIa receptor) that binds fibrinogen and promotes plateletâ€“platelet interaction, resulting in platelet aggregation and the formation of a secure plug. Several investigators have used radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies targeting fibrin and platelets to identify acute thrombi in humans, but these molecules have limited use because they are cumbersome to manufacture, are large in size, have a long blood circulation time, and present a danger of developing human antibodies directed against mouse antibodies (HAMA) (4). These limitations can be alleviated by the use of synthetic peptides that are much smaller than the monoclonal antibodies, are cleared quickly from circulation, and do not have a potential to produce the HAMA response. In this regard, synthetic peptides containing or mimicking the arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) sequence were shown to specifically bind the GPIIb/IIIa receptor, and a radioactive technetium (
