Abnormal cardiac [(123)I]-meta-iodobenzylguanidine uptake in multiple system atrophy. [(123)I]-Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy is useful for distinguishing multiple system atrophy (MSA) from Parkinson disease. In this study, longitudinal observation using MIBG myocardial scintigraphy was carried out in patients with MSA to evaluate the association of myocardial MIBG uptake with clinical features. A total of 96 MIBG examinations were performed in 52 patients with MSA. The heart/mediastinum (H/M) ratio of MIBG uptake at 240 minutes after injection was below the lower limit in 16 patients with MSA (31.3%). Overall, the H/M ratio correlated with neither disease duration nor severity. In the follow-up observations, the H/M ratio did not show any specific trends, in contrast with the continuous decrease observed in patients with Parkinson's disease. This data clearly showed that cardiac MIBG uptake cannot necessarily be preserved in patients with MSA and that approximately 30% of patients with MSA showed decreased MIBG uptake without any correlation to disease duration or severity.
