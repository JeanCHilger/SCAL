Dual phase FDG-PET imaging of brain metastases provides superior assessment of recurrence versus post-treatment necrosis. To study the ability of dual phase FDG-PET/CT imaging to accurately distinguish tumor versus necrosis in patients treated for brain metastases. 32 (22 female, 10 male) consecutive patients with treated brain metastases, lesion size greater than 0.5 cm(3) and suspected recurrence on MRI underwent dual-phase FDG-PET/CT. Clinical outcome was assessed by biopsy or by MRI. SUVmax and SUVmean values of the lesion (L) and gray matter (GM) at the level of the thalamus were measured on early (1) and delayed (2) imaging. L1/GM1 and L2/GM2 and the change of L/GM ratios as a function of time were calculated [(L2/GM2 - L1/GM1)/(L1/GM1)]. Cut-off values were obtained by ROC analysis. P < 0.05 defined statistical significance. Seven patients were excluded due to indeterminate outcomes. 25 patients (16 female, 9 male 27 lesions
