Primary retroperitoneal mullerian adenocarcinoma. Mullerian tumors are extremely rare malignancies in the retroperitoneum. We report a case of a 46-year old woman who presented with an eight year history of lower abdominal mass. Ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a 15Ã—10 cm cystic mass in the left lower retroperitoneum. As serial percutaneous needle aspiration cytology was negative for malignancy, she was observed for seven years. Eleven months ago, the mass was excised. The histopathology was reported as mucinous adenocarcinoma of the retroperitoneum. Six cycles of intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy was administered during the last six months after diagnosis of recurrence by aspiration cytology and high serum tumor markers (CEA, CA19-9). A few days ago, positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning showed evidence of local recurrence and single vertebral metastasis, so she was admitted again for systemic chemotherapy. Meticulous revision of additional sections of the tumor revealed papillary, serous, mucinous, and endometrioid subtypes of the mullerian adenocarcinoma. To our knowledge, there has been no similar case described in the literature.
