Exploring new frontiers in molecular imaging: Emergence of Ga PET/CT. Since US Food and Drug Administration approval of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose as a positron tracer, and the development of hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography machines, there has been a great increase in clinical application and progress in the field of nuclear molecular imaging. However, not underestimating the value of (18)F, there are known limitations in the use of this cyclotron-produced positron tracer. We hence turn our focus to an emerging positron tracer, (68)Ga, and examine the advantages, current clinical uses and potential future applications of this radioisotope.
