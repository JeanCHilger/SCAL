Functional brown adipose tissue is related to muscle volume in children and adolescents. We examined whether the depiction of brown adipose tissue (BAT) with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in pediatric patients is associated with anthropometric measures.We determined measures of body mass, adiposity, and musculature in 71 children and adolescents who underwent PET/CT examinations and compared patients with and without BAT. We used regression analyses to assess the relation between BAT and anthropometric measures.A total of 30 patients (42%) had BAT depicted on PET/CT, 10 of 26 girls (38%) and 20 of 45 boys (44%). Compared with patients without functional BAT, patients with BAT had significantly greater neck musculature (1880 ± 908 cm(3) versus 1299 ± 806 cm(3) P = .028 for boys and 1295 ± 586 cm(3) versus 854 ± 392 cm(3)Pediatric patients with visualized BAT on PET/CT examinations had significantly greater muscle volume than patients with no visualized BAT.
