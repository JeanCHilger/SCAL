Comparison of MR imaging and FDG-PET/CT in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant vertebral compression fractures. Differentiation between malignant and benign vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) is important but sometimes difficult, especially in elderly cancer patients. The authors investigated the findings of MR imaging and FDG-PET/CT for the differentiation of VCFs.Between 2007 and 2008, the authors evaluated and treated 102 VCFs in 96 patients. The final diagnosis, based on biopsy results or clinical follow-up, was benign fracture in 67 lesions in 65 patients and malignant fracture in 35 lesions in 31 patients. Magnetic resonance images were obtained in all patients, and FDG-PET/CT was performed in 17 patients in the benign fracture group and 20 in the malignant fracture group. The prevalence of 3 significant MR imaging findings (posterior cortical bulging, epidural mass formation, and pedicle enhancement) and the presence of radiotracer uptake on FDG-PET/CT were evaluated in the 2 groups. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) on FDG-PET/CT was compared between the 2 groups, and diagnostic threshold value was sought to confirm malignancy. The diagnostic accuracy of MR imaging and FDG-PET/CT was compared in the differentiation of malignant from benign VCFs.Posterior cortical bulging was seen in 26 (74%) of 35 malignant lesions and 30 (45%) of 67 benign ones, epidural mass formation in 27 (77%) of the malignant lesions and 25% of the benign ones, and pedicle enhancement in 30 (91%) of the 33 malignant lesions and 18 (39%) of the 46 benign ones evaluated with Gd-enhanced MR imaging. These differences were statistically significant for each feature. Sensitivity and specificity for predicting malignancy were, respectively, 74% and 55% for posterior cortical bulging, 77% and 74% for epidural mass formation, and 90% and 61% for pedicle enhancement. Simultaneous occurrence of 3 significant features was found in 21 (64%) of the 33 malignant and 8 (17%) of the 46 benign lesions for which complete MR imaging data were available and showed sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 83%. The presence of radiotracer uptake on FDG-PET/CT was seen in all 20 (100%) of the 20 malignant lesions and 12 (71%) 17 of the benign lesions evaluated by FDG-PET/CT and showed a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 29%. There was a significant difference in mean (± SD) SUV(max) for the malignant (6.29 ± 3.50) and benign (2.38 ± 1.90) lesions (p < 0.001). The most reliable threshold for SUV(max) was found to be 4.25, which yielded a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 71%.When MR imaging findings are equivocal, FDG-PET/CT can be considered as an adjunctive diagnostic method for differentiating malignant from benign VCFs. In comparison with MR imaging, FDG-PET/CT showed slightly higher sensitivity and lower specificity.
