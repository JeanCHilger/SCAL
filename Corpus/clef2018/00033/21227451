A novel approach to investigate neuronal network activity patterns affected by deep brain stimulation in rats. The establishment of new therapeutic indications for deep brain stimulation (DBS) is ambitiously promoted though the underlying mechanisms remain contested. Here, we report that PET-imaging and subsequent c-Fos-immunostaining in rats constitute a new translational approach to further understand DBS-mechanisms and -effectiveness.
