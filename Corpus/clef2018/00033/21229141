Synthesis of oligonucleotides possessing versatile probes for PET labelling and their rapid ligand-free click reaction. We synthesised aryl acetylene derivatives as versatile probes for labelling of oligonucleotides. RNA oligomers bearing an aryl acetylene molecule rapidly reacted with benzylazide derivatives under ligand-free click reaction conditions.
