Increased neural response to trauma scripts in posttraumatic stress disorder following paroxetine treatment: A pilot study. Neuroimaging studies of individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have revealed altered patterns of activity in medial prefrontal brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), an area implicated in affect regulation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to effectively treat PTSD symptoms, but there remains a lack of functional neuroimaging research examining the effects of psychopharmacological treatment on brain function in PTSD. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of the SSRI paroxetine on neural responses to traumatic memories in a small sample of patients with PTSD, as measured with PET imaging we hypothesized that paroxetine treatment would be associated with increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the medial prefrontal cortex. Thirteen participants with PTSD were given controlled-release paroxetine (paroxetine CR) or placebo in a randomized, double-blind fashion for 12 weeks. Participants underwent brain imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) before and at the end of treatment in conjunction with exposure to neutral scripts and personalized trauma scripts. Participants treated with paroxetine CR and placebo both exhibited significantly increased rCBF in the ACC during trauma versus neutral script presentations
