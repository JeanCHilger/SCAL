Contribution of SPECT measurements of D2 and 5-HT2A occupancy to the clinical development of the antipsychotic SB-773812. The aim of this study was to assess human striatal dopamine receptor 2 (D(2)) and cortical 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (5-HT(2A)) occupancy of SB-773812 to demonstrate brain penetration and binding to the target receptors and assess the pharmacokinetics-receptor occupancy relationship over time to aid dose selection and dosage regimen, in preparation for the phase II trials.D(2) and 5-HT(2A) occupancy were measured over time (both at the time of maximum [T(max) 6 ± 2 h] and at the time of minimum [T(trough)Study A showed less than 30% D(2) occupancy at T(max), maintained at T(trough). 5-HT(2A) occupancy was 74%-97% and also maintained over time. Study B revealed that 8 of the 12 schizophrenia patients showed more than 40% D(2) occupancy. 5-HT(2A) occupancy ranged from 91% to 100%. In study C, SB-773812-induced D(2) occupancy was 60.3% ± 13.3% at T(max) and 55.1% ± 4.9% at T(trough). The pharmacokinetics-receptor occupancy relationship was assessed in each study and strengthened, combining all data to yield a concentration associated with 50% occupancy (EC(50)) of 92.7 ± 13.5 ng/mL for D(2) and 2.11 ± 0.50 ng/mL for 5-HT(2A).In all subjects, SB-773812 showed penetration into the brain, reaching its target receptors. In patients with schizophrenia, D(2) occupancy levels induced by a single dose were maintained over time, indicating that once-daily dosing regimens are appropriate. Pharmacokinetics-receptor occupancy analysis provided guidance for the selection of a clinically effective dose, supporting progression in phase II.
