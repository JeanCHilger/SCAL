Synthesis and comparative biological evaluation of L- and D-isomers of 18F-labeled fluoroalkyl phenylalanine derivatives as tumor imaging agents. L-amino acid-based tracers have established their important role as tumor metabolic imaging agents. Recently, a number of studies demonstrated that D-amino acids may have improved imaging properties than their corresponding L-isomers. We synthesized and evaluated the D-isomer of a new phenylalanine derivative, p-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-phenylalanine ([(18)F]FEP), in comparison to its L-isomer and previously reported the L- and D-isomers of O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-tyrosine ([(18)F]FET).L- and D-Isomers of [(18)F]FET and [(18)F]FEP were successfully synthesized via a rapid and efficient two-step nucleophilic fluorination and deprotection reaction. In vitro studies were carried out in 9L glioma cells. In in vivo studies, Fisher 344 rats bearing the 9L tumor model were used.L- and D-Isomers of (18)F-fluoroalkyl tyrosine and phenylalanine derivatives were efficiently labeled with high enantiomeric purity (>95%), good yield (11-45%) and high specific activity (21-75 GBq/Î¼mol). D-[(18)F]FEP showed a similar linear time-dependent uptake as D-[(18)F]FET, while their corresponding L-isomers had much faster and higher uptake (4.3- to 16.0-fold at maximum uptake). The maximum uptake of the new compounds, L- and D-[(18)F]FEP, was 1.4- and 5.2-fold of that reported for L- and D-[(18)F]FET, respectively. Transport characterization studies indicated that both L- and D-[(18)F]FEP were selective substrates for system L. While L-[(18)F]FEP exhibited preference towards one subtype of system L, LAT1, D-[(18)F]FEP did not exhibit the same preference. Small animal PET imaging studies showed that both L- and D-[(18)F]FEP had higher uptake in 9L tumor compared to surrounding tissues, but D-isomer had lower tumor-to-muscle ratio in comparison with its L-isomer.Both L- and D-[(18)F]FEP are substrates for system L amino acid transporter with different preference toward its subtypes. Small animal imaging studies of 9L tumor showed that D-[(18)F]FEP did not show better imaging properties than their corresponding L-isomer.
