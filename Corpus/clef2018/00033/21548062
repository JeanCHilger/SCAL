Grafting of dermatan sulfate on polyethylene terephtalate to enhance biointegration. The aim of the present study was to achieve the immobilization of dermatan sulfate (DS) on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surfaces and to evaluate its biocompatibility. DS obtained from the skin of Scyliorhinus canicula shark was immobilized via carbodiimide on knitted PET fabrics, modified with carboxyl groups. PET-DS characterization was performed by SEM, ATR-FTIR and contact angle measurements. Biocompatibility was evaluated by investigating plasma protein adsorption and endothelial cell proliferation, as well as by subcutaneous implantations in rats. The results indicated that DS immobilization on PET was achieved at ~8 μg/cm². ATR-FTIR evidenced the presence of sulfate groups on the PET surface. In turn, contact angle measurements indicated an increase in the surface wettability. DS immobilization increased albumin adsorption on the PET surface, whereas it decreased that of fibrinogen. In vitro cell culture revealed that endothelial cell proliferation was also enhanced on PET-DS. Histological results after 15 days of subcutaneous implantation showed a better integration of PET-DS samples in comparison to those of nonmodified PET. In summary, DS was successfully grafted onto the surface of PET, providing it new physicochemical characteristics and biological properties for PET, thus enhancing its biointegration.
