Disorders of the respiratory system in pet and ornamental fish. The respiratory organ of fish is the gill. In addition to respiration, the gills also perform functions of acid-base regulation, osmoregulation, and excretion of nitrogenous compounds. Because of their intimate association with the environment, the gills are often the primary target organ of pollutants, poor water quality, infectious disease agents, and noninfectious problems, making examination of the gills essential to the complete examination of sick individual fish and fish populations. The degree of response of the gill tissue depends on type, severity, and degree of injury and functional changes will precede morphologic changes. Antemortem tests and water quality testing can, and should, be performed on clinically affected fish whenever possible.
