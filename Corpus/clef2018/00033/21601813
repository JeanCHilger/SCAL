Avian respiratory distress: etiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Respiratory distress is usually a life-threatening emergency in any species and this is particularly important in avian species because of their unique anatomy and physiology. In the emergency room, observation of breathing patterns, respiratory sounds, and a brief physical examination are the most important tools for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory distress in avian patients. These tools will help the clinician localize the lesion. This discussion focuses on the 5 anatomic divisions of the respiratory system and provides clinically important anatomic and physiologic principles and diagnosis and treatment protocols for the common diseases occurring in each part.
