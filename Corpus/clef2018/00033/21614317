F18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in progressive transformation of germinal centres. FDG-PET/CT is a widely established imaging modality for staging, restaging and monitoring therapy response in lymphoma patients. Progressive transformation of germinal centres (PTGC) is a benign condition presenting characteristically as asymptomatic lymphadenopathy. This paper presents a case of a 53-year-old man with a history of Hodgkin's disease (HD) whose F(18) FDG-PET/CT scan showed high uptake in left axillary lymph nodes (SUV 3.8). A subsequent, left axillary lymph node biopsy revealed PTGC. PTGC can present as a false positive finding on FDG-PET/CT in lymphoma patients and biopsy should be done in HD patients in clinical remission but have a positive FDG-PET/CT scan.
