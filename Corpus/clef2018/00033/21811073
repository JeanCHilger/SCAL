A multicenter brain perfusion SPECT study evaluating idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus on neurological improvement. This study was designed to investigate the specific cerebral blood flow (CBF) pattern in patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and a predictive value for shunt responsiveness in a multicenter study (Study of Idiopathic Normal-Pressure Hydrocephalus on Neurological Improvement: SINPHONI).Eighty-four iNPH patients underwent shunt operations using MRI selection criteria from the SINPHONI and were subjected to CBF single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The perfusion patterns on SPECT were classified: anterior-dominant CBF reduction type (A type), posterior-dominant CBF reduction type (P type), and mixed or diffuse CBF reduction type (M type). The predictive value of the CBF pattern for favorable shunt outcome was evaluated.Favorable outcomes were obtained in 76% (64/84) of patients, and shunt responsiveness was achieved in 85% (71/84) of patients. Areas of severely reduced relative CBF were demonstrated around the corpus callosum and in the sylvian fissure area, which included the effects of dilatations of the ventricles and sylvian fissures and relatively increased perfusion in the medial and lateral frontal, parietal, and occipital areas at high convexity. Forty-nine (58%) cases were A type, 25 (30%) cases were M type, and 10 (12%) cases were P type. A, M, and P type cases exhibited 83, 84, and 90% positive predictive values for shunt responsiveness, respectively. Mean modified Rankin scale and Mini-Mental State Examination scores of the A type group were significantly better than those of other groups.The iNPH patients showed various patterns of CBF reduction, but there was no significant difference in the predictive value among the three patterns, though CBF reduction patterns may suggest a severe condition of iNPH.
