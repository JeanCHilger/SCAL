Efficacy of dosimetric versus empiric prescribed activity of 131I for therapy of differentiated thyroid cancer. The optimal management of high-risk patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) consists of thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine ((131)I) therapy. The prescribed activity of (131)I can be determined using two approaches: 1) empiric prescribed activity of (131)I (E-Rx) and 2) dosimetry-based prescribed activity of (131)I (D-Rx).The aim of the study was to compare the relative treatment efficacy and side effects of D-Rx vs. E-Rx.A retrospective analysis was performed of patients with distant metastases and/or locoregionally advanced radioiodine-avid DTC who were treated with either D-Rx or E-Rx. Response to treatment was based on RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1.1 criteria.The study group consisted of 87 patients followed for 51 Â± 35 months, of whom 43 were treated with D-Rx and 44 with E-Rx. Multivariate analysis, controlling for age, gender, and status of metastases revealed that the D-Rx group tended to be 70% less likely to progress (odds ratio, 0.29 95% confidence interval, 0.087-1.02Higher efficacy of D-Rx with a similar safety profile compared to E-Rx supports the rationale for employing individually prescribed activity in high-risk patients with DTC.
