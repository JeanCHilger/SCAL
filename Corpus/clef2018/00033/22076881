FDG PET in the management of patients with adrenal masses and adrenocortical carcinoma. Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumor with aggressive behavior, high recurrence rate, and rapid evolution. Surgery is the only curative modality, while systemic treatments such as mitotane and chemotherapy associated to locoregional therapeutic tools remain as palliative options. Imaging has an important role in the management of patients with ACC both at diagnosis and during follow-up. First, it is necessary to characterize undetermined adrenal masses, selecting patients for surgery. Then, in case of malignancy, it is mandatory to assess disease extension, to detect early relapse during follow-up, and to evaluate treatment response. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging are actually the most used techniques for these intents as they are widely available in clinical practice. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) is routinely used for other malignancies and, on the basis of published data, is also becoming a promising tool in the management of ACC. Not only is it a diagnostic tool complementary to morphological imaging in the characterization of adrenal masses and in tumoral lesions detection, but it can be also useful to evaluate tumor response to treatment. New tracers and indications for the clinical use of FDG PET in this specific disease still have to be evaluated to assess its role in clinical practice.
