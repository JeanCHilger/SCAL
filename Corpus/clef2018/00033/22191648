Radiotracers based on technetium-94m. This review gives a survey on the use and applications of technetium-94m ((94m)Tc) as a non-conventional positron emission tomography (PET) radionuclide for molecular imaging. The first part of this review describes the production and processing of (94m)Tc. The second part covers basic concepts of technetium coordination chemistry with a special focus on the synthesis of (94m)Tc-labeled compounds for molecular imaging purposes. The review concludes with a summary and an outlook on the prospects of using (94m)Tc in the field of PET chemistry and molecular imaging.
