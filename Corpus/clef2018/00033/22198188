Evidence for the use PET for radiation therapy planning in patients with cervical cancer: a systematic review. In recent years, the role of positron emission tomography (PET) in the staging and management of gynecological cancers has been increasing. The aim of this study was to systematically review the role of PET in radiotherapy planning and brachytherapy treatment optimization in patients with cervical cancer.Systematic literature review.Systematic review of relevant literature addressing the utilization of PET and/or PET-computed tomography (CT) in external-beam radiotherapy planning and brachytherapy treatment optimization. We performed an extensive PubMed database search on 20 April 2011. Nineteen studies, including 759 patients, formed the basis of this systematic review.PET/ PET-CT is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting nodal metastases in patients with cervical cancer and has been shown to impact external-beam radiotherapy planning by modifying the treatment field and customizing the radiation dose. This particularly applies to detection of previously uncovered para-aortic and inguinal nodal metastases. Furthermore, PET/ PET-CT guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) allows delivery of higher doses of radiation to the primary tumor, if brachytherapy is unsuitable, and to grossly involved nodal disease while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. PET/ PET-CT based brachytherapy optimization allows improved tumor-volume dose distribution and detailed 3D dosimetric evaluation of risk organs. Sequential PET/ PET-CT imaging performed during the course of brachytherapy form the basis of âadaptiveâ brachytherapy in cervical cancer.This review demonstrates the effectiveness of pretreatment PET/ PET-CT in cervical cancer patients treated by radiotherapy. Further prospective studies are required to define the group of patients who would benefit the most from this procedure.
