 The tumor necrosis factorâ€“related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily of cytokines that selectively activate a complex apoptotic pathway (caspase cascade) in tumor cells, thereby inducing apoptosis (cell death) (1, 2). There are two cell-surface TRAIL receptors (death receptor 4 [DR4] and 5 [DR5]) that are capable of inducing apoptosis and three decoy TRAIL receptors that are not capable of inducing apoptotic signals (3, 4). Conatumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that acts as a human DR5 agonist antibody to tumor cells, which causes apoptosis in
