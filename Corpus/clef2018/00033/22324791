Waist circumference and metabolic syndrome: the risk for silent coronary artery disease in males. Waist circumference (WC) is a component used to define metabolic syndrome. However, its role as an independent predictor of silent coronary artery disease (CAD), above its contribution to metabolic syndrome, remains unknown.Male veterans without known CAD, undergoing cardiac stress testing for indications other than typical angina or its equivalent, were evaluated for the presence of silent CAD. High WC and metabolic syndrome were defined per the revised National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP-R) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria.Data on 1,071 patients (age 61±11 years) were analyzed retrospectively. On multivariable logistic regression analysis [odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI), P value), a WC ≥94 cm (1.42, 1.04-1.93 P=0.026), metabolic syndrome by NCEP-R (1.73, 1.29-2.33A WC ≥94 cm in males is independently associated with an increased prevalence of silent CAD. In patients with metabolic syndrome, this prevalence is increased by the presence of high WC.
