Immunological identification and characterization of extracellular serine protease-like protein encoded in a putative espP2 gene of Haemophilus parasuis. Haemophilus parasuis is known to produce a group of virulence-associated autotransporter (AT) proteins, VtaAs however, no other ATs have been characterized yet. On the basis of the reported sequence of a putative espP2 gene for extracellular serine protease (ESP)-like protein of H. parasuis, this putative AT gene was successfully amplified from H. parasuis serotype 5 field strain HPS0819, cloned and sequenced. The confirmed ORF sequence showed 100% identity with the reported putative espP2 gene. The recombinant ESP-like protein purified from Escherichia coli with a pET expression system was used for immunological characterization. An approximately 85 kDa antigen was detected in cultured H. parasuis by using antiserum to the purified ESP-like protein, and antibodies against the recombinant ESP-like protein were detected in a selected serum from pigs with experimental H. parasuis infection. The results indicated that H. parasuis could produce ESP-like protein in vitro and in vivo. In an immune protection study using guinea pigs, 6 out of 10 animals immunized with the recombinant ESP-like protein survived after challenge with 5 Ã— 10(9) bacteria of strain HPS0819, whereas 7 out of 10 animals immunized with formalin-inactivated H0819 bacterin survived after challenge. The results suggest that ESP-like protein could be one of the vaccine antigen candidates for H. parasuis infection.
