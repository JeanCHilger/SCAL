Diagnostic tests and strategies in venous thromboembolism. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a term including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Timely and accurate diagnosis of both is essential as delayed or missed diagnoses can result in death or longer term complications. Patients with suspected DVT should initially undergo a pretest probability Wells score. Depending on pretest probability Wells score they should then either proceed to two-point ultrasound scanning or D-dimer testing. Likewise, patients suspected of PE should undergo a two-level PE Wells score, and, if scored likely, a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA), or, if there is a low pretest probability score, D-dimer testing. If positive, patients should undergo CTPA. Ventilation perfusion scanning (V/Q scan) or V/Q SPECT should be considered in place of CTPA if there is allergy to contrast media or renal impairment.
