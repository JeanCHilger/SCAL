Quality changes of ready-to-eat ginseng chicken porridge during storage at 25 °C. Ready-to-eat (RTE) ginseng chicken porridge was heated in a retort with an F-value of 4.0 after being packaged in a gas-tight plastic tray (PP/EVOH/PP) with top film (PET/PA/CPP). Various quality changes were investigated during the storage for 28 weeks at 25 °C. Over the storage period, microorganisms were not detected above 1.0 log cfu/cm² (detection limit). The viscosity increased sharply from 775 to 2025 cp for initial 4 weeks and increased steadily until 16 weeks, with a slight reduction thereafter. During the 28 weeks of storage, the ratio of residual oxygen and pH decreased from 10.8% and 6.49 to 5.7% and 6.05, while retrogradation degree increased from 0% to 55.9%. Hunter L*, b*, and ΔE values increased until 20 weeks and remained for the rest of storage. Based on sensory, microbiological and physicochemical evaluations, the RTE ginseng chicken porridge could be marketable for at least 24 weeks at 25 °C.
