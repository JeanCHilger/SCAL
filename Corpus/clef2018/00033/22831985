Clinical parameters model for predicting pathologic complete response following preoperative chemoradiation in patients with esophageal cancer. Approximately 25% of patients with esophageal cancer (EC) who undergo preoperative chemoradiation, achieve a pathologic complete response (pathCR). We hypothesized that a model based on clinical parameters could predict pathCR with a high (â‰¥60%) probability.We analyzed 322 patients with EC who underwent preoperative chemoradiation. All the patients had baseline and postchemoradiation positron emission tomography (PET) and pre- and postchemoradiation endoscopic biopsy. Logistic regression models were used for analysis, and cross-validation via the bootstrap method was carried out to test the model.The 70 (21.7%) patients who achieved a pathCR lived longer (median overall survival [OS], 79.76 months) than the 252 patients who did not achieve a pathCR (median OS, 39.73 months OS, P = 0.004Our data suggest that the logistic regression model can predict pathCR with a high probability. This clinical model could complement others (biomarkers) to predict pathCR.
