Primary progressive aphasia and Alzheimer's disease: brief history, recent evidence. Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) has been recognized as a syndrome distinct from the usual pattern of language deterioration in Alzheimer's disease and typically more related to the pathology of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In recent years, however, the syndromes of primary progressive aphasia have become more complex, divided into the three subtypes of progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD), and logopenic/phonological progressive aphasia (LPA). These syndromes have not only made the linguistic analysis more complex, but the associated pathologies have also become more variable. In particular, PNFA is usually, but not always, associated with FTD pathology and often evidence of a tau mutation, but rarely AD SD is usually associated with FTD of the ubiquitin staining or progranulin (TAR-DNA) mutation type, but, again, occasionally AD
