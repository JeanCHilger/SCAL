Applications of a computerized adjustable brain atlas in positron emission tomography. A computerized brain atlas, adjustable to the patient's anatomy, has been developed. It is primarily intended for use in positron emission tomography (PET), but may also be employed in other fields utilizing neuro-imaging, such as stereotactic surgery. The atlas is based on anatomic information obtained from digitized cryosectioned cadaver brains. It can be adjusted to fit a wide range of individual brains with reasonable accuracy. The corresponding transformation is chosen so that the modified atlas agrees with a set of CT or MR images of the patient. The computerized atlas can be used to facilitate and improve the quantification and evaluation of PET data by: enabling the merging and comparison of results from different individuals or groups of individuals serving as a vehicle in the comparison of different examinations of the same patient, thus reducing the need of reproducible fixation systems
