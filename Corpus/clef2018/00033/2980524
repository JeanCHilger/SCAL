Regional cerebral blood flow determined with single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography. A comparative study. The regional uptake of 99Tcm-labelled HMPAO has been measured with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The potential value of 99Tcm-HMPAO as a flow tracer was evaluated. The uptake of 99Tcm-HMPAO as a function of time indicated that the tracer was trapped in the brain. The uptake images were compared with results from quantitative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements using positron emission tomography (PET) and with 11C-fluoromethane used as a tracer. There was a strong correlation between the uptake of 99Tcm-HMPAO and rCBF. The conclusion was that the uptake of 99Tcm-HMPAO was dependent on rCBF.
