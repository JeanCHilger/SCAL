Positron emission tomography instrumentation: an overview. Positron emission tomography (PET) makes possible the quantitation of the regional distribution of positron-emitting radioisotopes in a selected organ (Ter Pogossian et al.: Radiology 114:89-98, 1975). Since a large variety of physiologic compounds can be labeled with positron emitters (Wolf: Seminars in Nuclear Medicine 11:2-12, 1981 Fowler and Wolf: Nuclear Science Series, 1982), the technique can be used to monitor various biochemical and physiological processes of living tissues (Phelps et al.: Annals of Internal Medicine 98:339-359, 1983
