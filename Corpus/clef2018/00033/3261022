Technical study for SPECT of the head using slant hole collimator. The performance of a 160 keV slant hole collimator (160 keV SH) was compared with that of a 140 keV high resolution collimator (140 keV HR) for SPECT imaging of the head using 99mTc. The minimum radius of revolution was reduced from about 23 cm to 13 cm using 160 keV SH. Relative sensitivity of the 160 keV SH was 108% of that of the 140 keV HR. Compared with SPECT using 140 keV HR, 160 keV SH SPECT yielded approximately a 15% increase in resolution. The 160 keV SH SPECT images of phantom were superior in resolution and contrast to that of 140 keV HR SPECT. We concluded that high quality SPECT images of the head can be obtained from rotating gamma cameras equipped with slant hole collimators.
