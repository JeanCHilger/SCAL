Improvement of cerebral blood flow following stereotactic surgery in patients with putaminal haemorrhage. Changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) after CT guided stereotactic aspiration of putaminal haematoma were investigated in 13 patients with Xe-133 inhalation and single photon emission computed tomography. The interval from onset to operation ranged from 13 to 82 days (mean 30 days). The mean estimated haematoma volume ranged from 20 to 50 ml (mean 31.9 ml). The percentage of haematoma aspirated ranged from 75 to 98% (mean 86.8%). Postoperative CBF in two thirds of the patients was improved even though all cases were operated on in the subacute stage. Both the mean hemispheric and regional CBF in the anterior territory of the middle cerebral artery and in the region of the thalamus and basal ganglia in the affected hemisphere were increased postoperatively. Also in the nonaffected hemisphere, regional CBF in the region of the thalamus and basal ganglia was improved.
