Diagnostic accuracy of nuclear medicine SPECT imaging. SPECT imaging was utilized in 1052 liver/spleen and 338 brain imaging evaluations. In a quality assurance retrospective analysis with clinical and tissue diagnoses, SPECT liver images had a higher correlation than CT or ultrasound. In brain imaging, SPECT matched MRI in correlation and was more sensitive than CT in evaluating the posterior fossa. SPECT was positive earlier than CT in the discovery of cerebral infarcts. In several cases, primary brain tumors were initially diagnosed on SPECT images. SPECT imaging is a cost effective modality.
