Left ventricular volume determination using single-photon emission computed tomography. A new method for measuring left ventricular (LV) volume based on gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is described. Preliminary phantom studies showed an excellent correlation between SPECT and observed volumes (r = 0.99, standard error of the estimate [SEE] = 4.9 ml). SPECT was performed 24 hours after biplane contrast LV angiography in 36 patients. Transaxial blood pool tomograms were reconstructed by filtered back projection and reoriented to views orthogonal to the cardiac axes. Volume was calculated from serial short-axis tomograms by determining the base, apex and lateral borders of the LV blood pool, ascertaining the number of pixels in this volume and multiplying by the known volume of a pixel. Gated SPECT volumes were compared with contrast angiographic volumes. At end-systole, r = 0.96 and SEE = 12 ml at end-diastole, r = 0.81 and SEE = 27 ml. For ejection fraction, r = 0.85 and SEE = 0.06. To test interobserver variation in processing, count data from 5 patients were processed twice (r = 0.98, SEE = 8.3 ml). There is an excellent correlation between SPECT and contrast angiographic volumes at end-systole
