Horizons in radionuclide therapy: 1985 update. In 1981, I made the strong statement that "The therapeutic approach of internally administered radiopharmaceuticals offers the potential to outmode the present approaches of conventional radiation therapy and chemotherapy." The present article updates and further supports this statement with new data, especially with the use of [131I]MIBG in several cancers and proposes a plan for application of nonsealed source radionuclide therapy to most solid tumors.
