SPECT resolution and uniformity improvements by noncircular orbit. A noncircular orbit implemented by a combination of rotational and translational motions in single photon emission computed tomography improves significantly the image resolution and uniformity. The former is realized by closer access of the detector to the object at each projection angle, and the latter by suppression of ring artifacts through the shifts in the distance between the centers of detector and object. This has been demonstrated by comparing the SPECT images for an elliptical orbit of 40 cm X 30 cm with the equivalent circular orbit of 40 cm diameter, performed by SPECT system with a high resolution collimator. Resolution FWHM improvements were 1.5-2.5 mm. Lesion contrast improved by a factor of 2.8 for a nonradioactive rod of 6 mm diam. In phantom images, the elliptical orbit showed better definition of lesion shape, sharper edge response, and clearly increased detectability. Translational motion reduced ring artifacts, particularly near the image center.
