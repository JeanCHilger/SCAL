Kinetics of positron emitters in vivo characterized with a beta probe. To facilitate characterization of regional myocardial kinetics of positron-emitting tracers in vivo without distortion by activity outside the region of interest, a probe was developed and evaluated for monitoring radioactivity by detection of positrons themselves. These particles (beta particles) have a maximal range in tissue of only few millimeters rather than the larger range of gamma photons emitted as a result of positron annihiliation. Regional myocardial time-activity curves were determined in open-chest dogs after intracoronary injection of 0.5-1.5 mCi [15O]H2O, a tracer used for measurement of myocardial blood flow, or 6.0-8.0 mCi [11C]palmitate, a tracer used for noninvasive assessment of myocardial metabolism. Time-activity curves after [11C]palmitate injection clearly delineated specific components of myocardial tracer clearance previously identified in vitro in isolated perfused hearts. Myocardial washout of [15O]H2O was monoexponential for more than 2 min without distortion induced by recirculating tracer in ventricular blood. Reproducibility of measured tracer clearance rates during monoexponential clearance was high based on duplicate determinations for both tracers. The beta-detector probe developed overcomes several intrinsic limitations of gamma-probe systems or well counting of serial myocardial biopsies for studies of positron-emitting tracers in vivo and should facilitate assessment of factors of influencing tracer kinetics in vivo relevant to positron-emission tomography.
