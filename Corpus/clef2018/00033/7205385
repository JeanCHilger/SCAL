Remote, semiautomated production of F-18-labeled 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose. A routine production system for 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (2-18FDG) for medical use is presented. The method involves the preparation of F-18-labeled F2 by the 20Ne(d, alpha) 18F reaction, subsequent fluorination of 3,4,6-tri-o-acetyl-D-glucal, purification, and hydrolysis of the appropriate diastereoisomer to obtain 2-18FDG. These operations are performed using a completely remote, semiautomatic system. There have been no failures in more than 220 consecutive production runs. Currently, two preparations per day of 15-25 mCi of 2-18FDG are routinely performed, with a radiochemical purity, measured by TLC, in excess of 95% and with less than 1 mR radiation exposure to the chemist. Reaction conditions, operational variables, and systems are described in detail.
