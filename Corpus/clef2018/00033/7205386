A shielded synthesis system for production of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose. A remotely operated, shielded synthesis system for the production of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG) for clinical studies has been developed. Using this system, 25 mCi of 18FDG are produced a the end of a 60-min synthesis from approximately 300 mCi of F-18 (total F-18 recovered from the target at the end of bombardment). The fractional distribution of F-18 among various components of the synthesis system has been measured. This yield of 18FDG (25 mCi) is ample for two consecutive human studies in house or for shipment to collaborating institutions within a 3-hr (door to door) radius.
