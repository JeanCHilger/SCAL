Validation of a dual-isotope technique using 123I-MIBG and 201Tl in the assessment of sympathetic reinnervation following heart transplantation: phantom and patient studies. Dual-isotope studies using 123I and 201Tl allow the assessment of sympathetic reinnervation in patients following heart transplantation. 123I-meta-iodobenzyl guanidine (123I-MIBG) serves as a tracer of the integrity of the sympathetic nervous system. 201Tl is used for landmarking to allow better delineation of the myocardium due to faint 123I-MIBG accumulation in heart transplants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of parameters such as crossover, attenuation and the 123I/201TI activity ratio on the assessment of the myocardial 123I-MIBG uptake ratio using phantom and patient studies. Crossover was calculated using the ratio: 201TI counts in the 123I energy window/201Tl counts in the 201Tl window. Phantom studies were performed using a rectangular phantom (RP) and a cardiac phantom (CP). The mean crossover from the 201Tl to the 123I energy window was 11.48% (RP) and 11.13% (CP). Depending on attenuation in water (depth of water 0-5 cm), crossover increased from 10.92 to 15.85% (RP) and from 11.05 to 15.79% (CP). In order to confirm that the experimental crossover results were equivalent to those obtained in patient studies, 15 patients underwent myocardial scintigraphy. After injection of 201Tl, a simultaneous dual-window acquisition was performed to assess crossover from the 201Tl to the 123I window. The mean crossover was 15.35%, as high as the crossover assessed in phantom studies, taking into account attenuation and scatter caused by the chest wall. In order to reduce 201Tl crossover, the 123I activities were six times as high as the 201Tl activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
