Canine distemper infection in pet dogs: I. Surveillance in Indiana during a suspected outbreak. A mail survey of 613 private veterinary practices in Indiana was conducted to determine the prevalence of canine distemper infection in Indiana during 1991 and 1992 and to compare the prevalence in three geographic regions. Of the practices that were contacted, 223 (37%) responded. Canine distemper had been diagnosed by 150 (67%) of the 223 practices. The period prevalence increased significantly from 11.1 to 16.9 cases per 10,000 dog visits. Surveillance of private veterinary practices may be useful to confirm suspected outbreaks of diseases in companion animals.
