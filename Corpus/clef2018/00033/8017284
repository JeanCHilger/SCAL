Effect of exercise supplementation during adenosine infusion on hyperemic blood flow and flow reserve. Physical stress might modulate myocardial blood flow in near-maximally dilated coronary arteries by increasing coronary perfusion pressure, myocardial contractility, and heart rate. The net effect of these changes on hyperemic blood flows has not yet been defined in humans. To quantify the effect of physical exercise on pharmacologically induced hyperemia, myocardial blood flow was measured in 11 healthy volunteers. Measurements were performed with positron emission tomographic imaging with nitrogen-13 ammonia at rest, during intravenous (i.v.) adenosine administration (140 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 over 6 minutes), and during i.v. adenosine administration plus supine bicycle exercise with a maximal workload of 125 W. Myocardial blood flow was quantified by using a previously validated graphic analysis. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate-pressure product, and mean aortic blood pressures were significantly higher during combined physical and pharmacologic stress than during pharmacologic stress alone. However, myocardial blood flow decreased from 2.6 +/- 0.4 to 2.2 +/- 0.4 ml.min-1.gm-1 with the addition of physical stress (p < 0.05). This decline was associated with a significant increase in coronary vascular resistance (35 +/- 6 vs 52 +/- 13 mm Hg.ml-1.gm.min p < 0.05). Accordingly, myocardial flow reserve declined, from 5.0 +/- 0.9 to 4.3 +/- 1.0, with exercise supplementation (p < 0.05). Exercise in addition to pharmacologic stress increases coronary vascular resistance and thus significantly decreases hyperemic myocardial blood flow and flow reserve. This decrease results most likely from an increase in extravascular restrictive forces caused by higher ventricular pressures and contractility during physical stress.
