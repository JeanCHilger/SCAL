Technology for FDG SPECT with a relatively inexpensive gamma camera. Work in progress. At the time of the co-development of a commercial dual-headed gamma camera for whole-body single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), modifications were made to permit imaging of 511-keV photons (from positron emitters) while maintaining versatility and cost-effectiveness in nuclear medicine for routine nonpositron studies.Special collimators were made, and gantry stability was increased. Detector shielding and crystal thickness were not changed. In phantoms, healthy volunteers (two men, aged 34 and 38 years), and 109 patients (71 male and 38 female patients, aged 2-74 years [mean, 56 years]), SPECT was performed with 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). In patients, 36 myocardial viability, 47 oncologic, and 26 brain examinations were performed.All FDG SPECT scans were subjectively judged to be of acceptable quality. Preliminary results in regard to diagnostic findings are reviewed this analysis is intended to be a feasibility study not a conclusive review of imaging accuracy.FDG SPECT provides images that are interpretable for cardiac or oncologic diagnosis, without the need for or expense of a positron emission tomography (PET) center or a dedicated PET scanner.
