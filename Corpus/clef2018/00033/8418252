A PET radiotracer for studying serotonin uptake sites: carbon-11-McN-5652Z. A radioligand for imaging central serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT) uptake sites by positron emission tomography (PET) has yet to be developed. Such a tracer would be useful for the study of normal and altered serotonergic neurotransmission as well as for the detection of serotonergic neurotoxicity. This paper describes the labeling of the highly potent serotonin (5-HT) uptake blocker, McN-5652-Z (trans-1,2,3,5,6,10 beta-hexahydro-6-[4-(methylthio)phenyl]pyrrolo-[2,1-a]-isoquinoline
