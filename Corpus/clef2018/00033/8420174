Chronic dementia in Parkinson's disease treated by anticholinergic agents. Neuropsychological and neuroradiological examination. Reports about chronic-onset dementia due to ACA have been rare. Here we described five patients with chronic dementia induced by ACA. We examined their clinical aspect, neuropsychological aspect, and neuroradiological aspect in detail. Our study suggests the possibility of ACA-induced chronic-onset dementia in PD patients.
