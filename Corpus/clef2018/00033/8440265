Uptake and distribution of L-3-[I-125] iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine in experimental rat tumours: comparison with blood flow and growth rate. Radiolabelled amino acids combined with positron emission tomography (PET) show promise for the accurate delineation of viable tumour extent and may also provide a rapid and sensitive indicator of response to therapy. We have investigated the potential use of the radioiodinated amino acid analogue L-3-iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine (IMT) for these purposes using experimental tumours in hooded rats. Preliminary studies using HSN tumours and IMT labelled with iodine-125 demonstrated maximum tumour uptake at 15 min post injection although an improved tumour-to-brain ratio was seen at 24 h due to the relatively poor retention of IMT in normal brain. Brain uptake of IMT was also found to be substantially reduced by competition with another large neutral amino acid phenylalanine however, relatively less effect was seen in tumour, and in skeletal muscle no change in IMT uptake was observed. Quantitative autoradiography revealed no sign of heterogeneity in tumour IMT uptake: good penetration was seen even in poorly vascularised regions as confirmed by endothelial immunohistochemistry. Similar levels of IMT uptake were found in the OES.HR1 tumour during growth supplemented by exogenous oestrogen. Following arrest of tumour growth by removal of the oestrogen stimulus, IMT uptake was seen to fall from 1.7% to 1.0% of the injected dose per gram: this was matched by a fall in tumour blood flow as estimated by technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime distribution. It appears that IMT uptake is more strongly influenced by blood flow than cell proliferation and that intratumoural distribution of IMT is principally determined by diffusion.
