Decrease in the frontal-superobasal metabolic ratio in unipolar depression. Cerebral frontal glucose metabolism was investigated in 12 unipolar depressed patients and compared to these of 12 healthy volunteers using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and (F18) fluorodeoxyglucose. The PET investigation was made in a quiet room with a dimly light and each subject remained in a resting state with closed eyes. Results show a decreased in a frontal superobasal calculated ratio in depressed patients compared to control subjects for left and for right values. This reduction indicates an imbalance between the frontal and the superobasal region. This imbalance could relate to some particular depressive symptom profile.
