Usefulness of technetium-99m-galactosyl human serum albumin liver scintigraphy for assessment of severity of alcoholic hepatitis. We performed a liver scintigraphy using technetium-99m diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid-galactosyl human serum albumin (99mTc-GSA), which images the functional liver mass through its binding to the specific receptor asialoglycoprotein receptor in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. Receptor index (LHL 15) was significantly lower in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, compared with controls with normal liver. Difference in the isotope uptake patterns between liver and heart varied according to the severity of liver disease, and made it possible to categorize 5 grades. Grading score could discriminate between the eventual outcome of the patients. Furthermore, single photon emission computed tomography showed the variable uptake patterns in the hepatic lobule, wherein there were no evident findings in macroscopic view at autopsy. The results of this study show the usefulness of 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy in the evaluation and prognosis of alcoholic hepatitis.
