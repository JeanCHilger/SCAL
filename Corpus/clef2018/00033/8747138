Network analysis of PET-mapped visual pathways in Alzheimer type dementia. Using path analysis to determine the systems-level neural networks mediating specific tasks from regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) data obtained by positron emission tomography (PET), we recently found in young subjects strong functional linkages during a face matching task along a right hemisphere ventral network including occipital, temporal, and frontal regions. In this study, PET data obtained during a face matching task from mildly affected patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and healthy matched controls showed that (1) the neural model obtained in young subjects provides a good fit to data from old subjects (2) although the DAT patients could perform this task with the same accuracy as controls, they did not use the same functional network.
