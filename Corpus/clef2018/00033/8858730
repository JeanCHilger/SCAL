Strategies to improve 3D whole-body PET image reconstruction. An algorithm is described for three-dimensional whole-body (3DWB) image reconstruction in positron emission tomography. For whole-body applications, improvements to the popular fixed-axial-acceptance-angle technique are achieved by combining axially adjacent projection data available with a long-axis data set. Time-consuming reprojection of unmeasured oblique lines of response is reduced or eliminated by axial overlap of bed positions, while pixel variance and reconstructed axial resolution are made more uniform by the overlap. Improvements in noise and resolution uniformity are accompanied by gains in reconstruction efficiency, and may be optimized against increased acquisition-time due to overlapping acquisition segments and reduced axial coverage. An 11-detector-ring overlap improves axial uniformity in coronal images of a long, uniform cylinder from 23% to 8% with uniform axial resolution. Associated with a 37% improvement in reconstruction time is a 34% reduction in axial coverage for four bed positions. A smaller degree of overlap is found to provide the best trade-off between image uniformity, total scan duration, and reconstruction time because of a proportionally greater reduction in reprojected lines of response. Using a sample optimization scheme, we find a three-ring overlap is best for a 60 cm axial field of view and a five-ring overlap for an 80 cm axial field of view.
