Corticosteroid contact allergy: an EECDRG multicentre study. This article describes the results of an EECDRG multicentre study on contact allergy to corticosteroids. A total of 7238 patients were investigated: 6238 in 13 centres in the course of 1993, and 1000 patients in 1 centre in 1993 and 1994. The 5 corticosteroids tested were budesonide 0.1% pet., betamethasone-17-valerate 1% pet., clobetasol-17-propionate 1% pet., hydrocortisone-17-butyrate 1% eth., and tixocortol-21-pivalate 1% pet. 189 (2.6%) gave a positive patchtest reaction (+, ++, + + +) to at least 1 of the corticosteroids. The data regarding the corticosteroid-sensitive patients, as well as the patchtest results, were recorded on a standardized form.
