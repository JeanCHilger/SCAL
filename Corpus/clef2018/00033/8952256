Evaluation of a method to determine the myocardial uptake from 123I-BMIPP myocardial SPECT and its significance. We examined methods of calculating myocardial uptake (TU) of 123I-BMIPP by SPECT, and compared TU to heart function (ejection fraction (EF), cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI)) calculated by left ventriculography. Forty-two patients with acute myocardial infarction were classified into 5 groups within 1 week (I), from 1 to 2 weeks (II), from 2 weeks to 1.5 months (III), from 1.5 to 3 months (IV) and more than 3 months (V) after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Chest depth (Tw) was calculated by measuring the thoracic absorption rate of 123I. In calculating TU, the myocardial count was calculated from short-axis tomograms, and then absorption was corrected using Tw to calculate each value on early-phase image (E) and delay-phase image (D). The influence of lung uptake on myocardial count was only 1.76%. When TU was compared to heart function, there were correlations between group I and group V. Especially in group V D-TU was a significantly correlated with heart function. In heart function CI, but not EF nor CO, was significantly correlated with TU. It was suggested that the correlation between TU and heart function reflected the infarct condition before PTCA in group I, and that the individual difference in recovery of fatty acid metabolism in group V. The significant correlation between D-TU and CI suggests that D-TU reflects heart function and fatty acid metabolism, although TU is influenced by differences in physical status.
