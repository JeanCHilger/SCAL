Morphological and functional neuro-imaging of surgical partial epilepsies in adults. This article reviews literature on morphological and functional neuro-imaging data in refractory partial epilepsies of adults including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Single Photon Emission Computerised Tomography (SPECT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Except for MRI, which is of unquestionable utility in the diagnosis of epileptogenic lesions, most of these investigations are justified only in the context of pre-operative evaluation of candidates to functional neurosurgery. In terms of interpretation the key issue is that of the relation between the images and the epileptogenic process itself. The specific utility of available techniques is as follows: MRI, in its present state of development, reveals a morphological abnormality in more than 80% of the cases previously considered as cryptogenic on the basis of X ray Computerised Tomography. However, hippocampal atrophy, which has a questionable relation with temporal lobe seizures, represents two thirds of abnormal images. Functional MRI and MR spectroscopy represent potential alternatives respectively to Wada test and interictal SPECT or PET. Ictal blood flow studies during video-EEG monitoring represent the major application of SPECT
