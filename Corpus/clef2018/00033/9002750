The current status of radioiodinated metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy of neuro-endocrine tumors. The avidity of many metastatic pheochromocytomas and neuroblastomas for metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) observed at diagnostic scintigraphy has led to attempts to treat these lesions with large doses of MIBG. We and others have achieved therapeutic responses with 131I-MIBG (usually partial) in about a third of malignant pheochromocytomas. A small but important subgroup of advanced, poor prognosis neuroblastomas which have been resistant to all other therapies have also shown responses including occasional long-term survival (> 5 years) and apparent complete responses to 131I-MIBG. Because the physical properties of 131I are suboptimal for the delivery of therapeutic radiation to bone marrow micrometastases, a frequent problem in neuroblastoma, we have performed preliminary studies in poor prognosis Stage III and VI neuroblastoma using 125I-MIBG which has more satisfactory emissions. This has led to prolonged tumor stabilization and survival (> 19 to > 52 months) in 5 of 10 patients. MIBG radiopharmaceutical treatment of neuroendocrine tumor patients must still be considered an experimental but nevertheless promising treatment modality.
