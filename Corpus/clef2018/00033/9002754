Treatment with meta-[131I]iodobenzylguanidine and cisplatin in stage IV neuroblastoma. Metastatic neuroblastoma (NB) continues to have a dismal prognosis. NB is a radiosensitive tumor. Owing to its high concentration in the NB lesions, Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) has the potential for specifically delivering very large radiation doses to the malignant cells. Encouraging results have been reported with [131I]MIBG used alone in patients resistant to conventional therapy and at diagnosis. We report the first attempts to explore the integration of this new treatment modality with chemotherapy. Among the drugs effective in NB, cisplatin was chosen because of its high degree of activity against NB, its mild hematologic toxicity and the known synergism between cisplatin and radiation. Four patients, 3 with relapsed, heavily pre-treated, progressive stage IV NB, and 1 with stage IV NB at diagnosis, all with a good [131I]MIBG uptake, were investigated with the combined therapy. Two complete remissions and one partial remission were observed in the relapsed patients 4-6 weeks following only one single course of both cisplatin and [131I]MIBG at the "standard" dosage. The only toxicity was hematologic, which was significant and relatively long-lasting, but was not associated with any serious infections or bleeding tendency. The general condition of these patients during the entire study period was excellent. The 4th patient, investigated at diagnosis with a modified less intensive treatment, obtained a partial remission with a mild hematologic toxicity. The provisional conclusion of this preliminary study is that this new form of combined therapy appears very effective in heavily pretreated relapsed patients with progressive disease, and could also be investigated in refractory patients and in patients at diagnosis.
