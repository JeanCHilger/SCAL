111In-DTPA-D-Phe]-octreotide scintigraphy in functioning and non-functioning pituitary adenoma. Scintigraphy with [111In-DTPA-D-Phe]-octreotide is a recently developed technique for imaging somatostatin receptors in many neuroendocrine tumors. A good correlation between high [111In-DTPA-D-Phe]-octreotide uptake and the response to octreotide therapy has been proved in TSH- and GH-secreting pituitary adenomas, while few and conflicting scintigraphic data on somatostatin receptors in non-functioning tumors have been reported in the literature. The present study presents the results obtained with [111In-DTPA-D-Phe]-octreotide scintigraphy in thirteen patients with GH-secreting pituitary adenoma, four patients with inappropriate TSH-secretion and twelve patients with non-functioning pituitary adenoma. Twelve out of the 13 patients with GH-secreting pituitary adenomas had a positive scan moreover, in 5/6 patients with a GH-secreting microadenoma (tumor size range 5-8 mm) a positive scan was found. Two TSH-secreting macroadenomas had a positive scan while a negative scan was obtained for a TSH-secreting pituitary microadenoma and in a patient with non-neoplastic, inappropriate secretion of TSH. Finally, only 2/12 patients with non-functioning pituitary adenoma showed a positive scan. In conclusion, [111In-DTPA-D-Phe]-octreotide scintigraphy is a useful tool to confirm the presence of somatostatin receptors in selected patients with GH- and TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The role of [111In-DTPA-D-Phe]-octreotide scintigraphy in non-functioning pituitary tumors remains to be established, but it could be useful for octreotide treatment in patients who refuse surgery or who are poor surgical candidates.
