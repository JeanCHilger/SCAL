Sound-induced activation of auditory cortices in cochlear implant users with post- and prelingual deafness demonstrated by positron emission tomography. Changes of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the auditory cortices induced by sound stimulation were examined in nine postlingually and five prelingually deaf cochlear implant (CI) users by 15O-labeled water Positron Emission Tomography, and the results were compared with those of eight normal volunteers. Speech stimulation caused significantly greater rCBF increase compared with noise stimulation in the auditory association area in normal and postlingually deaf subjects. In prelingually deaf subjects, however, speech activation of the auditory association area was much less than that found in either of the other two groups. Neuronal networks for speech sound processing in the auditory association area in postlingually deaf individuals are thought be similar to those in normal subjects, while those in prelingually deaf patients who received CI after the speech acquisition period may not develop completely.
