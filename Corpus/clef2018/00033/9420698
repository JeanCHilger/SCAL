The use of carbon 11-labeled acetate for assessment of aerobic metabolism. Carbon 11-labeled acetate has been validated as a tracer of citric acid flux and indirectly of oxidative metabolism. 11C-labeled acetate is predominantly metabolized to 11C-labeled carbon dioxide, which clears from the heart. The myocardial 11CO2 efflux rate that can be estimated by dynamic positron emission tomographic imaging closely correlates with myocardial oxygen consumption over a wide range of flow, substrate use, and metabolic conditions. 11C-labeled acetate clearance rates are indirect indexes of oxidative metabolism. To provide absolute mass fluxes, the 11C-labeled acetate approach would require biochemical validation and configuration of a tracer kinetic model. Clinically, estimates of myocardial oxygen consumption appear to be useful in assessing tissue viability, as shown in patients after acute myocardial infarction or with chronic coronary artery disease. In non-coronary artery disease, 11C-labeled acetate may provide measurement of cardiac efficiency and be useful for monitoring therapy.
