Nitrate-augmented myocardial imaging for assessment of myocardial viability. 201Tl myocardial perfusion imaging is presently done by several possible strategies. Stress/delayed redistribution, stress/redistribution/reinjection, and rest/redistribution imaging can be useful in the clinical assessment of myocardial viability. Unfortunately, the extent of myocardial viability may still be underestimated even by 201Tl reinjection imaging, compared with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. 99mTc-labeled sestamibi imaging provides results similar to those of 201Tl imaging in the detection of coronary artery disease, but several previous studies suggest that stress/rest 99mTc-labeled sestamibi imaging significantly underestimates myocardial viability. Recently it has been reported that the administration of nitrates, before 201Tl reinjection, improves detection of defect reversibility. Several studies also suggested that administration of nitrates before the injection of 99mTc-labeled sestamibi significantly improved detection of reversibility with this agent, whereas additional studies showed further that this combination improves the predictive accuracy for recovery of left ventricular function and perfusion after coronary revascularization, compared with a standard rest 99mTc-labeled sestamibi study. Nitrate administration before the injection of 201Tl and 99mTc-labeled sestamibi may thus be a potentially attractive alternative for the evaluation of myocardial viability. Although the available results are encouraging, further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical value of 201Tl and 99mTc-labeled sestamibi imaging, in combination with nitrates, for predicting recovery of left ventricular dysfunction.
