Biokinetics and dosimetry analysis in healthy volunteers for a two-injection (rest-stress) protocol of the myocardial perfusion imaging agent technetium 99m-labeled Q3. Trans (N,N'-ethylene bis(acetylacetoneimine)) bis(tris(3-methoxy-1-propyl) phosphine) 99mTc(III) (99mTc-Q3) has been developed for myocardial perfusion imaging. Biokinetic studies and dosimetry analysis have been completed for six healthy volunteers.The same-day two-injection protocol involved (1) an average rest injection of 241 MBq of 99mTc-Q3 followed by myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) at 15.0 minutes and a whole body (WB) scan at 1.5 hours and (2) an average stress injection during treadmill exercise of 744 MBq of 99mTc-Q3 at 2.4 hours (postrest injection) followed by myocardial SPECT and additional WB scans at 1.5, 3.5, 6.5, and 21 hours poststress injection. Total urine was collected over 24 hours. Absolute organ activities were determined by conjugate counting methods. The two-injection data were simplified to a one-injection equivalent data set to facilitate dosimetry analysis. Decay corrected average percentage uptake values, plus or minus one standard deviation, for the myocardium were 1.4% +/- 0.2% at approximately 1.5 hours for both the postrest and poststress injections. The average biologic half-time for the myocardium was 26.4 hours. The highest organ uptake values included the gallbladder with 5.5% +/- 1.9% and the liver with 4.1% +/- 1.0% at the 1.5 hours poststress scan time. The sum of all gastrointestinal (GI) tract components was 18.8% +/- 9.4% at approximately 6.5 hours poststress injection (before any fecal elimination). The total 24 hour urine clearance was 17.1% +/- 2.4%. The gallbladder wall and upper large intestine wall received the highest doses at 0.024 and 0.023 mGy/MBq, respectively.The effective dose equivalent is estimated to be 0.01 mSv/MBq, which for an administration of 1110 MBq (30 mCi) is less than half that of a standard imaging protocol using 111 MBq (3 mCi) of 201Tl, and comparable to the published estimates for 99mTc-labeled sestamibi and 99mTc-labeled tetrofosmin (also normalized to 1110 MBq of administered activity). The 99mTc-Q3 exhibits myocardium uptake similar to that for these other two 99mTc agents.
