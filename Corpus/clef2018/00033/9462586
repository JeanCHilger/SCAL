Myocardial dysfunction and adrenergic cardiac innervation in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is associated with an increased incidence of heart failure due to several factors, and in some cases a specific cardiomyopathy has been suggested.This study sought to assess the mechanisms of exercise-induced left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in asymptomatic patients with IDDM in the absence of hypertensive or coronary artery disease.Fourteen consecutive patients with IDDM were enrolled (10 men, 4 women mean [+/- SD] age 28.5 +/- 6 years)Diabetic patients were classified into group A (n = 7), with an abnormal LVEF response to handgrip (42 +/- 7%), and group B (n = 7), with a normal response (72 +/- 8%). Baseline LVEF was normal in both group A and B patients (60 +/- 6% vs. 61 +/- 7%, p = NS). In group A patients, the LV circumferential wall stress-LVEF relation showed an impairment in LVEF disproportionate to the level of LV afterload. No significant changes in LVEF occurred during dobutamine (60 +/- 6% vs. 64 +/- 10%, p = NS), whereas PESP significantly increased LVEF (60 +/- 6% vs. 74 +/- 6%, p < 0.001) PESP at peak handgrip normalized the abnormal LVEF (42 +/- 7% vs. 72 +/- 5%, p < 0.001)Despite normal contractile reserve, a defective blunted recruitment of myocardial contractility plays an important role in determining exercise LV dysfunction in the early phase of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This abnormal response to exercise is strongly related to an impairment of cardiac sympathetic innervation.
