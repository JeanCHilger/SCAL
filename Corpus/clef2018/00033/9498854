Migraine with pleocytosis. Characteristics and etiopathogenesis. The Spanish experience and review of the literature. Since its first description in 1980, pseudomigraine syndrome with transient neurologic deficits and lymphocytic pleocytosis, or migraine with pleocytosis, has given rise to conflicting opinions regarding its possible etiology and place in the classification of headache. We describe the clinical profile of migraine with pleocytosis and its possible etiopathogenesis, with a broad survey of both Spanish cases and those reported in the English literature.
