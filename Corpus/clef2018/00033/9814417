Comparative study of positron emission tomography and quantitative digital radiography (QDR) in detecting effects of aging and diet on bone metabolism of guinea pig. The purpose of this study was to compare positron emission tomography and quantitative digital radiography (QDR) in detecting the effects of aging and diet on bone metabolism. Bone imaging of guinea pigs was performed with fluorine-18 fluoride ions using a high-resolution animal PET system to analyze bone metabolism quantitatively in different age groups of guinea pigs, young (8 weeks), adult (36 weeks), and aged groups (96 weeks), and also in a dietary manipulation group (low calcium and low vitamin D3 diet for 1, 2, and 3 weeks). A three-compartment kinetic model was applied for the analysis of bone metabolism to evaluate the rate constant (K, K1-K4). There was a significant difference in K-constant between the young and other groups. The K-constant was higher (0.100+/-0.005 ml/min/ml) in the young group than in adults (0.028+/-0.001 ml/min/ml) (p < 0.001) and the aged group (0.047+/-0.020 ml/min/ml). This high value of the K-constant in the young group indicates high turnover in bone metabolism, but there was no significant difference between the adult and aged groups. Bone mineral density (BMD) was lower in the young group (0.15+/-0.026 g/cm2) than in the adult (0.230+/-0.021 g/cm2) (p < 0.001) and aged groups (0.26+/-0.03 g/cm2). There was no significant difference in BMD between the adult and aged groups. Although there was no difference in BMD between the control and dietary manipulation groups, PET study revealed a significant difference in K-constant between them (0.028+/-0.001 vs. 0.090+/-0.009 ml/min/ ml) (p < 0.001). The quantitative skeletal dynamic PET study with 18F fluoride ions was more sensitive and superior in the early detection of metabolic disorders in bone disease than QDR.
