Quantitative gated blood pool SPECT for the assessment of coronary artery disease at rest. Planar gated blood pool imaging (GBPI) has long proven to be useful for the noninvasive assessment of ventricular function. From a practical viewpoint, gated blood pool single photon emission computed tomography (GBPS) acquisition can be accomplished in the same time as a three-view planar series, with the benefit of a tomographic perspective that avoids chamber overlap.Quantitative gated blood pool SPECT was applied to 10 patients who underwent coronary arteriography, contrast ventriculography, and planar gated blood pool imaging. For each patient, the mid-short axis oblique slice was divided into 4 discrete segments using 4 different reference models and 2 forms of segmentation. A center of mass (counts) fixed in the end-diastolic frame and segmentation that bisected the ventricular septum proved to have the highest sensitivity and specificity for determining regional wall motion abnormalities at rest in myocardium supplied by severely diseased coronary arteries (>75 %). GBPS correctly identified 19 of 21 abnormal segments (90%), with good specificity (95%), whereas ventriculography identified 12 (57%) and planar GBPI identified 9 (43%) of the segments supplied by diseased coronaries.Quantitative GBPS appears to be a sensitive method for assessing coronary artery disease at rest in myocardium perfused by severely diseased coronary arteries.
