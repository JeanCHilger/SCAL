Clinical evaluation of commercially available urinary acidification diets in the management of idiopathic cystitis in cats. To compare recurrence of signs of lower urinary tract disease (LUTD) in cats with idiopathic cystitis that were fed the dry or canned formulation of a commercial diet designed to result in production of an acidic urine.Prospective trial.54 client-owned cats with idiopathic cystitis that was diagnosed on the basis of a history of abnormal micturition, abnormal results on urinalysis, radiography, or cystoscopy, and lack of an alternative diagnosis.Cats were assigned to be fed the canned or dry formulation of the diet. Reevaluations conducted at 2 and 16 weeks, and at 6 and 12 months included a physical examination, CBC and serum biochemical analysis (except week 2), blood gas analysis, and urinalysis. Regular telephone contacts were also made. The study was discontinued after 12 months or if signs of LUTD recurred.Signs of LUTD did not recur in 16 of 18 cats fed the canned diet, and 17 of 28 cats fed the dry diet (chi 2, P < 0.05). Seven cats were reevaluated at recurrence. Owners of remaining cats in which signs of LUTD recurred declined to have their pets reexamined. A different problem (bacterial urinary tract infection) was identified in only 1 cat on reevaluation. Eight cats were lost to follow-up evaluation.Feeding this commercial canned urinary acidifying diet may reduce the proportion of cats with idiopathic cystitis that will have recurrence of signs of LUTD within a 12-month period.
