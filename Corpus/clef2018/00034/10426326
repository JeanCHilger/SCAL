Significance of dobutamine-induced ST-segment evaluation and T-wave pseudonormalization in patients with Q-wave myocardial infarction: simultaneous evaluation by dobutamine stress echocardiography and thallium-201 SPECT. The clinical significance of stress-induced ST-segment elevation and T-wave pseudonormalization in infarct-related leads is still controversial. Therefore, we conducted the present study to assess this issue using simultaneous dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography. A total of 119 patients with Q-wave myocardial infarction were enrolled in this study. There were 58 patients with (group I) and 61 patients without (group II) dobutamine-induced ST-T changes. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 43 +/- 13% in group I and 49 +/- 14% in group II (p <0.05). The baseline, low-, and peak-dose global wall motion scores were similar between these 2 groups (26.2 +/- 6.1 vs 26.2 +/- 6.3 [p = NS] 24.1 +/- 5.3 vs 23.5 +/- 5.7 [p = NS]
