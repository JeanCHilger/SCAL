Dobutamine stress echocardiography and technetium-99m-tetrofosmin/fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose single-photon emission computed tomography and influence of resting ejection fraction to assess myocardial viability in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and healed myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to compare 2 different techniques--dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography (DSE) and dual-isotope simultaneous acquisition (technetium-99-m-tetrofosmin/fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose) single-photon emission computed tomography (DISA-SPECT)--for assessment of viable myocardium. One hundred ten patients (mean age 55 +/- 9 years) with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (mean LV ejection fraction 27 +/- 13%) underwent both DISA-SPECT and DSE. A 16-segment scoring model was adopted for both techniques. Four types of wall motion during DSE were assessed: (1) biphasic, improvement at low dose (10 microg/kg/min) with worsening at high dose (2) worsening, deterioration without initial improvement
