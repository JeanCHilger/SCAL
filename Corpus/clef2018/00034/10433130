Regional cerebral blood flow in obsessive-compulsive patients with and without a chronic tic disorder. A SPECT study. The main goal of the present study was to explore whether regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) differs between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients without chronic motor tic disorder and those OCD patients with a comorbid chronic tic disorder. Twenty-seven patients suffering from OCD (DSM-IV criteria), including 7 OCD patients who met DSM-IV criteria for simple chronic motor dic disorder, and 16 healthy volunteers were examined at rest using a high resolution SPECT. Seven regions of interest (ROIs) were manually traced and quantified as a percentage of the mean cerebellar uptake. Severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS), anxiety and depressive symptoms and presence of motor tics were assessed with the Y-BOCS, HRS-A, HRS-D, MADRS, and Yale Global Tics Severity Scale, respectively. We found a significant relative decrease in rCBF in OCD patients without motor tics compared to healthy volunteers in the right orbitofrontal cortex (OCD without tics = 0.87 healthy volunteers = 0.94
