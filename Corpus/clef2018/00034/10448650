Importance of cerebral tomoscintigraphy using technetium-labeled sestamibi in the differential diagnosis of current tumor vs. radiation necrosis in subtentorial glial tumors in the adult. CT scan and MR imaging are not always reliable in the differential diagnosis between radionecrosis and recurrence of brain tumor. We describe the results of a prospective study using 99mTc Sestamibi. 22 patients were included. The histology of the tumor was astrocytoma (grade 2-4) oligodendroglioma (grade 2-3) or mixed (grade 2-3). SPECT was performed using a Tomomatic 564, 1 h after the injection i.v. of 370 MBq of 99mTc Sestamibi. Ten slices parallel to the orbitomeatal plane were obtained. Two index were calculated i) CI: ratio of the mean counts in the lesion to the mean counts in the contralateral choroid plexus and ii) MI: ratio of the mean counts in the lesion to the contralateral mirror area. The results were compared to stereotactic biopsies or to clinical course at 6 months. Twelve patients out of 22 showed an increased uptake of the tracer and 11/12 presented with a recurrence. In 10 patients without fixation, 4 were false negative. The sensitivity for the detection of tumor recurrence was 73% and specificity was 85%. The positive predictive value was 91% and the negative predictive value was 60%. The use of a cut-off value superior to 2 for MI and superior to 0.5 for CI appears to be a good criterion for helping the diagnosis of relapse according to the analysis of Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC). A positive SPECT was conclusive for the diagnosis of recurrence but a negative SPECT did not allow to assess the absence of recurrence. Limits of methods have to be stressed and searched for a better understanding of false negatives.
