Mechanisms of motor recovery after cerebrovascular accident. Recovery from motor deficit after a stroke remains a puzzling scientific question as well as public health problem. The natural history of deficits after stroke is given to us through published series of patients and we know from them that neurological deficits, spontaneously but most of the time partially, recover. Neuroimaging modern techniques (PET scan, fMRI, evoked potentials) allowed us to identify the main aspects of the post-stroke intracerebral reorganisation. Reorganisation of basal cerebral metabolism, changes in the somatotopia of primary motor cortex, recruitment of remote cortices, participation of associative cortices are clearly part of the rearrangement processes. It is likely that such mechanisms represent the basis of clinical recovery of our patients. However, despite those important advances, very few is known about the effect of treatments on the recovery phenomenon. Some lines of evidence appear now to give rationale to rehabilitation procedures and to drugs suspected to improve clinical recovery.
