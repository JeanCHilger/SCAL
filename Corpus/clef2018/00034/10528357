Mechanisms of aphasia recovery and brain imaging. Aphasia recovery may depend on right hemisphere or non-lesioned left hemisphere structures, pre-morbid brain language organization, and de novo learning of language. Here we review the brain imaging evidence supporting these different hypotheses. CT-scan studies have investigated the prognosis value of size and site of left hemisphere lesions. The size of the lesion is a global but not an individual predictor of the initial severity and subsequent recovery of aphasia. Studies on the site of the lesion have given different results for verbal expression and comprehension. There is no consensus on a single critical site for recovery of verbal expression in non-fluent aphasia, which may depend on sub-cortical more than cortical extend of the lesion. Conversely the extend of the lesion in the superior temporal gyrus emerges as a critical negative factor for comprehension recovery. Rest measurements of brain metabolism have consistently shown that aphasia severity depends much more on the degree of dysfunction of language-related areas in the left hemisphere than on the site of the lesion it-self. This suggests that aphasia recovery may depend on metabolic dysfunction recovery in peri-lesional structures. More recently, activation studies have shown consistent right hemisphere activation during language tasks in aphasic subjects, but their role in recovery remains debated. It is likely limited, and may depend on atypical pre-morbid language lateralization. Left hemisphere activations are also found in aphasic patients. They are often relocalized in peri-lesional areas, and emerge in most studies as the main factor of aphasia recovery.
