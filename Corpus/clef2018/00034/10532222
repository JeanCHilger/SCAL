Experimental evaluation of retrograde cerebral perfusion by single photon emission computed tomography technique (SPECT). Protection of the brain is of vital importance during aortic arch aneurysms. In this study efficiency of retrograde cerebral perfusion was evaluated with the use of single photon emission computed tomography technique (SPECT) by using 99mTc hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO).Four animals were used. The internal maxillary vein was the site of retrograde cerebral perfusion. The animals were studied after the heart rate and respiration were stopped with the use of the high dose drug administration and the brain was perfused with cold Ringer's lactated solution. After this procedure, 99mTc HMPAO-SPECT study was performed.In one animal we did not get any cerebral image because of the competent venous valve in the internal maxillary vein. In the remaining animals, normal brain perfusion was achieved.99mTc HMPAO-SPECT study documented that blood flow via the retrograde way meets the metabolic demand of the brain. Retrograde delivery of 99mTc HMPAO did not conclude any poorly perfused area in the brain when in given both sides and all parts of the brain can be effectively perfused by cerebral venous system in hypothermic conditions.
