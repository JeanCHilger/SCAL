Myocardial viability assessment after acute myocardial infarction: low-dose dobutamine echocardiography versus rest-redistribution thallium-201 SPECT. The presence of tissue viability is of great importance in the prognostic work-up of patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction. However, uncertainty still exists concerning the optimal tool for its assessment. The present study was undertaken in order to compare low-dose dobutamine echocardiography and rest-redistribution thallium SPECT for predicting late improvement of regional left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction.Fifteen patients undergoing coronary angiography, low-dose dobutamine echocardiography and rest-redistribution thallium SPECT after thrombolyzed anterior acute myocardial infarction were studied. A 3 month follow-up echocardiogram was performed in all patients and 9 underwent coronary revascularization.A significant (> or = 70%) residual stenosis of the infarct-related artery was present in 14 patients, whilst a total occlusion was observed in 1. At 3 month follow-up, 41% of the dyssynergic segments improved. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for late wall motion improvement was 61, 89 and 77% for low-dose dobutamine echocardiography and, respectively, 76, 45 and 58% for rest-redistribution thallium SPECT. Tissue viability was detected in 65 and 31% of dyssynergic segments by rest-redistribution thallium SPECT and low-dose dobutamine echocardiography, respectively (p < 0.001). The agreement between the two techniques was 48%.Low-dose dobutamine echocardiography is more accurate than rest-redistribution thallium SPECT for predicting 3 month wall motion improvement in patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction, mainly due to its significantly better specificity.
