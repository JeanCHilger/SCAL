Frontotemporal dementia can be distinguished from Alzheimer's disease and subcortical white matter dementia by an anterior-to-posterior rCBF-SPET ratio. Sixteen patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 27 with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, 25 with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, 19 with subcortical white matter dementia (SWD) and 28 normal controls underwent semiquantitative regional cerebral blood flow measurement (rCBF) using single-photon emission tomography (SPET (99m)Tc-HMPAO) and either computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. An anterior-to-posterior rCBF-SPET ratio (mesial superior frontal gyrus/medial temporal lobes) was calculated, which significantly separated the FTD group from the other dementia groups and controls with a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of at least 78.6%. CT/MRI was found to be helpful in the differential diagnosis between FTD and SWD. In FTD patients, the mesial superior frontal gyrus, near the polus frontalis, was found to be the region with the most reduced rCBF values.
