Pediatricians' pet peeves about mental health referrals. This chapter has described a number of problems encountered by pediatricians when referring their patients for mental health services these are related to access to care, quality of providers and service, attitudes of patients and providers, and lack of adequate communication. We have discussed some of the reasons for these difficulties, provided information that may assist pediatricians in making referrals to appropriate mental health providers, and offered suggestions to facilitate the referral process. We have highlighted the utility of developing and maintaining a relationship with mental health referral sources, and noted a number of advantages of including mental health providers in pediatric practices.
