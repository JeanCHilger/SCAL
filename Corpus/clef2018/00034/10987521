Ionic current and metabolism for brain scanners (a three state-model of modular activation). The papers of Taylor and Korner [(1999). Neural Networks, 12, 943, 989] describe ambitious and realistic models of the computational platform of the brain. However, in order to correlate E/MEG and MR/PET data, we need additional equivalencies. In this context, we suggest the introduction of three states of the cortical modules.
