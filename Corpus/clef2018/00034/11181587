Heterogeneity of metabolic activity in the canine parasternal intercostals during breathing. In the dog, the inspiratory mechanical advantage of the parasternal intercostals shows a marked spatial heterogeneity, whereas the expiratory mechanical advantage of the triangularis sterni is relatively uniform. The contribution of a particular respiratory muscle to lung volume expansion during breathing, however, depends both on the mechanical advantage of the muscle and on its neural input. To evaluate the distribution of neural input across the canine parasternal intercostals and triangularis sterni, we have examined the distribution of metabolic activity among these muscles in seven spontaneously breathing animals by measuring the uptake of the glucose tracer analog [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). FDG uptake in any given parasternal intercostal was greatest in the medial bundles and decreased rapidly toward the costochondral junctions. In addition, FDG uptake in the medial parasternal bundles increased from the first to the second interspace, plateaued in the second through fifth interspaces, and then decreased progressively toward the eighth interspace. In contrast, uptake in the triangularis sterni showed no significant rostrocaudal gradient. These results overall strengthen the idea that the spatial distribution of neural input within a particular set of respiratory muscles is closely matched with the spatial distribution of mechanical advantage.
