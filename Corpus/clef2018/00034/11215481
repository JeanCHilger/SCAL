Neuroimaging and electrophysiological study in epilepsy. There exist various morphological and biochemical changes closely associated with electrophysiological phenomena which cause epileptic seizures in the brains of epilepsy patients. Recent developments in investigation methods, not only electrophysiological(EEG and MEG), but also neuroimaging involving morphological imaging(CT and conventional MRI) and functional imaging(SPECT, PET, functional MRI and MRS) is able to demonstrate these changes. SPECT and PET can particularly clarify the changes of cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism between interictal and ictal periods. In our experience of 423 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery for intractable seizures, these interventions provide important information to identify the epileptogenic foci. However, in practice, discordance in the results of these presurgical evaluations is recognized, and invasive intracranial recordings are needed in such cases. These problems in diagnosis were shown especially in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis and focal cortical dysplasia. To detect an epileptogenic focus more clearly, a combination of morphological and functional findings, new functional imaging such as neurotransmitter receptor imaging, EEG-triggered or neuropharmacological functional MRI, as well as, statistical parametric analysis may be needed.
