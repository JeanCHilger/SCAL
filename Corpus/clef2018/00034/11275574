Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging in traumatic brain injury. Quantitative neuroimaging has now become a well-established method for analyzing magnetic resonance imaging in traumatic brain injury (TBI). A general review of studies that have examined quantitative changes following TBI is presented. The consensus of quantitative neuroimaging studies is that most brain structures demonstrate changes in volume or surface area after injury. The patterns of atrophy are consistent with the generalized nature of brain injury and diffuse axonal injury. Various clinical caveats are provided including how quantitative neuroimaging findings can be used clinically and in predicting rehabilitation outcome. The future of quantitative neuroimaging also is discussed.
