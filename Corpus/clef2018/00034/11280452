The impact of myocardial viability as determined by rest-redistribution 201Tl single photon emission CT imaging and the choice of therapy on prognosis in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. While thallium-201 (201Tl) single-photon emission CT (TSPECT) scintigraphy is a commonly used method for determining the viability of the myocardium, its value for predicting outcome is limited. The diagnosis of myocardial viability in patients with ischemic systolic left ventricular dysfunction might indicate which of them will benefit more from surgical revascularization. Forty patients (mean +/- SD aged 64.5 +/- 12 years, 33 males and 7 females) with impaired systolic left ventricular function (ejection fraction < or = 45%) underwent TSPECT examination. Twenty patients were surgically revascularized and 20 were treated medically. The patients were followed-up for a 34 +/- 10-month period and the cardiac long-term prognosis was evaluated. The significant viability percentage (SVP), defined as the percentage of the total number of segments showing a normal uptake of 201Tl redistribution divided by the total number of segments evaluated, was > or =55: this was observed in 18 patients. Among them, the cardiac event-free survival was 100% in the surgical group versus 22% in the medical group. However, in patients with non-SVP, the survival was lower and not significantly different in the two treatment groups. Surgical revascularization is the preferred method of treatment in patients with ischemic systolic left ventricular dysfunction and myocardial viability as defined by TSPECT scintigraphy.
