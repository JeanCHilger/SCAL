Positron emission tomography and gallium metabolic imaging in lymphoma. Metabolic imaging allows the recognition of active tumor mass because of its fixed tracer. For patients with Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, (67)gallium and (18)fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) have been employed. This review describes the role of (67)gallium scintigraphy (Ga-scan) and positron emission tomography (PET) in the staging and follow-up of patients with lymphoma. These tools do not appear to be more powerful than conventional imaging for initial staging and treatment choice. Ga-scan is only valid for thoracic examination. PET imaging following treatment resolves the problem of persisting images on CT scan nearly all patients with FDG uptake have an early relapse. Whether this examination will allow for intensified treatment and possible cure of more patients is yet to be demonstrated.
