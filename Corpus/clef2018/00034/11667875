New Synthetic Amino Acids for the Design and Synthesis of Peptide-Based Metal Ion Sensors. The syntheses of two new nonstandard amino acids, Flu (6) and XBp (20), and a new synthesis of Dmd (12) are reported. These residues exhibit fluorescence, metal-coordination, and fluorescence-quenching properties, respectively. These building blocks have been incorporated into peptides via solid phase peptide synthesis to afford the prototype for a photoinduced electron transfer-based metal ion chemosensor. The fluorescence of the peptides is modulated upon metal binding. This results from a metal ion-induced conformational change that brings the side chains of the Flu and Dmd amino acids into proximity, thereby favoring photoinduced electron transfer (PET) fluorescence quenching.
