Quantitative imaging of gene induction in living animals. Methods to repeatedly, non-invasively, and quantitatively image gene expression in living animals are rapidly emerging and should fundamentally change studies of gene expression in vivo. We previously developed assays utilizing positron emission tomography (PET) to image reporter gene expression. In this paper we: (1) describe a new bi-directional, tetracycline-inducible system that can be used to pharmacologically induce target gene expression and to quantitatively image induced expression by using a PET reporter gene (2) demonstrate the potential of this system in transient and stable cell transfection assays
