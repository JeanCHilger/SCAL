Value of whole body 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the evaluation of recurrent cervical cancer. To evaluate the clinical value of whole body positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) in recurrent cervical cancer, the records of 20 patients who underwent FDG-PET scans were reviewed to detect local recurrence, pelvic/para-aortic lymph node metastases and distal metastases. The final diagnosis was based on operative, histopathological findings or clinical follow-up for longer than one year. FDG-PET accurately detected 18 patients with recurrent diseases (12 patients with local recurrences, 16 patients with pelvic lymph node metastases, 14 patients with para-aortic lymph node metastases and 4 patients with distal metastases of other sites). However, 2 patients with local recurrences had false- negative FDG-PET results as well as 1 patient without local recurrence and 1 patient without pelvic lymph node metastases who had false-positive FDG-PET results. The overall sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET for patients were 90% and 100%, for local recurrence were 86% and 92%, for pelvic lymph node metastases were 100% and 94%, for para-aortic lymph node metastases were 100% and 100% and for distal metastases were 100% and 100%, respectively. In conclusion, whole body FDG-PET is a useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of recurrent cervical cancer. It appears to be promising for detecting recurrent cervical cancer, lymph node metastases and distal metastases.
