SPECT imaging, clinical features, and cognition before and after low doses of amisulpride in schizophrenic patients with the deficit syndrome. The aim of the study was to examine the action of low-dose amisulpride (100 mg/d), an atypical antipsychotic from the benzamide class with a high affinity for the D2 and D3 dopamine receptors, given for 4 weeks in 19 schizophrenic patients with the deficit syndrome, in terms of clinical response, modifications in their cognitive performance and changes in brain perfusion values. A secondary objective was to distinguish between primary and secondary deficit, according to Carpenter's definition. Both efficacy and a relatively low rate of side effects of low-dose amisulpride in the deficit forms of schizophrenia were found as expected from earlier placebo-controlled studies. Our study found significant changes in the cerebral blood flow, before and after treatment, more marked in the frontal area and particularly in the dorso-lateral frontal area. A significant improvement of cognitive function was found after treatment, without a link to any particular changes in a loco-regional perfusion value. Finally, a distinction between primary and secondary deficit showed a higher percentage of clinical improvement in the patients with a secondary deficit. The psychometric and cerebral perfusion changes were no different in the two groups.
