Decreased endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotion in healthy young smokers. Chronic cigarette smoking alters coronary vascular endothelial response. To determine whether altered response also occurs in young individuals without manifest coronary disease we quantified coronary blood flow at rest, following adenosine vasodilator stress and during the cold pressor test in healthy young smokers. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was quantified by oxygen-15 labelled water positron emission tomography in 30 healthy men aged from 20 to 35 years (18 smokers and 12 non-smokers, aged 27.4 +/- 4.4 vs 26.3 +/- 3.3). The smokers had been smoking cigarettes for 9.4 +/- 4.9 pack-years. MBF was measured at rest, during intravenous adenosine triphosphate (ATP: 0.16 mg kg(-1) min(-1)) infusion (hyperaemic response), and during cold pressor test (CPT) (endothelial vasodilator response). Rest MBF and hyperaemic MBF did not differ significantly between the smokers and the non-smokers (rest: 0.86 +/- 0.11 vs 0.92 +/- 0.14 and ATP: 3.20 +/- 1.12 vs 3.69 +/- 0.76 ml g(-1) min(-1) P = NS). Coronary flow reserve was similar between the two groups (smokers: 3.78 +/- 1.83
