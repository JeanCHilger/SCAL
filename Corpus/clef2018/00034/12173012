Norepinephrine transporter density as a causative factor in alterations in MIBG myocardial uptake in NIDDM model rats. Cardiac scintigraphic studies with iodine-123 labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine ([(123)I]MIBG) have demonstrated global and regionally pronounced decreases in myocardial accumulation of radioactivity in diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the cause of the regional differential decrease in accumulation. To this end, we investigated the global and regional myocardial distribution of [(125)I]MIBG in GK/Crj (GK) rats [a model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)] and assessed the responsibility of regional myocardial blood flow, myocardial and plasma norepinephrine (NE) content, and norepinephrine transporter (NET) function for the regional variations in [(125)I]MIBG accumulation. To investigate the responsibility of myocardial blood flow for the alterations in MIBG accumulation, dual-isotope autoradiographic studies with [(125)I]MIBG and technetium-99m hexakis-2-methoxy-2-isobutylisonitrile (MIBI), a tracer for the measurement of myocardial blood flow, were carried out in GK rats and control rats. The results in respect of the uptake of radioactivity into various myocardial regions were expressed as distribution absorption ratios [DAR = (radioactivity of tissue/g of tissue) x (body weight/total injected dose)]. In control rats, uptake of [(125)I]MIBG was significantly higher in the inferior wall than in the anterior wall (anterior wall, 6.35 +/- 0.90 inferior wall, 8.12 +/- 1.27: P < 0.001). On the other hand, in GK rats, uptake of [(125)I]MIBG was similar between the anterior wall and the inferior wall (anterior wall, 4.91 +/- 0.71
