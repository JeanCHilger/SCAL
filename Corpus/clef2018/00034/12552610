Molecular imaging: the application of small animal positron emission tomography. The extraordinary advances in genomic technologies over the last decade have led to the establishment of new animal models of disease. The use of molecular imaging techniques to examine these models, preferably with non-destructive imaging procedures, such as those offered by positron emission tomography (PET), are especially valuable for the timely advancement of research. With the use of small animal PET imaging it is possible to follow individual subjects of a sample population over an extended time period by using highly specific molecular probes and radiopharmaceuticals. In this Prospect small animal PET imaging will be described, specifically focusing on the current technologies, its applications in molecular imaging and the logistics of performing small animal PET.
