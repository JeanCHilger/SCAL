The use of mild hypothermia for patients with severe vasospasm: a preliminary report. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of mild hypothermia on cerebral ischaemia due to severe vasospasm, which was refractory to medical and intravascular treatments and to assess the brain protection of this treatment in patients who underwent delayed aneurysm clipping after presenting with ischaemic neurological deficits. Mild hypothermia (32-34 degrees C of brain temperature) was employed in two groups: (1) Patients (Hunt and Kosnik grades I to II) who showed progressive neurological deficits due to vasospasm and did not respond to conventional therapy (Group 1) and (2) Patients who received delayed aneurysm clipping after presenting with ischaemic neurological deficits due to vasospasm (Group 2). Seven of 8 patients in both Groups showed a favorable outcome with mild hypothermia (good recovery in 5 and moderate disability in two patients). Mild hypothermia is considered to be effective on critical cerebral ischaemia due to vasospasm even after failure to response the conventional therapies and to provide brain protection in delayed aneurysm clipping.
