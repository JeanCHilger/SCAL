Biodistribution of Lipiodol following hepatic arterial injection. Thirteen patients undergoing selective coeliac angiography before insertion of an indwelling hepatic arterial cannula underwent injection of 3 ml radiolabelled Lipiodol (2 MBq 131I) into the hepatic artery at the end of the procedure. At subsequent laparotomy 1-9 days later, biopsies were taken from normal liver and metastases. The radioactivity of this material was measured to establish the tumour:liver ratios. Two patients with large metastases (> 10 cm in diameter) had low ratios. In the remainder, the median ratio at 24 h was 1.5:1 (range 1.1-2.5:1 n = 5) and 2.6:1 (range 1.5-64.0:1
