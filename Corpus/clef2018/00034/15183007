Neuroimaging: new approaches for neurotoxicology. Over the last 20 years, the impact of imaging on the clinical sciences is unquestionable. It has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Interestingly, the use of imaging in preclinical neurotoxicology has been relatively negligible. This has been in part due to the lack of knowledge or understanding of the capabilities of these powerful technologies. However, some of the more immediately applicable imaging approaches could impact the present approach to neurotoxicology. In addition, the recent advent of the development of imagers specifically for application to small animals will provide the opportunity of obtaining information for neurotoxicological risk assessment in a more timely and relevant manner. The ability to visualize changes in structure and function due to neurotoxic insult in a noninvasive manner is a promising direction. Changes in anatomy of soft and hard tissue, metabolism, function and gene expression can now be done in both a preclinical and a clinical setting using such technologies as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance imaging microscopy (MRM), and positron emission tomography (PET). This type of information is not readily accessible using conventional preclinical neurotoxicological procedures and usually requires total destruction of the intrinsic structure of the sample of interest. Imaging provides an opportunity to produce much of these data in a nondestructive manner and presents the data in a three-dimensional format. This permits longitudinal studies of the same subject subsequently reducing the number of animals required for studies while providing more information. In addition, as these technologies have been primarily developed for clinical purposes, they provide an outstanding opportunity for cross-species and animal-to-human extrapolation and testing.
