99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC in the management of medullary thyroid carcinoma. An early diagnosis of distant metastases or local recurrences of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) can be achieved by several conventional radiological modalities (e.g., ultrasonography, computed tomography [CT], and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] as well as by radioisotopic procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET), scintigraphy with different types of radiopharmaceuticals, and radiolabeled receptor-ligands in particular. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC, a new octreotide derivative, to detect recurrences of disease or distant metastases in MTC. Images obtained of 5 patients with high levels of serum calcitonin were compared to findings obtained with other diagnostic procedures: 111In-octreotide, 99mTc-DMSA-V, 18F-flouro-D-deoxyglucose-PET, and CT/MRI. 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC was positive in all patients and showed 15 areas of pathological uptake in the cervical and mediastinal regions. 111In-octreotide was positive in 3 of 3 patients and showed 4 areas, compared to 8 of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC. 99mTc-V-DMSA was positive in 3 of 4 patients but showed 6 pathological areas, compared to 13 of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC. 18F-FDG-PET was positive in 5 of 5 patients but showed only 11 areas, compared to 15 of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC. The CT scan was positive in only 2 patients. In conclusion, 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC detected more sites of pathological uptake than other modalities, showed better imaging properties than 111In-octreotide, and might be the radiopharmaceutical of choice for providing a rationale for radioisotopic therapy.
