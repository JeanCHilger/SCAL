Evaluation of positron emission tomography with tracer 18-fluorodeoxyglucose in addition to magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in selected women after ultrasonography. To determine whether positron emission tomography (PET) with tracer 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) yields additional information in the diagnosis of malignancy compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in selected women after screening for ovarian masses by ultrasonography (US).After 49 patients were screened by US and physical examination (including a pelvic examination) by 2 experienced gynecologic oncologists, 38 patients suspected of having ovarian cancer were enrolled in the study. All 38 underwent MRI and FDG-PET. The results of the histologic findings were used to assess the accuracy of the imaging findings.Of the 38 women, 23 had malignant lesions and 15 had benign lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging, PET, and MRI with FDG-PET diagnoses had sensitivities of 91%, 78%, and 91%, respectively specificities of 87%, 87%, and 87%, respectivelyThe addition of FDG-PET to MRI does not yield significant additional information for differentiation of benign from malignant ovarian masses in selected women after US.
