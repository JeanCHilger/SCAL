QT dispersion in the risk stratification of patients with unstable angina: correlation with clinical course, troponin T and scintigraphy. This study sought to evaluate the potential prognostic usefulness of QT dispersion (QTd) in patients with unstable angina.QTd was calculated and plasma troponin T (TnT) level was measured and rest perfusion imaging with Tc-99m sestamibi was performed in 62 patients admitted with chest pain at rest. All patients had a follow-up during one month in order to assess cardiac events. Cardiac events occurred in 41 patients (no deaths, 11 myocardial infarctions (MI), 4 urgent and 26 planned revascularizations). The mean QTd in patients with cardiac events was significantly higher than in those without cardiac events (68 +/- 28 vs. 54 +/- 14 ms p = 0.01). When patients were divided into subgroups according to the cardiac events, the mean QTd in MI and revascularization were 90 +/- 25 ms and 60 +/- 25 ms, respectively. QTd in patients with MI was higher than in patients without cardiac events (p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in QTd between the revascularization subgroup and patients without cardiac events. Nineteen patients with elevated TnT had a greater QTd compared to patients with normal TnT (74 +/- 29 vs. 56 +/- 20 msThe measurement of QTd in patients with unstable angina may help to stratify patients at high risk for cardiac events, in particular MI and urgent revascularization.
