FDG-PET in the clinical management of Hodgkin lymphoma. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular functional imaging technique that provides qualitative and quantitative information about the localization and activity of pathophysiological processes. The most commonly used tracer for oncological purposes is 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG). FDG-PET has within recent years become the most important nuclear medicine imaging modality in the management of lymphoma. This review summarizes the data published so far concerning the value of FDG-PET in staging, treatment monitoring, therapy planning, and follow-up of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). FDG-PET detects more disease sites and involved organs than conventional staging procedures including computerized tomography (CT) and has a large influence on staging. FDG-PET during and after therapy appears to provide considerable prognostic information. However, the impact on patient outcome is not clear since no controlled trials are conducted and follow-up periods are generally short. The value of dual-modality PET/CT and its potential role in the radiotherapy planning is discussed.
