PET-CT interventional tumour therapy. Multifocal metastatic spread of solid tumours is often a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Those patients often cannot undergo curative surgery. Since several years, various types of interventional tumour therapy have been introduced, which may represent a promising option in those cases. In some cases morphological imaging is not able to assess the viability of a previously treated lesion. The combination of computed tomography and positron emission tomography has the potential to ease planning and guiding of interventional procedures and to improve postinterventional control. Due to its higher sensitivity and specificity, PET/CT enables for a more precise selection of patients for interventional tumor therapy. The success of a particular therapy could be assessed with greater accuracy using PET/CT as compared with the separate modalities. PET/CT was also able to improve planning and guiding interventional therapy. As of yet, no data are available concerning the success rate and long-term survival of PET/CT associated interventional procedures.
