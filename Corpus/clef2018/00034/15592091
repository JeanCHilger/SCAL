Prostate cancer localization with 18fluorine fluorocholine positron emission tomography. We evaluated positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine fluorocholine (F FCH) for the pretreatment localization of prostate cancer.A total of 17 patients with prostate cancer who had not yet received treatment for the disease underwent whole body PET following intravenous administration of 3.3 to 4 MBq/kg F FCH. PET findings were compared with the results of prostate sextant biopsy and other imaging studies, and the clinical course. Tracer uptake in prostate sextants was measured as a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and evaluated as a predictor of the prostate sextant biopsy result by ROC analysis.Prostate sextants positive for malignancy on biopsy demonstrated significantly higher SUVmax than biopsy negative sextants (mean 5.5 vs 3.3, p <0.001). In all 6 cases in which biopsy identified malignancy on only 1 side of the prostate it was possible to identify correctly the affected side based on higher SUVmax. Area under the ROC curve for SUVmax as a discriminator of biopsy positive sextants was 0.86. In 2 patients PET demonstrated areas of abnormal uptake in the retroperitoneum. Computerized tomography confirmed the presence of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy in these areas. In the 2 patients these lesions regressed following hormonal treatment for prostate cancer.Malignant tumors in the prostate gland can be localized based on a standardized regional measurement of F FCH uptake. PET with F FCH is potentially useful for staging and localizing prostate cancer.
