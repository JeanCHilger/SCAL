An amorphous selenium based positron emission mammography camera with avalanche gain. Early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial for effective treatment, and the need exists for greater detection ability and specificity than possible by screening x-ray mammography (currently the primary imaging technique for the detection of breast lesions). Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using the radiotracer 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) offers a noninvasive, highly sensitive method for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Images from PET contain unique metabolic information that is not available from anatomical imaging techniques. We propose a Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) imaging system that maintains the established high specificity of FDG PET while providing improved collection efficiency for the radiotracer signal and the potential for images with better spatial resolution. This PEM system will enable detection of lesions that are considerably smaller than those that can be visualized using whole body PET imaging. The compact dual-head PEM camera will be based on an amorphous selenium (a-Se) avalanche photodetector and the scintillator lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO). The camera promises high collection efficiency by combining the fast scintillation light decay and high light yield of LSO with the excellent quantum efficiency, large avalanche gain, and rapid response time of a-Se. We have measured the gain and readout time of an 8 microm a-Se layer and demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed PEM camera.
