Development of [18F]FRP-170 injection for imaging hypoxia by PET. A novel [18F]FRP-170 injection for imaging hypoxia by PET was developed for clinical use. The preparation was based on the simple on-column basic-hydrolysis and the whole procedure was automated by detecting He flow change for transferring and evaporating liquids. [18F]FRP-170 was prepared in around 15-20% decay-corrected radiochemical yield within 60 min and stable in saline for more than 6 hr. Radiochemical purity was over 99% and specific activity at EOS was 40-60 GBq/micromol. The radiation-absorbed dose to the whole body was estimated to be 1.0 mSv/185 MBq. The [18F]FRP-170 injection proved to be suitable for clinical use without acute toxicity or mutagenicity.
