Mechanism of exercise-induced hypotension in coronary artery disease. Hypotension during exercise testing has been considered a marker of extensive coronary artery disease (CAD) and poor prognosis. The mechanism of hypotension was examined in 25 CAD patients who developed hypotension during treadmill exercise testing (mean decrease in systolic blood pressure [BP] 33 +/- 13 mm Hg) (group 1) and was compared with the results of 25 CAD patients who had a normal systolic BP response to exercise (mean increase 53 +/- 15 mm Hg) (group 2). The 2 groups were comparable in age, sex, extent of CAD, previous myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction, history of hypertension and cardiac medications. Exercise heart rate (121 +/- 23 vs 133 +/- 25 beats/min p = not significant [NS]) and duration (6 +/- 2 vs 7 +/- 3 minutes
