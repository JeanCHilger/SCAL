Functional imaging in drug discovery and development. 30 September-1 October 1999, Paris, France. Functional diagnostic imaging techniques, including planar radioscintography, single photon emission tomography, positron emission tomography and computed magnetic resonance imaging, are universally-accepted procedures in medical diagnosis. This symposium focused on the evolving role of these techniques in the discovery and development of new drugs for human use. The relationships between academic/clinical imaging units and the pharmaceutical industry, were examined and assessed in terms of current drug development collaborations. The status of imaging data in new drug submission files and clinical trial files was used as a basis to develop paradigms to facilitate broad-based acceptance of imaging data by the industry and regulatory agencies.
