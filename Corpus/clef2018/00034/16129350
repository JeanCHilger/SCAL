Equipping the exotic mammal practice. Many tools used in small animal practice can be adapted for use with exotic mammals. For those veterinarians with a strong interest in exotic mammals, specific equipment and supply needs need to be taken under consideration. Initial investment need not be great to get started with special species, and as the practice develops more specialized equipment can be added. Starting with equipment that aids in patient husbandry, diagnostic sampling, and routine hospital medical and surgical care is very helpful in creating confidence and expertise with these species. As the practice case load grows more sophisticated, equipment can be added, allowing for better diagnostic workups, medical treatment, and surgical care. The right equipment for the right job makes for a more rewarding and efficient exotic mammal practice. The author describes equipment and products (Table 1) he routinely uses in his private practice, and has provided a list of available sources. Readers should keep in mind that this list is not all-inclusive, and that in many instances products discussed can be found from multiple veterinary distributors or vendors. The author does not promote or recommend one supplier or manufacturer over another.
