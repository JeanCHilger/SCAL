Striatal dopamine D2 receptors, metabolism, and volume in preclinical Huntington disease. Among 27 preclinical carriers of the Huntington disease mutation (PMC), the authors found normal striatal values for MRI volumetry in 88% and for fluorodesoxyglucose PET metabolic index in 67%. Raclopride PET binding potential (RAC-BP) was decreased in 50% and correlated with increases in the product of age and CAG repeat length (p < 0.0005). Dopamine D2 receptor availability measured by RAC-BP seems the most sensitive indicator of early neuronal impairment in PMC.
