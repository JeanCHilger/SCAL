Preoperative evaluation of prognostic factors in esophageal squamous cell cancer. Despite substantial improvements in the surgical therapy of esophageal squamous cell cancer, the prognosis still remains poor. This is mainly due to locally advanced tumors (T3-4, N+) or systemic metastases (M1) in the majority of patients at initial presentation. It is of the utmost importance to reliably detect relevant pretherapeutic prognostic indicators for optimal individual therapeutic strategies. Pretherapeutic prognostic indicators should therefore discriminate precisely between incurable and potentially curative disease. Preoperative or definitive multimodal treatment is increasingly being offered to patients with locally advanced tumors and opens a broad field for innovative techniques such as pretherapeutic molecular response prediction or early response detection by PET scan to further individualize and optimize treatment strategies.
