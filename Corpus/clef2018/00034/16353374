Resolution-effective diameters for asymmetric-knife-edge pinhole collimators. The effects of penetration are included in the formulas for the prediction of the resolution of pinhole collimators through the use of effective diameters. Expressions of the resolution-effective diameter for pinholes with a double-knife-edge (DKE) profile are available in the literature. In this paper the expressions applicable to asymmetric-knife-edge (AKE) profiles, which include the important case of the single-knife-edge (SKE), are presented. Results indicate that the simplest methods that are still accurate in the calculation of DKE effective diameters do not produce in general formulas with similar accuracy for AKE profiles, due to increased susceptibility to penetration. Especially at high energy (365 keV), for the SKE case more advanced formulas are necessary and were, therefore, derived.
