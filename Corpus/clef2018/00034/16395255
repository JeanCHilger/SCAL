Insulin resistance and impaired myocardial fatty acid metabolism in dialysis patients with normal coronary arteries. We investigated whether insulin resistance is associated with impaired cardiac fatty acid metabolism in maintenance hemodialysis patients without coronary artery disease. We studied 55 nondiabetic (63+/-11 years old) and 51 diabetic (61+/-10 years old) hemodialysis patients with normal coronary arteries, using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with an iodinated fatty acid analogue, iodine-123-beta-methyl iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid ((123)I-BMIPP), to evaluate cardiac fatty acid metabolism. SPECT imaging was graded regionally from 0 (normal) to 4 (absence of tracer) to calculate a summed score for 17 left ventricular segments. Insulin resistance was determined using the homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). HOMA-IR correlated with summed BMIPP score in nondiabetic and diabetic patients. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that HOMA-IR was independently associated with BMIPP summed score in nondiabetic (beta=0.774, t=9.218, P=0.0001) and diabetic patients (beta=0.792, t=9.079, P=0.0001). Left ventricular ejection fraction was lower in nondiabetic subjects with BMIPP summed score of at least 6 plus HOMA-IR of at least 4 than in others with lower values for both assessments (53.1+/-13.8%, n=20 vs 67.7+/-9.1%, n=23, P=0.0002) this was also true in diabetic subjects (50.9+/-15.2%, n=24 vs 71.0+/-13.6%, n=11, P=0.0007). Association between insulin resistance and impaired cardiac fatty acid metabolism may contribute to left ventricular dysfunction in patients with maintenance hemodialysis without coronary diseases.
