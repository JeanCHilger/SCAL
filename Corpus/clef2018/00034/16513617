Assessment of myocardial blood flow using 15O-water and 1-11C-acetate in rats with small-animal PET. This feasibility study was undertaken to determine whether myocardial blood flow (MBF, mL/g/min) could be quantified noninvasively in small rodents using microPET and 15O-water or 1-11C-acetate.MBF was measured in 18 healthy rats using PET and 15O-water (MBF-W) under different interventions and compared with direct measurements obtained with microspheres (MBF-M). Subsequently, MBF was estimated in 24 rats at rest using 1-11C-acetate (MBF-Ace) and compared with measurements obtained with 15O-water. Using factor analysis, images were processed to obtain 1 blood and 1 myocardial time-activity curve per tracer per study. MBF-W was calculated using a well-validated 1-compartment kinetic model. MBF-Ace was estimated using a simple 1-compartment model to estimate net tracer uptake, K1 (K1 (mL/g/min) = MBF.E E = first-pass myocardial extraction of 1-11C-acetate) and washout (k2 (min(-1))) along with F(BM) (spillover correction) after fixing F(MM) (partial-volume correction) to values obtained from 15O-water modeling. K1 values were converted to MBF values using a first-pass myocardial extraction/flow relationship measured in rats (E = 1.0-0.74.exp(-1.13/MBF)).In the first study, MBF-W correlated well with MBF-M (y = 0.74x + 0.96 n = 18, r = 0.91, P < 0.0001). However, the slope was different than unity, P < 0.05). Refitting of the data after forcing the intercept to be zero resulted in a nonbias correlation between MBF-W and MBF-M (y = 0.95x + 0.0MBF can be quantified by PET using (15)O-water or 1-11C-acetate in healthy rats. Future studies are needed to determine the accuracy of the methods in low-flow states and to develop an approach for a partial-volume correction when 1-11C-acetate is used.
