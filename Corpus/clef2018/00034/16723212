PET imaging of the basal ganglia. The present chapter reviews PET imaging in basal ganglia disorders Parkinson's disease is used as a model of these disorders because the neurochemical pathobiology of this disease is well known and great advances in the imaging area have been achieved. Other basal ganglia disorders including Tourette's syndrome, dystonia, Huntington's chorea and Wilson's disease are also dealt with. With PET and SPECT techniques, the whole integrative dopaminergic network of neurons can be studied, which plays an important role in differential diagnostics. Furthermore, pharmacological effects of medication can be visualized and the role of stereotaxic neurosurgery can be evaluated. Finally, functional imaging gives clues about the prognosis and rehabilitation aspects of the basal ganglia disorders.
