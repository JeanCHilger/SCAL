Prognostic value of myocardial perfusion imaging in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients after percutaneous coronary intervention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We revised retrospectively patients after PCI that underwent MPI and were followed for a year for the presence of MACE. We found no differences in the incidence of MACE between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. On multivariate analysis, the presence of ischemia by MPI was the most important independent predictor of MACE (OR 5.09, CI 95% 2.15-12.05, p < 0.001). The presence of myocardial ischemia by MPI performed after PCI, and no symptom status, predicts a worse outcome during 1 year of follow-up.
