What is the link between nonlocalizing sestamibi scans, multigland disease, and persistent hypercalcemia? A study of 401 consecutive patients undergoing parathyroidectomy. We hypothesized that nonlocalizing sestamibi scans would correlate with multigland disease and persistent primary hyperparathyroidism.We reviewed records for 401 consecutive patients who underwent parathyroidectomy from 1999 to 2004. Gender, age, preoperative imaging, surgical findings, gland weight and volume, and 6-month calcium levels (Ca) were examined.We identified 289 women and 112 men, 297 of whom had a preoperative sestamibi scan localized to a single gland (localized group LG). Ninety-six percent of the LG were found to have single-gland disease, and 4% had multigland disease (MGD). In the nonlocalized group (NLG), 76% had single-gland disease and 24% MGD. Mean gland weight was greater in the LG than in the NLG (1128 mg vs 699 mgNonlocalizing sestamibi scans were more common in primary hyperparathyroidism with MGD and were associated with smaller-volume abnormal glands found at operation. Preoperative sestamibi scan-results did not predict HCa at 6 months.
