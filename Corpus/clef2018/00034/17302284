Molecular imaging for drug development. In vivo molecular imaging has become a key technology for pathophysiological science and drug development. We are mostly utilizing PET(positron emission tomography) as a first-choice modality, because of its ultra-high sensitivity for molecules, adequate temporal and spatial resolution, and especially broad spectrum of target molecules. In vivo molecular imaging could bring the high-quality information about: 1. Molecular diagnosis for living patients with symptoms 2. Closer approach for etiology and differential diagnosis 3. Direct follow-up of key molecules as disease markers 4. Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics in primates/human 5. Dose finding information for individuals, corresponding to SNPs 6. Direct evidence for accumulation in non-target organs related to adverse effects 7. Drug effects with surrogate markers 8. Early decision of dropout substances (drug candidates) Here, the examples are shown as beta-amyloid imaging for Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impairment, serotonin transporter imaging for chronic fatigue, and dopaminergic components imaging for evaluation of drug for autistic spectrum disorder. In 2005, RIKEN and National Institute of Radiological Science were selected as the key centers for development of All-Japan research network to further promote mutual international and multi -disciplinary collaboration on in vivo molecular imaging.
