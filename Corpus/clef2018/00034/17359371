Guidelines for the use of imaging in the management of myeloma. In 2001, reference to the use of imaging in the British Committee for Standards in Haematology guidelines for the diagnosis and management of myeloma was confined to the standard use of plain X-rays in the diagnostic skeletal survey and emergency use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the setting of cord compression. Since then, there has been a steady rise in interest in the use of various imaging techniques in the management of myeloma. The purpose of imaging in the management of myeloma includes the assessment of the extent and severity of the disease at presentation, the identification and characterisation of complications, and the assessment of response to therapy. Plain radiography, CT, and MR imaging are generally established examination techniques in myeloma whilst positron emission tomography (PET) and (99)Technetium sestamibi (MIBI) imaging are promising newer scanning techniques under current evaluation. These stand-alone imaging guidelines discuss recommendations for the use of each modality of imaging at diagnosis and in the follow up of patients with myeloma.
