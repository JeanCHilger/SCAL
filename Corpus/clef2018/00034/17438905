99mTc isonitrils biophysical aspects in pulmonary tuberculosis. Part I. In vivo evaluation of 99mTc MIBI and 99mTc Tetrofosmin biophysical localization mechanisms. The aim of our study was to compare the role of lung perfusion scintigraphy with 1mTc MIBI and 99mTc Tetrofosmin (Mw) for the initial diagnostic evaluation of pulmonary tuberculosis-PTB).Two groups of new PTB diagnosed patients, without treatment, were studied: group I--41 patients were imaged with 99mTc MIBI (sex ratio men:women = 17:24, mean age 25 years, 26 positive Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MT) smears, 15 negative MT smears), group II--40 patients were imaged with 99mTc Mw (sex ratio men:women = 21:19 mean age: 32.5 yearsQualitatively, radiotracer uptake classification was coded: without uptake (-) low uptake (+)Both radiotracers are useful for the imaging evaluation of PTB, and can give evidence of new sites, related to radiology. The contrast between pathologic and normal uptake is more evident in 99rTc Mw images than in 99mTc MIBI images, how it was demonstrated by the index quantification. The in vivo uptake kinetic for 99mTc Mw seems to be similar with that of 99mTc MIBI for the first 60 minutes but, at 120 minutes showed delayed washout. This can be useful in the differential diagnosis from other lung disease where the radiotracer kinetic is different.
