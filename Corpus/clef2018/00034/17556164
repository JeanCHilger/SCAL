Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia in coronary artery disease patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a risk factor for poor outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) also identifies a subset of CAD patients at increased risk for future cardiovascular events. Susceptibility to MSIMI in patients with CAD and reduced LVEF is unknown.We enrolled 182 patients (67 women) with a mean age of 64 years and a documented history of CAD in this study. Baseline resting ejection fraction was determined by use of technetium 99m sestamibi gated single photon emission computed tomography. Abnormal LVEF was defined as less than 45% for men and less than 50% for women (based on published norms for our software [Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]). All participants underwent mental stress testing with a public speaking task. Rest/stress myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography was performed via conventional methodology. Images were visually compared for number and severity of perfusion defects by use of a scoring method from 0 to 4. A summed difference score was calculated as the difference between summed stress and rest scores. A score of greater than 3 was considered abnormal. MSIMI developed in 19% of patients with normal LVEF and 31% of those with reduced LVEF. There is no statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = .11).CAD patients with left ventricular dysfunction are equally susceptible to MSIMI as those with normal LVEF.
