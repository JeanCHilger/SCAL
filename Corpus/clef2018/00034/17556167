Influence of the postexercise acquisition delay on the detection of functional abnormalities in sestamibi-gated SPECT. Gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) identifies functional changes produced by ischemia, but the influence of acquisition delay on their detection is not established.In 80 patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, gated SPECT was acquired twice: first, less than 30 minutes after peak exercise (stress 1), and second, more than 45 minutes after peak exercise (stress 2). End-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and ejection fraction (EF) were compared with perfusion. The relationship between the DeltaEF (stress EF - resting EF) and the summed difference score (SDS) was -0.443 (P < .0001) for stress 1 and -0.416 (P < .0001) for stress 2. In stress 1, EF increased in patients without inducible ischemia (SDS = 0) (57% +/- 10% vs 54% +/- 9% at rest, P < .02) and decreased in those with an SDS of 1 or greater (53% +/- 10.8% vs 55% +/- 9.6% at rest, P < .05). In stress 2, EF was unchanged in patients without ischemia (55.8% +/- 9.7%, P = .06) and decreased in the other patients (52.8% +/- 10.2%, P < .01). In patients without ischemia, both the EDV and ESV decreased significantly in stress 1 and were unchanged in stress 2. In patients with an SDS of 1 or greater, the EDV remained unchanged and the ESV minimally decreased in stress 1, whereas both volumes clearly and significantly increased in stress 2.The early acquisition of postexercise gated SPECT is slightly more effective in detecting ischemia-related functional changes however, a delayed acquisition within 60 minutes still permits the detection of functional abnormalities in most patients.
