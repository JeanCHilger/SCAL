Age-related changes in the metabolic activity and distribution of the red marrow as demonstrated by 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose-positron emission tomography. The objective of the study was to determine age-related changes occurring in red marrow with regard to its distribution and the degree of its metabolic activity by whole-body 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET).This retrospective study included 112 patients (56 male, 56 female, mean age 40 years, range 2-85) who underwent whole-body FDG-PET scans for assessment of disorders that were determined not to affect red marrow activity. These patients were categorized into the following groups with equal gender distribution: 0-15 years (12 individuals), 16-25 years (20), 26-35 years (10), 36-45 years (20), 46-55 years (14), 56-65 years (16), 66-75 years (14), and 76-85 years (6). Whole-body FDG-PET images were performed at 60 min after the intravenous administration of 0.14 mCi/kg of FDG. By employing a dedicated whole-body PET scanner. Maximal standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) was calculated from three consecutive transverse sections of the upper thirds of the humeri and femora, manubrium of the sternum, 12th thoracic and 5th lumbar vertebra and anterior superior iliac crests of the pelvis. All available results from other imaging examinations [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and conventional radiolography], laboratory data, biopsies, and the clinical course of these subjects were reviewed to make certain that the bone marrow sites examined were free of any known pathologies.SUV(max) in the extremities showed significant decline with aging (correlation coefficient of -0.60 to -0.67, p < 0.01). In contrast, a weak correlation was noted in the axial skeletal activity with advancing age (correlation coefficient of -0.28 to -0.48, p < 0.05).These data suggest that FDG metabolic activity of the red marrow in the extremities decline significantly with normal aging, while that of the axial skeleton show minimal decrease related to this biologic phenomenon. These findings are of value in assessing the effects of hematological and other disorders in the distribution and the metabolic activity of this important tissue and testing therapeutic interventions that are employed for treating such maladies.
