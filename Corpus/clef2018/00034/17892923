The role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in detecting metastatic deposits of recurrent medullary thyroid carcinoma: a prospective study. To assess the diagnostic role of 18F-FDG PET/CT performed with a hybrid tomograph in the detection of tumoral deposits of recurrent medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).Nineteen MTC patients with elevated serum calcitonin levels (58-1350 pg/ml) after first treatment were enrolled (11 F, 8 M, mean age 53.4 years, 14 sporadic MTC, 5 MEN-related MTC). All patients had previously undergone total thyroidectomy and lymphoadenectomy. When referred to us, they were studied with ultrasound (US), 18F-FDG PET/CT, (111)In-pentetreotide scan, and contrast-enhanced whole-body CT (c.e. CT). In 4 patients with equivocal abdominal findings at 18F-FDG PET/CT and/or at c.e. CT, laparoscopy was also performed.18F-FGD PET/CT depicted metastases in 15 patients, 111In-pentetreotide in 8, c.e. CT in 11, US in 6. In 2 patients, liver micrometastases were detected at laparoscopy only. At a lesion-by-lesion analysis, 18F-FDG PET/CT visualized a total of 26 metastatic deposits, c.e. CT 18, 111In-pentetreotide 12, US 8. Final diagnosis was obtained by cytological or surgical findings. Four patients with evidence of limited metastatic spread to neck/upper mediastinum were re-operated, and in 2 of them serum calcitonin levels normalized.In our study, 18F-FDG PET/CT was the most sensitive imaging modality in detecting metastases in recurrent MTC patients with increased serum calcitonin levels. Moreover, 18F-FDG PET/CT was useful in some patients to plan a more accurate re-operation. From a diagnostic point of view, a multimodality imaging approach is recommended in recurrent MTC, especially based on the combination of c.e. CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT.
