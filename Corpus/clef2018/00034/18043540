Non-standard radionuclide production for PET in Japan. There is a limited number of non-standard positron emission tomography (PET) radionuclides available in Japan. At the present time, non-standard PET nuclides ((64)Cu and (62)Zn/(62)Cu generator) are available from a medium energy cyclotron at the National Institute for Radiological Sciences in Chiba, Japan. Targetry for a small cyclotron has been installed on the cyclotrons of the University of Fukui. The production and distribution of these radionuclides from these cyclotrons will be described.
