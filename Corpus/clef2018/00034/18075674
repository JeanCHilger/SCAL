Rapid C-carboxylation of nitro[(11)C]methane for the synthesis of ethyl nitro[2-(11)C]acetate. The labelling synthesis of ethyl nitro[2-(11)C]acetate, a synthetic intermediate feasible for (11)C-labelled PET tracers, by C-carboxylation of [(11)C]MeNO(2) with 1-ethoxycarbonylbenzotriazole, and its simple application are presented.
