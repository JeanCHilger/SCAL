Efficacy of selamectin in the treatment of cheyletiellosis in pet rabbits. Cheyletiellosis is a very common parasitic skin disorder of pet rabbits typically associated with pruritus and scaling. In this study, a total 23 rabbits with cheyletiellosis were treated with a single topical application of selamectin at a dose of 12 mg kg(-1). All rabbits were examined at 3 and 5 weeks after treatment. Five weeks after selamectin application, the scaling and pruritus had resolved in all 23 rabbits, and microscopic examination of epidermal debris collected by acetate tape and flea combing was all negative for mites and eggs. No side-effects were observed in any of the rabbits. This indicates that selamectin is an effective treatment for cheyletiellosis in rabbits.
