Novel PSEN1 and PGRN mutations in early-onset familial frontotemporal dementia. Frontotemporal dementia is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome. Mutations in two genes, Microtubule Associated Protein Tau (MAPT) and Progranulin (PGRN), and rarely Presenilin mutations, have been causally linked to this disorder.To investigate the presence of PGRN, PSEN1, PSEN2 and APP mutations in a group of familial early-onset frontotemporal dementia (f-EOFTD) patients negative for MAPT gene mutations.We prospectively studied 17 unrelated subjects diagnosed with f-EOFTD (one case neuropathologically confirmed as FTD-Ub+). Among these subjects eight belonged to eight autosomal dominant families unrelated to each other, and nine had at least one first degree relative affected by dementia.We identified two novel heterozygous mutations in two unrelated patients, Cys139Arg in the PGRN gene and Val412Ile in the PSEN1 gene.Early-onset f-FTD remains a heterogeneous disorder from a genetic point of view. PGRN mutation frequency was low in our sample. The presence of a novel PSEN1 mutation suggests that presenilin molecular studies should be performed when screening for MAPT and PGRN genes is negative.
