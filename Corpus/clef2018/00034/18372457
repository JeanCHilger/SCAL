Microwave ablation of lung malignancies: effectiveness, CT findings, and safety in 50 patients. To retrospectively evaluate effectiveness, follow-up imaging features, and safety of microwave ablation in 50 patients with intraparenchymal pulmonary malignancies.This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board informed consent was waived. From November 10, 2003, to August 28, 2006, 82 masses (mean, 1.42 per patient) in 50 patients (28 men, 22 womenAt follow-up (mean, 10 months), 26% (13 of 50) of patients had residual disease at the ablation site, predicted by using index size of larger than 3 cm (P = .01). Another 22% (11 of 50) of patients had recurrent disease resulting in a 1-year local control rate of 67%, with mean time to first recurrence of 16.2 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis yielded an actuarial survival of 65% at 1 year, 55% at 2 years, and 45% at 3 years from ablation. Cancer-specific mortality yielded a 1-year survival of 83%, a 2-year survival of 73%, and a 3-year survival of 61% these values were not significantly affected by index size of larger than 3 cm or 3 cm or smaller or presence of residual disease. Cavitation (43% [35 of 82] of treated tumors) was associated with reduced cancer-specific mortality (P = .02). Immediate complications included pneumothorax (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grades 1 [18 of 66 patients] and 2 [eight of 66 patients]), hemoptysis (four of 66 patients), and skin burns (CTCAE grades 2 [one of 66 patients] and 3 [one of 66 patients]).Microwave ablation is effective and may be safely applied to lung tumors.
