Positron emission tomography for brain research. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine imaging technique. Through the use of various radiopharmaceuticals, PET allows in vivo imaging of regional cerebral functions, including cerebral blood flow, molecular metabolism, and receptor binding capacity. PET is useful not only for diagnosis and therapeutic planning but also for neurological science research.
