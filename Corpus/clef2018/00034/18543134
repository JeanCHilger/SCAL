Importance of fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and endoscopic ultrasonography parameters in predicting survival following surgery for esophageal cancer. To assess the prognostic importance of standardized uptake value (SUV) for 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) at positron emission tomography (PET) and of EUS parameters, in esophageal cancer patients primarily treated by surgery.Between October 2002 and August 2004 a prospective cohort study involved 125 patients, with histologically proven cancer of the esophagus, without evidence of distant metastases or locally irresectable disease based on extensive preoperative work-up, and fit to undergo major surgery. Follow-up was complete until October 2006, ensuring a minimal potential follow-up of 25 months.The median SUV was 0.27 (interquartile range 0.13 - 0.45), and was used as cutoff value between high (n = 62) and low (n = 63) SUV. Patients with a high SUV had a significantly worse disease-specific survival compared with patients with a low SUV (P = 0.04). Tumor location (P = 0.005), EUS T stage (P < 0.001), EUS N stage (P = 0.006) and clinical stage (P < 0.006) were also associated with disease-specific survival. However, in multivariate analysis only EUS T stage appeared to be of independent prognostic significance (P = 0.007).In esophageal cancer patients, EUS T stage, EUS N stage, location and SUV of the primary tumor are pretreatment factors that are associated with disease-specific survival. However, only EUS T stage is an independent prognostic factor.
