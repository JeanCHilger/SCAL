Planogram rebinning with the frequency-distance relationship. We present an efficient rebinning algorithm for positron emission tomography (PET) systems with panel detectors. The rebinning algorithm is derived in the planogram coordinate system which is the native data format for PET systems with panel detectors and is the 3-D extension of the 2-D linogram transform developed by Edholm. Theoretical error bounds and numerical results are included.
