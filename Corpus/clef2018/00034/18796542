Task-evoked BOLD responses are normal in areas of diaschisis after stroke. Cerebral infarction can cause diaschisis, a reduction of blood flow and metabolism in areas of the cortex distant from the site of the lesion. Although the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal is increasingly used to examine the neural correlates of recovery in stroke, its reliability in areas of diaschisis is uncertain.The effect of chronic diaschisis as measured by resting positron emission tomography on task-evoked BOLD responses during word-stem completion in a block design fMRI study was examined in 3 patients, 6 months after a single left hemisphere stroke involving the inferior frontal gyrus and operculum.The BOLD responses were minimally affected in areas of chronic diaschisis.Within the confines of this study, the mechanism underlying the BOLD signal, which includes a mismatch between neuronally driven increases in blood flow and a corresponding increase in oxygen use, appears to be intact in areas of chronic diaschisis.
