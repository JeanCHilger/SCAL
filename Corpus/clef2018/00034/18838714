Involved-nodal radiation therapy as a component of combination therapy for limited-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma: a question of field size. Combined-modality therapy is the standard of care for limited-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). Radiation therapy has evolved from extended-field radiation therapy (EFRT) to involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT), reducing toxicity while maintaining high cure rates. Recent publications recommend a further reduction to involved-nodal radiation therapy (INRT), however, this has not been clinically validated.We identified 325 patients with limited-stage HL, diagnosed between May 1, 1989 and April 1, 2005, and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy following era-specific guidelines: EFRT until 1996 IFRT from 1996 to 2001At diagnosis, median age was 35 years 52% maleReduction in field size appears to be safe, without an increased risk of LRR in patients receiving INRT < or = 5 cm.
