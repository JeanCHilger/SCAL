Positron emission tomography in surveillance of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma after definitive chemoradiotherapy. We assessed the role of (18)F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (PET) in detecting head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) after definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT).A prospective study presented 80 PET before and after CRT for 44 patients, including 44 first-time post-CRT scans performed between 12 and 17 weeks after radiotherapy completion, as well as 10 repeated scans in the subsequent follow-up. PET interpretations were compared with clinicopathologic outcomes.PET demonstrated better performance than CT in post-CRT surveillance. Considering all 54 post-CRT PET scans, sensitivity for detecting primary tumors was 100%, specificity 93%, positive predictive value (PPV) 80%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 100%. For cervical diseases, sensitivity was 100%, specificity 98%, PPV 92%, and NPV 100%. For distant metastases, sensitivity was 100%, specificity 98%, PPV 86%, and NPV 100%.Negative PET readings were reliable for predicting free of HNSCC and helpful for selected patients in post-CRT surveillance.
