Human biodistribution and dosimetry of the D2/3 agonist 11C-N-propylnorapomorphine (11C-NPA) determined from PET. We measured the whole-body distribution of intravenously injected (11)C-N-propylnorapomorphine ((11)C-NPA), a dopamine agonist PET tracer, in human subjects and determined the resulting absorbed radiation doses.Six subjects (3 women, 3 men) were injected with (11)C-NPA (nominal dose, 370 MBq). A total of 9 consecutive whole-body PET scans were obtained for each subject. In addition, time-activity curves for 12 organs were determined, and residence times were computed for each subject. Dosimetry was determined for the various body organs and the whole body.The average NPA whole-body radiation dose was 3.17 x 10(-3) mSv per MBq of injected (11)C-NPA. The organ receiving the highest dose was the gallbladder wall, with an average of 2.81 x 10(-2) mSv.MBq(-1).On the basis of averaged dosimetry results, an administration of less than 1,780 MBq (<48 mCi) of (11)C-NPA yields an organ dose of under 50 mSv (5 rem) to all organs.
