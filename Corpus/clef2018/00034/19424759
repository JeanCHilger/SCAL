FDG-accumulating atherosclerotic plaques identified with 18F-FDG-PET/CT in 141 patients. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques based on [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in a large population characterized by high risk of cardiovascular disease.One hundred forty-one patients referred to our department for FDG-PET/CT for suspected lung cancer were re-evaluated for atherosclerotic lesions. Cardiovascular risk factors were analyzed based on patient records.Forty-two percent of the patients had three cardiovascular risk factors or more. Nine percent of all plaques were assessed as active FDG-accumulating plaques, 88% were inactive calcified plaques, and 2% were mixed. The abdominal aorta was the vessel with the highest plaque count. Patients with one risk factor had significantly less active and inactive plaques.The observed association between the numbers of cardiovascular risk factors and the numbers of FDG-accumulating plaques as well as calcified plaques further supports the validity and value of FDG-PET/CT in the non-invasive identification and characterization of atherosclerotic disease.
