Expression of hexokinases and glucose transporters in treated and untreated oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to assess the expression pattern of the high glucose affinity glucose transporters GLUT 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9 and of hexokinases I, II and III in newly diagnosed oesophageal adenocarcinoma by means of immunohistochemistry. Twenty patients eligible to undergo primary surgery and 18 patients with incomplete pathological response following induction radio chemotherapy, all suffering from oesophageal adenocarcinoma, were included in the study. The intensity and amount of positive tumour cells in the immuno-reaction (histology score (Hscore)) for GLUT 1, 3, 4, 8 and 9 as well as for hexokinase I, II and III were assessed independently by two experienced observers, blinded to the clinical results. In patients that underwent primary surgery, Hscores of GLUT8 (micro 6.7 sd3.3) and GLUT1 (micro 5.5
