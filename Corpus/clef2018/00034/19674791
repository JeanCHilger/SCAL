Interictal arterial spin-labeling MRI perfusion in intractable epilepsy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is required for the investigation of surgically intractable epilepsy. In addition to the standard MRI techniques, perfusion sequences can be added to improve visualization of underlying pathological changes. Arterial spin-labeling (ASL) MRI perfusion does not require contrast administration and, for this reason, may have advantages in these patients.We report here on 16 patients with epilepsy who underwent MRI of the brain with ASL and positron emission tomography (PET).Despite a slightly reduced resolution with ASL, we found a correlation between ASL, PET and electrophysiological data, with hypoperfusion on ASL that corresponded with hypoperfusion on interictal PET.Given the correlation between ASL and PET and electrophysiology, perfusion with ASL could become part of the standard work-up in patients with epilepsy.
