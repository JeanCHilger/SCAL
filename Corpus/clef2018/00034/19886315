Peritoneal dialysis patients with high effluent fibrin degradation products. Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a major and fatal complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). For treatment, the efficacies of steroids, tamoxifen, immunosuppressants, and surgical total intestinal enterolysis have been reported, but the results have not been sufficient. Because treatment after the onset of EPS is limited, a prophylactic therapy is needed. We previously reported that the level of effluent fibrin degradation products (eFDPs) is predictive of EPS. In the present study, we investigated the clinical course of PD cases with high eFDP levels, and the effect of prophylactic steroid therapy against EPS. Between January 2002 and August 2008, we investigated 310 PD patients, of whom 22 had an eFDP level of 30 microg/mL or more in 4-hour effluent from a fast peritoneal equilibration test (PET). Mean patient age was 62.6 +/- 11.1 years, and mean duration of dialysis was 42.7 +/- 45.5 months (range: 1 - 202 months). During a fast PET performed every 6 months, we measured, in 4-hour effluent, eFDPs, cancer antigen 125 (eCA125), and dialysate-to-plasma creatinine (D/P Cr). In addition, we calculated D/P beta2-microglobulin (beta2MG) from levels in overnight dialysis effluent and blood. In the 22 cases, the mean eFDP level was 66.6 +/- 39.2 microg/mL the D/P Cr 0.78 +/- 0.1
