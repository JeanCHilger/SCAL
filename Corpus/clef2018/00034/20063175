Phase II trial of intratumoral BCNU injection and radiotherapy on untreated adult malignant glioma. DTI-015 (BCNU dissolved in ethanol) utilizes solvent facilitated perfusion (SFP) for intratumoral drug delivery. A phase II clinical trial of DTI-015 and fractionated external beam radiotherapy on newly diagnosed, malignant gliomas investigated early changes in tumour physiology and metabolism, clinical outcome and safety. Pre- and post DTI-015 injection neuro-imaging included computed tomography (CT) cerebral blood flow and volume, glucose and thallium single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinical status was determined before and after DTI-015, prior to radiotherapy and 3 monthly thereafter until progression (defined by Macdonald criteria). Primary endpoint was radiographic response. Secondary endpoints were progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Twelve patients were enrolled eight glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), four anaplastic astrocytoma (AA). Three days after DTI-015 injection, mean tumour blood flow (Paired t-test
