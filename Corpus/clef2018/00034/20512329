Combined single photon emission computerised tomography and conventional computerised tomography (SPECT/CT) in patellofemoral disorders: a clinical review. Patellofemoral disorders are common conditions seen in a knee clinic but can present a great diagnostic challenge to the orthopaedic surgeon. Combined single photon emission computerised tomography with conventional computer tomography (SPECT/CT) provides the clinician with precise anatomical and physiological information of the patellofemoral joint. We present a clinical review that highlights the value of SPECT/CT in patients with patellofemoral disorders, where other modalities such as radiographs, MRI, and conventional CT did not provide sufficient information. SPECT/CT has proven to be helpful for establishing the diagnosis and guidance for further treatment. SPECT/CT should be recognised as a valuable diagnostic tool in orthopaedic patients.
