Maternal insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF-1, IGF-2) and IGF BP-3 and the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. To investigate the relationship between levels of insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF-1, IGF-2) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) in antenatal maternal serum and gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia (PET).Prospective cohort study of 1650 low-risk Caucasian women in a University teaching hospital in London. Statistical analysis was performed using commercial software (SPSS for Windows, version 6.1, SPSS, Chicago, IL), with P < 0.05 as significant. Maternal IGF 1, IGF 2 and IGF BP-3 were assessed on maternal blood at booking. Blood pressure was checked at each visit in conjunction with urine analysis. The Davey & MacGillivray 1988 classification system was used in making the diagnosis of PET.There was no significant correlation between maternal IGF-1 or IGFBP-3 levels and gestational hypertension or PET. However, a significant positive correlation does exist between maternal IGF-2 levels and PET.Maternal IGF-2 has a significant positive correlation with PET.
