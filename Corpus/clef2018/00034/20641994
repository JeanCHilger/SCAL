 In a variety of solid tumors, hypoxia was found to lead to tumor progression and the resistance of tumors to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (1-3). Tumor oxygenation is heterogeneously distributed within human tumors (4). Hypoxia in malignant tumors is thought to be a major factor limiting the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It would be beneficial to assess tumor oxygenation before and after therapy to provide an evaluation of tumor response to treatment and an insight into new therapeutic treatments (5). Tumor oxygenation is measured invasively using computerized polarographic oxygen-sensitive electrodes, which is regarded as the gold standard (6). Functional and non-invasive imaging of intratumoral hypoxia has been demonstrated to be feasible for the measurement of tumor oxygenation (7). Chapman proposed the use of 2-nitroimidazoles for hypoxia imaging (8). 2-Nitroimidazole compounds are postulated to undergo reduction in hypoxic condition, forming highly reactive oxygen radicals that subsequently bind covalently to macromolecules inside the cells (9).
