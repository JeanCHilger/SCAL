Differential kinetics of α-[¹¹C]methyl-L-tryptophan on PET in low-grade brain tumors. Increased tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway is a major mechanism of tumor immuno-resistance. α-[(11)C]Methyl-L: -tryptophan (AMT) is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for tryptophan catabolism, and increased AMT uptake has been demonstrated in brain tumors. In this study we evaluated the use of AMT PET for detection of low-grade gliomas and glioneuronal tumors, and determined if kinetic parameters of AMT uptake can differentiate among tumor types. AMT PET images were obtained in 23 patients with newly diagnosed low-grade brain tumors (WHO grade II gliomas and WHO grade I dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors [DNETs]). Kinetic variables, including the unidirectional uptake rate (K-complex) and volume of distribution (VD which characterizes tracer transport), were measured using a graphical approach from tumor dynamic PET and blood-input data, and metabolic rates ([Formula: see text]) were also calculated. These values as well as tumor/cortex ratios were compared across tumor types. AMT PET showed increased tumor/cortex K-complex (n = 16) and/or VD ratios (n = 15) in 21/23 patients (91%), including 11/13 tumors with no gadolinium enhancement on MRI. No increases in AMT were seen in an oligodendroglioma and a DNET. Astrocytomas and oligoastrocytomas showed higher [Formula: see text] tumor/cortex ratios (1.66 ± 0.46) than oligodendrogliomas (0.96 ± 0.21
