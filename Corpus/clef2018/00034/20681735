Barrier films from renewable forestry waste. Biobased free-standing films and coatings with low oxygen permeability were designed from a wood hydrolysate according to a recovery and formulation procedure that provides added value to wood converting industrial processes. Wood components released to the wastewater in the hydrothermal treatment of spruce wood were recovered and converted to an oligo- and polysaccharide-rich, noncellulosic fraction that was utilized in film formulations in a range of concentrations and compositions. Free-standing smooth and transparent films as well as coatings on thin PET were prepared and characterized with respect to oxygen permeability, tensile properties, structure, and water vapor transmission. With oxygen permeabilities as low as below 1 cm(3) Î¼m m(-2) day(-1) kPa(-1) and with adequate mechanical properties, the films and coatings show promising property profiles for renewable packaging applications.
