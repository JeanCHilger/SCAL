72/74As-labeling of HPMA based polymers for long-term in vivo PET imaging. In the context of molecular imaging, various polymers based on the clinically approved N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide (HPMA) have been radio-labeled using longer-living positron emitters 72As t1/2=26 h or 74As t1/2=17.8 d. This approach may lead to non-invasive determination of the long-term in vivo fate of polymers by PET (positron emission tomography). Presumably, the radio label itself will not strongly influence the polymer structure due to the fact that the used nuclide binds to already existing thiol moieties within the polymer structure. Thus, the use of additional charges or bulky groups can be avoided.
