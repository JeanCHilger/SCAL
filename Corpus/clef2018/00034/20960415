Safety and tolerance of dietary supplementation with a canine-derived probiotic (Bifidobacterium animalis strain AHC7) fed to growing dogs. Although probiotics are generally considered to be safe, their increasingly widespread use warrants better understanding of their risks in companion animals. This study evaluated the safety and tolerance of dietary supplementation with a canine-derived probiotic, Bifidobacterium animalis strain AHC7 (Prostora, Procter & Gamble Pet Care), fed to growing beagles beginning at approximately 6 months of age (11 males 9 females). Probiotic B. animalis AHC7 administered orally once per day at a dose of up to 5 x 1010 colony-forming units for at least 12 consecutive weeks was well tolerated with no safety concerns.
