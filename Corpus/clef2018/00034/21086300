Prostate cancer: transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of local recurrence after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. OBJECTIVES. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) as salvage therapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer after external beam radiotherapy or recurrences located in the region of vesicourethral anastomosis after radical prostatectomy. METHODS. Transrectal biopsy of the prostate (recurrence after radiotherapy) or in the region of vesicourethral anastomosis (recurrence after prostatectomy) was performed in all cases at the time of biochemical relapse. Only patients with positive biopsy were treated. Systemic disease was excluded by PET-CT and bone scan. All treatments were carried out under spinal anesthesia. The device used was Ablatherm (EDAP, Lion, France). The patients were followed with PSA measurement every 3 months and clinical examination every 6 months. In case of biochemical relapse we performed re-biopsy. RESULTS. From 2002 to 2008 we treated 19 patients with local recurrence after radiotherapy. The mean follow-up was 30 months for each patient (range 6-72 months). 9 patients (47%) are disease-free at last followup, with PSA < 1 ng/mL. 9 patients experienced biochemical failure: 8 were treated with androgen deprivation, 1 with salvage prostatectomy. 2 patients died of the disease. Adverse events related to HIFU included 1 rectourethral fistula (observed before the use of specific parameters dedicated to this patient population) and mild incontinence (2-3 pads/die) in 4 patients. From 2002 to 2008 we treated 27 patients with a local recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Mean pre-HIFU PSA was 2.17 ng/mL (range 0.5-8 ng/ml) the Gleason score ranged from 5 to 8. All patients reached a minimum follow-up of 20 months (range 20-80 months). Median PSA nadir was 0.2 ng/ml. The disease-free rate was 51% (14/27)
