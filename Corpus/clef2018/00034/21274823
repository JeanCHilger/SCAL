Endophenotypes and suicide behaviour. Recent studies have suggested that genetic predisposition to suicidal behavior may be independent of the risk of suicide associated to mental disorders, such as affective disorders, schizophrenia or alcohol dependence. Given the suicidal behavior heterogeneity and its hereditary complexity, the need to find demonstrable intermediate phenotypes that may make it possible to establish links between genes and suicide behaviors (endophenotypes) seems to be necessary. The main objective is to review which are the candidate endophenotypes of suicidal behaviors.We carried out a non-systematic review of all published literature in English, French and Spanish in MEDLINE. The search terms were endophenotypes and suicide behaviors.The main candidate endophenotypes of suicidal behaviors are neuropsychological (decision-making, executive functions), personality traits (impulsivity, aggressiveness, and neuroticism), neurochemistry (5-HIAA in CNS) and neuroimaging (fMRI of cerebral amygdala or PET of prefrontal cortex metabolism).
