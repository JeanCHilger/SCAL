Positron emission tomography findings relevant to neurosurgery for epilepsy. Using the 2-[F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose method, 213 positron emission tomographic (PET) studies of local brain glucose metabolism (CMRglu) were performed in 124 patients with various forms of epilepsy. Interictal PET scans of primary epileptics typically showed some global metabolic depression and decreased functional activity of insular, basal and anterior temporal cortex. Epilepsia partialis continua Kozevnikov was characterized by hypo- or hyper-metabolism of perirolandic cortex. Tuberous sclerosis was distinguished by neocortical foci of significantly decreased glucose consumption. Even in the interictal resting state, with regard to sensitivity (greater than 90%) and accuracy of focus localization. PET was superior to other diagnostic methods in typical temporal lobe epilepsy. Averaging 23% below normal CMRglu, the majority of hypometabolic foci were found in mesial temporal structures. Improved distinction between the epileptogenic area and the surrounding tissue showing comparatively normal functional responsiveness, was achieved by psychophysical activation using emotional speech or continuous visual recognition during PET scanning. In patients who had undergone total cerebral hemispherectomy because of uncontrolled epilepsy, remarkable recruitment of association areas was observed on both motor and speech activation.
