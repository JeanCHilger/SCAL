What is new in the management of salivary gland cancers? Salivary gland malignancies are a rare and heterogeneous group of tumors with considerable variability in their natural history. Historically they have been treated with surgery and radiation therapy. It is only recently that there has been any growth in our understanding of these diseases and their management, and this progress will be reviewed.There has been a considerable increase in the utilization of the PET scan in the staging of many malignancies. Reports are now emerging of the successful use of PET or PET/CT for the salivary gland cancers as well. The recent identification of characteristic molecular signatures in specific histologic subtypes of salivary gland cancer has sparked interest in the potential for better diagnostic classification and more specific, molecularly targeted therapies. These are being intensively explored. Although the systemic management of these diseases has historically involved a number of relatively ineffective chemotherapeutic agents, newer and more promising schedules of chemotherapy and radiation are now being tested.Although the salivary gland cancers are uncommon, our growing understanding of their unique biologic characteristics is paving the way toward specific and personalized treatment. Enrollment of these patients onto carefully designed clinical trials is critical.
