Basic performance of a large area PET detector with a monolithic scintillator. Conventionally, block detectors, which consist of a two-dimensionally segmented scintillator array with inserted reflectors, are often used for PET. On the other hand, PET detectors with a monolithic block have been investigated because they are expected to offer higher resolution than do segmented crystal arrays. However, previous reports focused on detectors dedicated as small-animal PET, and the thickness was not good enough to stop 511-keV radiation. We developed a PET detector that uses a large and thick monolithic LYSO and 64-channel PS-PMT. When the LYSO was covered with reflectors, the spatial resolution, which was 3Â mm FWHM at the center, rapidly became worse at the edge. We eliminated the loss of spatial resolution by replacing the reflectors with black paper, but the light output was decreased. Therefore, we concluded that spatial resolution and light output were in a trade-off relationship due to the edge effect of scintillation light.
