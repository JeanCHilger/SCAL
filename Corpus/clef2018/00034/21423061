99mTc white-cell imaging in inflammatory bowel disease: a comparison of planar versus SPECT. 99mTc-labelled white-cell scintigraphy is sensitive and specific for detecting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A retrospective analysis was carried out on 99 consecutive studies to compare results from planar imaging and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Two observers blindly and independently reported all planar images followed by the SPECTs. Both sets of scans were reported in random order. All possible abnormalities were assigned a confidence rating and specific, preagreed bowel location and their extent measured.The observers disagreed on whether studies were normal in 17 of 99 planar scans (κ=0.56) but only eight of 99 SPECTs (κ=0.83). Consensus reporting, where there was disagreement between observers, yielded the following results: planar and SPECT normal in 56 of 99 cases planar and SPECT positive in 29 of 99 casesReporting from SPECT improves inter-operator variability and appears to improve sensitivity for detecting IBD. Planar imaging also appears to underestimate the extent of active disease.
