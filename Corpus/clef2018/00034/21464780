Reliability of left ventricular ejection fraction calculated with gated myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography in patients with extensive perfusion defect. Gated myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (g-MPS) provides functional information on the left ventricle (LV) apart from the perfusion status. Computer algorithm-based LV ejection fraction (EF) calculated from resting g-MPS has been found to be reliable in patients with normal perfusion. However, its role in patients with extensive perfusion defects is not clear.To find the reliability of LVEF calculated from resting g-MPS in patients with extensive perfusion defects (>25% of LV myocardium) and to correlate this with echocardiography and multigated radionuclide ventriculography (RNV).Thirty patients with fixed perfusion defect of size greater than or equal to 25% of LV myocardium on rest g-MPS study were included. EF was calculated using three software packages: Emory Cardiac Toolbox, Myometrix, and quantitative gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/quantitative perfusion SPECT. The patients underwent RNV (gold standard) and echocardiography within a week of the g-MPS. Agreement among the EF values obtained by different methods was determined using Bland-Altman analysis. Correlation among the EF values was measured using Spearman's rank correlation.Thirty patients (23 male seven femaleThis study suggests that EF calculations, from g-MPS SPECT data using different software, have high agreement with the gold standard RNV even in patients with extensive perfusion defects.
