Neck dissection can be avoided after sequential chemoradiotherapy and negative post-treatment positron emission tomography-computed tomography in N2 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. This study assessed neck control in patients with N2 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with sequential chemoradiotherapy (SCRT) and the incidence of neck recurrence when neck dissection was withheld in those with negative post-treatment fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET).Thirty-four consecutive patients with N2 HNSCC who were treated with radical intent using SCRT were included. Twenty-seven patients received concomitant platinum-based chemotherapy with their radiotherapy. Nineteen patients were treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. PET-computed tomography (PET-CT) was obtained 3 months after the completion of radical radiotherapy. Neck dissection was carried out only in those with increased FDG uptake in the neck.The median follow-up was 39.1 months. One patient had increased FDG uptake in the neck post-treatment, which was false positive for malignancy. The remaining 33 patients were observed without neck dissection. No regional recurrence occurred. The negative predictive value (NPV) of post-treatment PET-CT was 100%.Good disease control in the neck can be achieved in patients with N2 HNSCC with SCRT. Post-treatment PET-CT has a high NPV. Neck dissection can be avoided if post-treatment PET-CT is negative.
