Cardiac fatty acid metabolism and ischemic memory imaging with nuclear medicine techniques. There has been a dramatic improvement in the clinical management of myocardial diseases with the advent of cardiac metabolic and molecular imaging. Although both myocardial perfusion and metabolic imaging provide insight of myocardium at risk for infarction or ischemia, it is known that metabolic derangements precede perfusion abnormalities, especially after reperfusion therapy. Deranged myocyte loses its flexibility of choosing the right substrate for energy production and it switches its substrate, especially between fatty acid (FA) and glucose depending on disease condition for example, predominance of FA metabolism is noted in diabetic heart disease, whereas glucose metabolism is enhanced in pressure overload conditions such as left ventricular hypertrophy. We thus hypothesize that with better technological advancements and different substrates, the metabolic footprint of various heart diseases can be charted out in future to help in the optimization of patient management. This review attempts to discuss the importance of radionuclide-labeled FAs in cardiac metabolic and ischemic memory imaging.
