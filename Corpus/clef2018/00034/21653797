New frontiers in science and technology: nuclear techniques in nutrition. The use of nuclear techniques in nutrition adds value by the increased specificity and sensitivity of measures compared with conventional techniques in a wide range of applications. This article provides a brief overview of well-established stable-isotope techniques to evaluate micronutrient bioavailability and assess human-milk intake in breastfed infants to monitor the transfer of micronutrients from the mother to the infant. Recent developments are highlighted in the use of nuclear techniques to evaluate biological interactions between food, nutrition, and health to move the agenda forward.
