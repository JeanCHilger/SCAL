Translational imaging of lymphatics in cancer. Imaging in the lymphatic system has gone through much advancement over the past 70 years since its beginnings. In this review, we will examine the modalities available for lymphatic imaging. We will explore the modern uses of early modalities, such as ultrasound as well as more modern modalities, such as Positron-Emission Tomography (PET). We will also describe some of the new modalities currently in development and their potential uses for the future as well as some of the current imaging modalities being studied in animal models.
