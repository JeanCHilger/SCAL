Allergen-specific immunotherapy in pet allergy - an update. Animal dander is a common cause of allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma in patients. In this regard, cats and dogs represent major causes of allergy to animal dander. In first line, the therapeutic options include the elimination of the pet from the patient's home as a (secondary) preventive step. However, avoidance of temporary contacts or indirect exposure to cat dander is often difficult, since cat-allergens are widely distributed even in non-cat-keeping households. In general, conventional pharmacologic therapy does not thoroughly prevent allergic symptoms. Therefore, allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) represents an important therapeutic option. This article highlights the current standards and further developments of SIT for cat-allergic patients.
