Synthesis and characterization of diiron dithiolate complexes containing a quinoxaline bridge. A potential model complex for the hydrogenase active site, [Fe(2){(μ-CH(2)S)(2)R}(CO)(6)] (1) (R = quinoxaline), was synthesized by condensation of [(μ-LiS)(2)Fe(2)(CO)(6)] with 2,3-bis(bromomethyl)quinoxaline. Reactions of 1 with bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm) under a range of conditions yielded substituted complexes [Fe(2){(μ-CH(2)S)(2)R}(CO)(5)(dppm)] (2), [Fe(2){(μ-CH(2)S)(2)R}(CO)(4)(k(2)-dppm)] (3) and [Fe(2){(μ-CH(2)S)(2)R}(CO)(4)(μ-dppm)] (4). X-ray crystallography confirms that in 2, the dppm is terminally bonded to an iron atom via one phosphorus atom, whereas in 3, it acts as a chelating ligand to coordinate to an iron center in a dibasal-substituted manner. In 4, the dppm bridges the two iron atoms in a cis basal/basal fashion with one phosphorus bonded to each iron atom. Treatment of 1 with various tertiary phosphines at room temperature in acetonitrile (MeCN) generates a range of mono-substituted products [Fe(2){(μ-CH(2)S)(2)R}(CO)(5)L] (5, L = PEt(3) 6, PMe(3)
