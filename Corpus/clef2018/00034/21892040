Preliminary study on the evaluation of olfactory neuroblastoma using PET/CT. Because of paucity of data available regarding the utility of PET/CT in the diagnosis and staging of patients with olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB), we retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of PET/CT in 9 patients with ONB.Whole-body F-18 FDG PET/CT was performed in 7 patients with newly diagnosed ONB, as well as in 1 patient with recurrence and in 1 patient with remnant tumor. Regional C-11 choline (C-11 CHO) PET/CT was performed in 2 patients with negative F-18 FDG scans. The lesion with intense radiotracer uptake was suggested as positive for tumor and the results of PET/CT were compared with conventional staging examinations.F-18 FDG PET/CT was positive in 7/9 (77.7%) patients with ONB. In 2 patients with negative F-18 FDG, the lesions were C-11CHO avid. Both the primary tumors and its invasions were clearly delineated by F-18 FDG or C-11 CHO PET/CT. SUVmax of F-18 FDG in the primary tumor was 6.37 Â± 4.22 and did not correlate with lesion size (F-18 FDG/size: r = 0.097, P = 0.820). Whole-body F-18 FDG PET/CT detected parapharyngeal and cervical lymph node metastases in 2 patients, lung metastases in 1 patient, liver metastases in 1 patients, and bone metastases in 2 patients. PET/CT altered the stages of 3 of 9 patients with upstaging in 2 patients and downstaging in 1 patient.PET/CT may be useful for the diagnosis and staging of ONB.
