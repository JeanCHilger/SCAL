Expression of a novel dual-functional protein--the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 fused with human acidic fibroblast growth factor in Escherichia coli. Human acidic fibroblast growth factor (haFGF) stimulates repair of delayed healing which still remains a tremendously world-wide issue. However, most of the patients with delayed healings have to face another creeping problem - microbial infection, which is one of the most frequent complications that still lead to wound healing failure. LL-37/hCAP-18 is the only cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptide found in human with a wide range of antimicrobial activities. In the present study, a novel hybrid protein combining LL-37 with haFGF was designed. The DNA sequence encoding recombination fusion protein LL-37-haFGF was subcloned into the pET-21b vector for protein expression in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The recombinant protein was expressed as a His-tagged protein and purified using a combination of Ni affinity and CM-Sepharose chromatography at a purity of 95.43% as detected by RP-HPLC and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Antimicrobial activity assays showed that the purified LL-37-haFGF had improved antimicrobial activities in vitro compared with LL-37. Methylthiazoletetrazolium (MTT) assay showed that the purified LL-37-haFGF also had a distinct mitogenic activity in NIH 3T3 cells. These data suggests the recombinant protein LL-37-haFGF has pharmaceutical potential for applications in wound healing.
