Imaging of the carotid artery. In the study of carotid arteries, modern techniques of imaging allow to analyze various alterations beyond simple luminal narrowing, including the morphology of atherosclerotic plaques, the arterial wall and the surrounding structures. By using CTA and MRI it is possible to obtain three-dimensional rendering of anatomic structures with excellent detail for treatment planning. This paper will detail the role of various imaging methods for the assessment of carotid artery pathology with emphasis on the detection, analysis and characterization of carotid atherosclerosis.
