Improved radiosynthesis of the apoptosis marker 18F-ICMT11 including biological evaluation. We improved the specific radioactivity of the apoptosis imaging isatin derivative (18)F-ICMT11. We then evaluated (18)F-ICMT11 in EL4 tumor-bearing mice 24h after treatment with etoposide/cyclophosphamide combination therapy. Dynamic PET imaging demonstrated increased uptake in the drug-treated (0.115±0.011 SUV) compared to the vehicle-treated EL4 tumors (0.083±0.008 SUV). This effect correlated to the observed increases in apoptotic index.
