Novel oncologic drugs: what they do and how they affect images. Targeted therapies are designed to interfere with specific aberrant biologic pathways involved in tumor development. The main classes of novel oncologic drugs include antiangiogenic drugs, antivascular agents, drugs interfering with EGFR-HER2 or KIT receptors, inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and hormonal therapies. Cancer cells usurp normal signal transduction pathways used by growth factors to stimulate proliferation and sustain viability. The interaction of growth factors with their receptors activates different intracellular pathways affecting key tumor biologic processes such as neoangiogenesis, tumor metabolism, and tumor proliferation. The response of tumors to anticancer therapy can be evaluated with anatomic response assessment, qualitative response assessment, and response assessment with functional and molecular imaging. Angiogenesis can be measured by means of perfusion imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging allows imaging evaluation of tumor cellularity. The main imaging techniques for studying tumor metabolism in vivo are positron emission tomography and MR spectroscopy. Familiarity with imaging findings secondary to tumor response to targeted therapies may help the radiologist better assist the clinician in accurate evaluation of tumor response to these anticancer treatments. Functional and molecular imaging techniques may provide valuable data and augment conventional assessment of tumor response to targeted therapies.
