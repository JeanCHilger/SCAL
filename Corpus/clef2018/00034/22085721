A novel protocol for the production of recombinant LL-37 expressed as a thioredoxin fusion protein. LL-37 is the only cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptide found in humans and it has a multifunctional role in host defense. The peptide has been shown to possess immunomodulatory functions in addition to antimicrobial activity. To provide sufficient material for biological and structural characterization of this important peptide, various systems were developed to produce recombinant LL-37 in Escherichia coli. In one previous approach, LL-37 coding sequence was cloned into vector pET-32a, allowing the peptide to be expressed as a thioredoxin fusion. The fusion protein contains two thrombin cleavage sites: a vector-encoded one that is 30-residue upstream of the insert and an engineered one that is immediately adjacent to LL-37. Cleavage at these two sites shall generate three fragments, one of which is the target peptide. However, when the fusion protein was treated with thrombin, cleavage only occurred at the remote upstream site. A plausible explanation is that the thrombin site adjacent to LL-37 is less accessible due to the peptide's aggregation tendency and cleavage at the remote site generates a fragment, which forms a large aggregate that buries the intended site. In this study, I deleted the vector-encoded thrombin site and S tag in pET-32a, and then inserted the coding sequence for LL-37 plus a thrombin site into the modified vector. Although removing the S tag did not change the oligomeric state of the fusion protein, deletion of the vector-encoded thrombin site allowed the fusion to be cleaved at the engineered site to release LL-37. The released peptide was separated from the carrier and cleavage enzyme by size-exclusion chromatography. This new approach enables a quick production of high quality active LL-37 with a decent amount.
