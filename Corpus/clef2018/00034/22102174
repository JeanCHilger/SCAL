The SUVmax (maximum standardized uptake value for F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose) and serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-ag) function as prognostic biomarkers in patients with primary cervical cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic significance of FDG uptake measured as maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in primary tumor by positron emission tomography with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET/CT) and pretreatment serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-ag) in patients with cervical cancer.82 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven cervical cancer who had PET/CT before any treatment were enrolled in this study. The SUVmax of the primary cervical tumor mass was obtained and compared with pretreatment SCC-ag and pathological prognostic factors after the initial treatment.There was significant correlation between the SUVmax of the primary tumor and tumor maximum size (p = 0.0024). The serum SCC-ag had a statistically significant association with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0373), although there was no correlation between the SUVmax of the primary tumor and the serum SCC-ag (r (2) = -0.57). The higher SUVmax of primary tumor (≥11.2) plus pelvic lymph node (PLN) metastasis and higher SUVmax plus higher serum SCC-ag (≥6.4 ng/nl) were two most significant variables that predicted worse prognosis (p = 0.0099 and p = 0.0020, respectively).Higher pretreatment SUVmax of primary tumor indicated worse prognosis, and the prognosis of patients with higher pretreatment SUVmax plus PLN metastasis was even worse both in patients of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and non-SCC of cervix. As for patients with SCC of cervix, higher pretreatment serum SCC-ag not only predicted worse prognosis but also predicted disease recurrence in the posttreatment surveillance.
