Bortezomib in combination with rituximab, dexamethasone, ifosfamide, cisplatin and etoposide chemoimmunotherapy in patients with relapsed and primary refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma may experience extended survival with second-line chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Since a major determinant of outcome after ASCT is responsiveness to second-line therapy, the development of more effective second-line treatments is desirable. We investigated the addition of bortezomib to rituximab, dexamethasone, ifosfamide, cisplatin and etoposide (VIPER). Fifteen patients were enrolled, of whom seven were refractory to first-line chemotherapy and only three had maintained first response for 1 year. Nine (60%) patients achieved objective responses, of which three (20%) were IWC-PET (International Workshop Criteria positron emission tomography) complete responses. Median progression-free survival was 3 months, and median overall survival was 10 months. At a median follow-up of 26 months, five patients (33%) remained alive. Treatment was well tolerated with no unexpected toxicity. Although response rates did not meet predefined criteria, activity was at least comparable to other second-line approaches despite a poor-prognosis patient population.
