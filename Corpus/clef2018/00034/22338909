Clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed as high cardiac event probability by "Heart Risk View". "Heart Risk View" is the software to evaluate the cardiac event probability, and it is based on the results of the prospective cohort study (J-ACCESS). We examined the usefulness of this software. Study population consisted of 83 patients, who were diagnosed that cardiac event probability was over 20% by "Heart Risk View." During the follow-up period (596 +/- 356 days), cardiac event occurred in 23 patients (27.7%), including 7 patients death. No significant differences were observed in the ejection fraction by Quantitative Gated SPECT, total defect score calculated from SPECT, and the percentage of stress perfusion abnormality detected by SPECT between event and non-event groups. However, the percentage of cardiac revascularization therapy based on the SPECT was significantly lower in the event group (9 vs. 38%, p = 0.03). In conclusion, cardiac event probability calculated by "Heart Risk View" was reliable in our study cohort. Cardiac event strongly depended on the cardiac ischemia, for which the therapy was difficult because of lesion complexity or combined diseases.
