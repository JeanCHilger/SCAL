FDG uptake in sternoclavicular joint synovitis: mimic of internal mammary adenopathy. False-positive FDG uptake has been noted in a wide range of benign processes. In this report, we describe a case of FDG uptake in unilateral sternoclavicular synovitis which mimicked an internal mammary node in appearance. Knowledge of this potential false-positive is particularly important in breast cancer patients with a propensity of internal mammary nodal metastases.
