Follow-up of subjects occupationally exposed to asbestos: MRI and PET scans. MRI and PET scans are not normally used for screening and follow-up of patients following occupational exposure to asbestos. These examinations usually complement the investigation of a parenchymal mass, an effusion or pleural thickening. PET and MRI have an excellent ability to define a parenchymal lesion as malignant (cancer versus rounded atelectasis) or a pleural lesion (mesothelioma versus plaque). MRI distinguishes perfectly the involvement of sub-pleural fat by bronchial carcinoma or mesothelioma. MRI, taking account of its lack of irradiation, could be regarded as suitable for potentially repeated examinations following initial screeing by CT scan. A comparative study of multidetector scanner versus MRI, including diffusion MRI could be, nevertheless, interesting. PET cannot be proposed for the follow up or for screening on account of the irradiation induced and the difficulty of access. Pleural plaques do not take up FDG. There is no specific study of asbestos related fibrosis and there is discordance between studies of other types of pulmonary fibrosis.
