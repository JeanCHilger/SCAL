Developments in cardiac-specific SPECT imaging. In recent years there has been a trend towards designing single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) systems specifically for application in cardiac imaging. There is now a wide range of systems designs ranging from compact dual detector system suited for either upright or supine patient positioning, specialized collimators or custom designed systems, some taking advantage of the compact design made possible with use of solid-state detectors. This paper provides an overview of these systems with discussion on merits and limitations.
