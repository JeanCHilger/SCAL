The efficacy of FDG-PET for the management of esophageal cancer: review article. (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography has become an important informative modality during the past two decades. Because this type of tomography is a functional imaging construct, its primary use is in the field of oncology. It is being used increasingly in the management of several tumor types including esophageal cancer. These tomography scans can distinguish between benign and malignant tumors, identify stages of tumor spread, assess tumor recurrence, and monitor the response of malignant disease to therapy. The aim of this review was to outline the current and future roles of positron emission tomography in the management of esophageal cancer.
