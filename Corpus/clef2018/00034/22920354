Shorter-time dual-phase FDG PET/CT in characterizing solid or ground-glass nodules based on surgical results. We compared the accuracy of shorter-time dual-phase (18)F-FDG PET/CT in evaluating 94 different lung nodules classified as solid or ground-glass nodules (GGNs).Early and delayed maximum standardized uptake values (SUV(max)) as well as the retention index (RI) of each nodule were determined in 75 solid nodules and 19 GGNs.In solid nodules, early SUV(max), delayed SUV(max), and RI were higher in malignant than in benign lesions. In GGNs, these values were not significantly lower in the malignant than in the benign lesions.In the patient group with solid nodules, shorter-time dual-phase (18)F-FDG PET/CT could significantly differentiate the malignant from the benign ones.
