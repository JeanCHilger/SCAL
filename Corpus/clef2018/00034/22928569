Neurofunctional imaging of β-cell dynamics. Here, we outline how islet cells use autocrine and paracrine 'circuits' of classical neurotransmitters and their corresponding receptors and transporters to communicate with vicinal β-cells to regulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Many of these same circuits operate in the central nervous system and can be visualized by molecular imaging. We discuss how these techniques might be applied to measuring the dynamics of β-cell function in real time.
