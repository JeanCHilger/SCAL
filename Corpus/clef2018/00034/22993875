cypate-d: -(+)-glucosamine (cyp-GlcN), and d: -(+)-glucosamine-cypate-d: -(+)-glucosamine (cyp-2GlcN) Increased nutritional requirements are a characteristic feature of neoplastic tumor cells, and because these lesions do not rely on mitochondrial oxidation for energy, most of the energy in these cells is generated through glycolysis (1). To keep up with the high nutritional and energy needs of a malignant tumor, the transformed cells in the lesion show a 20- to 30-fold higher rate of glucose uptake and glycolysis compared with normal cells. As a consequence, to meet the increased demand for glucose, the facultative glucose transport proteins (GLUTs there are 14 known isoforms of these proteins, designated GLUT1 through GLUT14) that facilitate glucose uptake are upregulated on the plasma membranes of the tumor cells (2). In general, GLUT1 and GLUT3 are able to transport glucosamine (GlcN) in addition to glucose and are overexpressed in the different cancer types, including prostate cancer. In addition, an elevated expression of these transporters correlates with the malignant potential of the lesions and indicates a poor prognosis for the patient (2). Among the different glucose transporters, GLUT2 and GLUT4 can also transport GlcN, and both of these isoforms are transcriptionally repressed by the p53 protein, a tumor suppressor protein that regulates the cell cycle and promotes apoptosis (3). GLUT1 and GLUT4 exhibit a similar affinity for glucose and GlcN, but GLUT2 has an approximate 20-fold higher affinity for GlcN than for glucose (3). The PC3 human prostate cancer cell line does not express the p53 protein, and an increased expression of GLUT1 has been observed in these cells (3). Therefore, an imaging probe derived from GlcN would probably accumulate rapidly in tumors generated from the PC3 cells (3). Currently, 2-deoxy-2-[
