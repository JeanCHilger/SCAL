New radionuclide agents for cardiac imaging: description and application. The introduction of three new radiopharmaceuticals into clinical research and practice has broadened the potential applications and scope of nuclear cardiology examinations. Technetium-99m labeled isonitrile perfusion agents have excellent imaging characteristics allowing the accurate identification of coronary artery disease. Simultaneous assessments of ventricular function are possible with these agents. Iodine-123 phenylpentadecanoic acid myocardial scintigraphy permits assessments of myocardial perfusion and fatty acid metabolism, and permits investigations of myocardial metabolism with conventional imaging equipment. Iodine-123 meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine serves as an indicator of the functional integrity of the sympathetic nervous system and permits evaluations of the effects of various disease states on catecholamine handling by the heart.
