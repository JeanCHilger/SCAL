2-Deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-galactose as an in vivo tracer for imaging galactose metabolism in tumors with positron emission tomography. The feasibility of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-galactose ([ 18F]FdGal) for imaging galactose metabolism in tumors with positron emission tomography (PET), was investigated using two hepatomas, Yoshida sarcoma, or glioma in rats, and mouse mammary carcinoma. In hepatoma-bearing rats the highest uptake of [18F]FdGal was observed in the liver followed by the kidney and tumor. The tumor uptake increased with time, and the high uptake ratios of tumor to organ were observed except for the liver and kidney. Tumor uptake was also measured in all tumors. As main metabolites in all tumors, [18F]FdGal 1-phosphate and UDP-[18F]FdGal were found by HPLC. Two hepatomas showed a slightly higher uptake and a larger percentage of UDP derivative than the other three tumors. By autoradiography the brain tumor was visualized clearly. These results indicate that [18F]FdGal has potential as a tracer for imaging galactose metabolism in tumors with PET.
