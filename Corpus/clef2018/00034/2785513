Regional cerebral function and blood flow: complementary single photon emission computed tomography of the brain using xenon-133 and [123I]iodoamphetamine. Regional cerebral function and blood flow can be imaged using isopropyl[123I]iodoamphetamine (IMP), or 133Xe (DSPECT), respectively. Both of these essentially non-invasive, quantitative, methods are suitable for many nuclear medicine laboratories. This study assessed the in vivo information about intracerebral disease provided by IMP and DSPECT techniques to determine the optimal diagnostic use of these modalities. Single photon emission computed tomograms of 53 subjects were acquired using similar displays for IMP and DSPECT data. Lobar tracer distributions were graded by three experienced observers and analyzed using a kappa statistic to eliminate chance agreements. Overall, both IMP and DSPECT had similar patterns. However, while similar, one or the other technique often displayed abnormalities not present on both. Although technical factors may account for some differences between the modalities, a case of arteriovenous malformation proves that discordant findings can result directly from tracer localization properties. Thus at least some discordances provide truly complementary diagnostic information lacking in either single study taken alone.
