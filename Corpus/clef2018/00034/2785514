Gallium-68-labeled macroaggregated human serum albumin, 68Ga-MAA. A technique is described that allows labeling of commercial MAA (macroaggregated human serum albumin) kits with generator-produced 68Ga. This positron-emitting radio-pharmaceutical should serve as an effective substitute for 68Ga-albumin microspheres in PET imaging studies that require a particulate tracer of regional perfusion.
