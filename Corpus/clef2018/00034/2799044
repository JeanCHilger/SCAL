Respiratory allergy and domestic animals. Survey in a sample of the general population. To evaluate the role of exposure to furred pets on respiratory allergic disorders, we interviewed 10,338 adults, selected at random from communities of South-East France. All subjects answered a standardized questionnaire related to asthma and perennial rhinitis and to present or past exposure to furred pets and respiratory symptoms related to this exposure. Besides, a sample of the population had a blood analysis for detection of specific IgE directed against common aero-allergens (Phadiatop). Overall, more than half of the households had a pet, more often in rural than urban communities. Among asthmatics 9.3% acknowledged respiratory symptoms when exposed to pets and 5.9% had parted from their pets because of respiratory symptoms among patients with chronic rhinitis, those figures were 5.1% and 2.6%, respectively. However, these subjects with respiratory symptoms had pets as often as the whole population. In atopic subjects (positive Phadiatop test), exposed to cats, the prevalence of perennial rhinitis was higher than in atopic subjects not exposed to cats and in non-atopic subjects. Thus furred pets have a deleterious influence on patients with asthma or rhinitis, especially in the atopic subgroup. Pet avoidance is an important factor in the management of these diseases.
