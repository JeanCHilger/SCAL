The temporal pattern of recovery of myocardial perfusion and metabolism delineated by positron emission tomography after coronary thrombolysis. Recovery of mechanical function by ischemic myocardium is dependent on the restoration of nutritive blood flow and oxidative metabolism subsequent to reperfusion. To characterize the time course and extent of recovery of perfusion and metabolism, we used positron emission tomography with 15O-labeled water and 11C-labeled palmitate to sequentially study six dogs after 2 hr of ischemia followed by reperfusion for 4 wk. Myocardial blood flow in the ischemic region increased from 15 +/- 8% of normal during coronary occlusion to 82 +/- 25% 1 hr after reperfusion. Despite maintained coronary patency documented angiographically, flow was reduced after 24 hr to 37 +/- 16% of normal. This decrease was temporary, with flow returning to 66 +/- 11%, 62 +/- 7%, and 64 +/- 18% of normal after 1, 2, and 4 wk of reperfusion, respectively. Uptake of 11C-labeled palmitate paralleled alterations in perfusion during ischemia and early reperfusion, averaging 32 +/- 15% of normal during ischemia, and 67 +/- 22% and 36 +/- 10% after 1 and 24 hr of reperfusion. After that, palmitate uptake was more variable. Flow and fatty acid uptake after 4 wk of reperfusion were not related to collateral flow during ischemia or the extent of initial reperfusion. However, uptake of palmitate 1 hr after reperfusion was a strong predictor of the uptake of palmitate 4 wk after reperfusion (r = 0.86, p less than 0.03). The results indicate that positron emission tomography with 15O-labeled water and 11C-labeled palmitate may be useful for assessing the success of recanalization in restoring nutritive perfusion and fatty acid metabolism and that the uptake of [11C]palmitate early after reperfusion predicts the ultimate salvage of myocardium.
