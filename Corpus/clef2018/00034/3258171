Deconvolution of emission tomographic data: a clinical evaluation. A method of improving the quality of images in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is demonstrated using transaxial images of the liver and brain. Deconvolution of the nuclear medicine data by a point source response function (PSRF) acquired previously in a scattering medium attempts to compensate for scattered radiation within the patient. The average geometric response of the collimator of the gamma camera is also compensated for with this technique. Three patients with known metastatic lesions in the liver and three with primary lesions in the brain were imaged. Clinical assessment of reconstructed slices both before and after deconvolution demonstrates that compensating for the effects of scatter and of collimator blurring leads to enhanced detail of pathological lesions. In all cases, cold lesions seen prior to deconvolution were enhanced in detail and, in addition, new lesions were seen with this technique.
