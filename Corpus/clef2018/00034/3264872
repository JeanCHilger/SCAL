Pontine deafness--a new disease picture?. The clinical features of pontine deafness are demonstrated in six patients with typical findings in pure-tone audiogram and speech audiometry, in stapedial reflex recordings, in brainstem-evoked potentials and cortical evoked potentials. The results of positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic response tomography (MRT), electrocochleography and the promontory test are presented. Results of cerebral spinal fluid and antibody titres in the serum are given. Pontine deafness is characterised by an interruption of the central auditory pathway cranial to the olive. This deafness should be differentiated from other forms of sensorineural hearing loss. The pathogenesis of pontine deafness is still unknown. However we should take it into consideration in the diagnosis of sudden unilateral deafness. No medical treatment method is known to date.
