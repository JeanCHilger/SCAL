Quantitative autoradiography of parathyroid glands in rats with carbon-14-labeled amino acids. We have utilized a quantitative autoradiographic method as a means of evaluating amino acid uptake of the rat parathyroid gland for the ultimate purpose of finding agents potentially suitable for position emission tomographic scanning of parathyroid glands. L-[1-14C]leucine and L-[guanido-14C]arginine were evaluated because of their relatively high content in the synthetic products of the parathyroid glands compared with other neck tissues, thyroid gland, and muscle. Carbon-14 leucine disappeared rapidly from plasma following intravenous injection and there was relatively selective uptake of the [14C]leucine and [14C]arginine by the parathyroid glands when compared with uptake by the thyroid gland and neck muscle. These data suggest that both agents warrant further investigation for their potential utility in positron emission tomographic scanning of the parathyroid gland.
