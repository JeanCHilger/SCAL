Serial studies of cerebral blood flow using 99Tcm-HMPAO: a comparison with 133Xe. We have compared the regional distribution of 99Tcm-HMPAO with regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). CBF was measured by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) using a TOMOMATIC 64 after 133Xe inhalation in 41 patients. With the same SPECT device the distribution of 99Tcm-HMPAO was measured after i.v. injection. High resolution (HR) and low resolution (LR) studies were performed yielding a resolution of 6 to 10 mm (HR) and 15 to 20 (LR). 99Tcm-HMPAO images showed close resemblance to xenon-133 CBF tomograms. Only about 20% of the (decay corrected) brain counts were lost during the first 24 h post injection. A slight decrease in contrast was measured comparing side-to-side asymmetry ratios from the serial studies. This loss of contrast is mainly due to back-diffusion and clearance of a part of the 99Tcm-HMPAO complex from the brain. It could be corrected for by a linearization algorithm. The slight loss of contrast will not be of any importance for the clinical use of this tracer complex.
