Computed tomography in nuclear medicine. Utilizing mathematical techniques and computer processing similar to those employed in x-ray transmission computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, cross-sectional images of radiopharmaceutical distribution are demonstrating encouraging maps of organ physiology and pathophysiology. The basic concepts of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and some of its clinical implications, are presented to demonstrate the potential applications of this new modality.
