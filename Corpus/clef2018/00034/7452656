Owner-pet relationships--a kynological study. The paper supplies the results of a first survey of its kind: a total of 46 questions were presented to dog owners mainly in the areas in an around Johannesburg, Cape Town, Bloemfontein, Pretoria, Windhoek, Salisbury, Port Elizabeth and Durban and the answers compiled. In this "kynological study", all aspects of the dog, his behaviour and relationship to man are involved. It is clear that South Africans love and care for their animals and spend about R135 per year on their pets. Some indications of differences between the owners of dogs--Afrikaans- and English speaking persons, as well as new immigrants--became apparent, but more data are needed to make clear differentiations. Comparisons to other countries would also throw more light on the "pet owner problem".
