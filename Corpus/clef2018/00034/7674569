The characteristics of 123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy in patients with left ventricular pressure-overload diseases. The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical significance of 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy in patients with left ventricular pressure-overload diseases. MIBG scintigraphy was applied to 10 pts with aortic valve stenosis (AS group), 11 pts with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM group), 17 pts with hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM group) and 6 control cases (C group). Mean pressure gradient in AS and HOCM groups was 62 +/- 21 mmHg and 38 +/- 18 mmHg, respectively. Initial myocardial uptake of MIBG (MU) was higher in the AS (1.92 +/- 0.46%) and HOCM (2.27 +/- 0.47%) groups than those in the HCM (1.61 +/- 0.29%) and C (1.50 +/- 0.23) groups. Myocardial clearance of MIBG (MC) was higher in the AS (39 +/- 11%), HOCM (37 +/- 19%) and HCM (28 +/- 17%) groups than that in the C (14 +/- 6%) groups. Heart/mediastinum count ratio (H/M) of AS, HOCM, HCM and C groups was 1.87 +/- 0.29, 2.09 +/- 0.19, 1.98 +/- 0.26, and 2.20 +/- 0.10, respectively. In the cases of AS, positive correlation was observed between mean pressure gradient and MU (r = 0.618, p < 0.05). In conclusion, MU was increased in the case of left ventricular pressure-overload state (AS and HOCM).
