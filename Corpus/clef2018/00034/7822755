Functional neuroimaging with SPECT in children with partial epilepsy. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is being used increasingly in the investigation of children with intractable partial seizures. SPECT imaging of regional cerebral blood flow with 99mTc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime, iodinated radiopharmaceuticals, and 133Xe typically reveals decreased cortical perfusion interictally and increased cortical perfusion ictally in the region of the epileptic focus. Studies in both adults and children indicate significantly greater sensitivity and specificity with ictal injection of radiopharmaceutical, with interictal SPECT not infrequently revealing nonlocalizing or falsely localizing information. Recent SPECT studies employing iodinated neuroreceptor ligands report altered receptor binding in the region of the epileptic focus, providing insight into the underlying neuropharmacology of partial epilepsy. SPECT has an established role in the presurgical localization of seizure foci in children with intractable partial seizures and may be a useful modality to study the functional anatomy and clinical semiology of partial seizures in childhood.
