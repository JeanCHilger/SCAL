Exercise and rest myocardial scintigraphy with 201TlCl/99mTc-MIBI dual energy acquisition using triple-energy window scatter correction. We carried out dual 201Tl/99mTc-MIBI imaging, to reduce the time required for exercise myocardial scintigraphy. We investigated 4 different protocols. In protocol (A), Tl was injected at rest followed by the injection of MIBI at peak exercise. Dual SPECT images were obtained by 201Tl/99mTc simultaneous acquisition. Protocol (B) means reverse either, in which MIBI was injected at rest followed by the administration of Tl at peak exercise. In protocol (C), exercise was performed first with MIBI-injection, and then Tl was injected at rest after one hour later. Simultaneous acquisition was also performed. In protocol (D), after the rest Tl-imaging, MIBI was injected at peak exercise, and then the MIBI-imaging was done. In protocol (A), (B) and (C), simultaneous acquisition was performed using TEW (Triple-Energy Window) scatter correction. Thanks to using dual isotopes, all procedures could be completed within 1-2 hours, which was much shorter than the conventional myocardial perfusion imaging. Scatter correction was useful for accurate diagnoses, when the simultaneous imaging is performed.
