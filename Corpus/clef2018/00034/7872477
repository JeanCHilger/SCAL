Imaging modalities in the follow-up of non-iodine avid thyroid carcinoma. The treatment of primary thyroid cancer requires protracted follow-up because of to the possibility of the development of recurrent metastases many years after the initial diagnosis. Often such follow-up involves imaging at regular intervals with diagnostic I-131 studies. However, not all thyroid cancer concentrates I-131. The purpose of this article is to review the efficacy of alternative diagnostic imaging modalities for follow-up of thyroid carcinomas that do not concentrate radioiodine.These procedures include the use of nuclear medicine imaging with thallium-201 (TI-201), Tc-99m-sestamibi, Tc-99m pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), radiolabeled anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibodies, and radioiodinated-131 meta-iodobenzyl guanidine, as well as computerized x-ray tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound (US).Thallium-201, MRI, and pentavalent DMSA provide adequate sensitivity for follow-up of selected patients with suspected recurrent noniodine concentrating thyroid carcinoma.
