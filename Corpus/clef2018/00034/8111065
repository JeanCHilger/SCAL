Positron emission tomographic measurement of bone marrow blood flow to the pelvis and lumbar vertebrae in young normal adults. Ten young normal adults had pelvic and lumbar vertebral body bone marrow blood flow examined using [15O]water and positron emission tomography (PET) in a study designed to assess the feasibility and reproducibility of the PET technique for measuring marrow blood flow to various marrow regions. The procedure was well tolerated. Repeated blood flow measurements obtained from two consecutive [15O]water exams on each individual subject were highly reproducible. In addition, there was minimal variation in marrow blood flow from individual to individual and no gender differences were noted. In contrast, mean +/- SD bone marrow blood flows (expressed as milliliters per minute per 100 g) at selected anatomical sites were significantly different and were as follows: lower lumbar vertebral bodies, 17.6 +/- 3.1 most posterior and superior pelvis (conventional site of percutaneous bone marrow biopsy), 14.3 +/- 3.1
