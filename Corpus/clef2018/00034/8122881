Neuronal migration disorders: positron emission tomography correlations. We analyzed the interictal [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (PET) findings of 17 epileptic patients with neuronal migration disorders (NMDs). Fifteen patients had abnormal PET findings, i.e., focal hypometabolism in 9 patients and displaced metabolic activity of normal gray matter in 6. All 15 patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities however, PET abnormality assisted in the identification of NMDs on MRI in 3 patients. Two patients with negative MRI also had negative PET studies. PET hypometabolism appeared to correlate with severity of neuronal dysgenesis or temporal lobe involvement, or both. Displaced metabolic activity of gray matter is regarded as a unique interictal [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET finding in NMD. This study demonstrates variable metabolic patterns in NMD and that PET may be a useful complement to MRI in the evaluation of NMD.
