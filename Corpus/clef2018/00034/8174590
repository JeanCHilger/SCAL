Regional 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile-uptake at rest in patients with myocardial infarcts: comparison with morphological and functional parameters obtained from gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging. It is not yet clear whether 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI)-uptake is a reliable indicator of myocardial viability, and a threshold value, differentiating viable from scarred myocardium, in comparison to a morphological and functional standard of reference has not been defined. MIBI-uptake was quantified in 800 segments from 55 patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease with and without a history of myocardial infarction. Viable myocardium was defined from gradient-echo magnetic resonance images (MRI) as regions with systolic wall thickening or an end-diastolic wall thickness above the mean value -2.5 SD of a healthy control group (n = 21). Scar was defined as end-diastolic wall thickness > 2.5 SD below the normal mean value and absent systolic wall thickening or wall thinning. Mean MIBI-uptake of viable (n = 676 79 +/- 14%) and scar segments by MRI (n = 124
