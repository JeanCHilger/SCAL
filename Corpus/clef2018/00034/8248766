Semi-quantitative SPECT scanning in acute ischaemic stroke. We performed semi-quantitative SPECT scans using 99mTcm-HMPAO on 34 elderly subjects 10-15 days after ischaemic stroke. Each cerebral hemisphere was divided into five regions of interest. Asymmetry scores were determined for ten slices in each region using activity ratios to the other hemisphere and to the ipsilateral cerebellum. Outcome was assessed by maximal Barthel ADL score during the first two months after stroke. Asymmetry scores in the hemisphere involved by the stroke event were much higher than those in the opposite hemisphere. Subjects with poor outcome (maximal Barthel 0-12) had significantly higher asymmetry scores than those with good outcome (Barthel 13-20). The total asymmetry score (both hemispheres) and the score of the involved hemisphere predicted Barthel ADL score in a general linear model. Total asymmetry score remained a significant predictor of maximal Barthel score in multivariate models. Thus semi-quantitative SPECT scanning is of value in predicting functional recovery after stroke.
