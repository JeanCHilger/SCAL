99mTc-HMPAO labeled leukocyte SPECT in intracranial lesions. Scintigraphy with 111In (indium-111)-oxine or 99mTechnetium-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) labeled leukocytes has been used to differentiate brain abscess from brain tumor. However, there are false positive or false negative results from planar scintigraphic images. So a more specific and sensitive scintigraphic technique needs to be developed.Planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were obtained and reviewed in 14 patients with intracerebral ring-enhancing lesions on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In all patients, diagnosis was confirmed by histopathologic examination. The effect of steroids or antibiotics on scintigraphic finding was examined.Abscess was confirmed in six patients, tumor in six, tuberculoma and cysticercosis in one each, respectively. In all the patients with abscess, SPECT showed increased focal activity irrespective of steroid or antibiotic therapy. Increased radioactivity, which could not be detected on planar images, could be identified in two patients with abscess. In three of the six patients with tumor, radiolabeled leukocytes did not accumulate in the tumor. In the other three patients with tumor, SPECT showed focally increased activity that was less intense than the activity shown in the patients with abscess.99mTc-HMPAO labeled leukocyte SPECT is useful for the differential diagnosis of intracerebral ring-enhancing lesions, and the use of steroids or antibiotics does not influence the sensitivity of SPECT. Diagnostic sensitivity of scintigraphy with labeled leukocytes could be improved by SPECT in addition to planar image.
