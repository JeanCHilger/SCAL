Facilitating pet ownership through improved housing design. To date, urban planners have had only a marginal interest in urban pet management. However, they have a potential role to play through application of urban design principles that may improve the quality of pets' lives and reduce problems. The design principles appropriate to pets have been recently identified. These principles are part of a worldwide movement to improve housing design, with guidelines for various considerations that have been misunderstood or ignored in the past. Veterinarians have a role to play in alerting their clients to the need to consider the quality of their pets' environment and in acting as advocates in relation to urban animal management and regulation.
