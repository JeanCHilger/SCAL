Renal transplant nuclear tomography using Tc-99m MAG3. In this study, the authors performed SPECT imaging on 12 renal transplant patients immediately after a routine planar study demonstrated tubular stasis. The stasis allowed the authors to obtain good quality tomograms on all of them. In five patients, the findings on the planar and SPECT studies were identical. In five patients, there was decreased upper pole activity on planar images and SPECT imaging differentiated between attenuation (4 patients) and cortical thinning (1 patient). In the remaining two patients, the SPECT images showed unanticipated information. It is not yet clear if this new information is of clinical value. It was concluded that diagnostic quality nuclear tomograms in renal transplant patients with tubular stasis can be easily and consistently obtained.
