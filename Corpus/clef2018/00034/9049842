Menadione inhibits MIBG uptake in two neuroendocrine cell lines. In this paper we report on our studies of the effect of menadione on the uptake of MIBG in the neuroendocrine cell lines PC12 and SK-N-SH. Menadione inhibits the uptake of MIBG in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of MIBG uptake is most pronounced in the PC12 cell line. Comparison of the inhibitory action of menadione on the uptake and retention of MIBG with that of imipramine and reserpine suggests that menadione inhibits uptake 1 mediated uptake as well as granular storage.
