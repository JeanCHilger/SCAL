Sturge-Weber syndrome revisited: the role of neuroradiology. In this article I review the typical clinical and neuroradiological features of Sturge-Weber syndrome and introduce some of the recently described findings demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging and perfusion-based single photon emission computed tomography. The article is concluded by a discussion into the most efficient way of imaging children with Sturge-Weber syndrome.
