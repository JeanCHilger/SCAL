Transmission scanning for attenuation correction of myocardial 201Tl images in obese patients. For attenuation correction (AC) of 201Tl myocardial perfusion images, an accurate attenuation map is required. This study assessed whether prolonged transmission scanning is required in obese compared to normal-sized patients. Twenty-nine obese patients (mean body mass index 33 kg m-2) underwent sequential emission/transmission imaging for AC using an L-shaped, dual-headed gamma camera fitted with two 153Gd scanning line sources. Transmission data were acquired for 5 s per view (scan time for normal-sized patients) and for 10 s per view and used to reconstruct individual attenuation maps. Emission data were reconstructed using each attenuation map in turn to produce attenuation-corrected images (AC5 and AC10). Tracer distribution in the AC5 and AC10 images was compared by two observers blinded to study type. For each data set, count density was measured in 17 segments of a polar plot and segmental uptake expressed relative to study maximum. Although myocardial count density was low on the 5 s per view transmission images (0.5-13.0 and 3.0-14.0 counts per pixel in the anteroposterior and lateral projections respectively), no significant differences in tracer distribution were seen between the AC5 and AC10 images and these were reported identically. In addition, the mean segmental relative uptake values were similar (P > 0.05) for corresponding segments of the AC5 and AC10 images. We conclude that prolonged transmission scanning is not required in obese compared to normal-sized patients. The transmission scanning protocol used in normal-sized patients is applicable across a wide patient weight range.
