Endogenous PMN-derived reactive oxygen intermediates provide feedback regulation on respiratory burst signal transduction. The role of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in stemming systemic infection is executed mainly by the utilization of molecular O2 leading to the production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). PMN-derived ROI also serve as intra- and extracellular second messengers providing both positive and negative feedback on cellular autoregulation. We investigated the effect of endogenous ROI on two signal transducing pathways: the receptor (R)-G-protein-phospholipase D (PLD) and receptor (R)-G-protein-phospholipase C pathways responsible for the subsequent interleukin-8 (IL-8)-induced PMN respiratory burst. Purified human PMN were primed with LPS adhered to plastic surfaces and stimulated with IL-8 with or without the presence of each of five different selective ROI scavengers/antioxidants: DMSO, N(a)N3, L-alanine, catalase, or superoxide dismutase. Total IL-8 surface receptor expression was assessed by 125I-IL-8 and 125I-labeled mAbs against IL-8R type A and B binding assays PLD activation was assessed by measuring formation of phosphatidyl ethanol (PEt) in the presence of ethanol
