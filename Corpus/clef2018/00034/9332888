Thalamic glucose metabolism in temporal lobe epilepsy measured with 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET). Thalamic glucose metabolism has been studied in 24 patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using interictal 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). A total of 17 patients had a unilateral TL seizure onset, 11 of these patients had a mesial temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome (MTLE), with mesial gliosis and a mesial TL seizure origin. Three patients had a lateral TL seizure origin, and 3 patients had mesial TL tumors. Bilateral TLE was assumed in 7 patients. Only in the patient group with MTLE (n = 11), the ipsilateral thalamic glucose uptake showed a statistically significant lower value when compared to the thalamus of the contralateral side (Wilcoxon paired sign test, P = 0.012). There was a more pronounced hypometabolism in right TLE compared to left TLE. A 'hypersynchronous seizure onset pattern' in ictal EEG was only seen in 6 (26%) patients (1 patient with bilateral, 5 with unilateral TLE). No correlation existed between the thalamic, temporal glucose metabolism and the 'hypersynchronous seizure onset pattern'.
