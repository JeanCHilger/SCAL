N-acetylglucosamine changes permeability of peritoneum during chronic peritoneal dialysis in rats. To evaluate the effect of supplementation of dialysis fluid with N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) on the permeability of peritoneum during chronic peritoneal dialysis in rats.Experiments were performed on rats with surgically implanted peritoneal catheters. Dialysis solution [Dianeal 1.5% (Baxter, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.) supplemented with either NAG 50 mmol/L or glucose 50 mmol/L (control)] was infused intraperitoneally twice, every day, for 8 weeks. Peritoneal equilibration tests (PET) were performed in all animals at the beginning of the study and after 8 weeks of dialysis. Additionally, at the end of each week, dialysis solution infused in the morning was drained after 4 hours of intraperitoneal dwell. White blood cell count, creatinine, and total protein concentrations were measured in the effluent dialysate. After 8 weeks of dialysis, the morphology of the peritoneum was studied.In rats exposed to dialysis fluid supplemented with NAG, peritoneal permeability to creatinine and proteins was reduced when compared to animals dialyzed with glucose solution. In NAG treated animals, staining with alcian blue for polyanions in the peritoneal interstitium was significantly stronger than in rats dialyzed with glucose solution.Chronic peritoneal dialysis with dialysis solution supplemented with N-acetylglucosamine causes accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the peritoneal interstitium, which results in a change of peritoneal permeability.
