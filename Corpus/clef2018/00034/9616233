The use of nuclear medicine in infections. The spectrum of infectious diseases has changed over the last few years, hence the requirements for radionuclide imaging for the detection of infection are becoming more demanding so that, although gallium-67 and labelled leucocytes remain useful agents, there is currently great interest in the development of new agents especially able to target chronic, non-pyogenic inflammation. Agents can be classified according to the site at which the radiolabel is targeted: pre-endothelial (for example, labelled leucocytes), endothelial (for example, labelled anti-endothelial monoclonal antibodies) or post-endothelial (for example, fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)). 67Ga and labelled polyclonal human immunoglobulin (HIG) localize at inflammation initially as a result of increased endothelial permeability, followed by retention of the label through binding to local extravascular receptors. Labelled leucocytes are avidly taken up by acute pyogenic inflammatory foci but perform less well in chronic inflammation. Other indications for labelled leucocytes include bone infection and undiagnosed fever. Nevertheless, since many causes of the latter do not stimulate a neutrophilic infiltrate, a non-specific agent, such as 67Ga, FDG or HIG, may be preferable, especially in patients with no immediate significant medical history. Since endothelial E-selectin expression is closely correlated to lymphocyte migration, labelled anti-E-selectin monoclonal antibody may also have a potential role for imaging chronic inflammation.
