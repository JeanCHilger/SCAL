Evaluating agreement with a gold standard in method comparison studies. We develop a statistical model for method comparison studies where a gold standard is present and propose a measure of agreement. This measure can be interpreted as a population correlation coefficient in a constrained bivariate model. An estimator of this coefficient is proposed and its statistical properties explored. Applications of the new methodology to data from the medical literature are presented.
