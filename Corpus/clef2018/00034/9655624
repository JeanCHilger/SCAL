Does the cerebellum contribute to cognitive aspects of speech production? A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in humans. Several positron emission tomography (PET) studies suggest a contribution of the lateral aspects of the right cerebellar hemisphere to higher-level (cognitive) aspects of speech production such as controlled verbal response selection. As an alternative, however, 'inner speech', giving rise to subliminal activity of orofacial and laryngeal muscles, might account for the observed activation effects. Eighteen subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during continuous silent recitation of the names of the months of the year ('automatic speech'). The right cerebellar hemisphere showed a significantly increased hemodynamic response concomitant with, among others, an asymmetric activation pattern towards the left side at the level of the motor strip. Since highly overlearned word strings, presumably, pose few demands on controlled response selection and since the projections of the right cerebellar hemisphere to the left precentral gyrus participate in motor control, the observed cerebellar activation, thus, seems to be related to the articulatory level of speech production rather than, as suggested by previous PET studies, to cognitive operations.
