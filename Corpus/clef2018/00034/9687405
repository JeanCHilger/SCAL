Pharmacokinetics of [18F]trovafloxacin in healthy human subjects studied with positron emission tomography. Tissue pharmacokinetics of trovafloxacin, a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent, were measured by positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]trovafloxacin in 16 healthy volunteers (12 men and 4 women). Each subject received a single oral dose of trovafloxacin (200 mg) daily beginning 5 to 8 days before the PET measurements. Approximately 2 h after the final oral dose, the subject was positioned in the gantry of the PET camera, and 1 h later 10 to 20 mCi of [18F]trovafloxacin was infused intravenously over 1 to 2 min. Serial PET images and blood samples were collected for 6 to 8 h, starting at the initiation of the infusion. Drug concentrations were expressed as the percentage of injected dose per gram, and absolute concentrations were estimated by assuming complete absorption of the final oral dose. In most tissues, there was rapid accumulation of the radiolabeled drug, with high levels achieved within 10 min after tracer infusion. Peak concentrations of more than five times the MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90) for most members of Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes (>10-fold for most organisms) were achieved in virtually all tissues, and the concentrations remained above this level for more than 6 to 8 h. Particularly high peak concentrations (micrograms per gram mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) were achieved in the liver (35.06 +/- 5.89), pancreas (32.36 +/- 20. 18), kidney (27.20 +/- 10.68), lung (22.51 +/- 7.11), and spleen (21. 77 +/- 11.33). Plateau concentrations (measured at 2 to 8 h
