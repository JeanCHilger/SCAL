The resting and activation issue of hypofrontality: a single photon emission computed tomography study in neuroleptic-naive and neuroleptic-free schizophrenic female patients. Functional neuroimaging findings of "hypofrontality" in schizophrenic patients is still controversial, due to the heterogeneity of methods and patient samples. This study tries to prevent some of these concerns by studying neuroleptic-naive (NN) and neuroleptic-free (NF) young female patients both in resting conditions and during a frontal cognitive activation task.Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was studied at rest and during the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) in 25 young acute unmedicated schizophrenic female patients (14 NN and 11 NF) and 15 female controls, using single photon emission computed tomography.The schizophrenic and control groups did not differ in rCBF during the baseline condition, but the schizophrenic group failed to activate the frontal lobe during the WCST condition. In addition, the left anterior temporal rCBF at rest correlated with the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms total score.The results suggest that hypofrontality in young acute unmedicated schizophrenic patients is a result of an inability to activate frontal regions during cognition, rather than a baseline decrease in frontal activity. Furthermore, positive symptoms seem to be associated with left temporal cortex activity.
