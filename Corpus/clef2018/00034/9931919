Can the extent of pancreatic tumors be evaluated reliably enough by positron emission tomography (PET). We made PET scans using 18 FDG for 46 patients admitted for pancreatic surgery. The method yielded a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 67%. PET does not allow precise exclusion of malignant tumors and therefore invasive diagnostic procedures may not be reduced.
