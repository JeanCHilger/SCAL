Longitudinal evaluation of early dementia of Alzheimer type using brain perfusion SPECT. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements using a Patlak plot method of 99mTc-ECD were performed in early dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) with both HDS-R and MMSE of over 20 to investigate initial abnormality and longitudinal changes of rCBF. A fusion technique of MRI and SPECT images was developed for MRI-guided analysis of regions of interest in hippocampal areas and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used for automated and objective approach to analysis of SPECT image data. Seventeen patients with clinically diagnosed early DAT and age-matched 32 normal control subjects were studied. At the first SPECT studies, the mean cerebral blood flow (mCBF) of 38.6 +/- 4.7 ml/100 g/min (mean +/- SD) for early DAT did not show significant reduction as compared with the normal control value of 42.0 +/- 3.8, whereas the rCBF values in the bilateral hippocampi (right 26.8 +/- 4.7, left
