Early response of tumour to radiotherapy should be assessed by both uptake and retention of single photon tracers: in vitro analysis with 201Tl-chloride, 99Tcm-sestamibi and 99Tcm-tetrofosmin in human bladder cancer cells and human leukocytes. The uptake and retention of single photon tracers in irradiated tumour cells was observed in an attempt at the early evaluation of the effect of radiation. T24 human bladder cancer cells were exposed to a single dose of 10 Gy or 20 Gy or a fractionated dose of 10 Gy (2 Gy for 5 days). The uptake of 201Tl chloride, 99Tcm-sestamibi and 99Tcm-tetrofosmin was observed by incubating in vitro for 60 min. The retention of the tracers was observed at 60 min after changing the incubation medium for a tracer-free medium. Uptake per culture well of all tracers in the cells exposed to 20 Gy declined as viable cell number decreased, but uptake per cell increased progressively. Uptake per cell of all tracers in the cells exposed to either a single dose or a fractionated dose of 10 Gy also increased, while a delay in growth was observed. The retention of these tracers decreased during this period and recovered thereafter. A binding assay with purified human leukocytes indicated that assessment with 99Tcm-sestamibi and 99Tcm-tetrofosmin is influenced by inflammatory cells. In conclusion, the effect of radiation may be underestimated if assessed by tracer uptake alone because of the increase in tracer uptake in viable irradiated cells. Observation of the retention of tracers may provide additional information.
