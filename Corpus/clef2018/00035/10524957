Pericystic metabolic activity in alveolar echinococcosis: assessment and follow-up by positron emission tomography. Information on parasite viability in alveolar echinococcosis (AE) cannot be obtained by conventional imaging techniques. We evaluated the glucose metabolism of AE lesions by use of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in 12 inoperable patients. Eight patients showed either perilesional or focal enhancement ("hot spots"), whereas 4 patients had nonenhancing (metabolically inactive) lesions. With PET, necrotic parasitic lesions and areas of enhanced metabolic activity could be clearly discriminated. Most notably, 3 of 8 patients with metabolically active lesions who were reexamined after chemotherapy treatment clearly showed improvement: the initial surrounding hot spots had disappeared in 2 of them, and had significantly decreased in 1. PET may prove valuable in assessing the efficacy of chemotherapy by showing the disappearance of metabolic activity and may also be useful for timely detection of relapses and metastases. Although costly and not readily available, FDG-PET is a promising tool toward improved management of AE and may thus help lower costs of long-term chemotherapy.
