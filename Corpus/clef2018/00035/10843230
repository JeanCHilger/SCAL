Cyclopentadienyltricarbonylrheniumbenzazepines: synthesis and binding affinity. Analogues of the benzazepine dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390 incorporating the cyclo-pentadienyltricarbonyl-rhenium (CPTR) moiety were synthesized and evaluated pharmacologically. The CPTR derivatives retained affinity (0.3-2.9 nM) and D1 selectivity of the parent compound, supporting their use as neuropharmacological surrogates for 99mTc-labeled SPECT radiopharmaceuticals.
