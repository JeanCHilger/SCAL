18F-FDG labelling of human leukocytes. Radiolabelled leukocytes are useful for the imaging of inflammation and infection, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is known to concentrate in metabolically active cells. We evaluated the feasibility of leukocyte labelling with 18F-FDG using ACD and heparin anticoagulants at 20 degrees C and 37 degrees C, with and without gentle mixing during incubation. With leukocytes (WBC) harvested from 20 ml blood, studies were performed using 18F-FDG in concentrations of 3.7-74 MBq (0.1-2.0 mCi). 18F-FDG WBC stability in platelet-poor plasma was assessed at 1-4 h. Satisfactory labelling efficiency was achieved with incubation in heparin-saline at 37 degrees C for 30 min (62.7+/-1.6%), and was further enhanced by mixing during incubation (78.1+/-3.9%). Cell labelling was predominantly of granulocytes (78.5+/-1.4%). 18F-FDG WBC was relatively stable in platelet-poor plasma for up to 4 h, and no cell staining was observed in viability studies using trypan blue. These results indicate the feasibility of leukocyte labelling with 18F-FDG, providing an approach that may be useful in PET imaging of inflammation and infection.
