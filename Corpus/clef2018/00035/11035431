Central nervous system involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus: cerebral imaging and serological profile in patients with and without overt neuropsychiatric manifestations. The aim of this study was to evaluate morphological and functional abnormalities by cerebral imaging in a series of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with and without overt central nervous system (CNS) manifestations, and to detect possible relationships with clinical parameters and a large panel of autoantibodies, including those reactive against neurotypic and gliotypic antigens. 68 patients with SLE were investigated in a cross-sectional study which included clinical evaluation of symptoms, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and brain single photon emission tomography (SPECT) analysis, electroencephalography (EEG), and serological tests for antibodies directed against nuclear, cytoplasmic neuronal and glial cell-related antigens. The results of this study showed: (1) a significant positive association of (a) anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) serum antibodies with neuropsychiatric (NP) manifestations and (b) anti-serin proteinase 3 (anti-PR3/c-ANCA) serum antibodies with pathological cerebral SPECT (2) the presence of significantly higher values of (a) SLICC organ damage index in patients with abnormal MRI and (b) SLAM activity index in patients with abnormal SPECT
