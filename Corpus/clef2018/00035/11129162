Diagnosing spinal osteomyelitis: a comparison of bone and Ga-67 scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging. The objective of this investigation was to compare the accuracies of bone and Ga-67 scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosing spinal osteomyelitis and to determine the optimal radionuclide approach to this disorder.Twenty-two patients, with 24 sites of possible spinal osteomyelitis, who underwent three-phase bone scintigraphy with SPECT, Ga-67 scintigraphy with SPECT, and MRI with and without contrast were included in this retrospective review. Bone scans were interpreted as three-phase studies, delayed planar images alone, delayed planar plus SPECT, and SPECT alone (to identify uptake patterns). Sequential bone/ Ga-67 images were interpreted as planar and as SPECT studies. Planar and SPECT Ga-67 images were also interpreted alone. Precontrast MRI studies were used to identify osteomyelitis, whereas postcontrast images were used to identify soft tissue infection.Eleven sites of spinal osteomyelitis were identified. Tracer uptake in two contiguous vertebrae, as noted on SPECT, was the most accurate bone scan criterion for detecting spinal osteomyelitis (71 %). SPECT bone/Ga-67 was significantly more accurate (92%) than both planar bone/Ga-67 (75%) and bone SPECT (P = 0.15 and P = 0.2, respectively). SPECT Ga-67 was as accurate as SPECT bone/Ga-67 and as sensitive as MRI (91 %) the radionuclide study was slightly but not significantly more specific (92% vs. 77%) than MRI. Of 11 sites of extraosseous infection, 10 were identified on MRI, 9 on SPECT Ga-67, 7 on planar Ga-67, and none on bone scintigraphy.Spinal osteomyelitis and accompanying soft tissue infection can be diagnosed accurately with a single radionuclide procedure: SPECT Ga-67. This procedure can be used as a reliable alternative when MRI cannot be performed and as an adjunct in patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain.
