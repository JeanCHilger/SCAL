Radiosynthesis of [123I]betaCIT, a selective ligand for the study of the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems in human brain. The procedure previously reported for the radiosynthesis of [123I]betaCIT was modified in order to improve both radiochemical yield and purity of betaCIT (2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta(4-iodophenyl) tropane) to be injected for SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) analysis imaging. The overall procedure, involving a HPLC purification step, results in quite good and reproducible yields of a highly purified tracer.
