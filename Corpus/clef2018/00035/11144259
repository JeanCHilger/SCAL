A Peltier thermal cycling unit for radiopharmaceutical synthesis. We have investigated the use of Peltier devices to rapidly cycle the temperature of reaction vessels in a radiopharmaceutical synthesis system. Peltier devices have the advantage that they can be actively cooled as well as heated, allowing precise and rapid control of vessel temperatures. Reaction vessel temperatures of between -6 degrees C and 110 degrees C have been obtained with commercially available devices with reasonable cycle times. Two devices have been used as the basis for a general purpose, two-pot synthesis system for production of [11C] compounds such as raclopride.
