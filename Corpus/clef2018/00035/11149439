Changes in pulmonary blood flow during gaseous and partial liquid ventilation in experimental acute lung injury. It has been proposed that partial liquid ventilation (PLV) causes a compression of the pulmonary vasculature by the dense perfluorocarbons and a subsequent redistribution of pulmonary blood flow from dorsal to better-ventilated middle and ventral lung regions, thereby improving arterial oxygenation in situations of acute lung injury.After induction of acute lung injury by repeated lung lavage with saline, 20 pigs were randomly assigned to partial liquid ventilation with two sequential doses of 15 ml/kg perfluorocarbon (PLV group, n = 10) or to continued gaseous ventilation (GV group, n = 10). Single-photon emission computed tomography was used to study regional pulmonary blood flow. Gas exchange, hemodynamics, and pulmonary blood flow were determined in both groups before and after the induction of acute lung injury and at corresponding time points 1 and 2 h after each instillation of perfluorocarbon in the PLV group.During partial liquid ventilation, there were no changes in pulmonary blood flow distribution when compared with values obtained after induction of acute lung injury in the PLV group or to the animals submitted to gaseous ventilation. Arterial oxygenation improved significantly in the PLV group after instillation of the second dose of perfluorocarbon.In the surfactant washout animal model of acute lung injury, redistribution of pulmonary blood flow does not seem to be a major factor for the observed increase of arterial oxygen tension during partial liquid ventilation.
