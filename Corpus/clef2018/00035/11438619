Troglitazone improves whole-body insulin resistance and skeletal muscle glucose use in type II diabetic patients. Recently, troglitazone has emerged as an insulin sensitizer for the treatment of type II diabetes. However, its effect on skeletal muscle glucose use (SMGU) has not been studied.To investigate the effect of troglitazone on SMGU in patients with type II diabetes, we undertook skeletal muscle (18)F-FDG PET dynamic imaging under insulin clamping before and after administration of SMGU to 20 patients with type II diabetes. Data were compared with those for 12 age-matched healthy volunteers.The whole-body glucose disposal rate (GDR) was significantly lower in patients (29.9 +/- 9.83 micromol/min/kg) than in control subjects (55.6 +/- 16.5 micromol/min/kg, P < 0.01), as was the SMGU (patients, 3.27 +/- 2.17 micromol/min/kg control subjects, 10.9 +/- 6.4 micromol/min/kgTroglitazone can improve whole-body insulin resistance through the improvement of SMGU but not through a decline in plasma free fatty acid concentration in patients with type II diabetes with or without hypertension.
