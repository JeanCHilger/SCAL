SPECT dipyridamole scintigraphy for detecting coronary artery disease in patients with isolated severe aortic stenosis. The sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive methods--specifically single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) dipyridamole-thallium myocardial perfusion--for detecting coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with severe aortic stenosis remains unclear. Occasionally, these patients present with atypical angina. Therefore, a CAD diagnosis must be excluded to prevent unnecessary cardiac catheterization.To determine the diagnostic value of SPECT dipyridamole-thallium imaging in this population, we compared the effectiveness of the imaging procedure with that of coronary angiography by prospectively analyzing patients who underwent both procedures. Group 1 included 59 patients who were asymptomatic or had atypical angina group 2Coronary angiography with significant CAD (>50%) was present in 15 (25%) group 1 patients and in 16 (32%) group 2 patients (P=NS). The sensitivity was greater in group 2 than in group 1 (56 versus 26% P=0.001). The specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy in the groups were similar. CAD of >70% luminal stenosis was present in 11 (19%) group 1 patients and in 12 (23%) group 2 patients (P=NS). The positive predictive value was greater in group 2 than in group 1 (75 versus 43%symptoms of typical angina had significant impact on test sensitivity, positive predictive value and likelihood ratio for abnormal test. Furthermore, SPECT dipyridamole-thallium imaging was a useful non-invasive method to exclude the diagnosis of significant CAD (high specificity) in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with isolated severe aortic stenosis.
