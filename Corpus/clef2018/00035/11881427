Clinical experience with icodextrin. Multicenter study. The aim of this study was to analyse our experience with icodextrin in Andalusia, Spain. The study includes 51 patients (30 women and 21 men) on peritoneal dialysis (21 on CAPD and 30 on Automated Peritoneal Dialysis) treated with icodextrin for 10.3 +/- 7 months (0-41 months). Their mean age was 57 +/- 18 years (18-86 years). We have recorded the appearance of side effects, and the evolution of several biochemical parameters at baseline and after 6, 12 ans 18 months from initiation of icodextrin. We also studied drainage fluid from 12 patients after an icodextrin exchange.There were side effects (all cutaneous) in 4 out of 51 patients (7.8%). Two of the affected suffered from cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, and icodextrin had to be suspended the other two had exfoliative dermatitis affecting hands and feet that disappeared without have to withdraws icodextrin. Biochemical parameters: Serum sodium levels decreased from baseline to six months (138 +/- 6 mEq/l vs 136 +/- 3 mEq/l
