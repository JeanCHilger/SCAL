Usefulness of brain SPECT to evaluate brain tolerance and hemodynamic changes during temporary balloon occlusion test and after permanent carotid occlusion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of SPECT during temporary carotid balloon occlusion testing and to evaluate the changes in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and regional cerebral perfusion reserve (CPR) after permanent carotid occlusion.Temporary balloon occlusion testing was performed on 40 patients (24 head and neck tumors, 16 aneurysms). During the balloon occlusion (total time, 30 min), (99m)Tc-ethylcysteinate dimer (ECD) was injected intravenously about 5 min before balloon deflation, followed by SPECT data acquisition. SPECT images were visually evaluated, and the severity of hypoperfusion on the occluded side was classified using 4 grades (normal, mild, moderate, and severe). The count ratio of the occluded side to the contralateral side (L/N ratio) was also analyzed. In 7 patients who subsequently underwent permanent carotid occlusion, CBF and CPR were quantitatively assessed using (133)Xe inhalation dynamic SPECT at rest and after acetazolamide (ACZ) enhancement (CPR was defined as the percentage increase in CBF after ACZ), and the patients were followed up periodically.SPECT after temporary occlusion showed moderate or severe hypoperfusion in 12 patients, whereas neurologic deterioration was observed in only 4 patients. The L/N ratios were 0.96 +/- 0.03 in normal perfusion (13 patients), 0.93 +/- 0.03 in mild hypoperfusion (15 patients), 0.83 +/- 0.03 in moderate hypoperfusion (10 patients) and 0.66 +/- 0.09 in severe hypoperfusion (2 patients) (P < 0.0001). In the 7 patients who underwent permanent carotid occlusion, CPR decreased after surgery (35% +/- 7% vs. 7% +/- 14%, P < 0.05), even though the resting CBF did not change (54 +/- 8 mL/100 g/min vs. 52 +/- 6 mL/100 g/min, not statistically significant). The steal phenomenon (rCPR < 0%) was observed in 3 patients, 1 of whom experienced transient hemiparesis when blood pressure dropped soon after surgery. On follow-up, the decreased CPR gradually improved and no infarction developed.SPECT is useful to detect cerebral hypoperfusion during carotid occlusion. Assessment of CPR is recommended to predict the potential risk of postsurgical complications and to follow up patients after permanent carotid occlusion.
