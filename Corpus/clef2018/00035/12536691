Relationship between protein loss and dialysis duration results of PET and KT/Vurea in CAPD patients. The study focused on the relationship between protein loss and dialysis duration, results of PET and KT/Vurea in two groups of CAPD patients. 16 patients of one group were included in CAPD for only 30 days while 19 patients of the other group were included in CAPD for more than one year. The results showed that value of protein loss had no obvious significance between both groups. Compared with the patients with value of PET D/Pcr < 0.65, the patients with value of PET D/Pcr > or = 0.65 had no significant protein loss. Between the patients whose index of urea clearance > or = 2.0, and those index of uera clearance < 2.0 the protein loss had no difference. It is suggested that, in routine dialysis duration peritoneal transport of small solutes and dialysis adequency. The conclusion shows furtherly that transportion of large protein and small solutes through different ways.
