Exotic invertebrates--a health problem?. Tropical insects and arachnids are becoming popular pets in Norway. Most animals kept are harmless, but some species might cause the need for assistance from the health service. This paper presents tropical arthropods common in captivity and some challenges they might pose to health services.This article is mainly based on articles collected with the help of Biological Abstracts, Science Citation Index and PubMed. Also, some of the findings are based on the author's experience gained through keeping tropical arthropods for 15 years and participating in international networks.There is no evidence in the literature that the bite of tarantulas is dangerous. However, the large amounts of urticating hairs in many species can cause skin irritations and serious eye inflammations that can be difficult to treat. The scorpion species imported into the Norwegian pet trade today have no medical significance, but the increasing private import of potential dangerous species via the Internet might change this situation. Walking sticks and mantis are harmless insects that have no medical significance. Most giant millipedes are also harmless, but some species have defence fluids that can cause pathological reactions if exposed to skin, mouth/throat or eyes.
