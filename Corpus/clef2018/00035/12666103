Imaging end points for monitoring neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease. In this review, the potential role of positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography as biological markers for following the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) is discussed, and their value for assessing the efficacy of putative neuroprotective agents in PD is considered. It is concluded that functional imaging provides a valuable adjunct to clinical assessment when judging the efficacy of neuroprotective approaches to PD.
