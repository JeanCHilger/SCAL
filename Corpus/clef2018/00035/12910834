Angio-MR assessment of vasomotor reactivity impairment as a long-term outcome of SAH following intracerebral aneurysm rupture. Studies on long-term outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) have been carried out for many years using various neuroimaging techniques, such as e.g.: SPECT, PET, TCD and XeCT. In our study angio-MRI supplemented with the acetazolamide test was used to assess cerebrovascular reserve impairment in 30 patients within 6 months since clipping an intracranial aneurysm. Severity of the SAH course was evaluated using the WFNS (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies) scale [3]. The patients' clinical status was assessed at follow-up by means of the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) [8]. Cereberovascular reserve evaluated at the follow-up in hypercapneal conditions was found to be insufficient. The degree of vessel reactivity dysfunction as a long-term outcome of SAH turned out to depend on massiveness of hemorrhage from the ruptured aneurysm.
