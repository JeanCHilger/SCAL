Association of ENOS polymorphism with basal peritoneal membrane function in uremic patients. Basal peritoneal permeability has a major impact on the outcome of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, but the determinant of this is unknown. Early evidence suggests that peritoneal permeability is affected by nitric oxide (NO) activity. Recently, a gene polymorphism of the endothelial NO synthase (ENOS) gene was identified that is associated with circulating nitrate levels.We performed a cross-sectional study to examine the relationship between ENOS4(a/b) gene polymorphism and basal peritoneal function in 86 Chinese incident PD patients. ENOS genotypes for variable number tandem repeats in intron 4 (a/b) were identified by polymerase chain reaction. Patients were classified into 2 groups according to results of a basal peritoneal equilibration test (PET) performed within 2 months of dialysis therapy: group A consisted of patients with low (L)/L average (LA) PET results, and group B consisted of those with H and HA PET results.Group A (L/LA) had a significantly greater prevalence of ENOS aa/ab genotype than group B (H/HA 30% versus 12%ENOS4(a/b) gene polymorphism is associated with basal peritoneal permeability in uremic Chinese patients.
