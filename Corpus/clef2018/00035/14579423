Oral D-amphetamine causes prolonged displacement of [11C]raclopride as measured by PET. Parenterally administered D-amphetamine has been used as a challenge drug to release dopamine, which in turns inhibits [11C]raclopride binding to dopaminergic D2 receptors as measured using positron emission tomography (PET) techniques. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether orally administered D-amphetamine would inhibit [11C]raclopride binding in a manner similar to that produced by intravenously administered D-amphetamine. The secondary objective was to assess the timeline of these effects. Twelve healthy human volunteers participated in this study. Subjects were scanned at baseline and 2 h after D-amphetamine administration (n = 5) at baseline, 2 and 6 h postdrug (n = 4)
