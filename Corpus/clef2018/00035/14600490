Effects of a 902 MHz mobile phone on cerebral blood flow in humans: a PET study. Fourteen healthy right-handed subjects were scanned using PET with a [15O]water tracer during exposure to electromagnetic field (EMF) emitted by a mobile phone and a sham-exposure under double-blind conditions. During scanning, the subjects performed a visual working memory task. Exposure to an active mobile phone produced a relative decrease in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) bilaterally in the auditory cortex but no rCBF changes were observed in the area of maximum EMF. It is possible that these remote findings were caused by the EMF emitted by the active mobile phone. A more likely interpretation of the present findings were a result of an auditory signal from the active mobile phone. Therefore, it is not reasoned to attribute this finding to the EMF emitted by the phone. Further study on human rCBF during exposure to EMF of a mobile phone is needed.
