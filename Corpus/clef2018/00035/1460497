Early thallium imaging after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty: tomographic evaluation during adenosine-induced coronary hyperemia. This study examined the immediate results of 201Tl imaging during adenosine-induced coronary hyperemia in 25 patients with one-vessel coronary artery disease, 4 +/- 3 days after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). There were special features in our study: use of quantitative angiography and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) a homogeneous group of patients (one-vessel disease) and a uniform stress (adenosine infusion). As a group, quantitative coronary angiography showed a decrease in percent diameter stenosis from 72% +/- 12% to 23% +/- 14%, p < 0.001. The thallium images were normal in 17 patients and abnormal in eight patients. However, of the eight patients, four had residual stenosis either in a secondary branch or downstream
