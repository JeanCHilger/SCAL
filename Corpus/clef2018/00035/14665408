Recovery from fatigue: changes in local brain 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose utilization measured by autoradiography and in brain monoamine levels of rat. We recently established an animal model of fatigue in which rats were kept in a cage filled with water to a height of 1.5 cm for 5 days. In this way, after the fatigue session, they were returned to their home cage. Rats resting for 15 min or 2 h showed reduced 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake in their brain. Rats resting for 1 h showed a significantly increased ratio of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid/5-hydroxytryptamine, an index of serotonin turnover, in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, and the ratio of [3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid+homovanillic acid]/dopamine, an index of dopamine turnover, tended to be increased as compared with the control. These data suggest that improvement of glucose uptake and increased serotonergic and dopaminergic neuronal activities are associated with recovery from central fatigue.
