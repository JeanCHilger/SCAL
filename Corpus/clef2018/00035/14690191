Biphasic response to dobutamine predicts improvement of left ventricular dysfunction after revascularization: correlation with positron emission and rest-redistribution 201Tl tomographies. Dobutamine echocardiography (DSE), positron emission tomography (PET) and 201Tl-single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have been used to identify myocardial viability. There are few reports, however, that compare high doses DSE with myocardial metabolic and perfusion imaging techniques in the same patient population. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between high doses DSE, metabolic PET and 201Tl-SPECT imaging to predict the recovery of function after revascularization in patients with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.Twenty-five patients underwent DSE (up to 40 microg/kg/min), rest and 4-hour redistribution 201Tl SPECT, rest 13N-ammonia and 18fluoro-deoxy-glucose PET imaging and coronary angiography 7-10 days before surgical revascularization. A follow-up 2D-echocardiography was performed 6 weeks after surgery.Of the 109 successfully revascularized segments with severe dysfunction, 62 (57%) improved. LV ejection fraction increased from 30 +/- 10% to 42 +/- 13 at follow-up (p < 0.05). 201Tl SPECT, PET and the presence of contractile reserve determined by DSE had a similar sensitivity (77-87%) to predict recovery of function, but specificity was higher for the PET mismatch pattern and biphasic DSE (85-89%) than for any of the 201Tl viability patterns (19-64%). The highest positive predictive values were obtained by biphasic DSE and PET mismatch pattern (78-79%) compared to all other criteria (54-67%). In a multivariate model, which included evidence of viability by all imaging modalities, biphasic response was the best predictor of regional recovery of function (Odds ratio, OR: 9.9, 95% confidence intervals, 95% CI: 3.5-27.8).Although DSE and PET had overall comparable results, the presence of contractile reserve by the biphasic response to dobutamine was a best predictor for the improvement of LV contractile function in this group of patients.
