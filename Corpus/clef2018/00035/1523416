Positron emission tomography as a multi-institutional effort. The consortium relationship at State University of New York at Buffalo School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences have made it possible to establish in this community a multi-institutional effort to develop positron emission tomography (PET). The type of approach used and the modalities employed to generate community, university, and federal support are presented. The development of PET technology has led to a greater understanding between the various disciplines, and joint efforts have been made to establish pilot projects in a number of research protocols in the clinical applications that are currently available today. The consortium concept has led to early consideration by third-party carriers to consider reimbursement for those established PET procedures that can be applied clinically. Hopefully, with the passage of time and the maturation of a regional PET center, the concepts proposed might be used as models for other installations throughout the country.
