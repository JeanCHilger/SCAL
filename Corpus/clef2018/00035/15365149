APOE-dependent PET patterns of brain activation in Alzheimer disease. Using H2(15)O PET, the authors imaged 13 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) while performing a serial nonverbal recognition memory task. Patterns of brain activation differed as a function of APOE genotype: epsilon4 carriers exhibited lower activation in the left lingual gyrus and higher activation in left cuneus, precuneus, parahippocampal, and right precentral gyrus. The APOE genotype seems to play a role in cerebral physiologic activity even after onset of clinical manifestations of AD.
