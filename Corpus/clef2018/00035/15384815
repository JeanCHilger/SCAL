Dialysis dose and nutrition in Japanese peritoneal dialysis patients. In the present study, we tried to determine the relationship between dialysis dose and nutrition in PD patients. We enrolled 100 Japanese outpatients, including 11 diabetic patients, who were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [CAPD (n = 74)] and automated peritoneal dialysis [APD (n = 26)] at 49 local hospitals. In all patients, a peritoneal function test (PET) was performed using the PD NAVI software (JMS, Hiroshima, Japan). The PD NAVI software measured parameters of nutrition and dialysis dose percentage creatinine generation rate (%CGR)
