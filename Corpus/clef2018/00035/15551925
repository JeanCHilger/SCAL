Urinary corticoid:creatinine ratios in healthy pet dogs after oral low-dose dexamethasone suppression tests. Eleven dogs were used in a trial to find a suitable dose of dexamethasone for an oral dexamethasone suppression test for the diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism. Basal urinary corticoid:creatinine ratios were established in all 11 and then groups of seven were given oral doses of 0.02, 0.01 or 0.0075 mg dexamethasone/kg bodyweight and urine samples were collected at two-hour intervals from 08.00 to 22.00. The doses of 0.02 and 0.01 mg/kg consistently suppressed their urinary corticoid:creatinine ratios measured at 16.00 by a mean of more than 50 per cent and those of individual dogs to less than 1.0 x 10(-6), whereas the dose of 0.0075 mg/kg did not.
