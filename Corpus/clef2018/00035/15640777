Update of the FDG PET search strategy. The comprehensive search strategy for identification of FDG PET literature in the electronic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE, published in 2000, has been updated for PubMed. The new search strategy presented here is freely available at the VU website and can be easily copied from there and pasted into the PubMed search window. In addition, the strategy can be stored using the 'Cubby' feature on the PubMed interface and run whenever needed in a minimum of time. It can therefore be used for quick searches during clinical practice as well as extensive searches for systematic reviews. To increase sensitivity, new search terms and term combinations for 'PET' and 'FDG' were added. The existing truncations and field qualifications had to be changed for PubMed. The new strategy is even more sensitive than the previous and therefore identifies more articles without affecting precision (proportion of the retrieved articles that are relevant). Since 2000, MeSH indexing of FDG and PET has hardly improved. Our proposal to introduce the MeSH 'positron emission tomography' as a narrower term of the current 'Tomography, emission-computed' and to replace the current MeSH 'Fludeoxyglucose F-18' by '18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose' has been accepted by the National Library of Medicine. The new MeSH terms will be included in the MeSH edition for 2004-2005.
