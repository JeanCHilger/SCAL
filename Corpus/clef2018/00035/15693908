Prenatal exposure to mite and pet allergens and total serum IgE at birth in high-risk children. To examine the relationship between prenatal exposure to mite, cat and dog allergens and total serum IgE at birth in newborns at high risk of asthma. In the homes of 221 newborns with at least one first-degree relative with asthma, concentrations (ng/g dust) of allergens of house dust mite (mite), cat and dog were measured at the fourth to sixth month of pregnancy in dust samples from the maternal mattress and living room. At day 3-5 after birth, total IgE was measured in capillary heel blood. A total number of 174 blood samples were available (11 mothers refused newborn's blood sampling, and in 36 cases the blood sample was too small for analysis). In 24% of the newborns, total IgE was elevated (cut-off value 0.5 IU/ml). A significant dose response relationship was found between increasing mite allergen levels [divided in quartiles ng/g dust (qrt)] and the percentage of elevated IgE: first qrt (0-85 ng/g) 13% second qrt (86-381) 19%
