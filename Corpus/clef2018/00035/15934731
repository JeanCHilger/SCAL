Metal-driven and covalent synthesis of supramolecular grids from racks: a convergent approach to heterometallic and heteroleptic nanostructures. Supramolecular nanogrids were prepared from dynamic supramolecular racks through the coupling of terminal alkynes using either a covalent (with CuCl/O(2)) or a coordinative (with [trans-(PEt(3))(2)PtCl(2)]) approach. Because of the rapid equilibration of the racks (as tested by exchange reactions), oligomeric adducts potentially formed in the coupling process will selectively furnish the nanogrids through an entropically driven self-repair mechanism. To ascertain the structural assignment, the nanogrids were also synthesized by an independent strategy.
