Selective mediastinal node irradiation based on FDG-PET scan data in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer: a prospective clinical study. To evaluate the patterns of recurrence when selective mediastinal node irradiation based on FDG-PET scan data is used in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).A prospective Phase I/II study was undertaken on 44 patients with NSCLC without detectable distant metastases on CT and FDG-PET scan, delivering either 61.2 Gy in 34 fractions over 23 days or 64.8 Gy in 36 fractions over 24 days (1.8 Gy b.i.d. with 8-h interval). Only the primary tumor and the positive mediastinal areas on the pretreatment FDG-PET scan were irradiated. Isolated nodal failure was defined as recurrence in the regional nodes outside of the clinical target volume, in the absence of in-field failure.The CT and FDG-PET stage distribution was as follows: Stage I: 8 patients (18%) and 13 patients (29%) Stage II: 6 patients (14%) and 10 patients (23%)Selective mediastinal node irradiation based on FDG-PET scan data in patients with NSCLC results in low isolated nodal failure rates. In the Phase I component of this trial, radiation dose escalation up to 64.8 Gy in 36 fractions over 24 days is feasible.
