PCR amplification, cloning and protein expression of interferon-inducible transmembrane protein-1 gene. To study the PCR amplification, cloning and protein expression of interferon-inducible transmembrane protein-1 (IFITMP-1) gene.With the cDNA fragment containing IFITMP-1 gene as template, IFITMP-1 gene was amplified using Pfu enzyme by means of PCR. After EcoRI and HindIII digestion, the target gene fragment was linked to pUCm-T plasmid and sequenced. The IFITMP-1 gene was cloned into pET-Trx protein expression plasmid, and the condition for protein expression was optimized.The length of the PCR product of IFITMP-1 gene-containing cDNA fragment was about 1000 bp. The IFITMP-1 gene was successfully inserted into pUCm-T plasmid with correct sequence and cloning of the IFITMP-1 gene into the pET-Trx protein expression plasmid was achieved. Expression of the fusion protein of pUCm-T plasmid and IFITMP-1 gene was detected after IPTG induction.Successful amplification and cloning of the IFITMP-1 gene and its protein expression may facilitate further study of the role of IFITMP-1 gene in colorectal cancer.
