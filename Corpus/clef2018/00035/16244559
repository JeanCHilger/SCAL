Spatio-temporal dynamics of neuronal networks in partial epilepsy. The anatomo-functional organization of partial drug-resistant epilepsies is the subject of much current research aiming at better understanding these pathologies and improving their treatment. The work carried out by our team on the study of intracerebral recording falls within this category of research. The objectives are to identify the neural networks involved in the generation of paroxysmal activity and to understand their spatio-temporal dynamics, in order to be able in the long term to propose targeted therapeutic approaches likely to "control" these networks.The traditional concept of epileptic "focus" must nowadays be replaced by a more complex model taking into account potential interactions within the neural networks involved in the seizure. Indeed, during partial seizures, involved cerebral structures are the site of characteristic oscillations which may be synchronized or on the contrary transiently desynchronized. These epileptic rhythms may disturb the physiological rhythms underlying normal cognitive processes these cognitive processes may thus be impaired in partial epilepsy, even those remote from the site of origin of the discharge. In this article we describe a model of organization of human partial seizures, through characterization of the relationships ("synchrony") between intracerebral signals recorded in the involved structures. We propose that seizures are generated in an initial network of highly epileptogenic brain structures (epileptogenic zone network, EZN) whose activity is synchronizedThese studies contribute to improvement in our knowledge of the neural networks involved in partial epilepsies. In the future, this type of research may contribute to the development of specific treatments that target certain pathophysiological mechanisms involved in seizure generation.
