Left ventricular systolic/diastolic function evaluated by quantitative ECG-gated SPECT: comparison with echocardiography and plasma BNP analysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the left ventricular (LV) functional parameters calculated using quantitative electrocardiography (ECG)-gated myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (QGS). In addition to LV systolic parameters, diastolic parameters were compared with those by ultrasound echocardiography (UCG) and also with plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations.We examined 46 patients with various forms of heart disease. By the QGS data with 16 framing data acquisition using technetium (Tc)-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) perfusion, we calculated the following parameters: LV end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), ejection fraction (EF), peak filling rate (PFR), filling rate during the first third of the filling time (1/3FR) and first third filling fraction (1/3FF). By UCG, we measured mitral early to atrial (E/A) wave velocity ratio and pulmonary venous inflow systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio as diastolic functional parameters. Plasma BNP concentrations were also measured.There was a significant correlation between LVEDV, ESV and EF measured by QGS and UCG (EDV, r = 0.71, p < 0.001 ESV, r = 0.82, p < 0.001The degree of LV systolic and diastolic dysfunctions evaluated by QGS correlated with that by UCG or BNP. The QGS functional parameters offer useful information regarding cardiac failure.
