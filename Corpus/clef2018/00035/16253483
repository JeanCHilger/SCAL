Mapping of temporal and parietal cortex in progressive nonfluent aphasia and Alzheimer's disease using chemical shift imaging, voxel-based morphometry and positron emission tomography. Little and controversial evidence is available from neuroimaging studies in progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNA). The goal of this study was to combine information from different imaging modalities in PNA compared with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Chemical shift imaging (CSI), voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) were used in 5 PNA, 10 AD patients and 10 normal subjects. Group comparisons revealed left anterior lateral temporal abnormalities (BA20/21) in PNA using CSI, VBM and PET in comparison to normal subjects. AD patients showed more limited hypometabolism within the same area. In addition left lateral parietal (BA40) abnormalities were demonstrated in our PNA as well as our AD group using PET and VBM (AD group only). Combining information from all imaging modalities on a single case basis revealed pathology within the left anterior lateral temporal and lateral parietal lobe both in PNA and AD. PNA and AD patients differed significantly, however, with respect to the frequency of medial temporal lobe and posterior cingulate/precuneus involvement. Although our results might not be generalizable to all subgroups of PNA, we conclude that medial temporal and posterior cingulate/precuneus cortex pathology as assessed by CSI and VBM or PET distinguish PNA from AD, whereas lateral temporal and parietal areas are involved in both conditions.
