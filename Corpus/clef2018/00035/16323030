PET-CT studies of the support system and continence function of pelvic organs. The pivotal importance of Denonvilliers' fascia for surgical procedures. Like all other organs in the chest or abdominal cavities, pelvic organs are not suspended by specialized ligaments such as those in the skeletomuscular system. In spite of this, the organs of the pelvis remain well suspended within their cavity even during evacuation. This support system for these organs consists of inconspicuous smooth muscle elements scattered throughout pelvic structural fat tissue and fascial structures, in particular Denonvilliers' fascia. We used PET-CT studies to identify spontaneous muscle activity in the pelvis, which is strongest at Denonvilliers' fascia. We were able to correlate continence function, filling, and evacuation of pelvic organs with this spontaneous muscle activity that leads to stiffening and relaxation of the muscular walls of these organs. During the course of different disease processes such as visceral prolapse, these pelvic support structures are prone to fail gradually. Surgical interventions should take the pelvic support system into account to avoid therapeutic errors.
