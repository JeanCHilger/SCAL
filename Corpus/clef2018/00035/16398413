Mean and covariance properties of dynamic PET reconstructions from list-mode data. We derive computationally efficient methods for the estimation of the mean and variance properties of penalized likelihood dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images. This allows us to predict the accuracy of reconstructed activity estimates and to compare reconstruction algorithms theoretically. We combine a bin-mode approach in which data is modeled as a collection of independent Poisson random variables at each spatiotemporal bin with the space-time separabilities in the imaging equation and penalties to derive rapidly computable analytic mean and variance approximations. We use these approximations to compare bias/variance properties of our dynamic PET image reconstruction algorithm with those of multiframe static PET reconstructions.
