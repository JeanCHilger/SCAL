Carcinoid syndrome: diagnosis and medical management. Gastro-intestinal carcinoids are slow growing tumors arising from enterochromaffin or Kulchitsky cells. Their clinical presentation depends on what combination of bioactive substances is secreted. Midgut carcinoid can present with the carcinoid syndrome in the presence of liver metastases. Its most typical clinical manifestations include cutaneous flushing and diarrhea. A nonspecific biochemical tumor marker for carcinoid tumors is serum chromogranin A and a specific marker for the carcinoid syndrome is the increased urinary excretion of 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-HIAA). Localizing studies in carcinoid tumors/syndrome are: transabdominal ultrasonography (US), endoscopy, endoscopic US, videocapsule endoscopy, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, selective abdominal angiography, 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy (and intraoperative radionuclide probe), 123I (131I)-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy, bone scintigraphy and 11C-5-HT positron emission tomography (PET). Therapies for carcinoid tumors/syndrome are: surgery, somatostatin analogs, interferon-alpha, radiotherapy, liver dearterialization, liver (chemo, or radio)-embolization, alcohol sclerotherapy of liver metastases, radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases, cryosurgery of liver metastases, occasionally liver transplantation, radiotherapy-coupled somatostatin analogs, 131I-MIBG and occasionally chemotherapy.
