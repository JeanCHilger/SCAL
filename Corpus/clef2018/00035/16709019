Comparison of intratumoral bolus injection and convection-enhanced delivery of radiolabeled antitenascin monoclonal antibodies. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a novel technique used to deliver agents to the brain parenchyma for treatment of neoplastic, infectious, and degenerative conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine if CED would provide a larger volume of distribution (Vd) of a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody (mAb) than a bolus injection.Patients harboring a recurrent glioblastoma multiforme that reacted with the antitenascin mAb 81C6 during immunohistochemical analysis were randomized to receive an intratumoral injection of the human-murine chimeric mAb Ch81C6, which had been labeled with the 123I tracer. The mAb was administered by either a bolus injection or CED via a stereotactically placed catheter between 48 and 72 hours later the mAb was again administered using the other technique. Injections of escalating doses of a 131I-labeled therapeutic mAb were then delivered using the technique shown to produce the largest Vd by single-photon emission computerized tomography.Convection-enhanced delivery has enormous potential for administering drugs to sites within the central nervous system. For the relatively small volumes injected in this study, however, CED did not provide a significant increase in the Vd when compared with the bolus injection. Nevertheless, a clear cross-over effect was seen, which was probably related to the temporal proximity of the two infusions.
