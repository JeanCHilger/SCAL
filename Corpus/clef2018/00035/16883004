Detection of Richter's transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia by PET/CT. Our objective was to evaluate the accuracy of PET/CT for the diagnosis of Richter's transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to diffuse large cell lymphoma.A retrospective study was performed of 37 patients with CLL who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT at our institution between March 2003 and July 2005. All PET/CT scans were reviewed in consensus by 2 diagnostic radiologists. Sites of abnormal 18F-FDG uptake with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of greater than 5 were considered highly suggestive of Richter's transformation. The PET/CT findings were correlated with histologic findings from bone marrow or lymph node biopsy performed within 6 wk of PET/CT and with clinical follow-up.The 37 patients (26 men and 11 women mean age, 61 y, range, 40-82 y) underwent 57 PET/CT scans. In 10 (91%) of 11 patients with Richter's transformation, PET/CT detected sites of abnormal 18F-FDG uptake having an SUVmax of greater than 5. Richter's transformation was missed in 1 patient who had only low-grade 18F-FDG uptake (SUVmax < 5). Nine patients had false-positive PET/CT findingsPET/CT can detect Richter's transformation of CLL to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with a high sensitivity and a high negative predictive value.
