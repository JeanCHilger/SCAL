Usefulness of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration for predicting subsequent left ventricular remodeling after coronary angioplasty in patients with acute myocardial infarction. To determine the relation between plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and remodeling in terms of infarct-related artery (IRA) patency, 106 patients with a first anterior wall acute myocardial infarction with a patent IRA at 1 month were studied. The IRA reoccluded at 6 months in 17 patients (reoccluded IRA) and was patent in 89 patients (patent IRA). The 2 groups did not differ with respect to clinical characteristics, hemodynamic variables, and left ventricular function at 1 month, except for left ventricular end-diastolic and systolic volumes, which were significantly greater in the reoccluded IRA group. Plasma BNP concentration in the reoccluded IRA group (336 +/- 288 pg/ml) was significantly higher than that in the patent IRA group (116 +/- 106 pg/ml) at 1 month. BNP concentration decreased significantly at 6 months in the 2 groups (reoccluded IRA vs patent IRA 152 +/- 162 vs 44 +/- 58 pg/ml, p <0.05). The increase in left ventricular volume from 1 to 6 months was significantly correlated with plasma BNP concentration at 1 month in the patent IRA group (r = 0.314, p < 0.01) and the reoccluded group (r = 0.634, p < 0.01). Linear regression analysis showed that the correlation between the 2 parameters in the 2 groups was similar. Based on stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis, only plasma BNP concentration was significantly correlated with the increase in left ventricular volume from 1 to 6 months in the 2 groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that plasma BNP concentration predicts left ventricular dilation independently of IRA patency.
