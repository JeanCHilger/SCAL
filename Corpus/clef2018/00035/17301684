Increase in [11C]vorozole binding to aromatase in the hypothalamus in rats treated with anabolic androgenic steroids. In the present study, we investigated the alteration of aromatase expression in the brain by anabolic androgenic steroid treatment in male rats. The rats were given nandrolone decanoate (15 mg/kg/day) for 14 days, and the brains were used for autoradiography with [C]vorozole, which has been developed as a positron emission tomography tracer for aromatase by our group. The results indicated a significant increase of [C]vorozole binding by anabolic androgenic steroids in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and preoptic area. In contrast, no significant change of [C]vorozole binding was observed in the medial amygdala. Our results suggest that aromatase is significantly upregulated in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and preoptic area by anabolic androgenic steroids and also suggest that androgens regulate aromatase differently in these structures compared with the medial amygdala.
