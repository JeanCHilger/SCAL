Cerebral perfusion in patients with arterial hypertension associated with type 2 diabetes. The aim of the study was to assess cerebral perfusion (CP) in patients with arterial hypertension in combination with type II diabetes. The subjects were 57 patients with stage II AH (mean age 51.6 +/- 5.7 years), among who there were 33 patients without disturbances in carbohydrate exchange and 24 patients with compensated or subcompensated type II diabetes. All the patients underwent single-photon emission computed tomography of the brain with 99m Tchexamethylpropyleneamineoxime. The study showed that patients suffering from AH with or without type II diabetes had signs of cerebral hypoperfusion and lowered cerebrovascular reserve even in the absence of focal neurological symptoms. Disturbances in cerebral perfusion were more prominent in patients suffering from AH with type II diabetes vs. patients without carbohydrate exchange disorder.
