Interictal cerebral metabolism in partial epilepsies of neocortical origin. We performed interictal [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) in 24 patients with partial epilepsy of neocortical origin. Two-thirds of patients had regions of hypometabolism. The zone of intracranially recorded electrographic ictal onset was always located in a region of hypometabolism, in those with hypometabolism. Hypometabolic regions in partial epilepsies of neocortical origin were usually associated with structural imaging abnormalities. Regional hypometabolism occasionally occurred without localizing ictal scalp EEG and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging findings, however. FDG PET may be useful in directing placement of intracranial electrodes for presurgical evaluation of refractory neocortical seizures.
