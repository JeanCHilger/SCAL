Multimodality imaging following 90Y radioembolization: a comprehensive review and pictorial essay. Radioembolization with yttrium 90 (90Y) microspheres represents an emerging transarterial therapy for the treatment of liver malignancies that continues to generate interest in the medical community. The classic indication of treatment response is a reduction in tumor size however, parenchymal changes (eg, necrosis, lack of enhancement, specific findings at positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging) and other benign findings (pleural effusions, perivascular edema, contralateral hypertrophy, ring enhancement, perihepatic fluid, fibrosis) may occur following treatment, requiring proper image interpretation. With classic imaging findings and surrogates (time to progression, duration of response, disease-free interval), response rates range from 20% to 80% in patients treated for hepatocellular carcinoma or metastatic disease to the liver. Complications of 90Y radioembolization include cholecystitis, abscess, and bilomas and should be recognized early in the imaging follow-up of these patients. Radiologists who are involved in the posttreatment assessment of patients undergoing 90Y radioembolization should be familiar with the imaging findings and potential imaging pitfalls associated with this therapy.
