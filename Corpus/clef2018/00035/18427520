Diagnostics and treatment tactics for chronic cerebrovascular disorders with the use of single photon emission computed tomography. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a highly informative method of functional neuroimaging with high diagnostic potential for some neurological disorders. We used this method in diagnostics of specification of lesion localization, choosing of treatment tactics for chronic cerebral blood circulation disorders and evaluation of cavinton effect. The positive effect of the drug on cerebral hemoperfusion is confirmed.
