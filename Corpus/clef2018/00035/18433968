Usefulness of a blood flow analyzing program 3DSRT to detect occipital hypoperfusion in dementia with Lewy bodies. In the latest criteria for the clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), supportive features include generalized low uptake on SPECT/PET perfusion scan with reduced occipital activity. In this study, we investigated the usefulness of a cerebral blood flow (CBF) quantification program '3DSRT' in detecting occipital hypoperfusion in DLB. Twenty two patients with probable DLB, 38 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 16 normal controls underwent brain perfusion SPECT. Compared with AD, DLB patients had a bilateral lower CBF in the posterior cerebral segments. The correlation of clinical symptoms and brain blood perfusion was examined by dividing the subjects into subgroups. DLB patients with Parkinsonism, when compared to non-Parkinsonism subgroup, had a lower CBF throughout the cerebrum with statistical significance in the posterior cerebral segments. The quantitative analysis of brain perfusion SPECT by 3DSRT could be a useful supportive measurement in the diagnosis of DLB.
