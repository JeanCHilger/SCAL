The evolution and application of dental maxillofacial imaging modalities. During the last decades, an exciting new array of imaging modalities, such as digital imaging, CT, MRI, positron emission tomography, and cone-beam CT (CBCT), has provided astounding new images that continually contribute to the accuracy of diagnostic tasks of the maxillofacial region. The most recent, cone-beam imaging, is gaining rapid acceptance in dentistry because it provides cross-sectional imaging that is often a valuable supplement to intraoral and panoramic radiographs. The information content in such examinations is high and the dose and costs are low. The increasing trend toward the use of CBCT in dental offices may be expected to result in improved diagnosis, but with increased patient dose and health care costs. Using CBCT as a secondary imaging tool helps optimize health-to-risk ratio.
