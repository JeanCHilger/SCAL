Efforts to develop methods for in vivo evaluation of the native beta-cell mass. Visualization and quantification of the native beta-cell mass in vivo in humans appear to be important in the study of the natural course of diabetes, and in ongoing trials aimed at preserving beta-cell mass in patients with diabetes. This cannot be done by biopsy sampling, and therefore there is a great need for development of a non-invasive method. This article discusses the principle theoretical requirements for reaching this goal. In addition, it provides an overview of tracer probes, which have been examined as potential beta-cell mass imaging agents in the past. Finally, some future perspectives are discussed.
