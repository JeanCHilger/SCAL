(18)F-labelling of A-ring substituted 16alpha-fluoro-estradiols as potential radiopharmaceuticals for PET imaging. The 2-methoxy derivative of estradiol is currently in Phase II clinical trial as an anticancer agent while the 4-methyl derivative has been shown to interact with cytoplasmic and nuclear estrogen receptors in rat pituitary gland and hypothalamus. We hypothesize that the 16alpha-(18)F-analogs of these estrogens could be suitable radiotracers to evaluate action mechanisms of the parent compounds. In this study we report the synthesis of the 16alpha-(18)F and 16alpha-(19)F-analogs of the A-ring substituted estradiols in high yield via stereoselective opening of the intermediate 16beta,17beta-O-cyclic sulfones with [(18)F]F(-) or F(-) followed by deprotection.
