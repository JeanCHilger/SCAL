Application of PET-CT technique to the research on central mechanism of acupuncture effects. PET-CT system is an innovative hybrid system combining Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with the fastest Computed Tomograph (CT) in one single instrument, which realizes a better integration of structure and function. This system represents the future of development of nuclear medicine imaging. When applied to revealing the underlying central mechanism of acupuncture effect, PET-CT is very helpful not only in revealing its substantial basis as neurotransmitters, etc. but also in finding the intrinsic regularities between efficacies and changes of images. It provides a new stool for scientific research. In the present paper, the authors make an introduction about its characteristics in techniques, advantages, points for paying attention and possible progresses achieved in the studies about central mechanisms of acupuncture.
