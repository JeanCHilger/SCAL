Role of 123-I-metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging as a component in the diagnosis and treatment of neuroblastoma. Tomoscintigraphy with 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine reveals function of tumor tissue. It may be used for both primary diagnosis of neuroblastoma, monitoring treatment efficiency and prognosis. Before single photon emission tomography using 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine is undertaken, MRI by means of computed tomography should be carried out in abdominal area to ensure perfect blending of multimodal images.
