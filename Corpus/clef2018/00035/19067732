Development of a new semi-quantitative non-invasive method for evaluating ventricular stroke work. Ventricular stroke work (SW) is one of the best indices to evaluate ventricular function, however, the SW monitoring mainly depends on the invasive method with the artery catheter. In this paper, our aim is to develop a new semi-quantitative non-invasive method for evaluating ventricular SW.The multiple gated cardiac blood pool imaging was done in 25 patients with coronary artery disease and 12 normal controls. A new parameter, the relative stroke work (RSW) of left ventricle, was calculated using an equation derived from the principle of hydrodynamics. The left ventricular SW was analyzed by stroke volume (SV) and mean arterial pressure. Ejected fraction (EF), peak ejected rate (PER) and peak filling rate (PFR) were gotten with the routine software in imaging device.The left ventricular RSW was linearly correlated with the SW. The RSW was related to the SV, EF, PER and PFR of the left ventricle. The RSW had regressive relation with SV and PER. The RSW in patients, same as SW, SV, EF, PFR and PER, was noticeably lower than that in normal controls, P<0.01.The RSW is a potential and valuable clinical index for evaluation of the ventricular function.
