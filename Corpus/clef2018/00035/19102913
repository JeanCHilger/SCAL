Impact of viable myocardium assessed by 99Tcm-MIBI SPECT and 18F-FDG PET imaging on clinical outcome of patients with left ventricular aneurysm underwent revascularization. To evaluate the impact of viable myocardium assessed by (99)Tc()m-MIBI SPECT and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging in patients with left ventricular aneurysm (LVA) underwent revascularization (RVS).Forty-six consecutive patients with LVA (mean LVEF 36% +/- 7%), underwent (99)Tc(m)-sestamibi SPECT and (18)F-FDG PET examinations and received RVS therapy, were followed-up for a mean period of 80 +/- 27 months. Viable myocardium in aneurysm was defined as perfusion-metabolism mismatch score (MMS) >/= 2.0. Patients were divided into four groups by aneurysm viability and aneurysmectomy. Group A1 (n = 8): viability- Group A2 (n = 15): viability-, aneurysmectomyThe cardiac event rates during follow up were similar among groups [A1 (25%, 2/8), B1 (40%, 6/15), A2 (20%, 2/10) and B2 (31%, 4/13 P > 0.05)]. After revascularization, LVEF was improved (> 10%) in groups A2, B1 and B2 (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that LV-MMS (OR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.08 - 5.06, P < 0.05), distal vessel disease (OR = 0.008, 95% CI 0.001 - 0.560, P < 0.05) and nonaneurysm perfusion score (OR = 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 - 0.85, P < 0.05) were significantly associated with the improvement of LVEF after revascularization.Long term cardiac events rate post revascularization was not affected by viable myocardium or aneurysmectomy in LVA patients. Viable myocardium in LVA patients was associated with better LVEF improvement after revascularization.
