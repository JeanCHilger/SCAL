Left ventricular dysfunction secondary to ischemia in women with angina and normal coronary angiograms. Microvascular disease is proposed as a cause of segmental myocardial blood flow abnormalities and heterogeneous myocardial perfusion in cardiac syndrome X.To assess if myocardial ischemia can be evidenced through both perfusion abnormalities and poststress left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction by gated single photon emission tomography (SPECT) myocardial scintigraphy in women with syndrome X in a similar way to those with epicardial coronary lesions.Three groups of postmenopausal women were studied: group I, 20 women with angina, perfusion defects, and normal coronary angiography group II, 20 women with epicardial coronary lesions (> or =50% of coronary lumen reduction)Groups I and III patients had a higher body mass index (BMI). There were more smokers in groups I and II. Very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and triglycerides were higher in group II patients. The brachial artery vasodilator responsiveness after 5 minutes of ischemia was similarly lower in patients of groups I and II compared with those of group III (3% vs. 6.5%, respectively p = 0.03 group III vs. group I and group II). Mean DeltaLVEF (LVEF poststress minus LVEF at rest) was -3.86%, -2.90%, and 4.18% in groups I, II, and III, respectively (p = NS between I and II, p = 0.005 between II and III, and p = 0.003 between I and III). In 43% of group I patients and in 10 of 18 group III patients with perfusion defects, there was a poststress LVEF reduction >5%.Stress-induced ischemia is associated with poststress LVEF reduction as a probable manifestation of myocardial stunning in postmenopausal women with typical angina and normal coronary angiography.
