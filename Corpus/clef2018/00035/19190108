18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for the diagnosis of adrenocortical tumors: a prospective study in 77 operated patients. Most adrenal incidentalomas are nonfunctioning adrenocortical adenomas (ACAs). Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs) are rare but should be recognized at an early stage.The objective of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) to predict malignancy in patients without a previous history of cancer.This was a prospective, multicenter study from 2001 to 2006.The study was conducted at a network of seven university hospitals in Paris.Seventy-seven patients were included. All underwent surgery because of hypersecretory and/or growing benign lesions (n = 18), obvious ACCs (n = 21), or radiologically indeterminate lesions (n = 38).The degree of (18)F-FDG PET uptake [maximum standardized uptake value (maxSUV)] was related to the pathological findings serving as a reference, and its diagnostic value was compared with that of computerized tomography (CT) scan.Pathology eventually diagnosed 43 ACAs, 22 ACCs, and 12 nonadrenocortical lesions. Using a cutoff value above 1.45 for adrenal to liver maxSUV ratio, the sensitivity and specificity to distinguish ACAs from ACCs were, respectively, 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.85-1.00) and 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.75-0.96). Among the 38 indeterminate lesions at CT scan, we could analyze a subgroup of 16 adrenocortical tumors with high unenhanced density (>10 HU) and an inappropriate washout: (18)F-FDG PET correctly predicted the benignity in 13 of 15 ACAs.In a multidisciplinary team approach, (18)F-FDG PET helps to manage suspicious CT scan lesions. An adrenal to liver maxSUV ratio less than 1.45 is highly predictive of a benign lesion.
