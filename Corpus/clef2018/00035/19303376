Predicting liver failure following major hepatectomy. Pre-operative determination of the risk of liver dysfunction has come under criticism with regards to its usefulness in clinical practice.

Published data would not suggest any difference in mortality, morbidity or liver failure rates between these groups. This review outlines and presents the evidence for pre-operative quantification of functional liver remnant volume.
