Hemodynamic variables during stress testing can predict referral to early catheterization but failed to show a prognostic impact on emerging cardiac events in patients aged 70 years and older undergoing exercise (99m)Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value of hemodynamic variables during ergometric stress testing for (99m)Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) as compared to several patient-related variables and MPS results with regard to referral to early coronary angiography (<3 months after MPS CA) as well as cardiac event (CE) free survival in a study population aged > or =70 years. About 90 patients aged > or =70 years (74.5 +/- 3.6 years) who underwent ergometric stress/rest MPS were included in this study. About 19 hemodynamic variables during stress testing were assessed. Semiquantitative visual interpretation of MPS images were performed and Summed-Stress-(SSS), Summed-Difference-, and Summed-Rest-Scores were calculated. Emerging CE comprised myocardial revascularization and -infarction as well as cardiac-related death. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed for evaluation of independent prognostic impact of hemodynamic-, MPS- and clinical-variables with regard to referral to early catheterization as well as emerging CE. Kaplan-Meier survival- and log rank analyses were calculated for assessment of CE free survival. History of CAD (Odds ratio
