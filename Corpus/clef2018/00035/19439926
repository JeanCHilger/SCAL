Intraperitoneal vascular endothelial growth factor C level is related to peritoneal dialysis ultrafiltration. Local inflammation and neovascularization have a negative influence on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Patients with higher peritoneal transport have higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) levels in their dialysate. However, the relationship of other members of the VEGF family, such as VEGF-C, to peritoneal transport or ultrafiltration (UF) is yet to be studied.Peritoneal cytokine and growth factor levels were determined during the peritoneal equilibration test (PET). Ultrafiltration, peritoneal clearance and residual renal function were also considered.Forty-two PD patients were enrolled. They had been on PD for at least 1 month and free of peritonitis for at least 1 month prior to the study. Patients with high or high average PET had higher dialysate IL-6 and VEGF-C. Dialysate IL-6 and VEGF-C correlated negatively with PET and UF.Dialysate VEGF-C is related to higher transport rate and poorer UF. The role of VEGF-C in PD deserves further study.
