Effect of freshly isolated autologous tissue resident stromal cells on cardiac function and perfusion following acute myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intracoronary administration of freshly isolated, uncultured autologous tissue-derived stromal cells on cardiac function and perfusion after acute infarction in pigs.A transmural myocardial infarction in a porcine model was induced by occlusion of the mid LAD with an angioplasty balloon for 3 h. Upon reperfusion, freshly isolated, uncultured autologous stromal cells (1.5×10⁶ cells/kg) or control solution was injected into the infarct artery. Cardiac function and area at risk were determined by (99m)Tc-SPECT.Eight weeks after infarction, cell treated pigs showed a 20% smaller myocardial perfusion defect compared to control animals (35±9% vs. 44±5% of LV, treated vs. control, respectively, p<0.05). The reduction of the perfusion defect was associated with a significantly higher myocardial salvage index in the cell group as well as a significant increase in ejection fraction compared to control (EF at 8 weeks 43±7% vs. 35±3%, treated vs. control, respectively, p<0.05). This functional improvement was reflected by an increased wall thickness of the infarct and border zone in the treated group (11.2±2.2 mm) compared to control (8.6±1.6 mm, p<0.05) as well as an increased capillary density in the border zone (treated vs. control 41.6±17.9 vs. 32.9±12.6 capillaries per 0.1 mm², p<0.05).This study demonstrates for the first time that recovery and intracoronary delivery of uncultured autologous tissue derived stromal cells at time of vessel reperfusion is feasible and improves ventricular function.
