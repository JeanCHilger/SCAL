Noninvasive evaluation of coronary endothelial function following sirolimus-eluting stent implantation by using positron emission tomography. Several invasive studies have reported delayed reendothelialization and endothelial dysfunction following sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implantation. We evaluated the changes in coronary endothelial function following SES implantation by using a noninvasive method that involved positron emission tomography and cold pressor testing (CPT).The study was conducted on 14 lesions on which percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was successively performed. The lesions were classified into 2 groups depending on the PCI performed: the conventional PCI group, in which 7 conventional PCIs (plain old balloon angioplasty or bare-metal stents) were performed, and the SES group, in which 7 SESs were implanted. Coronary endothelial function was defined as the percent increase in the myocardial blood flow (MBF) during CPT.The resting MBF in the segments distal to the PCI sites did not differ between the conventional PCI and SES groups however, the MBF significantly decreased in the SES group during CPT.These data suggest that SES implantation induces coronary endothelial dysfunction in the segments distal to the PCI sites.
