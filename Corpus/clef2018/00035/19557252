Copper(I) scorpionate complexes and their application in palladium-mediated [(11)C]carbonylation reactions. Solutions of copper(I) tris(pyrazolyl)borate complexes have been used to greatly improve the solubility of [(11)C]carbon monoxide, enabling it to be used in low-pressure, 'one-pot' palladium-mediated carbonylation reactions to form (11)C-radiolabelled amides and ureas for use in positron emission tomography.
