Large vessel vasculitis. Large vessel vasculitis is characterized by local inflammation of the vessel wall of the aorta and its first and second degree branches. Giant cells are found regularly. The process leads to stenoses and occlusions as well as to aneurysmatic dilatation. Recent progress in vascular imaging (colour Doppler ultrasound, MRI and PET) allows to detect Takayasu arteritis at an earlier stage and to reveal the involvement of larger arteries in temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis, GCA). With increasing frequency, a subtype of predominantly female and less aged GCA patients without cranial symptoms is noticed in whom obstructions are prevailing in the proximal arm vessels or in the aorta. The latter may be affected exclusively. Initial therapy is based on corticosteroids. In GCA, methotrexate hitherto is the only other immunosuppressive drug that has proved to be helpful. Disease activity has to be controlled both by laboratory parameters and vascular imaging.
