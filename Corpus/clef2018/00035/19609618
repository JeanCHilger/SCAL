Metabolic tumor volumes by [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT correlate with occult metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. To investigate the correlation between pretreatment metabolic tumor volume (MTV) as determined by [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and occult metastasis (OM) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) of the tongue.Forty-three clinically node-negative (cN0) OSCC patients, diagnosed by preoperative workups (biopsy, physical examination, CT, and PET/CT) were enrolled. All patients had undergone primary tumor resections and elective neck dissections. MTVs were measured for tumors showing standardized uptake value (SUV) of >2.5 by an automated contouring program. Pretreatment variables (age, sex, clinical T stage, maximal SUV [SUV(max)] and MTV) and posttreatment variables (pathologic T stage, depth of invasion, lymphovascular invasion, pathologic tumor volume, and histological differentiation) were analyzed to identify their correlation with OM.Twelve (27.9%) of 43 patients were found to have OM in pathologic specimen of neck dissections. A cutoff of 6.0 ml for the MTV was determined to be the most discriminative value for predicting OM. By univariate analysis, the patients with an MTV of >6.0 ml had significantly higher number of occult metastases than those with an MTV of <or=6.0 ml (57.1% vs. 13.7%, hazard ratio 8.33, 95% confidence interval, 1.95-35.6, P=0.009). Lymphovascular invasion and SUV(max) showed only trends toward significance (P=0.08 and 0.05, respectively). By multivariate analysis, only MTV had a significant correlation with OM (hazard ratio 54.66, 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2842.86, P=0.04).MTV as determined by PET/CT demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with OM in patients with cN0 OSCC of the tongue.
