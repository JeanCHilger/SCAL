Prognostic importance of standardized uptake value on F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography in biliary tract carcinoma. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been used for diagnosis and staging of malignant diseases. However, the prognostic significance of FDG uptake on PET had not been sufficiently evaluated in patients with biliary carcinoma.We performed a retrospective review of patients with biliary carcinoma imaged by FDG-PET to determine whether high uptake of FDG predicted overall survival independently of clinicopathological characteristics. Sixty-nine patients with biliary carcinoma underwent FDG-PET before cancer treatment. The maximum standard uptake value (maxSUV) was calculated as an index of FDG uptake.A receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated a maxSUV of 6.3 to be the optimal cutoff point. The 3-year survival rate of patients with a maxSUV of 6.3 or less was 74.3%, whereas it was 44.1% for those with values greater than 6.3. Univariate analysis showed that the maxSUV was one of the significant prognostic factors for overall survival (P = 0.0119), whereas multivariate analysis showed that the independent predictors of survival were pN, pM, and pTNM staging.SUV analysis of FDG-PET was useful to predict the prognosis of biliary carcinoma. This information may assist in the guiding of treatment strategies before postoperative pathological assessment.
