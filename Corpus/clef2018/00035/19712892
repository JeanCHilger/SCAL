Weight loss in the elderly cat. Appetite is fine and everything looks normal... Improvements in general health care and nutrition have meant that more cats are living to an advanced age. Weight loss is one of the most common presenting signs in the older cat. Many causes of weight loss in older cats are at least amenable to supportive care and some are curable.Weight loss is a non-specific change and, while often a sensitive indicator of ill health, does not readily point to the diagnosis. Careful history taking and physical examination may indicate a specific cause but, as discussed in this article, further tests are generally required to confirm the diagnosis. In those cats where common causes of weight loss have been eliminated by initial tests, it is often harder to reach a diagnosis. A logical approach to case-solving is required, making use of imaging and advanced laboratory tests. Occult gastrointestinal disease should be suspected and investigated in cats where another cause of weight loss cannot be found.While the average lifespan of a pet cat is probably around 13-14 years, many will live longer than this if well cared for, and some considerably longer. Recently, the life stages have been redefined to help predict the changes that might be occurring in terms of a cat's physical and mental health. Cats are considered 'senior' at 11-14 years old and 'geriatric' at 15 years and above.Geriatric medicine is forming an increasing part of the case load of first opinion and many referral veterinarians.
