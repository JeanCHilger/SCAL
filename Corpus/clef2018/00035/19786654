Phase I, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic study of AMG 479, a fully human monoclonal antibody to insulin-like growth factor receptor 1. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and evidence of antitumor activity of AMG 479, a fully human monoclonal antibody to insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R).Patients with advanced solid malignancies or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received escalating doses of AMG 479 intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks (Q2W). Blood samples were assayed to determine pharmacokinetic parameters and IGF-1R occupancy on neutrophils fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans were used to assess tumor metabolic effects.Fifty-three patients received 312 infusions of AMG 479 Q2W. Overall, the most common grades 1 to 2 toxicities were fatigue, thrombocytopenia, fever, rash, chills, and anorexia. One dose-limiting toxicity (ie, grade 3 thrombocytopenia) occurred in a patient at 20 mg/kg during course 1 grade 3 thrombocytopenia (n = 8) and grade 3 transaminitis elevations (n = 1) also were reported but not in the escalation phase. The maximum-planned dose of 20 mg/kg was safely administeredAMG 479 can be administered safely at 20 mg/kg IV Q2W. The absence of severe toxicities, attainment of serum concentrations associated with high levels of IGF-1R binding on neutrophils, and provocative antitumor activity warrant additional studies of this agent.
