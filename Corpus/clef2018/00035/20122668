Influence of chemoresistance and p53 status on fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose incorporation in cancer. Both mutant p53 and chemoresistance are poor prognostic factors in cancer. Many studies have examined the influence of these factors on fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) incorporation. Whilst mutant p53 is associated with increased FDG incorporation, chemoresistance, especially when associated with P-glycoprotein, is associated with decreased FDG incorporation.
