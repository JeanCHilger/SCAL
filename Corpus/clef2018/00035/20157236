Antisaccades: a probe into the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in Alzheimer's disease. A critical review. The number of people living with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the major cause of dementia, is projected to increase dramatically over the next few decades, making the search for treatments and tools to measure the progression of AD increasingly urgent. The antisaccade task, a hands- and language-free measure of inhibitory control, has been utilized in AD as a potential diagnostic test. While antisaccades do not appear to differentiate AD from healthy aging better than measures of episodic memory, they may still be beneficial. Specifically, antisaccades may provide not only a functional index of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC), which is damaged in the later stages of AD, but also a tool for monitoring the progression of AD. Further work is required to: 1) strengthen the link between antisaccade errors, in AD, with the DLPFC 2) insure that antisaccade errors do not result from memory, visuospatial, or other deficits associated with AD
