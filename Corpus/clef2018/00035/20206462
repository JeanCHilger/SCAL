Classification of superficial vascular anomalies. All superficial vascular abnormalities are not angiomas even though this term continues - incorrectly - to be used. Because the suffix "oma" implies a tumor, it is necessary to differentiate true vascular tumors, such as infantile hemangioma, from vascular malformations. From a hemodynamic perspective, there are two types of vascular malformations: slow- and fast-flow. In addition to the functioning of the impaired or severely damaged vessels, we discuss slow-flow capillary, venous, or lymphatic malformations and rapid flow arterial and arteriovenous malformations. All combinations are possible. There are several types of childhood vascular tumors with different courses and different prognoses. Infantile hemangioma is by far the most frequent (8 to 10 children/100). The diverse other vascular tumors in children are sufficiently rare that they are described as orphan diseases. Since the end of the last century, a simple endothelial marker, GLUT-1, is available. This immunophenotype is present in all cases of infantile hemangioma at every stage and is negative in other tumors. Kasabach-Merritt syndrome and its accompanying severe thrombocytopenia never complicate childhood hemangioma, contrary to what has been said for nearly 60 years. When it is present, the tumor is either a tufted angioma or kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, and the GLUT1 marker can distinguish them from infantile hemangioma if the histologic diagnosis is uncertain (GLUT 1 is negative in both the latter cases). There are a wide variety of rare vascular tumors many of them are benign, isolated, or limited
