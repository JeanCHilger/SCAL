The value of PET/CT for preoperative staging of advanced gastric cancer: comparison with contrast-enhanced CT. To date, no data are available on the use of PET/CT for preoperative staging of gastric cancer. We attempted to evaluate the value of PET/CT for preoperative staging of advanced gastric cancer, and to compare the use of PET/CT with contrast-enhanced CT (CECT).We analyzed PET/CT of 78 patients with surgically proven advanced gastric cancer who had undergone preoperative CECT. Qualitative analysis was conducted by assessing the presence of primary tumors and metastases with PET/CT and CECT.Among 71 patients who underwent a gastrectomy, 69 primary tumors (93%) were diagnosed by PET/CT, while 64 primary tumors (90%) were detected by CECT (p=0.55). For regional lymph node metastasis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of PET/CT vs. CECT were 41% vs. 25% (p=0.00019), 100% vs. 92% (p=0.31), 100% vs. 98% (p=0.46), 26% vs. 42% (p=0.14), and 51% vs. 72% (p=0.00089), respectively.Overall, PET/CT showed comparable diagnostic performance to CECT in diagnosing primary tumors and regional lymph node metastases, though PET/CT was inferior to CECT for the sensitivity and accuracy in diagnosing regional lymph node metastases. Nevertheless, PET/CT would be useful when CECT findings were equivocal due to its high positive predictability.
