Detection of myocardial perfusion abnormalities: standard dual-source coronary computed tomography angiography versus rest/stress technetium-99m single-photo emission CT. We compared coronary dual-source computed tomography angiography (corDSCTA) with technetium-99m single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the detection of myocardial perfusion abnormalities. Fifty-five consecutive patients underwent both gated myocardial perfusion SPECT and corDSCTA, the latter during a single arterial-phase injection of contrast agent. The perfusion defects visualised by corDSCTA correlated with the findings of rest/stress SPECT. Abnormal findings on stress SPECT, which were due to either ischaemia or infarct, were found in 24 patients. In comparison to SPECT at rest, corDSCTA detected perfusion defects with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 78%, respectively. Compared to SPECT at stress, the sensitivity and specificity values of corDSCTA were 83.3% and 90.3%, respectively. On corDSCTA , the average attenuation values of perfusion defects that corresponded to chronic infarcts (-8.5+/-22.2 HU) were significantly lower (p = 0.002) than those of non-infarct-related perfusion defects (43.1+/-17.5 HU). Using rest/stress SPECT is the gold standard for the diagnosis of myocardial ischaemia, corDSCTA was able to diagnose ischaemic disease (defined as the presence of high-grade stenotic CAD (>or=50% luminal narrowing)) with a sensitivity and specificity of 59% and 89%, respectively, in patients with no known history of myocardial infarction (n = 4). Thus, corDSCTA may serve as a diagnostic tool for the detection of perfusion abnormalities (first) visualised by SPECT. There appears to be a limited correlation between coronary stenotic disease and SPECT findings.
