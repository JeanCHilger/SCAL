Association of ST segment depression >5 min after exercise testing with severity of coronary artery disease. To determine the association of prolonged ST segment depression after an exercise test with severity of coronary artery disease.A cross sectional study of 100 consecutive patients referred to the cardiology laboratory for stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) conducted between April-August 2008. All selected patients were monitored until their ST segment depression was recovered to baseline. ST segment recovery time was categorized into less and more than 5 minutes. Subsequent gated SPECT-MPI was performed and stratified according to severity of perfusion defect. Association was determined between post exercise ST segment depression recovery time (<5 minutes and >5 minutes) and severity of perfusion defect on MPI.The mean age of the patients was 57.12 +/- 9.0 years. The results showed statistically insignificant association (p > 0.05) between ST segment recovery time of <5 minutes and >5 minutes with low, intermediate or high risk MPI.Our findings suggest that the commonly used cut-off levels used in literature for prolonged, post exercise ST segment depression (>5 minutes into recovery phase) does not correlate with severity of ischaemia based on MPI results.
