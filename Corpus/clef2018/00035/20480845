Role of FDG-PET in the evaluation and staging of hepatocellular carcinoma with comparison of tumor size, AFP level, and histologic grade. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has proven to be a valuable tool in the initial diagnosis, staging, and restaging of a variety of cancers. The potential use of FDG-PET in the evaluation and management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continues to evolve. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of FDG-PET for the detection and staging of HCC. In addition, we also assessed the correlation between FDG-PET positivity, tumor size, a-fetal protein level (AFP), and histologic grade. All patients on the hepatobiliary and liver transplant service with biopsy proven HCC that underwent FDG-PET between January 2000 and December 2004 were selected for a retrospective review. Results of the FDG-PET scan were compared with other imaging studies [computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography], intraoperative findings, tumor size, AFP levels, and histologic grade. Of the 20 patients who underwent 18F-FDG PET, increased FDG uptake was noted in 14 scans (70%). These 20 patients fell into 2 groups: 1 for detecting HCC (Group A) and 1 for staging HCC (Group B). There were 7 patients in Group A only 2 scans (28.6%) showed increased uptake. There were 13 patients in Group B
