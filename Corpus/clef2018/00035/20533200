Pros and cons of gonadectomy in female and male cats. Gonadectomy irreversibly prevents reproduction by removing germ cells as well as gonadal hormones. Moreover, consequences of gonadectomy include metabolic alterations influencing the incidence of diseases, phenotype and behavior. The desirable and undesirable effects of castration on different organ systems and their relation to timing of gonadectomy are discussed. For reasons of disease prevention as well as ease of husbandry and control of pet overpopulation prepuberal castration of non-breeding cats is recommended. At the time of gonadectomy the risk for developing obesity and associated diseases as well as dietary measures should be discussed with the owner.
