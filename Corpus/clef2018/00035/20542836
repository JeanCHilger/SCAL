Function and anatomy: SPECT-MPI and MSCT coronary angiography. For the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), non-invasive cardiac imaging is indispensable. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) investigates the pathophysiological consequences of luminal obstructive CAD, while multislice computed tomography coronary angiography (CTA) indicates the presence, extent and location of coronary atherosclerosis. The integration of CTA and SPECT data may provide important information which may be useful for patient management. In this manuscript the value of both techniques will be described. In addition, the feasibility and potential value of combined anatomic and functional imaging will be discussed.
