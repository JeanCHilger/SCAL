Balloon Test Occlusion with Perfusion CT Imaging Utilizing Intraarterial Contrast Injection. Balloon Test Occlusion (BTO) is performed to evaluate the collateral flow when a permanent therapeutic occlusion of unilateral carotid artery is planned. BTO with neurological evaluation alone, however, has a rather high false negative rate. In order to improve the sensitivity, several adjunctive procedures such as induced hypotension or cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurement with various modalities have been combined. Perfusion CT (PCT) is another imaging modality that is mainly used for the diagnosis of acute stroke. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy and the safety of BTO combined with PCT in the same procedure utilizing intraarterial contrast injection from the catheter. Seven patients underwent BTO with PCT in our institution. All the procedures were performed in the angio/CT combination suite. BTO was performed in the usual fashion and when the patient passed the 30 minutes' BTO clinically, PCT was performed subsequently. Contrast material was injected from a Pig Tail catheter placed in the ascending aorta. The obtained data were transferred to a workstation and perfusion maps of CBF, cerebral blood volume (CBV), and time to peak (TTP) were generated using software. In three patients, single photon emission CT (SPECT) was also obtained with administering 99 mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer (99 mTc-ECD) intravenously during BTO. Although all the patients had passed the BTO clinically, the CBF maps of three patients revealed significant decrease in the occluded hemisphere. There was no procedure-related morbidity. PCT using intraarterial contrast injection during BTO was performed successfully and safely. Intraarterial injection allowed us to obtain excellent time-attenuation curves by utilizing less contrast material and less radiation doze.
