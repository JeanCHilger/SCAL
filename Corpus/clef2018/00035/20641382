 Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a characteristic feature of a variety of cancers such as squamous cell lung carcinoma and breast, ovarian, head and neck, bladder, and colon cancers (1). The EGFR is a 170-kDa transmembrane protein that promotes cell proliferation by the specific binding of the autocrine epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor α (TGFα). The activity of these factors is believed to contribute to the progression of cancers. This EGFR operates through a receptor-associated tyrosine kinase–mediated signal transduction pathway. In an effort to develop therapy against cancer, a variety of EGFR inhibitors have been developed that either inhibit activation of the receptor kinase or inhibit the binding of EGF and TGFα, e. g., monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to the receptor (2). A murine MAb ior egf/r3, with a high affinity for an extracellular domain of the EGFR, was developed and tested for the treatment of cancers (3). This MAb was also labeled with radioactive technetium (
