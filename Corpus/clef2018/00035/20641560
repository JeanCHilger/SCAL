 A favorable prognosis of estrogen therapy for breast cancer can often be predicted on the basis of response to the hormone because the estrogen receptor (ER) is a valuable marker to determine treatment outcome (1). The ER status of the tumors determines the likelihood of a favorable response to the treatment, and patients with ER-positive tumors have a better chance of recovery compared to those with ER-negative tumors. The presence of ER in the tissue is measured in a biopsy sample or after resection of a tumor. The random biopsy or tumor sampling may yield a false negative result because primary tumors usually have a heterogeneous ER distribution (2). In this regard a radioscintigraphic procedure could be more useful to determine the ER status of tumors because agents used for scintigraphy have a binding specificity for their targets. Tamoxifen is a selective ER modulator that blocks estrogen binding to the receptor and is often used to treat breast cancer. Using radioactive halogen ([
