 The B cell differentiation antigen (CD20) is a transmembrane, non-glycosylated, hydrophobic protein that is characteristically expressed in more than 90% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) tumors. Although the exact cellular functions of CD20 are not known, it is believed to play a role in B cell growth, activation, and maintenance of cellular calcium homeostasis (1). Because of its specific presence in the NHL tumor cells, CD20 is targeted with the antibody (Ab) retuximab, which has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in monotherapy or in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of this disease (2). For enhanced efficacy, radionuclide-coupled anti-CD20 Abs tositumomab (
