. Hypoxia in malignant tumors can be a major factor limiting the efficacy of radiotherapy and may also be a predictive factor for the occurrence of metastatic disease. This is the reason for a multitude of efforts to develop methods and imaging techniques for measuring oxygen in tissues. Methods for measuring tumor hypoxia use diverse technologies including biological, chemical and physical methods. Nitroimidazoles, used in conjunction with positron emission tomographic imaging (PET), offer a less invasive and less technically demanding alternative to the Eppendorf (oxygen) electrode method. Nitroimidazoles are reduced intracellularly in cells. In aerobic cells, the reduced nitroimidazole is immediately reoxidised and washed out rapidly. On the other hand, an environment of low oxygen concentration induces further reductive reactions that ultimately lead to the formation of either reactive products that are able to covalently bind to cell components, or charged species that diffuse slowly out of the tissues (1). The bioreductive metabolism of 2-nitroimidazoles leads to nitroso (2e-), hydroxylamine (4e-), and amine (6e-) derivatives. When the fragmentation of the imidazole ring occurs, reactive portions of the molecule, such as glyoxal, bind to macromolecular components of cells in tissues and tumors (2) Initial development of nitroimidazoles for
