Hyperpolarized sodium 1-[ Pyruvate (Pyr) is an endogenous substrate enriched at a crossroad of the major energy-generating metabolic pathways in mammalian cells (1). Under most physiological conditions, the bulk of intracellular Pyr is generated endogenously by glycolysis of glucose or oxidation of lactate (Lac) (2). Pyr is then converted into several products through different metabolic pathways in mitochondria or cytoplasm (2, 3). In mitochondria, one of the major pathways is the irreversible transformation of Pyr into acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and CO
