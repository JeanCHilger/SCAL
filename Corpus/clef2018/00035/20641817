 CD3 antigen is a protein complex that is expressed on the T cell surface and is involved in the signal transduction of T cell activation. More than 95% of the circulating T cells in blood and activated T cells in inflamed tissues express CD3 antigen (1-3). Blocking CD3 antigen with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been shown to be effective in suppressing the immunoreaction in inflammatory and graft-
