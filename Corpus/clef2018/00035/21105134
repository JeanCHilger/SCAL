Imaging of the pleura. Pleural disease is a problem of global significance which causes significant morbidity and mortality. Pleural disease is usually first suspected on chest x-ray but further imaging, often ultrasound, is usually required as part of the diagnostic work-up. Complex imaging with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT are less often performed but are routinely required in patients with mesothelioma and occasionally required in patients with pleural infection and other pleural diseases. Cross-sectional imaging may be used to suggest the diagnosis of pleural disease, quantify disease severity, guide biopsy, and even predict prognosis. This review will focus on the contributions of CT, MRI, and PET to the management of pleural disease with discussion of their relative strengths and weaknesses.
