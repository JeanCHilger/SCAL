Gastric amyloidoma in patient after remission of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Amyloidosis is commonly systemic, occasionally organ-limited, and rarely a solitary localized mass. The latter, commonly referred to as tumoral amyloidosis, is described as occurring in nearly every organ/tissue. Only a few reports of gastric amyloidosis exist today. We describe a 72 year-old black male from Barbados presenting with 3 d of diffuse abdominal pain. His medical history included Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma diagnosed five years ago, status-post six rounds of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone chemotherapy, and currently was in remission. On computed tomography scan of the abdomen, thickening and calcification of the gastric wall was noted along with pneumatosis. On esophagogastroduodenoscopy, a large circumferential friable mass was seen from the gastroesophageal junction to the body. A large non-bleeding 3 cm polyp was also seen in post bulbar area of duodenum. Biopsies were stained with Congo red and gave green birefringence under polarized light, consistent with tumoral amyloidosis. Positron emission tomography scan revealed diffuse gastric mucosa uptake compatible with gastric malignancy without metastatic foci. Treatment for gastric amyloidomas has presently been one of observation or, at most, resection of the amyloid mass. It is not known if our patient required the same approach or if this warranted the re-institution of chemotherapy for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Until more reports of tumoral amyloidosis are made known, treatment as well as prognosis remain uncertain.
