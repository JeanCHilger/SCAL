Binding and photodissociation of CO in iron(II) complexes for application in positron emission tomography (PET) radiolabelling. (R-DAB)FeI(2) complexes containing bidentate diimide ligands (R-DAB = RN=CH-CH=NR R = (i)Pr, c-C(6)H(11)) have been investigated for their ability to react with carbon monoxide to form iron(II) dicarbonyl complexes, (R-DAB)FeI(2)(CO)(2). Solution IR spectroscopy revealed two νCO stretches between 2000 and 2040 cm(-1) corresponding to a cis-arrangement of the carbonyl ligands around the iron. Photochemical decarbonylation was achieved by UV irradiation (365 nm), which occurred within 5 min as evidenced by solution IR spectroscopy. (c-C(6)H(11)-DAB)FeI(2) has been characterised by X-ray crystallography. Reactions using (11)C-labelled carbon monoxide were investigated and revealed that both (R-DAB)FeI(2) species were not effective as trapping complexes due to the low concentrations of [(11)C]CO used in these experiments. A Fe(TPP)(THF)(x) (TPP = tetraphenylporphyrin) complex was investigated with unlabelled CO and the monocarbonyl adduct Fe(TPP)(THF)CO was formed in situ as identified by IR spectroscopy (νCO = 1966 cm(-1)) yet was stable to CO loss upon UV irradiation. Carbonylation reactions of in situ-generated Fe(TPP)(THF)(x) using [(11)C]CO revealed that 97% of the [(11)C]CO stream could be trapped in one pass of the gas at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure.
