These techniques include computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography/CT, single-photon emission CT (SPECT), and SPECT/CT. This article reviews the various imaging methods and their respective advantages and limitations for use in different types of NETs, in particular carcinoid tumors.
