Relationship between clinicopathological factors and fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in patients with papillary thyroid cancer. To examine the relationship between clinicopathological factors and fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) uptake in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).Fifty-four patients were included in this study.F-FDG positron emission tomography was performed before surgery. Immunohistochemistry of glucose transporter (GLUT) was performed using postoperative histopathological specimens. We investigated the relationship between maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and GLUT-1, GLUT-3, and GLUT-4 expression/SUVmax and prognostic risk factors {tumor size, age, sex, extrathyroidal extension, and lymph node metastasis [ly (+)]}.GLUT-3 and GLUT-4 expressions significantly correlated with SUVmax (GLUT-3: r=0.38, P=0.008 GLUT-4: r=0.46, P=0.001), but GLUT-1 did not (r=0.21, P=0.147). The tumor size correlated with SUVmax (r=0.5, P<0.001), but GLUT-1, GLUT-3, and GLUT-4 did not (GLUT-1: r=0.006, P=0.681F-FDG uptake in PTC may be determined by GLUT-3 and GLUT-4 expressions and may be related to tumor size and lymph node metastasis of PTC. F-FDG uptake may reflect tumor progression of PTC.
