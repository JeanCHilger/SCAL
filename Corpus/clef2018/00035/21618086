Imaging of embryonic stem cell migration in vivo. Conventional reporter gene technology and histological methods cannot routinely be used to track the in vivo behavior of embryonic stem (ES) cells longitudinally after cellular transplantation. Here we describe a protocol for monitoring the in vivo survival, proliferation, and migration of ES cells without necessitating animal sacrifice. Stable ES cell lines containing double fusion (DF enhanced green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase) or triple fusion (TF
