Detection of pulmonary emboli with 99mTc-labeled anti-D-dimer (DI-80B3)Fab' fragments (ThromboView). We report a new method to diagnose acute pulmonary embolism (PE) by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) after administration of (99m)Tc-labeled anti-D-dimer (DI-80B3) monoclonal antibody Fab' fragments. This novel technique provides an additional approach to diagnosing PE in patients for whom other methods are nondiagnostic or contraindicated.We performed a prospective, multicenter study to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of (99m)Tc-DI-80B3/SPECT in patients with suspected acute PE.Subjects with a moderate to high clinical probability of PE or a positive D-dimer test underwent a PE-protocol contrast-enhanced multidetector thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan as well as (99m)Tc-DI-80B3/SPECT (0.5 mg (99m)Tc-DI-80B3 intravenously followed by a thoracic SPECT 2.5 h later). Separate and independent adjudication committees, blinded to clinical data and other test results, interpreted the (99m)Tc-DI-80B3/SPECT scans (PE detected as foci of abnormally increased (99m)Tc uptake) and the thoracic CT scans using Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II criteria.Of the 52 patients who were enrolled and completed both tests, 42 had both evaluable SPECT scans and thoracic CT scans. Using the criterion standard (thoracic CT scan) there were 21 patients with PE and 21 without. (99m)Tc-DI-80B3/SPECT had a sensitivity of 76.2% (95% confidence interval, 52.8-91.8%) and a specificity of 90.5% (95% confidence interval, 69.8-98.8%). Treatment-related serious adverse events did not occur.(99m)Tc-DI-80B3/SPECT was sensitive and specific for acute PE in subjects with moderate to high clinical probability of PE or a positive D-dimer test. (99m)Tc-DI-80B3/SPECT demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and avoids exposure to contrast.
