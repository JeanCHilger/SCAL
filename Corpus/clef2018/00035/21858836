Guidelines for lymphoscintigraphy and F18 FDG PET scans in melanoma. Melanoma has a high potential to develop metastases. Accurate staging is essential for appropriate management. Sentinel node (SN) status is a powerful prognostic factor in early stage melanoma. Staging is assisted by SN biopsy after lymphoscintigraphy to locate all true SNs prior to biopsy. PET using F18-FDG can detect metastases and is used to restage patients with AJCC Stages III and IV disease before planning surgery with curative intent.
