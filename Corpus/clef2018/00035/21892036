Diagnostic performance of In-111 capromab pendetide SPECT/CT in localized and metastatic prostate cancer. To determine the diagnostic performance of In-111 capromab pendetide single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT), in the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes via correlation to a gold standard of histopathology.In this study, we retrospectively reviewed all In-111 capromab pendetide SPECT/CT acquired at our institution for dedicated histopathology within a 4-month period. Statistical measures of performance were calculated in terms of glandular, seminal vesicle, and lymph node activity. The accuracies of glandular and seminal vesicle activity were then correlated to the indices of risk, including the stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen level, as well as the treatment history.Of the 200 scans meeting the criteria of our study, 197 had prostate gland histopathology, 94 had bilateral seminal vesicle histopathology, and 5 had a total of 43 resected lymph nodes for comparison. The overall accuracies of the scan results were determined to be 77.7% (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.539) for the gland, 67.0% (AUC = 0.510) for the seminal vesicles, and 93.0% (AUC = 0.787) for lymph nodes. For glandular activity alone, scan accuracy was found to significantly improve with increasing Gleason score (P < 0.0001), and in a setting prior to treatment (P = 0.0005). No statistically significant differences were found between different scan groups with regards to seminal vesicle activity.The results of this study provide substantiating evidence In-111 capromab pendetide can be used to accurately diagnose lymph node metastases from primary cancers of the prostate however, they also suggest the test may have limited utility in diagnosing tumors within the prostate gland and seminal vesicles.
