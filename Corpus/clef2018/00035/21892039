Noninvasive and invasive staging of ovarian cancer: review of the literature. The use of F-18 FDG PET/CT in the characterization of doubtful adnexal findings and in the staging of ovarian cancer is being extensively evaluated. The purpose of our article is to review the literature and to add our experience to the published works. We concluded that F-18 FDG PET/CT could represent an important method in addition to other imaging modalities (transvaginal ultrasound-, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography) in the characterization of adnexal masses and in the staging of ovarian cancer patients, particularly in assessing the presence of extra-abdominal metastatic spread.
