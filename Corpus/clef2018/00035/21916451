Highly selective and sensitive fluorescent turn-on chemosensor for Al3+ based on a novel photoinduced electron transfer approach. A photoinduced electron transfer (PET)-based chemosensor possessing dual PET processes by simultaneously introducing both nitrogen and sulfur donors was achieved. The fluorescence signal of the free chemosensor is in a normal-off state due to the sulfur donor being insensitive to environmental pH stimuli. As a result, the device can be used over a wide pH span of 3-11. Upon binding Al(3+), a significant fluorescence enhancement with a turn-on ratio over 110-fold was triggered by the inhibition of PET processes from both the sulfur and the nitrogen donors to the fluorophore.
