Association between life events and change in depressive symptoms in Hong Kong Chinese elderly. Life event was regarded as an important risk factor for depression. Only a few prospective studies had examined the impact of life events individually and in combination. This study examined the relationship between life events and change in depressive symptoms.Depressive symptoms were assessed longitudinally using Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) in 2630 community-dwelling Chinese elderly aged 65 or above. A cutoff score of 8 or higher indicated clinically relevant depressive symptoms. Subjects identified as demented were excluded. Eight life events experienced in the past year were assessed at 2year follow up. Logistic regression analyses were performed with adjustments for baseline GDS score and potential confounders such as sociodemographic, developmental and social factors, alcohol consumption, medical history and physical health status.In men, experience of two events (OR=2.493) and three or more events (OR=3.199) was independently associated with increased risk of having depression. In women, the risk increased only in experiencing three or more events (OR=5.558). Moreover, life event affected depressive symptoms differently for men and women. Loss of pet and serious financial trouble were associated with an increase in depressive symptoms among men, but serious illness or accident of partner, and loss of a hobby were significant among women. Experience in either good or bad important events increased risk of depression in both sexes.The main limitation was all subjects were ambulatory volunteers.The occurrence of single life event had contributed to the onset of depression and multiple events had a cumulative effect.
