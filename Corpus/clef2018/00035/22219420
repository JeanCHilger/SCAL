Correlation between matrix metalloproteinase 9 and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography as diagnostic markers of lung cancer. This study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic role of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), serum and tissue samples of patients with indeterminate lung lesions and its correlation with F-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ((18)FDG-PET) findings in diagnostic work.MMP9 levels (ng/ml) in serum and BAL were analysed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 60 consecutive patients with lung mass. (18)FDG-PET was performed on all patients and a standard uptake value (SUV) threshold of 2.5 was used to differentiate benign from malignant lesions. In tissue samples of resectable patients, MMP9 expression was also revealed by immunohistochemical staining.Twenty patients had benign disease and 40 patients had malignant lesions, of which 7 (17.5%) were classified as Stage I, 18 (45%) as Stage II, 7 (17.5%) as Stage III and 8 (20%) as Stage IV. MMP9 levels in serum were significantly higher in malignant than in benign lesions (673 ± 182 versus 309 ± 96, respectively, P < 0.0001), and were significantly higher in patients with metastatic disease than in patients of other stage groups no significant difference was found between different histological types. MMP9 levels in BAL were higher in malignant than in benign lesions (502 ± 137 versus 325 ± 118, respectively, P = 0.001)The measurement of MMP9 levels helps to differentiate benign from malignant lung mass. Its use in combination with PET study adds further information to the diagnosis work-up of lesions to select patients who may or may not benefit from additional invasive procedures.
