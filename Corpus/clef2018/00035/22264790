Rapid decrease in delivery of chemotherapy to tumors after anti-VEGF therapy: implications for scheduling of anti-angiogenic drugs. Current strategies combining anti-angiogenic drugs with chemotherapy provide clinical benefit in cancer patients. It is assumed that anti-angiogenic drugs, such as bevacizumab, transiently normalize abnormal tumor vasculature and contribute to improved delivery of subsequent chemotherapy. To investigate this concept, a study was performed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients using positron emission tomography (PET) and radiolabeled docetaxel ([(11)C]docetaxel). In NSCLC, bevacizumab reduced both perfusion and net influx rate of [(11)C]docetaxel within 5 hr. These effects persisted after 4 days. The clinical relevance of these findings is notable, as there was no evidence for a substantial improvement in drug delivery to tumors. These findings highlight the importance of drug scheduling and advocate further studies to optimize scheduling of anti-angiogenic drugs.
