Fused 99m-Tc-GSA SPECT/CT imaging for the preoperative evaluation of postoperative liver function: can the liver uptake index predict postoperative hepatic functional reserve? To evaluate the role of hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor analysis in the preoperative estimation of postoperative hepatic functional reserve.We obtained technetium-99m-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-galactosyl human serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) SPECT/CT fusion images in 256 patients with liver disease scheduled for hepatic resection. The liver uptake value corrected for body surface area [LUV(BSA)] and liver uptake ratio (LUR) of the remnant were preoperatively estimated based on the fused images. These values were compared with the postoperative hepatic functional reserve.Significant correlations were observed between LUV(BSA), LUR, and most conventional indicators of hepatic functional reserve. Postoperatively, nonpreserved liver functional reserve was observed in 15 of the 256 patients (5.8%). Remnant LUV(BSA) showed better correlation than remnant LUR or the other indicators. No patients with remnant LUV(BSA) above 28.0 manifested poor nonpreserved functional reserve. Using a LUV(BSA) of 27.0, it was possible to predict postoperative poor hepatic functional reserve at a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 81%, and accuracy of 81% postoperatively. According to multivariate analysis, a low remnant LUV(BSA) was the only significant independent predictor of poor hepatic functional reserve.Our 99mTc-GSA SPECT/CT fusion imaging method was clinically useful for evaluating regional hepatic function and for predicting postoperative hepatic functional reserve.
