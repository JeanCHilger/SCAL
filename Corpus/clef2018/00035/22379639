Pyridine-tetra-acetate-gadolinium(III) (PTA-Gd) conjugated to 17β-estradiol (EPTA-Gd) or tamoxifen (TPTA-Gd) The luminal-A subtype of breast cancer (the other three subtypes are basal-like, epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive, and luminal-B (1)) is characterized by overexpression of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) and has been reviewed by Geyer et al. (2). The biological activity and the mode of action of this receptor in the nucleus of a cell have been described by Nilsson et al. (3). In addition, ERα is known to promote cell proliferation that leads to the development of cancerous tumors in the breast (4). Therefore, the ERα is a major biomarker for the detection of ERα-positive (ER+) breast cancer, and the level of its expression in this malignancy is used to predict the response and the prognosis of anti-hormonal therapy for a patient (5). Currently, immunohistochemistry and ELISA are the most common methods used to determine the levels of ER in cancerous breast tissue, but these procedures require the use of invasive techniques to obtain biopsy samples from the primary tumor, and results generated from these tests show analytical variability due to a lack of standardized methods (6). Investigators have successfully used 16α-[
