Two-in-one protocol: simultaneous small-pore and ultrasmall-pore peritoneal transport quantification. Reduced free water transport (FWT) through ultrasmall pores contributes to net ultrafiltration failure (UFF) and should be seen as a sign of more severe functional deterioration of the peritoneal membrane. The modified peritoneal equilibration test (PET), measuring the dip in dialysate Na concentration, estimates only FWT. Our aim was to simultaneously quantify small-solute transport, FWT, and small-pore ultrafiltration (SPUF) during a single PET procedure.We performed a 4-hour, 3.86% glucose PET, with additional measurement of ultrafiltration (UF) at 60 minutes, in 70 peritoneal dialysis patients (mean age: 50 ± 16 years 61% womenSodium sieving (as measured by ΔDNa(0-60)) correlated strongly with the corrected Dip(D/PNa60') (r = 0.85, p < 0.0001) and the corrected FWT (r = 0.41, p = 0.005). Total UF showed better correlation with FWT than with indirect measurements of Na sieving (r = 0.46, p < 0.0001 for FWT r = 0.360, p < 0.0001 for Dip(D/PNa60')). Corrected FWT fraction was 0.45 ± 0.16. A negative correlation was found between time on PD and both total UF and FWT (r = -0.253, p = 0.035 and r = -0.272, p = 0.023 respectively). The 11 patients (15.7%) diagnosed with UFF had lower FWT (89 mL vs 164 mL, p < 0.05) and higher D/P creatinine (0.75 vs 0.70, p < 0.05) than did the group with normal UF. The SPUF correlated positively with FWT in the normal UF group, but negatively in UFF patients (r = -0.709, p = 0.015). Among UFF patients on PD for a longer period, 44.4% had a FWT percentage below 45%.Measurement of FWT and SPUF is feasible by simultaneous quantification during a modified 3.86% glucose PET, and FWT is a decisive parameter for detecting causes of UFF in addition to increased effective capillary surface.
