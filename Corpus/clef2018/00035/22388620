Gallium-labelled peptides for imaging of inflammation. Inflammation plays a major role in the development of many diseases. This review article summarizes recent research in the field of in vivo imaging of inflammation. Novel methodologies using PET with (68)Ga peptides targeting, for example, vascular adhesion protein 1 are discussed.
