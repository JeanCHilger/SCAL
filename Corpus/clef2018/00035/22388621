Feasibility and availability of ⁶⁸Ga-labelled peptides. (68)Ga has attracted tremendous interest as a radionuclide for PET based on its suitable half-life of 68 min, high positron emission yield and ready availability from (68)Ge/(68)Ga generators, making it independent of cyclotron production. (68)Ga-labelled DOTA-conjugated somatostatin analogues, including DOTA-TOC, DOTA-TATE and DOTA-NOC, have driven the development of technologies to provide such radiopharmaceuticals for clinical applications mainly in the diagnosis of somatostatin receptor-expressing tumours. We summarize the issues determining the feasibility and availability of (68)Ga-labelled peptides, including generator technology, (68)Ga generator eluate postprocessing methods, radiolabelling, automation and peptide developments, and also quality assurance and regulatory aspects. (68)Ge/(68)Ga generators based on SnO(2), TiO(2) or organic matrices are today routinely supplied to nuclear medicine departments, and a variety of automated systems for postprocessing and radiolabelling have been developed. New developments include improved chelators for (68)Ga that could open new ways to utilize this technology. Challenges and limitations in the on-site preparation and use of (68)Ga-labelled peptides outside the marketing authorization track are also discussed.
