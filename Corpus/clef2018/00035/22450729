N,N,N,N-tetradentate macrocyclic ligand based selective fluorescent sensor for zinc (II). N,N,N,N-tetradentate macrocyclic ligand (L) has been synthesized by the condensation of benzil and semicarbazide and characterized. On excitation by light of wavelength 350 nm, L exhibited a fluorescent peak at λ(max) = 454 nm, which showed ca 6 times enhancement in intensity with a blue shift on interaction with Zn(2+). L has been found to act as a selective fluorescent sensor for zinc(2+) ion over a host of other metal ions such as- Cd(2+), Pb(2+), Hg(2+), Ca(2+), Fe(2+), Na(2+), Co(2+), Mn(2+), Cu(2+) and Ni(2+), in 1:1 CH(3)OH:H(2)O. A 1:1 complex formation between L and Zn(2+) was proved. The enhancement in the fluorescence could be explained on the basis of Photo induced electron transfer (PET) mechanism with log β = 1.86.
