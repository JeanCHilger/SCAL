Enterohepatic Helicobacter spp. in colonic biopsies of dogs: molecular, histopathological and immunohistochemical investigations. Enterohepatic Helicobacter spp. have been described colonizing the large intestine and liver of healthy and symptomatic subjects and are thought to have a role in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The prevalence of enterohepatic Helicobacter spp. infection in dogs is largely unknown and to our knowledge there are no data about their potential pathogenic role. In light of these considerations, the aims of this study were (i) to assess the prevalence of enterohepatic Helicobacter spp. in colonic biopsies of symptomatic pet dogs and (ii) to evaluate a possible association between Helicobacter spp. colonization status (heavily colonized, poorly colonized and uncolonized biopsies) and histological lesions. Colonic biopsies from 27 pet dogs of different ages were evaluated by family Helicobacteraceae and enterohepatic Helicobacter spp. PCR, histology, and immunohistochemistry for the in situ detection of Helicobacter spp. organisms. 85% and 52% of colonic biopsies were positive by Helicobacteraceae and enterohepatic Helicobacter spp. PCR, respectively. Immunohistochemistry revealed Helicobacter spp. were localized both in the superficial mucus (55%) and within intestinal crypts (33%). Dogs with heavy enterohepatic Helicobacter spp. colonization were significantly younger and had a higher level of mucosal fibrosis/atrophy than dogs with uncolonized or poorly colonized biopsies (p<0.05). These findings contribute to widen current knowledge regarding canine enterohepatic Helicobacter spp., suggesting the infection is rather common in dogs and acquired at an early age. Furthermore, heavy colonization of colonic crypts is associated with chronic inflammatory lesions (fibrosis/atrophy), supporting the role of enterohepatic Helicobacter spp. in the development of canine IBD.
