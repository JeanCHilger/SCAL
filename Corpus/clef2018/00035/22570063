Biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: after Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative studies. Recent advances in biomarker studies compiled from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) are summarized here. CSF AÎ²42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau181 are the most sensitive biomarkers for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and predicting the onset of AD in cases with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. Many perspective studies on PiB-PET, FDG-PET, MRI volumetry, and some neuropsychiatric tests have provided evidence for the usefulness of these biomarkers for diagnosing AD and MCI due to AD. Basic and clinical studies have contributed considerably to the establishment of clinical evidence that supports the usefulness of these markers. Given the progress in the diagnosis of preclinical AD, discovery of therapy that is essential for the cure of AD is expected soon.
