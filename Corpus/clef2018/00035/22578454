Synthesis of PECAM-1-specific 64Cu PET imaging agent: evaluation of myocardial infarction caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury in mouse. A PECAM-1 specific PET imaging agent, PECAM-1-Ab-DOTA-(64)Cu, was synthesized by conjugating the anti-mouse PECAM-1 antibody with 2,2',2",2"'-(1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetrayl)tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and subsequent labeling with (64)Cu. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) was successfully performed in a mouse model of myocardial infarction (MI) induced by an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, indicating the elevated expression of PECAM-1.
