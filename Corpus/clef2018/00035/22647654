V/Q SPECT imaging of acute pulmonary embolus - a practical perspective. The following article is intended to illustrate the place of scintigraphy and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in the investigation of acute PE in current practice, and to guide non-radionuclide radiologists and other medical professionals to the best test for patients. We share our early experiences with ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) including image acquisition and interpretation. A comparison of the two techniques is given, along with practical considerations in a variety of clinical scenarios.
