Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy: past, present and future. During the last two decades, radionuclide myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) has become established as the main functional cardiac imaging technique for the assessment of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Despite a growing number of alternative functional imaging techniques, MPS still remains the most widely used technique, with a wealth of literature supporting its usefulness in assessing IHD and predicting prognosis. The technique itself has evolved, making it more reliable and robust, with additional ventricular functional information that further defines the prognosis in these patients. With the advent of hybrid single photon emission with CT and positron emission tomography with CT cameras together with the development of new camera technology that enables faster images with less radiation and better resolution, MPS will remain an essential part of IHD investigation. There are new promising radiopharmacological developments and applications such as radiolabelled fatty acids and meta-iodobenzylguanidine. These will widen the scope of nuclear medicine imaging to include patients with cardiac failure and acute chest pain presenting to accident and emergency departments. Nuclear medicine cardiac investigations will continue to have an essential role in the diagnosis, stratification and prognosis of patients with cardiac disease, complementing the new developing cardiac modalities such as CT coronary angiography and MRI.
