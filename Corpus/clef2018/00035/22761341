FDG-PET/CT for the early prediction of histopathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients: initial results. Up to about one-quarter of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy do not adequately respond to the given treatment. By a differentiation between responders and non-responders ineffective toxic therapies can be prevented.To retrospectively test if FDG-PET/CT is able to early differentiate between breast cancer lesions with pathological complete response (pCR) and lesions without pathological complete response (npCR) after two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).In this retrospective study 26 breast cancer patients (mean age, 46.9 years ± 9.9 years) underwent a pre-therapeutic FDG-PET/CT scan and a subsequent FDG-PET/CT after the second cycle of NACT. Histopathology of resected specimen served as the reference standard. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of cancer lesions before and after the second cycle of NACT were measured. Two evaluation algorithms were used: (a) pCR: Sinn Score 3 and 4, npCR: Sinn Score 0-2 (b) pCR: Sinn Score 4, npCR: Sinn Score 0-3. The absolute and relative decline of the SUVmax (ΔSUVmax, ΔSUVmax(%))was calculated. Differences of the SUVmax as well as of the SUVmax decline between pCR lesions and npCR lesions were tested for statistical significance P < 0.05. To identify the optimal cut-off value of ΔSUVmax(%) to differentiate between pCR lesions and npCR lesions a receiver-operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed.Using evaluation algorithm A the ΔSUVmax was 13.5 (pCR group) and 3.9 (npCR group) (P = 0.006) the ΔSUVmax(%) was 79% and 47%, respectively (P = 0.001). On ROC analysis an optimal cut-off ΔSUVmax(%) of 66% was found. Using evaluation algorithm B the ΔSUVmax was 17.5 (pCR group) and 4.9 (npCR group) (P = 0.013)FDG-PET/CT may be able to early differentiate between pCR and npCR of primary breast cancer lesions after two cycles of NACT.
