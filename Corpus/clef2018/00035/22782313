Oncologic PET/MRI, part 2: bone tumors, soft-tissue tumors, melanoma, and lymphoma. With integrated whole-body PET/MRI, a novel metabolic-anatomic imaging technique recently has been introduced into clinical practice. This review addresses PET/MRI of bone tumors, soft-tissue sarcoma, melanoma, and lymphoma. If PET/MRI literature is not yet available for some types of tumors, potential indications are based on available PET/CT and MRI data. PET/MRI seems to be of benefit in T-staging of primary bone tumors and soft-tissue sarcomas. With regard to N-staging, PET/MRI can be considered similarly accurate to PET/CT when applied as a whole-body staging approach. M-staging will benefit from MRI accuracy in the brain, the liver, and bone.
