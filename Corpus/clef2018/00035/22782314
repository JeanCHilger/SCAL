PET of serotonin 1A receptors and cerebral glucose metabolism for temporal lobectomy. The objective of this study was to compare 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (5-HT(1A)) PET with cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) PET for temporal lobectomy planning.We estimated 5-HT(1A) receptor binding preoperatively with (18)F-trans-4-fluoro-N-2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl) piperazin-1-yl]ethyl-N-(2-pyridyl) cyclohexane carboxamide ((18)F-FCWAY) PET and CMRglc measurement with (18)F-FDG in regions drawn on coregistered MRI after partial-volume correction in 41 patients who had anterior temporal lobectomy with at least a 1-y follow-up. Surgery was tailored to individual preresection evaluations and intraoperative electrocorticography. Mean regional asymmetry values and the number of regions with asymmetry exceeding 2 SDs in 16 healthy volunteers were compared between seizure-free and non-seizure-free patients. (18)F-FCWAY but not (18)F-FDG and MRI data were masked for surgical decisions and outcome assessment.Twenty-six of 41 (63%) patients seizure-free since surgery had significantly different mesial temporal asymmetries, compared with 15 non-seizure-free patients for both (18)F-FCWAY (F(1,39) = 5.87 P = 0.02) and (18)F-FDG PET (F(1,38) = 5.79Our study provides class III evidence that both 5-HT(1A) receptor PET and CMRglc PET can contribute to temporal lobectomy planning. Additional studies should explore the potential for temporal lobectomy based on interictal electroencephalography and minimally invasive imaging studies.
