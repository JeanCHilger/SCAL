Co(η5-P5){η2-P2H(mes)}]2-: a phospha-organometallic complex obtained by the transition-metal-mediated activation of the heptaphosphide trianio. A carbon copy: The chemical activation of the heptaphosphide trianion with [Co(PEt(2)Ph)(2)(mes)(2)] (see picture 1) yields the novel phospha-organometallic complex [Co(η(5)-P(5)){η(2)-P(2)H(mes)}](2-) (2). The reaction product maintains the nuclearity of the parent cluster, but extensive cage fragmentation takes place to yield a diamagnetic "inorganometallic" cobalt complex.
