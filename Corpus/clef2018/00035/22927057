Fusion of [(18)F]FDG PET with fluorescence diffuse optical tomography to improve validation of probes and tumor imaging. Given the progress of fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (fDOT) technology, here, we study the additional benefits provided by multimodal PET/fDOT imaging by comparing the biodistribution of 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) in tumors with three fluorescent probes: a glucose analog, a protease activatable optical probe, and a ligand of αvβ3 integrin.Sequential fDOT/PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging of mice was performed with a custom multimodal mouse support that allows the subject to be transferred between the fDOT and the PET/CT scanners. Experiments were performed in xenografted tumor models derived from the human breast cancer line MDA-MB 231 and compared to ex vivo analysis.The three-dimensional signals showed that the fluorescent glucose analog is not colocalized with [(18)F]FDG, raising questions about its use as a surrogate probe of the PET tracer. Fusion of [(18)F]FDG with the other fluorescent probes showed evidence of high variability both for the protease activity and the αvβ3 integrin expression during tumor growth.The added value of hybrid PET/fDOT over the two modalities was demonstrated for cross-validation of probes and for better characterization of tumor models.
