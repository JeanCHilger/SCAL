Simultaneous in vitro and in vivo validation of nitrogen-13-ammonia for the assessment of regional myocardial blood flow. Measurement of myocardial blood flow by 13NH3 relies heavily on the assessment of both the input function and the variable tissue extraction fraction. In six open-chest dogs, myocardial and arterial 13NH3 activity was measured both by in vitro sampling and by in vivo positron emission tomography (PET). Regional myocardial blood flow was forced to vary in the range 0.2-5 ml/min/g and actual values were assessed by in vitro counting of 153Gd microspheres. The ammonia input function was processed by: (a) total curve integration (b) curve integration for 2 min
