Food-borne outbreak of Giardia lamblia. An outbreak of giardiasis occurred following a family party for 25 persons. Nine who had eaten fruit salad became ill, compared with one who had not eaten the salad (Relative Risk = 7.4, 95% CI = 1.4, 169.3). The fruit salad preparer had a diapered child and a pet rabbit at home who were both positive for Giardia lamblia. This outbreak emphasizes the importance of good hygienic practices in food preparation and the possibility of domestic-animal-to-person transmission in Giardia outbreaks.
