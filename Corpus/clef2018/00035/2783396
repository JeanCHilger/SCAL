Noninvasive quantitation of regional myocardial oxygen consumption in vivo with [1-11C]acetate and dynamic positron emission tomography. The usefulness of [1-11C]acetate as a tracer of overall myocardial oxidative metabolism for use with positron emission tomography has been investigated in 12 closed-chest dogs. Myocardial 11C activity clearance kinetics after intravenous administration of [1-11C]acetate in dogs have been determined noninvasively by positron emission tomography. Biexponential fitting of regional myocardial 11C time-activity curves was performed to give clearance half-times and fractional distribution. The rate constant k1 for the early rapid phase of 11C activity clearance was found to correlate linearly with myocardial oxygen consumption (y = 0.0156x + 0.039 SEE = 0.023
