Detection and quantification of chronic cerebrovascular disease: comparison of MR imaging, SPECT, and CT. Twenty patients with angiographically proved occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) (19 unilateral, one bilateral) were studied with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, iodine-123 iodoamphetamine (IMP) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), xenon-133 SPECT, and computed tomography (CT). All patients had a history of stroke or prolonged reversible ischemic neurologic deficit for more than 4 weeks. By regions of interest, T1, T2, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and the number and size of the lesions were determined. The data were expressed as interhemispheric ratios (diseased/nondiseased). The highest ratios obtained were for MR imaging (T1, 2.60 +/- 0.42 T2, 1.61 +/- 0.22 [mean +/- standard deviation]) followed by Xe-133 SPECT (0.58 +/- 0.13) and IMP SPECT (0.56 +/- 0.13). Correlation coefficients for MR imaging (1/T1, 1/T2) and IMP SPECT were below .21. The lesion size was greatest on IMP SPECT images, intermediate on MR images, and least on CT scans. However, MR imaging was superior in detection of pathologic areas (detection rates: MR, 100%
