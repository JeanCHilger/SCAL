A study of the single compartment tracer kinetic model for the measurement of local cerebral blood flow using 15O-water and positron emission tomography. The effects of varying the data collection time on the calculation of cerebral blood flow and distribution volume via the integrated projection technique were studied in four human subjects. The significance of these results in terms of the limitations of the single compartment model for 15O-water was explored using computer simulations. The simulations helped to account for causes for the variations seen in blood flow and distribution volume as a function of the data collection time. Two different compartmental models were explored for better quantitation of blood flow and distribution volume.
