Comparison of 99Tcm complexes (NEP-DADT, ME-NEP-DADT and HMPAO) with 123IAMP for brain SPECT imaging in dogs. Several new lipophilic 99Tcm complexes have recently been described as alternatives to N-isopropyl (123I) iodoamphetamine (123IAMP) for measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (RCBF). In this study we have compared brain uptake and blood clearance of 99Tcm-N-ethylpiperidine-diamino dithiol (99Tcm-NEP DADT), its 4-methylated derivative (99Tcm-Me-NEP-DADT) and 99Tcm-hexamethyl-propylene-amine-oxime (99Tcm-HMPAO) with that of 123IAMP in two dogs. Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) was employed to measure brain accumulation and retention of the four radiopharmaceuticals. Cerebral uptake of the 99Tcm complexes (0.8-1.1%) was lower than that of 123IAMP (1.6% of the injected dose). There was considerable extracerebral activity in the dog's head, especially in the olfactory and snout regions. Because of slow blood clearance 99Tcm-HMPAO showed high uptake in these regions. Brain uptake of 99Tcm-HMPAO reached a plateau 5 to 10 min after intravenous injection and remained constant for the entire study period (1 h). 99Tcm-NEP-DADT, on the other hand, showed significant clearance from the brain after reaching maximal uptake at 10 to 15 min after injection. However, brain imaging with these agents was possible during the first 20 min. The mechanism of brain uptake, as well as the relationship between brain uptake and RCBF need to be evaluated for each of the four radiopharmaceuticals.
