Antibody activity to Babesia canis in dogs in North Carolina. Sera from 600 dogs from 6 geographic regions of North Carolina were analyzed for antibody activity to Babesia canis, using an indirect fluorescent antibody test. Overall, 3.8% of the dogs had an antibody titer greater than or equal to 1:80, which was considered to be indicative of infection. Dogs were more likely to be seropositive if they were housed at humane facilities and were located within areas of the state with a milder climate than were pet animals living within colder regions of North Carolina.
