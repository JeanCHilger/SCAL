Efficient stereospecific synthesis of no-carrier-added 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose using aminopolyether supported nucleophilic substitution. An aminopolyether mediated synthesis of fluorine-18 (18F) 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) has been developed. The nucleophilic fluorination with accelerator-produced [18F]fluoride works at the no-carrier-added level and gives epimerically pure 2-18FDG with an uncorrected radiochemical yield of a maximum 50% in a synthesis time of approximately 50 min from EOB.
