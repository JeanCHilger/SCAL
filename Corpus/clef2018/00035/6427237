Measurement of cerebral blood flow using bolus inhalation of C15O2 and positron emission tomography: description of the method and its comparison with the C15O2 continuous inhalation method. This article describes a rapid method for the regional measurement of cerebral blood flow using a single breath of C15O2 and positron emission tomography. The technique is based on the bolus distribution principle and utilises a reference table for the calculation of flow. Seven subjects were studied using both this method and the C15O2 continuous inhalation steady-state technique. The single-breath method gave flow values 20% higher than those obtained using the steady-state method. A simulation study was performed in an attempt to define the reasons for the difference between the two techniques. Estimations were made of identified sources of error in the measurement of regional cerebral blood flow using the single-breath technique and compared with results from a similar study previously described for the steady-state technique. However, further comparative studies will be necessary to satisfactorily explain the difference between both techniques.
