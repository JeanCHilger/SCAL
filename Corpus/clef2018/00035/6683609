Regional extravascular lung density and fractional pulmonary blood volume in patients with chronic pulmonary venous hypertension. Using a technique based on positron transmission and emission tomography, we measured regional extravascular lung density (lung tissue and interstitial water per unit thoracic volume) and fractional pulmonary blood volume (volume of blood per unit thoracic volume) in normal subjects and in patients with cardiomyopathy and chronic pulmonary venous hypertension. We found an increase in extravascular lung density in the patients. Extravascular density was increased in all parts of the lung studied, but higher values were seen in the dorsocaudal portion than in the ventrocaudal portion of the lung (average 151% and 130% of normal, respectively). Fractional blood volume was markedly reduced in the dorsocaudal part of the lung (mean 74% of normal). The increase in extravascular density probably reflects structural changes in the lung as well as accumulation of interstitial fluid. The distribution of extravascular density is consistent with previous radiological and morphological studies, and may reflect a higher tendency to oedema formation in the dependent parts of the lung. The measurements of fractional blood volume suggest that intrapulmonary blood volume is reduced in chronic pulmonary venous hypertension. This may reflect a decrease in the distensibility of the pulmonary vessels due to structural abnormalities, as well as functional changes in the pulmonary vasculature.
