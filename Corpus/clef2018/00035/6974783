Single photon emission tomography of the pituitary: preliminary communication. A specific application of single photon emission tomography to the relative quantitation of the pituitary region is described together with the results obtained in 19 patients with pituitary adenoma proven by air encephalography. These are compared with those obtained by X-ray computer tomography and conventional brain imaging and a superiority of single photon emission tomography is demonstrated in this small series.
