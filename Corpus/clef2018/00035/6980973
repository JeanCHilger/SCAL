Planar imaging of positron-emitting radionuclides with a multicrystal camera. A multicrystal gamma camera has been evaluated for the imaging of 511-keV photons resulting from positron emission. With minor instrument modifications, images of a phantom demonstrating good resolution are obtained. Satisfactory planar images are obtained in animals using fluorine-18 or rubidium-82. These findings establish the feasibility of planar imaging of positron emitters in a clinical setting, and may make possible the more rapid development assessment, and dissemination of positron-emitting radionuclides, thus promoting utilization of tomographic positron imaging techniques.
