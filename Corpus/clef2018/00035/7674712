PET in clinical work. A refined instrument for imaging. Positron emission tomography (PET) enables in vivo studies to be performed in patients to investigate the binding or metabolism of biologically/functionally active substances labelled with short-lived positron-emitting radionuclides. The procedure has been used for discriminative analysis of physiology and function, both normal and pathological. The range of clinical applications includes studies of cerebral ischaemia and heart diseases, tumor diagnosis and treatment follow-up, presurgical work-up in cases of epilepsy, and characterization and treatment follow-up in cases of dementia. The clinical uses of PET are outlined in a review of the last three years' experience at the PET centre at Uppsala University.
