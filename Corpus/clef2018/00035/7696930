Diagnostic imaging in the evaluation of renal lymphoma. Renal lymphoma usually is a manifestation of disseminated disease and often is asymptomatic. Occasionally, the kidney(s) may be the major or only demonstrable site of disease, which may then present with a variety of urologic symptoms. The imaging studies should be tailored according to the presenting symptoms and prior history. Currently CT with intravenous contrast material enhancement is the study of choice for both the evaluation of renal involvement as well as staging of the disease. When necessary, CT or sonography may be used to guide percutaneous needle biopsy of suspicious masses. The role of the various imaging techniques, including MR and positron emission tomography, in the evaluation of renal lymphoma is discussed.
