Fluoxetine effects on cerebral glucose metabolism. In a counterbalanced, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 40 mg of fluoxetine was administered to four healthy adult volunteers (three men, one woman age range 20-39 years), 90 min before injection of 6-7.5 mCi of [18F]-2-deoxyglucose to measure cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglu). Subjects were engaged in a visual monitoring task shortly before and during scanning with a PETT-VI tomograph. Global CMRglu did not differ when placebo (8.93 +/- 0.96 mg 100 g-1 min-1) was compared to fluoxetine (8.22 +/- 0.86 mg 100 g-1 min-1
