Synthesis of 6 alpha-[18F]fluoroprogesterone: a first step towards a potential receptor-ligand for PET. 6 alpha-[18F]Fluoroprogesterone 3 was prepared by the BF3.Et2O-catalyzed reaction of progest-5 alpha, 6 alpha-epoxy-3,20-bisketal 1 and [18F]fluoride as a possible route for the in vivo visualization of progesterone receptors by PET. The radiochemical yield of 3 was 25% (EOB) and the sp. act. was 5 MBq/mumol (100 Ci/mol, EOS).
