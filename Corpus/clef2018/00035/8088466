Global change in the regulation of regional coronary flow in patients with single vessel coronary disease evidenced by positron emission tomography. Aim of this study is to investigate whether, in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), regional myocardial blood flow (rMBF) regulation is affected with further mechanisms besides the effects of epicardial coronary stenosis.RMBF and coronary reserve are measured in 13 normal subjects and in 36 patients with effort angina and isolated (> or = 50% diameter narrowing) left anterior descending (LAD, 27 patients) or left circumflex (LCX, 9 patients) coronary artery stenosis. Measurements are obtained both at baseline and following dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg in 4 minutes) using positron emission tomography and N13-ammonia.At rest, patients with CAD show similar rMBF values in the stenotic and remote areas (0.71 +/- 0.19 vs 0.77 +/- 0.22 ml/min/gr, respectively, ns) both values are significantly (p < 0.01) reduced with respect to mean rMBF observed in the normal subjects (1.07 +/- 0.21 ml/min/gr). Following dipyridamole, patients with CAD show lower rMBF values in stenotic than in control regions (1.25 +/- 0.54 vs 1.73 +/- 0.80 ml/min/gr, p < 0.01)These data suggest that, in patients with CAD, other factors beyond hydraulic effects of epicardial coronary stenosis, could modulate rMBF regulation in fact: 1) myocardium perfused by angiographically normal coronary artery shows reduced values of both resting rMBF and coronary reserve
