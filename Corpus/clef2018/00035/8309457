Clinical applications compared in implantology. On the basis of their own experience and of orientation reported by literature, the authors display how important it is for professional men who practise implantology or who approach it, to have the possibility of knowing several implantologic systems. Indeed, what we want to demonstrate is, that in different situations of edentulous, in relation to the quantity and the quality of the available bones, to the gnotologic situation and to the aesthetic functional result they aim to, corresponds the choice of one or several implantologic systems. In that sense the basic research occupies a role of vital importance, because only through the knowledge of chemical, chemical-physical and biomechanical characteristics it is possible to recognize some essential chemical entities for an implantologic approach. Thus the several diagnostic instrumental means available enable the surgeon to make an exact clinical diagnosis. The TAC, in this case, assumes a determinant role, because, in addition to supplying exact dimensional and qualitative informations, also occupies an important medico-legal aspect. The resolution of some forms of edentulous programmed like that, will subsequently be illustrated. Finally, a control hypothesis is proposed for the rearrangement, of peri-implant bone. On this account, the SPECT (single photon emission computerized tomography), through a semi-quantitative research, could provide some specific indications about the osteotropic implantation activity.
