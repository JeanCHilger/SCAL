123I-labelled BMIPP fatty acid myocardial scintigraphy in patients with hypertropic cardiomyopathy: SPECT comparison with stress 201Tl. 123I-labelled 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed in 17 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and was compared with 201Tl exercise stress myocardial perfusion SPECT images. Fourteen patients showed asymmetrical hypertrophy, and three demonstrated apical hypertrophy. SPECT was performed 20 min and 3 h after injection of 111 MBq 123I-BMIPP at rest. Exercise stress 201Tl SPECT was performed at 10 min and 3 h after injection and was compared with BMIPP imaging. In 13 patients BMIPP accumulation in the hypertrophied area in the 20 min image was lower than that of 3 h 201Tl uptake. Interestingly, six patients demonstrated 201Tl redistribution in the region where the uncoupling of BMIPP uptake at 20 min and 201Tl accumulation at 3 h after exercise was observed. These findings suggest that impaired fatty acid metabolism or utilization in hypertrophic myocardium and ischaemia or impaired coronary flow reserve may be one of the causes of the abnormality of fatty acid accumulation.
