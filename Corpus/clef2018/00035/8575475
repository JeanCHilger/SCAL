Changes in cerebral blood flow induced by balloon test occlusion of the internal carotid artery under hypotension. Balloon test occlusion (BTO) of the internal carotid artery (ICA) combined with cerebral blood flow (CBF) study has proved to be a sensitive test for prediction of the outcome of permanent vessel occlusion. In this study, we evaluated the acute changes in regional CBF during BTO under hypotension in order to examine the possible risk of cerebral ischaemia after surgical treatment. Eleven patients in whom surgical carotid sacrifice was planned underwent BTO combined with CBF studies using technetium-99m hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime single-photon emission tomography under hypotension by decreasing the systemic blood pressure by about 50 mm Hg using a ganglion blocking agent. All patients showed a mild to severe decrease in CBF in the ipsilateral ICA territory relative to the contralateral side. A decrease in CBF of greater than 20% was observed in nine patients (82%), and two of them showed a decrease exceeding 40%. However, no ischaemic symptoms were demonstrated during scanning with hypotensive BTO. Our results suggest that in many patients with negative normotensive BTO, a considerable reduction in CBF would occur during hypotension. This procedure may predict a possible risk of hypotensive accident during and/or after surgery.
