Cloning of chalcone-flavanone isomerase cDNA from Pueraria lobata and its overexpression in Escherichia coli. Chalcone-flavanone isomerase (CHI) cDNA was isolated from Pueraria lobata by combination of cDNA library screening using Phaseolus vulgaris CHI cDNA as a probe and polymerase chain reaction techniques. Analysis of nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA revealed a 675-bp open reading frame encoding a 225-amino-acid polypeptide with a molecular weight of 23,803 Da. The CHI cDNA coding region was cloned into pET-3d expression vector and successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells as active CHI enzyme. The recombinant CHI was then purified to apparent homogeneity by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. Replacement of Cys-119 with Ala was carried out by site-directed mutagenesis and the result that the mutant CHI showed CHI enzyme activity confirmed that Cys-119 is not involved in the CHI catalytic active site.
