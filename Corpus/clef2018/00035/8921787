Assessment of blood flow distal to coronary artery stenoses. Correlations between myocardial positron emission tomography and poststenotic intracoronary Doppler flow reserve. Previous studies have correlated quantitative coronary angiographic stenosis severity with positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion and proximal measurements of intracoronary flow velocities in normal and diseased coronary arteries. The aim of this study was to correlate regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) derived from [15O]H2O PET with directly measured poststenotic intracoronary Doppler flow velocity data acquired under basal conditions and dipyridamole-induced hyperemia.Eleven consecutive patients 53 +/- 13 years old with ischemic chest pain and isolated proximal left coronary artery stenoses (left anterior descending, 9 left circumflex, 2Intracoronary Doppler flow velocities acquired distal to isolated left coronary artery stenoses correlated with [15O]H2O PET regional myocardial perfusion and are useful for assessment of the physiological significance of coronary stenoses in humans.
