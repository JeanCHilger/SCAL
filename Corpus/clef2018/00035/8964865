Ethanol impairs insulin-mediated glucose uptake by an indirect mechanism. The effect of ethanol (ETOH) on muscle metabolism was assessed in both normal (NC) and noninsulin-dependent (NIDDM) subjects in the basal state and during isoglycemic hyperinsulinemia (450 pmol/L) clamp studies carried out either with systemic (NC, n = 5 NIDDM, n = 5) or intrabrachially (NC, n = 5
