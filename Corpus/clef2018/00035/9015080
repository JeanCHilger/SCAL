Brain tumors: detection with C-11 choline PET. To evaluate the effectiveness of positron emission tomography (PET) with carbon-11 choline in brain tumor imaging.A rat glioma cell line (C6) was incubated with C-14 choline the time course of uptake and metabolism was determined in vitro. C-11 choline was injected intravenously in tumor-bearing ratsC-14 choline was metabolized to phosphoryl choline in glioma cells. The uptake of C-11 choline by glioblastoma cells was three to four times higher than that in the rat brain. All brain tumors took up more C-11 choline than did normal brain thus, brain tumors that were not treated, as well as those that were treated with surgery or radiation therapy, were depicted. The tumor-normal brain uptake ratio of C-11 choline in brain tumor did not correlate with the O-15 water regional blood flow in the corresponding area.C-11 choline PET can depict brain tumors effectively. This method was clinically useful in patients who had undergone surgery.
