Clinical validation of three-dimensional color-modulated displays of myocardial perfusion. Two-dimensional polar maps have been validated previously with coronary arteriography for determining vascular involvement of defects from a patient's myocardial perfusion distributions with and without quantification. The purpose of this study was to validate previously developed three-dimensional color-modulated surface displays representing myocardial perfusion.The validation consisted of comparing the agreement between the three-dimensional displays and two-dimensional polar maps in localizing perfusion defects to vascular territories in 30 patients (16 men/14 women) who underwent both a 1-day rest/stress exercise 99mTc-labeled sestamibi study and coronary arteriography. Reading by two experts was used to identify the size and location of quantified defects and corresponding areas of reversibility seen in the polar maps and, on a separate day, in the three-dimensional displays. Agreement between the two-dimensional polar maps and the three-dimensional displays resulted in identical percentages for the localization of both defects and reversibilities: left anterior descending coronary artery, 87% (26/30) left circumflex coronary artery, 97% (29/30)These results show that the color-modulated three-dimensional displays are at least as good as the CEqual polar maps in localizing a perfusion defect and its reversibility to angiographically defined vascular territories and thus could be used in the routine clinical evaluation of myocardial perfusion.
