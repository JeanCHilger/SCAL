Prognostic evaluation of patients after myocardial infarction: incremental value of sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography and echocardiography. This study compares the prognostic value of 99mTc-labeled methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging, echocardiography, and other clinical and laboratory prognostic factors in the long-term risk stratification of patients with stable uncomplicated infarcts.Ninety-one consecutive patients affected by a first myocardial infarction without serious complications were enrolled. After at least 3 months from the infarction, they were submitted to stress-rest MIBI SPECT and rest echocardiography. Eighty-six patients completed a follow-up of at least 4 years (range 48 to 72 months mean 55 months). By univariate (log-rank test) and multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards model), the main clinical, electrocardiographic, scintigraphic, and echocardiographic findings were evaluated and correlated statistically with the incidence of ensuing cardiac events. Twenty-five patients had cardiac events during the follow-up (four cardiac deaths, four myocardial infarctions, and 17 cases of unstable angina). At the multivariate analysis, the presence of reversible defects on MIBI SPECT (p = 0.008 and relative risk [RR] = 7.09), the wall motion score index, and the ejection fraction at echocardiography (respectively, p = 0.010, RR = 3.67, p = 0.036, and RR = 3.12), and stress angina (p = 0.007 and RR = 3.40) were significant and independent prognostic factors.In our long-term follow-up, MIBI SPECT and echocardiography appeared to be significant and independent prognostic tools in the risk stratification of patients with stable, uncomplicated infarcts, furnishing complementary information. The reversibility of MIBI defects appeared the best indicator for a bad prognosis.
