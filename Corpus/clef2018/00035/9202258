Cerebral arteriovenous oxygen difference: a predictor of cerebral infarction and outcome in patients with severe head injury. Jugular bulb oxygen monitoring can be used to estimate the adequacy of cerebral blood flow to support cerebral metabolism after severe head injury. In the present study, the authors studied the cerebral arteriovenous oxygen difference (AVDO[2]) before and after treatment in 32 head-injured patients (Glasgow Coma Scale scores < or = 8) to examine the relationships among AVDO and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), delayed cerebral infarction, and outcome. Fifteen patients (Group A) underwent craniotomy for hematoma evacuation and 17 (Group B) received mannitol for sustained intracranial hypertension (intracranial pressure > 20 mm Hg, > 10 minutes). Radiographic evidence of delayed cerebral infarction was observed in 14 patients. Overall, 17 patients died or were severely disabled. Cerebral AVDO(2) was elevated before craniotomy or mannitol administration the mean AVDO(2) for all patients before treatment was 8.6 +/- 1.8 vol%. Following craniotomy or mannitol administration, the AVDO(2) decreased in 27 patients and increased in five patients (mean AVDO(2) 6.2 +/- 2.1 vol% in all patients
