The role of the electroencephalogram in the diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer type: an attempt at technology assessment. In a first attempt at technology assessment of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in the diagnosis of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), three conclusions were reached: notwithstanding the well defined clinical criteria, there remains a need for a laboratory technique to confirm the diagnosis since a 100% accuracy cannot be obtained by clinical methods only although the EEG has a high sensitivity in separating AD patients from normal controls, the sensitivity of the EEG is at present not satisfactory when studying populations with a low prevalence of AD patients
