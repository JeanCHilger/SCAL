In vivo radiotracers for vesicular neurotransmitter transporters. The vesicular monoamine transporter is a specific presynaptic protein involved in the transport of monoamines from the cytosol to storage vesicles of monoaminergic nerve terminals. Recently, radioligands for this transporter have been developed and utilized for in vivo positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging of monoaminergic nerve terminals in the human brain. In this review, the characteristics of vesicular transport and storage that provided the impetus for development of these radioligands are presented and discussed.
