The influence of lifestyle and diet on the lipoprotein profile of border collies. Plasma lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were determined in two groups of Border Collies, one actively working and the other pets. Baseline concentrations of total, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were higher, and HDL triglyceride concentrations lower in the pet dogs. Lifestyle of the dogs was assessed by questionnaire completed by the owners. Measurement of exercise was made by visual observation and using a Caltrac activity monitor. The working dogs were a homogenous group with respect to lifestyle and diet, but the pet dogs showed differences in lipoprotein profile relating to housing, dietary fat and exercise intensity. Two diets with different levels of dietary fat (13 and 20 per cent dry weight) were given for two months each. After two months on either of the diets the cholesterol concentration of the working dogs increased and HDL triglyceride concentration decreased, and there were no significant differences between the groups, but very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride increased significantly in the less active pet dogs.
