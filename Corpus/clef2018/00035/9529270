Positron emission tomography analysis of [1-(11)C] acetate kinetics in short-term hibernating myocardium. Modeling of the time-[1-(11)C]acetate activity curve assumes a constant concentration of labeled tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and associated metabolites, such as glutamate and aspartate, which may, however, decrease in short-term hibernating myocardium.In 12 anesthetized pigs, [1-(11)C]acetate was injected as a bolus into the cannulated left anterior descending coronary artery during normoperfusion, inotropic stimulation, and early (5 to 45 minutes) and prolonged ischemia (60 to 90 minutes). Regional myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2, microliters per minute per gram) was measured, and the absence of necrosis was verified by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Inotropic stimulation increased MVO2 from 52.5+/-7.4 to 195.4+/-36.2 (mean+/-SD) and the rate constant (kmono, minutes[-1]) of [1-(11)C]acetate clearance from 0.094+/-0.018 to 0.322+/-0.076. During early ischemia, MVO2 and kmono were decreased to 24.3+/-8.5 and 0.061+/-0.011, respectively. Kmono closely correlated to MVO2 during normoperfusion, inotropic stimulation, and early ischemia. In short-term hibernating myocardium, however, at an unchanged MVO2, kmono increased toward control values (0.080+/-0.014). Myocardial glutamate and aspartate concentrations (biopsies) decreased to 47+/-26% and 77+/-18% the peak count rate decreased to 66+/-22% of its respective control value. After correction for the decreases in glutamate and aspartate or in peak count rate, kmono was again decreased (0.050+/-0.016 or 0.052+/-0.014, respectively), and a close relationship to MVO2 was restored.Kmono correlates to MVO2 in short-term hibernating myocardium when the decreases in aspartate and glutamate or in peak count rate are considered.
