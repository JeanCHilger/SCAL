High-level expression of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibiting peptide, YG-1, as tandem multimers in Escherichia coli. To produce a large quantity of the angiotensin-converting- enzyme(ACE)-inhibiting peptide YG-1, which consists of ten amino acids derived from yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a high-level expression was explored with tandem multimers of the YG-1 gene in Escherichia coli. The genes encoding YG-1 were tandemly multimerized to 9-mers, 18-mers and 27-mers, in which each of the repeating units in the tandem multimers was connected to the neighboring genes by a DNA linker encoding Pro-Gly-Arg for the cleavage of multimers by clostripain. The multimers were cloned into the expression vector pET-21b, and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) with isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside induction. The expressed multimeric peptides encoded by the 9-mer, 18-mer and 27-mer accumulated intracellularly as inclusion bodies and comprised about 67%, 25% and 15% of the total proteins in E. coli respectively. The multimeric peptides expressed as inclusion bodies were cleaved with clostripain, and active monomers were purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. In total, 105 mg pure recombinant YG-1 was obtained from 11 E. coli culture harboring pETYG9 which contained the 9-mer of the YG-1 gene. The recombinant YG-1 was identical to the natural YG-1 in molecular mass, amino acid sequence and ACE-inhibiting activity.
