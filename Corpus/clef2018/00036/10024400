Atypical hepatic hemangiomas with intense arterial enhancement and early fading. Our purpose is to analyze the prevalence and characteristics of the enhancement patterns of hemangiomas.Fifty-five proven hemangiomas studied with a dynamic single-slice T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo sequence (50/13/65 degrees) were retrospectively selected. Fifteen images of the tumor in 5 min were obtained after a bolus of gadolinium. A temporal planar reconstruction image was generated to analyze the dynamic evolution of a line of interest through the tumor.Most hemangiomas (60%) had a typical progressive pattern with hyperintensity on late images. Of these, 34.6% had an intense enhancement pattern with the highest slope close to the arterial or portal phases of perfusion and 25.5% had a less intense enhancement with a more constant rate. In 10.9% of cases, the enhancement was slowly progressive with late isointensity and 7.3% had a very slow progressive pattern with late hypointensity all had a globular peripheral initial enhancement pattern. There were 12 hemangiomas (21.8%) with intense arterial enhancement and early fadingHemangiomas can have early intense enhancement with early fading and diffuse intense enhancement.
