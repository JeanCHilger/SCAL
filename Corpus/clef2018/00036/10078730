Cerebellar reorganization following cortical injury in humans: effects of lesion size and age. The authors investigated chronic cerebellar reorganization following unilateral cortical lesions in children and adults using PET to measure benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) binding with [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) and glucose metabolism with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG).Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) is defined as decreased metabolism or blood flow in the cerebellum contralateral to a cortical insult measured by functional neuroimaging, and is typically seen in adults with large frontal or parietal lesions. The authors previously reported that CCD of glucose metabolism was not as prominent in children as in adults, and that some children showed a paradoxical pattern of increased glucose utilization in cerebellar cortex contralateral to the cortical lesion. The current study investigated whether CCD is associated with alterations in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A))/BZR complex.Patients with frontal lesions alone or with parietal lesions were compared with patients with temporal lesions, which are typically not associated with CCD.Children with lesion onset before 1 year of age showed significantly higher glucose utilization in contralateral posterior quadrangular and superior semilunar lobules of cerebellar cortex than did adults. Two patterns of change in cerebellar BZR binding were seen in children: 1) Five of 10 children showed increased BZR binding in the dentate nucleus contralateral to the lesion, and 2) the remaining five children showed no increase in dentate nucleus BZR binding but showed increased binding in the lateral lobules of the cerebellar cortex contralateral to the lesion. Adults showed increased binding only in contralateral dentate nucleus and not in cerebellar cortex. The size and severity of the supratentorial lesion, as well as age at the time of injury, were important factors in these findings.Reorganization of GABA-mediated mechanisms and glucose metabolism in cerebellum following cortical injury differs with size of lesion and age at the time of injury.
