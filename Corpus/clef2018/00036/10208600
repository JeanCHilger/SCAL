Opioid receptors in the human cerebellum: evidence from [11C]diprenorphine PET, mRNA expression and autoradiography. Little is known regarding opioid receptors in the human cerebellum. The present [11C]diprenorphine PET study investigated opioid receptor binding in the human cerebellum in vivo, and showed a differential binding level in cerebellar cortex, vermis and dentate nuclei. The additional study in vitro of opioid receptors in human cerebellar cortex and rat brain corroborated the presence of opioidergic mechanisms in the human cerebellum in contrast to the rat. A differential cellular distribution pattern was detected for the three major opioid receptors investigated. For the mu-receptor, and at a lower level for the kappa-receptor, mRNA expression was mainly observed over granule cells. Binding sites were most prominent in the molecular layer. For the delta-receptor no signal was detected. The consideration of cerebellar opioidergic mechanisms and the distribution patterns of the various opioid receptors may promote the understanding of cerebellar function and of opioidergic pharmacology in the human.
