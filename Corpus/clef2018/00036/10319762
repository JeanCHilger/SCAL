Iterative reconstruction based on median root prior in quantification of myocardial blood flow and oxygen metabolism. The aim of this study was to compare reproducibility and accuracy of two reconstruction methods in quantification of myocardial blood flow and oxygen metabolism with 15O-labeled tracers and PET. A new iterative Bayesian reconstruction method based on median root prior (MRP) was compared with filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction method, which is traditionally used for image reconstruction in PET studies.Regional myocardial blood flow (rMBF), oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF) and myocardial metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (rMMRO2) were quantified from images reconstructed in 27 subjects using both MRP and FBP methods. For each subject, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on the lateral, anterior and septal regions on four planes. To test reproducibility, the ROI drawing procedure was repeated. By using two sets of ROIs, variability was evaluated from images reconstructed with the MRP and the FBP methods.Correlation coefficients of mean values of rMBF, rOEF and rMMRO2 were significantly higher in the images reconstructed with the MRP reconstruction method compared with the images reconstructed with the FBP method (rMBF: MRP r = 0.896 versus FBP r = 0.737, P < 0.001 rOEF: 0.915 versus 0.855, P < 0.001The MRP reconstruction method provides higher reproducibility and lower variability in the quantitative myocardial parameters when compared with the FBP method. This study shows that the new MRP reconstruction method improves accuracy and stability of clinical quantification of myocardial blood flow and oxygen metabolism with 15O and PET.
