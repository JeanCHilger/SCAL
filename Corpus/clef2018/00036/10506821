Evaluation of the nature of brain tumors using methods of nuclear medicine. FDG-PET studies permit an assessment of the degree of brain tumour malignancy and detection of tumour recurrence. MIBI-SPECT also affords promising results in this respect. In this work, the diagnostic value of MIBI-SPECT was compared with that of FDG-PET for the determination of primary brain tumours malignancy and the detection of recurrent brain tumours. SPECT and PET examination were carried out within a week in 14 patients (12 males, 2 females, mean age: 40 years, range 16-61 years) with brain tumours. Seven patients had a primary tumour, and in a further 7 MRI or the clinical signs and symptoms let to a suspicion of tumour recurrence. All tumours were verified histologically to be gliomas of grades I-IV. The SPECT and PET images were analysed visually and semiquantitatively. In 3 of the investigated 7 primary glioma patients, there was a visibly enhanced MIBI-positive cases, only one had an increased FDG uptake. In 4 of the 7 tumour recurrence cases, either the MIBI or the FDG uptake was visibly increased. All of these were histologically high-grade gliomas. In the remaining low grade tumours (primary of recurrent), neither MIBI nor FDG revealed a pathologically increased uptake. The intensity of radiopharmaceutical uptake at the site of the tumours was visually and semiquantitatively higher for MIBI that for FDG. It is concluded that MIBI-SPECT is a valuable and simple tool for evaluation of the biological characteristics of brain tumours, showing increased uptake of MIBI according to the malignancy and tumour recurrence of brain tumours.
