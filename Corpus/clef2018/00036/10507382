A positron emission tomography study of cerebrovascular reserve before and after shunt surgery in patients with idiopathic chronic hydrocephalus. In this study the authors use positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) in chronic hydrocephalus.Ten patients whose mean age was 67 +/- 10 years (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) were compared with 10 healthy volunteers who were 25 +/- 3 years of age. Global CBF and CVR were determined using (15)O-H2O and PET prior to shunt placement and 7 days and 7 months thereafter. The CVR was measured using 1 g acetazolamide. Neurological status was assessed based on a score assigned according to the methods of Stein and Langfitt. Seven months after shunt placement, five patients showed clinical improvement (Group A) and five did not (Group B). The average global CBF before shunt deployment was significantly reduced in comparison with the control group (40 +/- 8 compared with 61 +/- 7 ml/100 ml/minute mean +/- SD, p < 0.01). In Group A the CBF values were significantly lower than in Group B (36 +/- 7 compared with 44 +/- 8 ml/100 ml/minuteThe preliminary results indicate that a reduced baseline CBF before surgery does not indicate a poor prognosis. Baseline CBF before shunt placement and preoperative CVR are not predictive of clinical outcome. A decrease in the CVR early after shunt placement, however, is related to poor late clinical outcome, whereas early improvement in the CVR after shunt placement indicates a good prognosis.
