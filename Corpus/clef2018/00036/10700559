Functional brain areas used for the lifting of objects using a precision grip: a PET study. Positron emission tomography (PET) was performed in 10 normal volunteers to investigate regional cortical and subcortical activation induced by the lifting of an object repetitively using a precision grip between the index finger and thumb. Data were obtained for three object weights (4, 200 and 600 g) and a resting condition. Grip and lift forces on a similar object and the activity of selected muscles in the hand, arm and shoulder were also recorded in separate lifting trials. A comparison between all movement conditions and the resting condition revealed significant activation of the primary motor (M1), primary sensory (S1), dorso-caudal premotor (PM), caudal supplementary motor (SMA) and cingulate motor (CMA) cortices contralateral to the hand used. On the ipsilateral side, activation of the M1, caudal SMA and inferior parietal cortex (BA 40) was also found. In the subcortical areas, the bilateral hemispheres and right vermis of the cerebellum, left basal ganglia and thalamus were activated. Behavioral adaptation to a heavier object weight was revealed in a nearly proportional increase of both grip and lift forces, prolonged force application period and a higher level of hand and arm muscle activities. An increase in the rCBF associated with these changes was noted in several cortical and subcortical areas. However, consistent object weight-dependent activation was observed only in the M1/S1 contralateral to the hand used.
