Improvement in left ventricular function in response to carvedilol is accompanied by attenuation of neurohumoral activation in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. We sought to evaluate whether improvement in ejection fraction (EF) with carvedilol therapy is accompanied by improvement in neurohumoral factors.Forty-two patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were given carvedilol for 3 to 5 months. Changes in EF, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and norepinephrine levels were determined. Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) images were also obtained before and after carvedilol therapy. Myocardial uptake of MIBG was calculated as the heart to mediastinal activity ratio (H/M). Storage and release of MIBG was calculated as percent myocardial MIBG washout rate (WR). We divided patients into 2 groups: 27 responders whose EF increased by more than 5% and 15 nonresponders whose EF increased by 5% or less. EF of responders increased by 15 +/- 5% and that of nonresponders by 1 +/- 4%. Although MIBG image-derived indexes of nonresponders remained unchanged, the delayed H/M (1.91 +/- 0.34 v 2.24 +/- 0.53, P < .01) and WR (49 +/- 11 v 39 +/- 9%, P < .01) of responders improved, respectively. The plasma ANP (51 +/- 50 v 27 +/- 24 pg/mL, P < .01) and BNP (194 +/- 197 v 49 +/- 62 pg/mL, P < .01) levels of responders decreased. The degree of changes in the plasma BNP level correlated with changes in EF (r = -.698, P < .01).The improvement in EF with carvedilol therapy was proved to be accompanied by an improvement in neurohumoral factors.
