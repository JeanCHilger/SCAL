Results and potential of somatostatin receptor imaging in gastroenteropancreatic tract tumours. Somatostatin receptor imaging with 111In-pentetreotide is widely accepted as an essential step in the management of patients affected by neuroendocrine tumours of the gastro-entero-pancreatic tract. Many data are already available on the high sensitivity of this technique.We present a review of the published data together with the results of a study involving 253 patients submitted to somatostatin receptor imaging in three Italian hospitals. The patients were divided into two groups treated with different acquisition and processing protocols.The overall sensitivity was as high as (169/176) 96% in both groups, while the specificity was higher in the group in which semi-quantitative evaluation of somatostatin receptor density was performed: (23/26) 88% vs (39/51) 76%. The use of this method is recommended to increase the specificity of 111In-pentetreotide imaging.Our results with somatostatin receptor imaging in neuroendocrine tumours of the gastro-entero-pancreatic tract demonstrate that all figures of merit are excellent when imaging is accurately performed and analysed by experienced operators.
