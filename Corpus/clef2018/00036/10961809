Use of a coincidence gamma camera to detect primary tumor with 18fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose in cervical lymph node metastases from an unknown origin. This study was performed to evaluate the ability of a dual-head gamma camera with 18fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose coincidence detection emission tomography (FDG-CDET) to detect primary tumors in patients with cervical lymph node metastases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma from an unknown origin. From 60 patients with untreated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, we selected 4 in whom no evidence of the primary's origin was found by the conventional methods used for the evaluation of head and neck tumors. In addition to the panendoscopy, chest radiography, a computed tomography (CT) scan, and FDG-CDET were performed. Both FDG-CDET and the CT scan located cervical lymph node metastases. In addition, FDG-CDET located the primary tumor in 3 of the 4 patients, and the tumors were confirmed with histopathologic findings. In contrast, the CT scan detected the primary tumor in none of them. FDG tomography performed on a coincidence gamma camera appears to be a successful new tool in detecting occult primary tumors in head and neck carcinoma, and is useful in guiding endoscopic biopsies. It has, further, the important potential ability to detect distant metastases on whole body images.
