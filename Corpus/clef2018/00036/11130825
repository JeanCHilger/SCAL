Comparison of 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography in detection of cervical lymph node metastases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Neck lymph nodes (LNs) from 18 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) were evaluated with 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Eighteen NPC patients underwent head and neck FDG-PET and computed tomography (CT) for detection of suspected neck LN metastases. For final diagnosis, biopsies were taken from neck LNs with discordant findings between FDG-PET and CT. Meanwhile, standard uptake values (SUVs) of the FDG-PET images were calculated to differentiate metastatic LNs from benign LNs. A total of 90 neck LNs found on either FDG-PET or CT were evaluated. In addition to 27 concordant positive results and 42 concordant negative LN results, biopsy findings revealed 11 metastatic LNs that were detected by FDG-PET but not by CT. However, the SUVs of the 11 metastatic LNs and 7 benign LNs were not significantly different. The CT scanning showed positive findings for I metastatic LN with negative FDG-PET findings. In addition, the tumor stage was upgraded in 5 patients on the basis of FDG-PET findings. In comparison with CT, FDG-PET has a higher potential for detecting neck LN metastases of NPC and assessing NPC tumor stage.
