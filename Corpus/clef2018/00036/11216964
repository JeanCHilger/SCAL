Myocardial perfusion imaging findings and the role of adenosine in the warm-up angina phenomenon. This study examined the roles of myocardial perfusion and adenosine in warm-up angina.In warm-up angina, neither the role of an adenosine-mediated mechanism, as is found in experimental ischemic preconditioning, nor of increased myocardial perfusion is well defined.In substudy A, a single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-thallium-201 exercise test was performed by 12 subjects with ischemic heart disease on three occasions one week apart. The third test was preceded by a warm-up test. The extent of the thallium deficit and its intensity on the third test were compared with the baseline tests controlling for the heart rate-systolic blood pressure product (RPP) at thallium injection. In substudy B, 12 similar subjects did two successive exercise tests at two separate sessions and received the adenosine antagonist, aminophylline (intravenous 5 mg/kg bolus and 0.9 mg/kg/h infusion) at one session, and equivalent saline at the other session. Change in ischemic threshold (RPP at 1 mm ST segment depression) and in maximum ST depression adjusted for RPP were analyzed.In substudy A, despite a significant attenuation of electrocardiogram indexes of myocardial ischemia between the baseline and third (warmed-up) tests, the thallium extent deficits (20.8 +/- 15.1% and 16.8 +/- 12.4%) and intensity deficits (41.2 +/- 12.6% and 39.3 +/- 12.6%) did not differ significantly. In substudy B, the increase in ischemic threshold on re-exercise was unaffected by aminophylline. Adjusted maximum ST depression even decreased to a greater extent on re-exercise with aminophylline (by 51 +/- 21%) than with saline (by 32 +/- 19%) (p = 0.012).While warm-up angina is associated with a significant attenuation of exercise electrocardiogram indexes of ischemia, it is unaccompanied by significant changes in SPECT perfusion and does not appear to be mediated by an adenosine-dependent mechanism since it is not blocked by aminophylline. Thus, its mechanism, which appears distinct from experimental ischemic preconditioning, remains unidentified.
