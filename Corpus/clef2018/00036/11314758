99Tc(m) labelled HL91 versus computed tomography and biopsy for the visualization of tumour recurrence of squamous head and neck carcinoma. This phase I pilot study reports on (1) the safety and feasibility of 99Tc(m)-HL91, an amine oxime core radioligand that has shown oxygen dependent binding, and imaging and (2) its usefulness for the visualization of local tumour recurrence of a biopsy proven squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) as compared to spiral computed tomogaphy (CT) and biopsy. Nine men (mean age 33 years, range 34-74 years) were prospectively included. For safety measurements, vital signs were recorded and serum chemical analysis carried out, with a complete blood cell count and urine analysis, and an ECG was performed prior to injection of 99Tc(m)-HL91 and repeated during the investigation. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans of the head and neck, and of a standard, were performed at 2 h and 4 h post-injection of 740 MBq 99Tc(m)-HL91. Tumour-to-normal tissue background (T/N) ratios and percentage uptake were measured for all 99Tc(m)-HL91 scans. Spiral CT scans were obtained using a Somaton 4+ Siemens scanner within 1 week from the 99Tc(m)-HL91 scans. Based on CT and the 99Tc(m)-HL91 scan findings guided biopsies were performed. No adverse or subjective side effects were noticed. Vital signs, ECG findings, clinical laboratory, blood and urine assays remained stable in all patients. Spiral CT suggested local recurrence in 5/9 patients accompanied by nodal involvement in three, all of which proved positive on biopsy. 99Tc(m)-HL91 scintigraphy was false positive in one patient and true positive (TP) in 3/5 local recurrences and two out of three sites of lymph node involvement depicted by spiral CT. The mean T/N ratios at 2 h and 4 h in TPs were 1.28 (range 1.1-1.66) and 1.40 (range 1.0-1.6), respectively. The corresponding absolute percentages of 99Tc(m)-HL91 lesional uptake at 2 h and 4 h were mu = 0.05% (SD = 0.03%) and mu = 0.048% (SD = 0.035%). The findings suggest 99Tc(m)-HL91 is a safe radioligand and that metabolic binding in a large fraction but not all of local SCCHN recurrences may be expected. The inference that tumour 99Tc(m)-HL91 avidity could be a non-invasive measure of tumour hypoxia deserves however independent confirmation with needle oximetry.
