Role of nuclear medicine in the diagnosis and therapy of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) originates in the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid, secreting both calcitonin and CEA. Genetic and biochemical testing allow early pre-clinical identification of familial forms. Sporadic MTC usually presents as a solitary palpable thyroid nodule and in most cases the definitive diagnosis is established only at the time of surgery. Nuclear medicine procedures, which play a minor role in the preoperative evaluation of MTC, are essential in postoperative follow-up to detect residual and/or recurrent tumor. A number of radiopharmaceuticals are able to visualize MTC lesions with considerable advantages in diagnosis and prognosis, some of them having also a therapeutic role. Among them, 99mTc[V]DMSA shows the highest diagnostic sensitivity and is considered by many authors the radiopharmaceutical of choice in the postoperative work-up of MTC. Radioiodinated MIBG, in spite of its high specificity has a poor sensitivity (30%) however it is useful for the identification of pheochromocytoma and, in patients showing MIBG uptake in tumoral lesions, high activities of 131I-MIBG may be used for therapy. 111In labeled octreotide detects lesions which express somatostatin receptors
