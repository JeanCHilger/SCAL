Treatment of metastatic carcinoid tumours, phaeochromocytoma, paraganglioma and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid with (131)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine [(131)I-mIBG]. Meta-iodo-benzyl-guanidine labelled with 131-iodine [(131)I-mIBG] has been used extensively for imaging tumours originating from the neural crest but experience with its therapeutic use is limited, particularly for non-catecholamine secreting tumours. In order to assess the therapeutic response and potential adverse effects of the therapeutic administration of (131)I-mIBG, we have reviewed all patients who had received this form of treatment in our department.Retrospective analysis of the case notes of patients with neuroendocrine tumours who received treatment with (131)I-mIBG and were followed-up according to a defined protocol in a given time frame.Thirty-seven patients (18 with metastatic carcinoid tumours, 8 metastatic phaeochromocytoma, 7 metastatic paraganglioma and 4 metastatic medullary carcinoma of the thyroid) treated with (131)I-mIBG over a 15-year period were included in this analysis.The symptomatic, hormonal and tumoural responses before and after (131)I-mIBG therapy over a median follow-up duration of 32 months (range 5-180 months) were recorded. Of the 37 patients (22 males median age 51 years, range 18-81 years), 15 were treated with (131)I-mIBG alone whereas the other 22 received additional therapy.A total of 116 therapeutic (131)I-mIBG doses were administered [mean cumulative dose 592 mCi (21.9 GBq) range 200-1592 mCi (7.4-58.9 GBq)]. None of the patients showed a complete tumour response. However, 82% of patients treated with (131)I-mIBG alone and 84% who received additional therapy showed stable disease over the period of follow-up. Overall survival during the period of the study was 71%. The overall 5-year survival rate was 85% (95% confidence interval, 72-99%) for all patients and 78% (95% confidence interval, 55-100%) for the carcinoid group alone, according to Kaplan-Meier analysis. Symptomatic control was achieved in all the patients treated with (131)I-mIBG alone, and in 72% of those receiving additional therapy. Hormonal control was noted in 50% and 57% of patients, respectively. (131)I-mIBG therapy was safe and well tolerated. Serious side-effects necessitating the termination of (131)I-mIBG therapy were seen in only 2 of our patients.(131)I-mIBG therapy produces symptomatic and hormonal improvement and moderate tumour regression/stabilization in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumours with minimal adverse effects. It may be a valuable alternative or additional therapeutic option to the currently available conventional treatment modalities.
