The changing vasculo-cardiology in the midst of revolution of modern science and technology. Modern revolution of science and technology exerts profound and overall influences on the basic research, diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The application of molecular biology has been revealing the nature of cause, pathogenic mechanism, physiology and pathology of cardiovascular diseases, while gene therapy is expected to yield a radical cure of these diseases. The products of modern technology including computerized tomography, computer enhanced digital angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonic-cardiography, positron emission tomography, single photon emission computerized tomography, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and other techniques, laser, artificial pacemaker, artificial heart etc. have greatly improved the capacity of diagnosis and therapy of cardiovascular diseases. Now the studies probe not only the levels of organ and cell, but also the levels of protein, nucleic acid and gene. The diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases is focussed on, besides the traditional "four diagnostic methods", i.e. inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation, precise diagnosis with the help of various advanced medical equipments. As to the treatment, in addition to traditional drugs and surgical operations, new therapeutic methods such as gene therapy and interventional measures are also applied.
