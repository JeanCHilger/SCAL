Combined Analysis of CSF Tau Levels and [(123)I]Iodoamphetamine SPECT in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Implications for a Novel Predictor of Alzheimer's Disease. The aim of this study was to establish an objective and reliable index to predict the development of Alzheimer's disease in a large pool of elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment.Twenty-three patients with probable Alzheimer's disease, 22 patients with mild cognitive impairment who eventually developed Alzheimer's disease, eight patients with mild cognitive impairment who did not develop dementia, and 19 cognitively normal subjects were included in the study. The authors constructed a new diagnostic index, the CSF-CBF index, based on CSF tau levels divided by regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the posterior cingulate cortex.Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that applying a cutoff value for the CSF-CBF index of 296.0 achieved a sensitivity of 88.5% and a specificity of 90.0% in discriminating mild cognitive impairment that progressed to Alzheimer's disease from mild cognitive impairment that did not progress to Alzheimer's disease.The CSF-CBF index is useful in predicting Alzheimer's disease in subjects with mild cognitive impairment.
