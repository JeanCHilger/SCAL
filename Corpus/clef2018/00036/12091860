Prevalence and correlates of household exposures to tobacco smoke and pets in children with asthma. To examine the prevalence rates of household smoking and ownership of a furred or feathered pet, the intercorrelation of these home environment measures, and their association with sociodemographic, family, and child asthma variables.Children with asthma (n = 152, aged 7-18 years) with asthma and their primary parent were evaluated through the use of reliable and valid questionnaires focusing on exposure to household smoke and furred or feathered pets as well as sociodemographic, family, and asthma variables.Prevalence of household smoking and pet ownership were high and comparable to normal levels in the US population. Smoking and pet ownership were not correlated with each other or with asthma medication adherence. Sociodemographic, family, and asthma variables showed distinct patterns of correlation with smoking and pet status. Household smoking was associated with poorer family resources and greater stress pet ownership was associated with greater resources.Smoke exposure and pet ownership are not related to one another in children with asthma and will require independent counseling strategies because they relate in different and opposite ways to socioeconomic status.
