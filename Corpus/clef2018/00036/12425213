Bioterrorism: the role of veterinarians in detection and prevention. The fear of terrorist attacks has increased since the events of 11 September 2001 in New York. In the weeks following the terrorist attack, letters containing anthrax spores were received at various locations in the USA. This shows that bioterrorism is possible and that is necessary to be prepared for the potential release of biological agents. Such agents can be distributed not only via the air and drinking water but also via household pets. The aim of terrorist attacks, namely, the disruption of society and daily life, can be achieved in three ways, ways which are of importance to practising veterinarians, namely, via pets, via contamination of pet foods of animal origin, and by the spread of infectious animal diseases that have far-reaching economic consequences. These ways are discussed in this article, together with possible ways in which veterinarians can act to diminish the consequences of such an event.
