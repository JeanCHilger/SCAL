Impaired coronary flow reserve in patients with non-ischemic heart failure. Coronary flow reserve (CFR) is impaired not only in ischemic heart disease, but also in cardiac diseases that may or may not course with heart failure. The aim of the present study was to determine if the severity of heart failure can influence CFR impairment.Forty patients with non-ischemic heart disease and heart failure were studied 41 times. Four groups were established: 1. 10 patients in functional class III-IV 2. 10 patients in functional class II not taking beta-blockersMBF and CFR were significantly higher in group 4 (1.95 0.58 and 2.40 0.95 ml/min/g) than in group 1 (1.02 0.52 and 1.46 0.48 ml/min/g). CFR tended to be higher in groups 2 (1.73 0.72), and 3 (1.89 0.75) vs group 1. No significant correlation was found between CFR and the following variables: age, systolic blood pressure, ventricular mass index, ventricular volume indexes, and ejection fraction.Coronary microvascular function is impaired in non-ischemic heart failure, and the impairment is related to functional class, regardless of the underlying responsible heart disease.
