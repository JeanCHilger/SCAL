Myocardial perfusion abnormalities in patients with active acromegaly. Cardiomyopathy is often seen in patients with a long history of acromegaly. In order to screen for perfusion abnormalities, patients with active acromegaly without evidence for coronary heart disease were examined by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The study included a group of 11 strictly selected patients with active acromegaly (7 males and 4 females age 51 +/- 12 y [mean +/- S.D.]) with elevated age-adjusted IGF-I levels (IGF-I 569 +/- 193 micro g/l
