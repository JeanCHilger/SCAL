Evolution of systolic function and myocardial perfusion, evaluated by gated-SPECT, in the first year after acute myocardial infarction. Systolic function and myocardial perfusion are evaluated before hospital discharge and can change during follow-up. The purpose of this study was to evaluate these parameters by gated-SPECT in the first year after acute myocardial infarction.We studied 74 consecutive patients with a first uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction (49 infero-lateral and 25 anterior) by stress-rest 99mTc-tetrofosmin and rest-gated-SPECT before hospital discharge (6-8 days after admission) and one year after myocardial infarction.The ejection fraction (EF) increased > 5% in 51% of infero-lateral infarcts and 28% of non-revascularized anterior infarcts. EF increased significantly (48.4 8% to 54.6 8.7% p < 0.0001, mean difference: 6.2Left ventricular systolic function can change during the first year of evolution, a significant improvement being seen in infero-lateral infarctions. The ejection fraction increased > 5% in half of these patients, as opposed to only a quarter of anterior infarctions. This improvement was associated to increased myocardial perfusion at rest.
