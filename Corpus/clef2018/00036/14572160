Functional genomics and radioisotope-based imaging procedures. After the sequencing of the human genome has been completed, non-invasive imaging studies are needed to assess the function of new genes in living organisms. The evaluation of genetically manipulated animals or new designed biomolecules will require a thorough understanding of physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology, and the experimental approaches will involve many new technologies including in vivo imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). Nuclear medicine procedures may be applied for the determination of gene function and regulation using established and new tracers or using in vivo reporter genes such as enzymes, receptors, antigens or transporters. Pharmacogenomics will identify new surrogate markers for therapy monitoring which may represent potential new tracers for imaging. Also, drug distribution studies for new therapeutic biomolecules are needed at least during preclinical stages of drug development. Clinical gene therapy needs non-invasive tools to evaluate the efficiency of gene transfer. These informations can be used for therapy planning, follow-up studies in treated tumors and as an indicator of prognosis. Therapy planning is performed by the assessment of gene expression for example using radio-labeled specific substrates to determine the activity of suicide enzymes such as the Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase. Follow-up studies with single photon emission tomography or positron emission tomography may be done to evaluate early or late effects of gene therapy on tumor metabolism or proliferation. Finally, new biomolecules will be developed by bioengineering methods which may be used for isotope-based diagnosis and treatment of disease.
