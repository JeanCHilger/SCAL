Dopamine transporter change in drug-naive schizophrenia: an imaging study with 99mTc-TRODAT-1. The aim of this study was to use a specific dopamine transporter (DAT) ligand, 99mTc-TRODAT-1 with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to investigate the densities of DAT in the striatal dopaminergic system in patients with schizophrenia. Striatal DAT uptakes were measured in 12 drug-naive schizophrenic patients and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. The psychometric tools included the Standardized Clinical Assessment for Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Semiquantitative analyses using the ratio of uptake in caudate, putamen, and striatum to occipital lobe, and left-right asymmetry were performed. Decreased TRODAT uptake in the right striatum and increased uptake in the left striatum were found in the schizophrenics. However, there is no overall difference in the average striatum uptake. The right-left asymmetry of the caudate and putamen DAT binding seen in the healthy control group disappeared in the schizophrenia group. The decreased right uptake and increased left uptake in the striatum might lead to the lack of right-left asymmetry in neuroleptic-nai
