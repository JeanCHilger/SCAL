Automatic detection of the left ventricular myocardium long axis and center in thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography. A new method for centering and reorienting automatically the left ventricle in thallium-201 myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPET) is proposed. The processing involves the following steps: (a) the transverse sections of the left ventricle are segmented, (b) the three-dimensional skeleton of the left ventricle is extracted using tools of mathematical morphology, (c) the skeleton is fitted to a quadratic surface by the least-squares method, (d) the left ventricle is reoriented and centered using the long axis and the coordinates of the centre of the quadratic surface. A series of 30 consecutive exercise and redistribution 201Tl SPET studies were centered and reoriented by two operators twice with this method, and twice manually. There was no significant difference in the mean realignment performed by the automatic and the manual methods while centering differed moderately in some instances. In all cases and for all parameters, the reproducibility of the automatic method was 1.00, while it ranged between 0.74 and 0.98 with the manual centering and reorientation. This automatic approach provides a fast and highly reproducible method for the reconstruction of short- and long-axis sections of the left ventricle in 201Tl SPET.
