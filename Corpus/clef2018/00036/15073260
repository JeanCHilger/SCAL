Proposed addendum to previously published fetal dose estimate tables for 18F-FDG. Placental transfer and fetal dose estimates have been published for women in early pregnancy and at the end of each trimester for a large number of radiopharmaceuticals. For the case of (18)F-FDG, a dose was given with no information about placental transfer of the radiopharmaceutical. Recent publications have reported quantitative values for maternal and fetal uptake of (18)F-FDG in primates and new values for (18)F-FDG kinetics. In this article, these data are applied to give radiation dose estimates for the fetus at all stages of pregnancy for (18)F-FDG. The recommended values are 2.2 x 10(-2) mGy/MBq in early pregnancy, 2.2 x 10(-2) mGy/MBq at 3-mo gestation, 1.7 x 10(-2) mGy/MBq at 6-mo gestation, and 1.7 x 10(-2) mGy/MBq at 9-mo gestation.
