Adenosine myocardial SPECT--its efficacy and safety and correlation with coronary angiogram. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of adenosine Tc99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion study under controlled conditions and to correlate the adenosine Tc99m sestamibi perfusion defects and the coronary angiography in patients investigated for coronary artery disease.This prospective study included 122 consecutive patients who underwent adenosine Tc99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion study. Seventy two patients had coronary angiographic correlation. All the patients who were referred by the cardiologists for stress myocardial perfusion scan who could not be stressed physiologically for one reason or the other were included in the study.Among the coronary angiography group the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of adenosine Tc99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion study for detecting significant coronary obstruction (diameter > or = 50%) were 94.4%, 79%, 85% and 92% respectively. The side effects were transient and required no treatment.We conclude adenosine Tc99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomogram myocardial perfusion study is a reliable test with high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of coronary artery disease.
