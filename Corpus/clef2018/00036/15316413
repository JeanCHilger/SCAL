Does liver-disease aetiology have a role in cerebral blood-flow alterations in liver cirrhosis? Studies using brain-imaging techniques have shown changes in regional blood flow (rCBF) in patients with liver cirrhosis. It remains unknown whether the aetiology of liver disease accounts for these changes.To evaluate whether the aetiology of liver cirrhosis is associated with different patterns of rCBF.A total of 50 patients with end-stage liver disease and no overt encephalopathy were studied. Thirteen age-matched subjects admitted to the neurology department for headache were used as controls. Exclusion criteria were focal brain lesions, severe brain atrophy and any abnormalities found on computed tomography scan suggesting other central nervous system diseases, alcohol intake or use of neuroactive drugs for at least 6 months. rCBF was assessed using single-positron-emission tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HM-PAO) as a tracer in all patients and controls. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis.The liver-disease aetiology was as follows: alcoholic (A) in 19 patients viral (V) (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis D virus, hepatitis C virus) in 14 patientsCerebral blood flow is significantly lower in patients with liver cirrhosis than in controls and, among cirrhotics, it is lower in alcoholic and viral cirrhosis than in cholestatic liver disease. In patients with previous alcohol abuse, cerebral blood flow was significantly more reduced in the frontal and temporal regions compared with patients without previous alcohol abuse.
