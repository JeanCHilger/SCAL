Breast cancer patients' experiences on endocrine therapy: monitoring with a checklist for patients on endocrine therapy (C-PET). Women with hormone responsive breast cancer routinely receive endocrine therapy. There is growing evidence that patients experience significant side effects. Between 1996 and 1998, all patients on endocrine therapy for adjuvant or advanced breast cancer, attending the Edinburgh Breast Unit, were invited to complete a checklist for patients on endocrine therapy. This simple form, designed as a communication aid, was completed by patients before their consultation. 708 patients (age 28-93) completed 1060 forms. These forms were analysed in order to gain a better understanding of the side effects experienced. Most patients were on tamoxifen (n = 524), with 103 on anastrazole and 35 on megestrol acetate. Common symptoms experienced were hot flushes, sweats and weight gain. Symptoms varied according to the patients' ages and the setting in which they received endocrine treatment. Pre-menopausal women were more likely to experience problems with flushes, sweats, weight gain and reduced libido.
