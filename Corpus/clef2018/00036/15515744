Evaluation of myocardial viability following acute myocardial infarction using 201Tl SPECT after thallium-glucose-insulin infusion--comparison with 18F-FDG positron emission tomography. The aim of this study was to evaluate myocardial viability in patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We compared 201Tl SPECT after 201Tl with GIK (10% glucose 250 ml, insulin 5 U and KCl 10 mEq) infusion (GIK-201Tl) with resting 201Tl and 99mTc-pyrophosphate (PYP) dual SPECT, positron emission computed tomography (PET) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in 21 patients with their first AMI, who all underwent successful reperfusion. GIK-201Tl SPECT, 201Tl and 99mTc-PYP dual SPECT were done within 10 days after admission and 18F-FDG-PET was performed at 3 weeks. GIK-201Tl SPECT was obtained after 30 min of GIK-201Tl infusion. 18F-FDG (370 MBq) was injected intravenously after oral glucose (1 g/ kg) loading, and then PET was obtained. PET and SPECT images were divided into 20 segments. Regional tracer uptake was scored using a 4-point scoring system (3 = normal to 0 = defect), and summed to a regional uptake score (RUS). Regional area means the infarcted area in which 99mTc-PYP accumulated. The number of decreased uptake segments (ES) was then determined. The infarcted area was defined as the area of 99mTc-PYP uptake.The ESs for the GIK-201Tl and 18F-FDG-PET images were significantly lower than the number of 99mTc-PYP uptake segments. The RUS for GIK-201Tl was higher than that for resting-201Tl imaging and similar to those for 18F-FDG-PET.In the detection of myocardial viability following AMI, GIK-201Tl imaging is useful with findings similar to those of 18F-FDG-PET.
