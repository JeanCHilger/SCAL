Role of [18F]-dopa-PET imaging in assessing movement disorders. FD-PET has proved to be an extremely useful technique for the noninvasive evaluation of nigrostriatal pathophysiology in patients with PD and other movement disorders. The development of ratio methods for image analysis has greatly reduced the complexity of these PET studies and has facilitated data analysis. With the recent advances in cyclotron targetry and automated synthesis modules FD-PET will soon become an important component of the clinical armamentarium.
