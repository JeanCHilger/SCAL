PET in cardiology. Myocardial perfusion imaging with single-photon emission CT (SPECT) is a key investigation in the work-up of patients with coronary artery disease. PET, however, with inherently better spatial and temporal resolution, offers several advantages over SPECT. The last decade has witnessed extensive application of PET techniques to assess myocardial viability and has provided valuable information important in analyzing the risk: benefit ratio for several therapeutic measures. Recent advances in PET instrumentation and radiopharmaceuticals have generated considerable interest to use PET for evaluating an array of cardiovascular disease.
