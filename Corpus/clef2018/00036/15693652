Applications of fluorodeoxyglucose-PET imaging in the detection of infection and inflammation and other benign disorders. FDG-PET has great potential in the evaluation of a variety of inflammatory and infectious disorders and possibly other benign disorders. FDG-PET is very helpful in the evaluation of chronic osteomyelitis, sarcoidosis, FUO, and differentiating toxoplasmosis from lymphoma in the central nervous system in HIV-positive patients. The assessment of efficacy of FDG-PET in the evaluation of arthroplasty-associated infection, large-vessel vasculitis, and other inflammatory and infectious disorders is ongoing but seems quite promising at this time.
