Phase 2 study of beta-methyl-p-(123I)-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid, a myocardial imaging agent for evaluating myocardial fatty acid metabolism. A phase 2 study of beta-methyl-p-(123I)-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid (123I-BMIPP), a myocardial imaging agent developed for evaluating myocardial fatty acid metabolism, was performed in 197 patients with various heart diseases. The myocardial distribution of 123I-BMIPP did not change from early to late images in 88% of 91 patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), while washout and/or fill-in were observed in 45% of 55 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In comparison with 201Tl in 165 patients with various heart diseases, the decrease in uptake was more profound with BMIPP in 56% and with 201Tl in only 4%. 123I-BMIPP showed more severely decreased uptake in 83% of the patients with subacute myocardial infarction (15 to 30 days after the onset) and in 73% of the patients with HCM. High-quality SPECT images were obtained with 123I-BMIPP in 93% of 194 patients analyzed. However, the image quality in cardiomyopathy was inferior to that in IHD. The optimal injection dose range and standard dose of 123I-BMIPP were considered to be 74-148 MBq and 111 MBq, respectively. These findings suggest that 123I-BMIPP myocardial imaging is safe and useful for evaluating myocardial fatty acid metabolism in various heart diseases.
