Whole body MRI for detecting metastatic bone tumor: comparison with bone scintigrams. To compare the effectiveness of whole body MRI (WB-MRI [magnetic resonance imaging]) and bone scintigram (BS) at detecting bone metastasis.WB-MRI was performed on 16 patients for detecting bone metastasis (6 breast carcinoma, 7 prostatic carcinoma, 1 renal cell carcinoma [RCC], 1 hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], and 1 primary unknown). BS was also performed in all cases. Patients were placed on a table top extender (Philips Medical Systems). The maximal longitudinal field of view (FOV) was 200 cm. At first, the total spine was imaged in the sagittal plane with a three-station approach for two image sets (fast spin-echo [SE] T1-weighted images [T1WI] and short tau inversion recovery [STIR] images). The whole body was then imaged in the coronal plane with a seven-station approach for two image sets (fast field echo [FFE] T1WI and STIR). Total examination time, including patient positioning, was within 40 min. Three independent radiologists interpreted the imaging data.WB-MRI identified 5 cases of 24 lesions as bone metastasis, while BS identified 3 cases of 25 lesions. Concordance between WB-MRI and BS was seen in 3 cases of 22 lesions (81%). For two cases of 2 lesions, which were identified only with WB-MRI, the lesions were located in the sacrum and thoracic spine. For one case of 3 lesions, which was identified only with BS, the lesions were located in the skull and rib.WB-MRI was an excellent method for screening bone metastasis, especially the vertebral body.
