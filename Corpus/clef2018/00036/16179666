Loss of insight and functional neuroimaging in frontotemporal dementia. Loss of insight is a diagnostic criterion for frontotemporal dementia. It is associated with hypoperfusion/hypometabolism in the right hemisphere, particularly the frontal lobe. Loss of insight is often an anosodiaphoria (i.e., lack of concern) rather than an anosognosia (i.e., decreased awareness).
