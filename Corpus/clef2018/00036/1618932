Potential language and attentional networks revealed through factor analysis of rCBF data measured with SPECT. We used changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) to disclose regions involved in central auditory and language processing in the normal brain. rCBF was quantified with a fast-rotating, single-photon emission computerized tomograph (SPECT) and inhalation of 133Xe. rCBF data were obtained simultaneously from parallel, transverse slices of the brain. The lower slice was positioned to include both Broca's and Wernicke's areas. The upper slice included regions generally regarded by neurobehaviorists as less related to primary auditory or linguistic functions. We presented three types of auditory stimuli to ten healthy, young volunteers: (a) diotically presented Danish speech, (b) dichotic word stimulation, and (c) white noise. Wilcoxon's signed ranks sum test revealed increased rCBF in language-related areas of cortex, viz., Wernicke's area and its right-sided homologous area as well as in Broca's area (left hemisphere), when subjects listened to narrative speech, compared to white noise (baseline). No significant rCBF differences were detected with this test during dichotic stimulation vs. white noise. A more sophisticated statistical method (factor analysis) disclosed patterns of functionally intercorrelated regions. The factor analysis reduced the highly intercorrelated rCBF measures from 28 regions of interest to a set of three independent factors. These factors accounted for 77% of the total variation in rCBF values. These three factors appeared to represent statistical analogues of independent brain networks involved in (I) auditory/linguistic, (II) attentional, and (III) visual imaging activity.
