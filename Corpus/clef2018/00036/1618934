Vibration-induced regional cerebral blood flow responses in normal aging. Task-induced changes in regional CBF (rCBF) can be measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and provide a powerful tool to map brain function. Many studies using these techniques have investigated responses in healthy young subjects. Since many pathological conditions occur more commonly in older subjects, it is necessary to compare blood flow responses in these patients with appropriately age-matched controls. Furthermore, the effects of normal aging on such blood flow responses remain unknown. For both reasons, we designed this study to determine whether vibration-induced CBF responses change with advancing age in normals. CBF was measured with PET and bolus-administered H2(15)O in 26 subjects from 20 to 72 years old (mean = 39 SD = 19). Regional responses were identified by subtraction-image analysis. Left and right hand vibration produced consistent responses in contralateral primary sensorimotor area (PSA) and supplementary motor area (SMA). Response magnitudes were compared to age by linear regression. There were no substantial relationships between age and responses to vibration for PSA or SMA (PSA r = -0.28, p = 0.054
