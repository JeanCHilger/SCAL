Regional cerebral L-[14C-methyl]methionine incorporation into proteins: evidence for methionine recycling in the rat brain. The specific activity (SA) of free methionine was measured in plasma and in different regions of the rat brain at 15, 30, or 60 min after intravenous infusion of L-[14C-methyl]methionine. Within these time periods, an apparent steady state of labeled free methionine in plasma and in brain was reached. However, the brain-to-plasma free methionine SA ratio was found to be approximately 0.5, showing that an isotopic equilibrium between brain and plasma was not attained. This suggests the presence of an endogenous source of brain free methionine (likely originating from protein breakdown), in addition to the plasma source. The contribution of this endogenous source to the content of free methionine varies significantly among the different brain regions. Our results indicate that the regional rates of protein synthesis measured with L-[11C-methyl]methionine using positron emission tomography would be underestimated, since the local fraction of brain methionine derived from protein degradation would not be considered.
