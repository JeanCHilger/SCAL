Glucose-normalized standardized uptake value from (18)F-FDG PET in classifying lymphomas. Our objective was to derive the best glucose sensitivity factor (g-value) and the most discriminating standardized uptake value (SUV) normalized to glucose for classifying indolent and aggressive lymphomas.The maximum SUV obtained from (18)F-FDG PET over the area of biopsy in 102 patients was normalized by serum glucose ([Glc]) to a standard of 100 mg/dL. Discriminant analysis was performed by using each SUV(100) (SUV x {100/[Glc]}(g), calculated using various g-values ranging from -3.0 to 0, one at a time) as a variable against the lymphoma grades, and plotting the percentage of correct classifications against g (g-plot) to search for the best g-value in normalizing SUV(100) for classifying grades. To address the influence of the extreme glucose conditions, we repeated the same analyses in 12 patients with [Glc] < or = 70 mg/dL or [Glc] > or = 110 mg/dL.SUV(100) correctly classified lymphoma grades ranging from 62% to 73% (P < 0.0005), depending on the g-value, with a maximum at a g-value of -0.5. For the subgroup with extreme glucose values, the g-plot also revealed higher and more optimal discrimination at a g-value of -0.5 (92%) than at a g-value of 0 (83%) (P = 0.03). The discrimination deteriorated at g < -1 in both analyses. The box plot for all cases using a g-value of -0.5 showed little overlap in classifying lymphoma grades. For a visually selected threshold SUV(100) of 7.25, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of identifying aggressive grades were 82%, 79%, and 81%, respectively.The results suggest that metabolic discrimination between lymphoma grades using a glucose-normalized SUV from (18)F-FDG PET is improved by introducing g-value as an extra degree of freedom.
