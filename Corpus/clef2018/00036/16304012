Three-dimensional cardiac image fusion using new CT angiography and SPECT methods. The purpose of this study was to develop a method of fused images of coronary CT angiography and myocardial perfusion SPECT.Four patients with ischemic heart disease underwent 3D volume-rendering fused images using a conversion program and volume-rendering fusion function of a computer workstation. The fusion images clearly showed the relationship of relevant coronary arteries and the abnormal perfusion territory in all patients and were useful for the evaluation of coronary artery disease.
