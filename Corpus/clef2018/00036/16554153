Novel fluorescent probe for detecting hydroperoxides with strong emission in the visible range. A novel fluorescent probe, a swallow-tailed perylene derivative for detecting hydroperoxides (Spy-HP), containing perylene 3,4,9,10-tetracarboxyl bisimide as the main skeleton in the structure, was developed. Spy-HP reacted rapidly with hydroperoxides such as m-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) and cumene hydroperoxide to form its oxidized derivative, Spy-HPOx, and emitted an extremely strong fluorescence (phi approximately 1) in the visible range (lambda(ex) = 524 nm and lambda(em) = 535 nm), as the result of canceling the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) effect. The reaction between Spy-HP and hydroperoxides proceeded quantitatively in strict stoichiometry, without being affected by autoxidation or photobleaching. Because of these prominent properties, Spy-HP is expected to be a novel and useful fluorescent probe to 'spy' on hydroperoxides in biosamples.
