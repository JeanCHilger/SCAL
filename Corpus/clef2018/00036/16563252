Clinical significance of adenosine 99mTc-MIBI myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography for patients in percutaneous coronary intervention. To analyze the clinical significance of adenosine (99m)Tc-MIBI myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Coronary angiography and adenosine (99m)Tc-MIBI myocardial perfusion SPECT were performed for all patients. Adenosine myocardial perfusion was performed after PCI. Adenosine was infused intravenously at a rate of 140 microg.kg(-1).min(-1) for 6 minutes, and 925MBq (99m)Tc-MIBI was injected intravenously at 3 minutes after adenosine infusion. SPECT myocardial imaging acquisition was obtained in 1.5 hours after adenosine infusion. If the result was abnormal, rest (99m)Tc-MIBI myocardial perfusion SPECT would be performed next day. There were 17 segments of left ventricle, and four degrees of myocardial perfusion.There were 63 cases (63 +/- 10 years old) with CAD, in which 40 patients got PCI. Twenty eight cases after PCI.Adenosine myocardial perfusion imaging will be useful in detecting regional myocardial perfusion abnormalities for patients with PCI.
