Stepwise revascularization for prevention of postoperative hyperperfusion. Abrupt normalization of cerebral blood flow (CBF) after surgical procedures to improve excessive cerebral hypoperfusion can cause irreversible brain parenchymal damage. Such hyperperfusion, which is caused by inflow at normal blood pressure into maximally dilated fine vessels, is an important complication following carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Strict control of blood pressure in the perioperative period can prevent this complication except in a few patients, who have severe cerebral hypoperfusion and poor cerebrovascular reserve due to extremely severe stenosis of the ipsilateral or the bilateral carotid arteries, for which CEA is indicated. The requirement for improved CBF and the risk of postoperative hyperperfusion conflict in the pathogenesis of these patients. We tried to prevent abrupt improvement in perfusion by attempting gradual restoration of CBF. Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis was first performed to improve the poor cerebrovascular reserve by allowing insufficient blood flow. A few weeks later, CEA was performed to completely restore CBF. This surgical approach obtained good results without postoperative problems in four patients. The indications of this surgical management and efficacy of stepwise restoration of CBF to prevent postoperative hyperperfusion depend on careful preoperative evaluation of perfusion studies.
