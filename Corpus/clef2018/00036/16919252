The relation of amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen and severity of coronary artery disease in patients without myocardial infarction or hibernation. The association of cardiac fibrosis and coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients without infarction or hibernation is unclear. We investigated the relationship between serum concentrations of procollagen propeptides and severity of CAD in such patients.Forty-six patients (32 men mean age 64 years) with chest pain were enrolled. All patients received stress thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and analysis of the serum levels of the amino-terminal propeptide of type I and III procollagen (PINP and PIIINP).In patients with thallium-201 perfusion defects, the number of diseased vessels was associated significantly with PIIINP (p=0.024) rather than PINP (p=0.613). Follow-up serum PINP and PIIINP levels after coronary intervention (mean 84 days) revealed no significant decrease.Serum PIIINP level is significantly associated with the severity of CAD in patients without myocardial infarction or hibernation.
