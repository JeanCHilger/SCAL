Imaging of pain: recent developments. Brain imaging of pain has made remarkable strides in the past year and a half. The basic regional activation pattern after acute nociceptive stimulation is now fairly well clarified. The extension of imaging studies from normal subjects to include cohorts of pathological pain patients is occurring. The techniques of positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging and single photon emission computed tomography have all been applied to the study of human pain processing and the assessment of physiological interventions or psychological manipulations. Studies using labelled ligands to trace receptor alterations have also been conducted. Although more work could be done on the pharmacology and physiology of anesthesiology, the resulting set of observations provides a deeper understanding of the basic human neurophysiology of pain and a potential neural framework for better pain management.
