Functional significance of using tissue adhesive substance in nephron-sparing surgery: assessment by quantitative SPECT of 99m Tc-Dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy. To compare changes in renal function following nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) using tissue adhesive only versus NSS using standard suturing technique, as measured by quantitative SPECT of 99m Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid uptake by the kidney (QDMSA).QDMSA was done before and 3-6 mo after the operation in 32 patients who underwent standard suturing technique and in 24 patients in whom tissue adhesive sealant (19 with albumin glutaraldehyde tissue adhesive [BioGlue] 5 with CoSeal) was used to close the parenchymal defect. Individual kidney uptake was measured and retrospectively compared between the two groups.Average tumor diameter was 3.4cm (range: 2.2-6) in the suture group and 3.56 (range: 1.7-6) in the tissue sealant group. In the tissue sealant group following surgery, we observed an average individual renal function loss of 11.49% compared with the suture group in whom an average individual renal function loss of 20.36% (p = 0.02) was measured by 99m Tc-DMSA.The use of tissue sealant to close the parenchymal defect during NSS demonstrated a statistically significant advantage in reducing functioning renal loss as measured by the absolute uptake of QDMSA. Further clinical studies are required to establish the role of tissue sealants in NSS.
