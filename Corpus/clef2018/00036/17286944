Assessment of cortical brain blood flood by brain perfusion spect in patients with a diagnosis of eating behavior disorders. To evaluate cortical brain blood flow by 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT in patients with Eating Disorders (ED): restrictive anorexia (RA) and purgative bulimia (PB).The study included 7 women with diagnostic criteria of RA and 12 with PB. The control group was made up of 12 healthy women. All subjects underwent brain 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT. The SPECT studies were quantified, yielding semiquantitative indexes relating to cerebellar activity in different regions. Body dissatisfaction was assessed by means of the BSQ (Body Shape Questionnaire). The results were analyzed with the ANOVA variance and had a statistical significance of p < 0.05.Mean BSQ scores were 98.28 (range 71-159) in the RA group, 145.05 (range 73-191) in the PB group, and 57.4 (range 37-88) in the control group. All patients in the sample (i.e., both RA and PB) showed global cerebral hypoperfusion versus the controls, although the difference only reached statistical significance in the RA group in the left parietal lobe (p = 0.02) and in the right (p = 0.004) and left temporal lobes (p = 0.015). In the PB group, the significantly hypoperfused regions were the right (p < 0.001) and left (p = 0.008) superior frontal lobe, the right inferior frontal lobe (p = 0.042), the right (p = 0.042) and left (p = 0.002) parietal lobes, and the right temporal lobe (p = 0.002).The results obtained showed that patients with ED had cerebral hypoperfusion compared with healthy subjects. This pattern is common in parietotemporal regions for both PB and AR although with temporal and parietal predominance in RA and PB, respectively. In addition, patients with PB had frontal region involvement.
