Phase II study on the effect of disease sites, age, and prior therapy on response to iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy in refractory neuroblastoma. To evaluate the effect of disease sites and prior therapy on response and toxicity after iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) treatment of patients with resistant neuroblastoma.One hundred sixty-four patients with progressive, refractory or relapsed high-risk neuroblastoma, age 2 to 30 years, were treated in a limited institution phase II study. Patients with cryopreserved hematopoietic stem cells (n = 148) were treated with 18 mCi/kg of 131I-MIBG. Those without hematopoietic stem cells (n = 16) received 12 mCi/kg. Patients were stratified according to prior myeloablative therapy and whether they had measurable soft tissue involvement or only bone and/or bone marrow disease.Hematologic toxicity was common, with 33% of patients receiving autologous hematopoietic stem cell support. Nonhematologic grade 3 or 4 toxicity was rare, with 5% of patients experiencing hepatic, 3.6% pulmonary, 10.9% infectious toxicity, and 9.7% with febrile neutropenia. The overall complete plus partial response rate was 36%. The response rate was significantly higher for patients with disease limited either to bone and bone marrow, or to soft tissue (compared with patients with both) for patients with fewer than three prior treatment regimens and for patients older than 12 years. The event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) times were significantly longer for patients achieving response, for those older than 12 years and with fewer than three prior treatment regimens. The OS was 49% at 1 year and 29% at 2 years EFS was 18% at 1 year.The high response rate and low nonhematologic toxicity with 131I-MIBG suggest incorporation of this agent into initial multimodal therapy of neuroblastoma.
