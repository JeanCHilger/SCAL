Randomized trial of low-pressure carbon dioxide-elicited pneumoperitoneum versus abdominal wall lifting for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Two alternative surgical techniques for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), low-pressure insufflation of the peritoneal cavity and abdominal wall lifting (AWL), have been developed over time to minimize the disadvantages associated with CO2-elicited pneumoperitoneum. To the best of our knowledge, the 2 methods have seldom been compared as regards their relative advantages and disadvantages.Eighty patients scheduled for elective LC were randomized into either a low-pressure (8 mmHg) CO2 insufflation method (LPLC) group, or a gasless technique using a subcutaneous abdominal wall lifting device (GLC group). The duration of the surgical procedure, the surgical results including level of postoperative pain, and perioperative cardiopulmonary function changes experienced by the members of both groups were compared.Laparoscopic surgery was completed for all but 1 patient from each group due to an inadequate surgical-site exposure. There was no mortality for study participants, and no major complications were noted for members of either group. The LPLC group evidenced a shorter surgical duration as compared to the GLC group (77 +/- 28 minutes vs. 98 +/- 27 minutes, respectively p < 0.01) and a lower incidence of postoperative shoulder pain (2/38 vs. 8/39, respectivelyBoth alternative methods for this type of surgery appeared feasible and safe for LC. Low-pressure CO2 pneumoperitoneum had a shorter surgical duration and less postoperative shoulder pain compared to the GLC technique, but did not feature any other advantage over the AWL technique with regard to impact on cardiopulmonary function.
