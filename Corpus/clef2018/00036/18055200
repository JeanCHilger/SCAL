A method for the synthesis of an oseltamivir PET tracer. A protocol applicable for the synthesis of an oseltamivir positron emission tomography (PET) tracer was developed. Acetylation of amine 3 with CH(3)COCl, followed by deprotection and aqueous workup, produced oseltamivir 4 from 3 within 10 min. The obtained 4 was sufficiently pure for PET studies. This method can be extended to PET tracer synthesis using CH(3)(11)COCl.
