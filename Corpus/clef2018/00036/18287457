Clinical utility of hybrid SPECT-CT in endocrine neoplasia. Imaging of endocrine neoplasms often involves a combination of anatomic and functional techniques including sonography, CT, MRI, and scintigraphy. Recent technologic advances have enabled hybrid imaging using SPECT-CT, which combines anatomic and functional techniques to allow accurate localization of tumors, increased detection of recurrent and metastatic disease, and exclusion of physiologic uptake.SPECT-CT provides improved specificity and diagnostic confidence helping to guide conventional management and assess suitability for targeted radionuclide therapy.
