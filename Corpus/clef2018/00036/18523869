LRRK2 mutation in familial Parkinson's disease in a Taiwanese population: clinical, PET, and functional studies. Pathogenic mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause autosomal-dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD). We performed clinical, imaging, and molecular functional studies in one family with the R1441H and six families with the G2385R variants of Lrrk2. To determine the contribution of these variants to familial PD in Taiwanese, we screened 32 Taiwanese or ethnic Chinese patients with familial PD for four pathogenic substitutions (R1441H, I2012T, I2020T, and G2019S) and one susceptibility polymorphism (G2385R). The frequencies of R1441H and G2385R were 3.7% and 22.2%, respectively. G2019S, I2012T, and I2020T were not detected. The clinical phenotypes and [(18)F]-dopa PET findings for subjects with R1441H or G2385R resembled those of patients with idiopathic PD however, their lymphoblastoid cell lines showed increased apoptosis following exposure to a proteosome inhibitor. Thus, LRRK2 mutations are rare in Taiwanese with familial PD. Further study is needed to identify causative genes or unique biomarkers for familial PD.
