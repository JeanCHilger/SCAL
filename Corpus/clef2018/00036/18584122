Characterization of surface modified polyester fabric. Woven polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fabric has been used in the construction of vascular grafts and sewing ring of prosthetic heart valves. In an effort to improve haemocompatibility and tissue response to PET fabric, a fluoropolymer, polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF), was coated on PET fabric by dip coating technique. The coating was found to be uniform and no significant changes occurred on physical properties such as water permeability and burst strength. Cell culture cytotoxicity studies showed that coated PET was non-cytotoxic to L929 fibroblast cell lines. In vitro studies revealed that coating improved haemocompatibility of PET fabric material. Coating reduced platelet consumption of PET fabric by 50%. Upon surface modification leukocyte consumption of PET was reduced by 24%. About 60% reduction in partial thromboplastin time (PTT) observed when PET was coated with PVDF. Results of endothelial cell proliferation studies showed that surface coating did not have any substantial impact on cell proliferation. Overall results indicate that coating has potential to improve haemocompatibility of PET fabric without affecting its mechanical performance.
