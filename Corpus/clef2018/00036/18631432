Post-operative changes of cerebral circulation and metabolism in the acute stage of low-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Pre- and post-operative cerebral circulation and metabolism were evaluated in patients with low-grade acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who underwent early surgery to investigate the effects on brain dysfunction.Positron emission tomography (PET) was performed to measure the regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral blood volume in four patients (one male and three females, mean age: 60.3 years) with low-grade SAH within 30 hours of onset. Post-operative PET was performed on the seventh post-operative day. No patient suffered clinical deterioration during the study. Pre-operative PET scans demonstrated significant global reduction of CBF and CMRO2, compared to 16 normal control subjects, and no significant change in OEF. CBF and CMRO2 reduction post-operatively improved to the normal control values. Post-operative OEF was significantly increased compared to the normal control value.Patients with low-grade SAH have impairment of cerebral circulation and metabolism in the acute period, which improves after surgery. Early surgery for low-grade SAH, necessary to avoid rerupture of the aneurysm, did not worsen the impairment of cerebral circulation and metabolism. However, measures to protect the brain from perioperative damage are necessary to achieve the optimum outcome.
