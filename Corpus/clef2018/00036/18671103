Small-intestinal cryptosporidiosis in a young pigeon. Small-intestinal cryptosporidiosis in a 10-day-old pet pigeon is described. Clinically, the pigeon was depressed and inactive, its feathers were ruffled, and had faecal material adhering to feathers around its vent. Gross lesions were seen only in the intestinal tract and consisted of mild hyperaemic segments of small intestine distended with typical green watery ingesta. Histologically, organisms of the Cryptosporidium sp. were found in the villi of lower portions of the small intestine which were atrophic and misshapen. Spontaneously occurring intestinal cryptosporidiosis has not been previously reported in pigeons.
