Objective methods of assessment of coronary angiogenesis. Stimulatiion of coronary angiogenesis in patients with IHD appears to be one of perspective directions in contemporary cardiology. Therefore objective assessment of results with the help of instrumental methods of investigation is important. For assessment of the state of coronary vascular bed and myocardial perfusion in the clinic one can use coronarography, single photon emission computer tomography, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance tomography, and contrast echocardiography. Novel techniques of visualization are elaborated at present with consideration of peculiarities of mechanisms and use of molecular markers of angiogenesis: visualization of integrin avb3, VEGF-receptors, visualization of activity of matrix metalloproteinases.
