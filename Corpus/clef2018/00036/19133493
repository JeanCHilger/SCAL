Equine-facilitated psychotherapy with adult female survivors of abuse. This qualitative study examined the stories of 5 women who experienced abuse and participated in equine-facilitated psychotherapy (EFP) as part of their recovery. Anecdotal accounts support the effectiveness of EFP with women who have experienced abuse, but there is a lack of supporting research. This study was designed to examine the effectiveness of EFP in the treatment of women who have experienced abuse. Selection criteria included age, experience of abuse, participation in EFP, and ability to understand English. Data analysis identified four patterns in the participants' stories: I Can Have Power Doing It Hands On, Horses as Co-Therapists, and Turned My Life Around. Overall, the participants' stories show that EFP can be an effective intervention for women who have experienced abuse.
