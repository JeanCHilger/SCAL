FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography for the detection of extrahepatic metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma. To compare the efficacy of positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT), multi-detector helical computed tomography (MDCT) and bone scintigraphy for the detection of extrahepatic metastases in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Thirty-four patients diagnosed with metastatic HCC were enrolled in this study. The lesions included lung (n = 18), bone (n = 12) and lymph node (n = 16) metastases. For receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, lesions were diagnosed as metastatic HCC by two experienced abdominal radiologists. Another three physicians independently reviewed both positive and negative images. Each physician read three sets of images of MDCT, PET-CT and bone scintigraphy for bone metastasis.The mean sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of lung metastasis were 85.2 and 88.9% for MDCT, and 59.2 and 92.6% for PET-CT, respectively. For lymph node metastasis, these values were 62.5 and 79.2% for MDCT, and 66.7 and 91.7% for PET-CT, respectively and for bone metastasis 41.6 and 94.5% for MDCT, 83.3 and 86.1% for PET-CT, and 52.7 and 83.3% for bone scintigraphy, respectively. The mean Az values were 0.95 and 0.77 for MDCT and PET-CT in lung metastasis, respectively, 0.75 and 0.80 for MDCT and PET-CT for lymph node metastasis, respectively, and 0.59, 0.88 and 0.62 for MDCT, PET-CT and bone scintigraphy for bone metastasis, respectively.PET-CT has high sensitivity and is more suitable for the detection of bone metastases from primary HCC, relative to MDCT and bone scintigraphy.
