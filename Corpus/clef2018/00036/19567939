The detection of brain ischaemia in rats by inductive phase shift spectroscopy. Ischaemia in the brain is an important clinical problem that is often monitored and studied with expensive devices such as MRI and PET, which are not readily available in low economical resource parts of the world. We have developed a new less expensive tool for non-invasive monitoring of ischaemia in the brain. This is a first feasibility study describing the concept. The system is based on the hypothesis that electromagnetic properties of the tissue change during ischaemia and that measuring the electromagnetic properties of the bulk of the brain with non-contact means can detect these changes. The apparatus we have built and whose design we describe here consists of two electromagnetic coils placed around the head. The system measures the bulk change in time of the phase difference between the electromagnetic signal on the two coils in a range of frequencies. A mathematical model simulating the device and the measurement is also introduced. Ischaemia was induced in the brain of rats by occlusion of the right cerebral and carotid arteries. Experimental subjects were monitored for 24 h. Inductive phase shift measurements were made at five frequencies in the range of 0.1-50 MHz eight times during the observation period. An ex vivo estimation of the percentage of necrosis in the ischemic subjects at t = 24 h was done. The mathematical model was also applied to the experimental tested situation. The results of both experiments and theory show significant phase shifts increase as a function of frequency and ischaemia time. The theoretical and experimental results suggest that the tested technique has the potential to detect the processes and level of ischaemia in the brain by non-invasive, continuous, bulk volumetric monitoring with a simple and inexpensive apparatus.
