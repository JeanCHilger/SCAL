Design of a twins-oval tool in a precise nanostructure reclamation of digital paper displays. A new mechanism modus of micro ultrasonic electroremoval (MUERM) using a precise nanostructure reclamation and a design twins-oval tool offering faster performance in removing the Indium-tin-oxide (In2O3SnO2) thin-films from the surface of the optical PET-diaphragm (PET) of digital paper is demonstrated. Through the ultra-precise etching of the nanostructure, the semiconductor industry can effectively reclaim defective products, thereby reducing production costs. For the removal-process, a faster feed rate of the PET combined with a higher electric current produces a faster removal rate. Using ultrasonic energy transmitted into the electrolyte to assist in the chemical reaction can improve the effect of dreg discharge and contributes to the achievement of a fast PET feed rate. The average removal effect of the ultrasonics is better than the pulsed current while the current rating needs not to be prolonged. The high rotational speed of the twins-oval tool increases the dreg discharge mobility and improves the removal effect. A small height of the anode and the cathode, or a large width of the cathode corresponds to a higher removal rate for the In2O3SnO2. A small arc edge radius of the anode and the cathode also corresponds to a higher removal rate for the In2O3SnO2.
