A clinico-anatomical correlation study of logorrhoea. The degree of verbal production necessary to be considered logorrhoea has still not been defined, and no clear correlation has been established between the topography of the dysfunction and this symptom.To provide quantitative data about normal verbal production and to identify the location within the brain of the alterations observed in neuroimage of patients with logorrhoea.The oral verbal production of 60 control subjects between 20 and 80 years of age was quantified by analysing five speeches. Ten patients who exceeded the 75th percentile in at least two of the five speeches underwent structural and functional neuroimaging tests. RESULTS. The data on verbal production of normal subjects are reported. Age, sex and habits (smoking, coffee, alcoholic drinks) did not exert an influence, but the degree of schooling was seen to have an effect. All the patients were diagnosed with frontotemporal degeneration, although in one case there were also coexisting vascular risk factors and subcortical vascular lesions, which reduce the degree of certainty of the diagnosis. Cortical atrophy is located in the right anterior temporal lobes (100% anteromedial, 100% anteroinferior, 70% anterolateral), left anterior temporal (90% anteromedial, 90% anteroinferior, 60% anterolateral), right prefrontal (30% basal, 50% dorsolateral, 20% medial) and left prefrontal (20% basal, 30% dorsolateral, 20% medial).Oral verbal production is influenced by level of education and, in a sample of patients with probable frontotemporal degeneration and logorrhoea, all the patients showed alterations in the anteroinferior and anteromedial regions of the right temporal lobe.
