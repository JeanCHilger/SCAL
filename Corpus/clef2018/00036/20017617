Does recombinant human thyrotropin-stimulated positron emission tomography with [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose improve detection of recurrence of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma in patients with low serum thyroglobulin? Thyrotropin (TSH) stimulates thyrocyte metabolism, glucose transport, and glycolysis. The interest in using recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) stimulation of fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) with positron emission tomography (PET) has been shown, but mainly for patients with high serum thyroglobulin (Tg) concentration. We evaluated the use of rhTSH-stimulated PET-FDG in patients with low serum Tg concentration.Sixty-one PET/computed tomography (CT)-FDG (Biograph Sensation 16 Siemens Medical Solutions, Knoxville, TN) were performed in 44 patients (28 women and 16 menThe mean Tg(ini) was 785 +/- 2707 microg/L for a TSH of 73 +/- 64 mU/L. The mean Tg(T4) was 7 +/- 15 microg/L (T(4) = 195 +/- 59 microg/day mean TSH of 0.24 +/- 0.57 mU/L). Among the 44 patients, PET/CT-FDG findings were positive in 20 and negative in 24. Among the 61 PET/CT-FDG, 25 PET/CT-FDG were positive (41%). Among the 25 positive PET, the Tg(T4) values were less than 10 microg/L for 19, including 9 true-positive patients (20% of the 44 patients). There was no difference of PET/CT-FDG results (positive vs. negative) as related to the serum Tg concentrations (p = 0.99 for Tg(ini), p = 0.95 for Tg(T4), p = 0.07 for Tg(1), and p = 0.42 for Tg(2)). No relation was observed with PET/CT-FDG results and initial tumor size (p = 0.52) or node metastasis (p = 0.14).In the diagnosis of recurrent disease in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma and low Tg level, the sensitivity of rhTSH-stimulated PET/CT-FDG seems to be low and no correlation was observed between PET/CT-FDG findings and Tg level. However, positive PET-FDG results have been found in 9/44 (20%) patients with serum Tg levels lower than 10 microg/L. Therefore, this series shows that a cutoff value of 10 microg/L for the Tg under T(4) is probably not the best criteria to select patient candidates for PET/CT-FDG examination to detect the recurrence of differentiated thyroid carcinoma.
