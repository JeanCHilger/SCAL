Chemical delivery system of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) to the central nervous system. The aim of the present investigation was to apply a chemical delivery system (CDS) to MIBG (4) with the purpose of delivering this drug to the CNS. Compound 4 has been linked to a 1,4-dihydroquinoline moiety in order to achieve its CNS penetration, and here we report the synthesis to link 4 to the chemical delivery system and the radiosynthesis with carbon-11 of the "CDS-4 entity". After iv injection into rats of the [(11)C]CDS-4, the follow-up study of the radioactivity distribution in blood samples and brain homogenates and the analysis by HPLC and LC-MS/MS have confirmed the release of 4 into the CNS.
