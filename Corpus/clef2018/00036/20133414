Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from paraffin-embedded tissues by INNO-LiPA Rif.TB assay: retrospective analyses of Health Protection Agency National Mycobacterium Reference Laboratory data. Molecular diagnostic methods are of potential value in identifying tuberculosis (TB) and drug resistance where tissue specimens have been submitted for histology but not for microbiological culture. All paraffin-embedded tissue (PET) specimens (n=60) referred to a single national centre over a 42 month study period were analysed using the INNO-LiPA Rif.TB assay 29/60 patients had been reported to the UK Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance database with a diagnosis of TB based on clinical, radiological and histological evidence. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA was detectable in 5 out of 29 reported TB cases (17.2 %)
