Radiosynthesis of novel carbon-11-labeled triaryl ligands for cannabinoid-type 2 receptor. Two novel triaryl ligands 2 and 5 with potent in vitro binding affinities for the cannabinoid subtype-2 (CB2) receptor were labeled with a positron-emitting radioactive nuclide (11)C. Radioligands [(11)C]2, [(11)C]5, and their analogs [(11)C]3 and [(11)C]4 were synthesized by O-[(11)C]methylation of their corresponding phenol precursors with [(11)C]CH(3)I. [(11)C]2-5 had relatively high uptakes (>1.2% injected dose/g tissue) in mouse brains.
