Current themes in neuroimaging of epilepsy: brain networks, dynamic phenomena, and clinical relevance. Brain scanning methods were first applied in patients with epilepsy more than 30years ago. A very substantial literature now exists in this field, which is exponentially increasing. Contemporary neuroimaging studies in epilepsy reflect new concepts in the epilepsies, as well as current methodological developments. In particular, this area is emphasising the role of networks in epileptogenicity, the existence of dynamic phenomena which can be captured by imaging, and is beginning to validate the implementation of neuroimaging in the clinic. Here, recent studies of the last 5years are reviewed, covering the full range of neuroimaging methods with SPECT, PET and MRI in epilepsy.
