Anxiety levels in dreams: relation to localized cerebral glucose metabolic rate. Ten normal male subjects were injected with D-[18F]deoxyglucose during REM sleep, and 32-45 min later they were aroused and reported their dreams as well as free associations to these dreams. Nonparametric correlations between the anxiety scores derived from the typescripts of these verbal reports by the Gottschalk-Gleser content analysis method and localized cerebral glucose metabolic rates obtained from PET scans revealed significant positive correlations in lateral parietal and medial frontal cortex and negative correlations in adjacent white matter.
