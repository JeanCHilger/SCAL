Imaging the major salivary glands. Advances in imaging have led to improved sensitivity in the diagnosis of diseases that involve the major salivary glands. Ultrasound (US), plain radiography and sialography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and nuclear scintigraphy/positron emission tomography (PET) all play a part, and imaging often assists in the planning of further management, operative or otherwise. We review the methods used for imaging the major salivary glands, and apply the indications for these methods to the principal pathological processes.
