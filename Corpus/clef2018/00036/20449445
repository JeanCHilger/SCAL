Synthesis, characterisation and photochemistry of platinum diselenolenes. The reaction between [Pt(PPh(3))(4)] and cycloocteno-1,2,3-selenadiazole or bis-cycloocteno-1,4-diselenin in toluene under reflux yielded the poorly soluble mononuclear platinum diselenolene [Pt(Se(2)C(8)H(12))(PPh(3))(2)], 1c. Treatment of [Pt(C(2)H(4))(PR(3))(2)] with a bis-cycloalkeno-1,4-diselenin in a mixture of 1,4-dioxane, THF and toluene under reflux led in good yield to the platinum diselenolenes [Pt(Se(2)C(n+4)H(2n+4))(PR(3))(2)] (R = Et (2), Bu (3) n = 3 (b), 4 (c)). The analogous complexes [Pt(Se(2)C(8)H(12))(L)] (L = dppm: 4c
