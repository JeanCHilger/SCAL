Adrenal imaging. Adrenal nodules are frequently encountered on current high-resolution imaging, and accurate characterization of such lesions is critical for appropriate patient care. Our article highlights how imaging techniques such as CT densitometry, CT washout characteristics, chemical shift MRI, PET, and PET/CT help characterize most adrenal lesions. We focus on these techniques as well as specifically, because of space constraints, the varied imaging appearances of adrenocortical carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and lymphoma on these techniques.The imaging characterization of adrenal lesions has continued to advance over the past decade as new technologies have evolved. CT, MRI, PET, and PET/CT are now established clinical techniques capable of differentiating benign from malignant adrenal lesions.
