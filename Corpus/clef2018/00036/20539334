Seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii antibodies amongst pregnant women at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. Toxoplasma gondii (T.gondii), an obligate intracellular parasite found in many species throughout the world, causes a variety of clinical syndromes in humans and animals. It is also associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnancy. Hence the need to determine the seroprevalence of antibody to toxoplasmosis gondii amongst pregnant women.A cross- sectional study was carried out using patients attending the ante-natal clinic of Lagos State University Teaching Hospital Ikeja. All consenting newly registered ante-natal patients were recruited consecutively into the study within a time frame of six weeks during which a total of 179 pregnant participants were recruited. Literate participants filled self administered questionnaires whilst the non-literate participants were interviewed by research assistants. Five milliliters of blood was collected from each participant after obtaining patient's consent. Sera were assayed for antitoxoplasmosis IgG antibody by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. (ELISA.)A total of 179 pregnant women were studied. Almost 50.8% were between the ages of 25-30 years, 70.8% of the patients studied, had tertiary education. An assessment of the patients' status to anti-toxoplasmosis IgG showed 40.8% were positive while 59.2% were negative. Pet-keeping was a practice amongst only 6.1% of patients whilst 90.5% did not keep pets. Out of those who kept pets, 63.6% were positive while 39.5% were negative. Amongst those who did not keep pets, 39.5% were positive while 60.5% were negative. This difference was not statistically significant. (P=0.261)It appears that seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis IgG antibody amongst the pregnant women in this study population is high. Therefore, it is valuable to follow up the IgMantibody status of their off springs as its presence indicates recent exposure.
