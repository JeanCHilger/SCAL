Insights into schizophrenia using positron emission tomography: building the evidence and refining the focus. Schizophrenia involves dysregulation in dopaminergic transmission. Studies show heightened presynaptic striatal dopaminergic function and elevated striatal D(2)/D(3) receptor density in the brain. Cognitive impairments result from hypostimulation of D(1) receptors and are associated with dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex. Here we discuss relevant positron emissions tomography (PET) studies and provide future directions.
