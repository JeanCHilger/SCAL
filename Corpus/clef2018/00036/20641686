2-Butyl-5-[ Angiotensin II (Ang II), an octapeptide, plays an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular, renal and endocrine function (1, 2). Ang II induces a variety of physiological changes such as constricting of vascular smooth muscle cells, modulation of glomerular filtration rate, and sodium retention, resulting in an increase in blood pressure. Two subtypes of Ang II receptors, AT
