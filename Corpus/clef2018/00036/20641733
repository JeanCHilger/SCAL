 Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was first identified from extracts of human colon adenocarcinoma (1) and fetal gut (2). It is a Î²-glycoprotein, and its predominant expression on the cell surface is increased in a variety of carcinomas and in certain inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (3, 4). CEA has a molecular weight of ~180 kDa, and it can be shed and detected in the serum (5). CEA expression is observed in patients with various carcinomas of the colon, lungs, thyroid, uterus, ovaries, pancreas, and medullary thyroid (6). Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed for both the diagnosis and treatment of tumors (7, 8). Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) of mAbs with a molecular mass of 25 kDa are cleared very rapidly from the circulation, but they exhibit poor tumor retention because they have a lower affinity than the parent antibody (9). On the other hand, bivalent antibody fragments possess more ideal tumor-targeting characteristics, including rapid tissue penetration, high target retention, and rapid blood clearance. The diabody fragment (a dimer of scFvs molecular mass = 55 kDa) and the minibody fragment (a dimer of scFvs-C
