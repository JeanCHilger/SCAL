2β-Carbomethoxy-3β-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-(2-[ Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, plays an important role in the mediation of movement, cognition, and emotion. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with a loss of dopamine-containing neurons in the striatum, resulting in a loss of dopamine transporter (DAT) protein in the presynaptic nerve terminals (1, 2). DAT is important to the regulation of synaptic concentration of dopamine. However, reduction of DAT density is not necessarily a measure of the clinical severity of motor dysfunction in PD patients (3). Several cocaine analogs were developed for the evaluation of DAT density in striatal neurons of PD patients (4). Radiolabeled 2β-carboxymethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (β-CIT) and
