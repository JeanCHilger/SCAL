Localization diagnostics of neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumours. Localization diagnostics of neuroendocrine tumours is relevant in relation to staging and planning of therapy, including surgery. Imaging modalities are also relevant in relation to biopsy guidance. Currently, the most frequently used methods are somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, computed tomography with contrast and endoscopic ultrasound. The strengths of the different modalities are discussed and it is concluded that frequently a combination of imaging modalities is necessary in the work-up of patients with neuroendocrine tumours.
