Impact of FDG PET/CT in the staging and the follow-up of anal carcinoma. The purpose of the study was to assess the diagnostic performance of positron emission tomography/computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose (18F) (FDG PET/CT) for the staging and the follow-up of anal carcinoma, and to evaluate the impact of FDG PET/CT on patient management.Patients with anal carcinoma were referred to our department from October 2004 until July 2008. The diagnostic performance was evaluated on a perexamination basis and on a per-site basis, together with impact of PET/CT on patient management. The standard of truth was histology when available and, in all cases, follow-up data during at least 6 months.Fifty-eight FDG PET/CT performed in 44 patients were analysedâ€”22 for initial staging and 36 during follow-up. The detection rate of non-excised tumours on initial examination was 93%. During post-treatment follow-up, FDG PET/CT had, on a per-examination basis, sensitivity for the detection of persistent or recurrent disease of 93% and specificity of 81%, and on a per-site basis, 86% and 97%, respectively. Its negative predictive value was 94% on a per-examination basis and 98% on a per-site basis. FDG PET/CT had an impact on management in nine patients out of 44 (20%), which was relevant in eight of them (89%).FDG PET/CT is an accurate imaging modality in anal cancer. It has an interesting added value during post-treatment follow-up, especially when persistence or recurrence of disease is suspected. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether surveillance by means of FDG PET/CT might have a positive impact on overall survival.
