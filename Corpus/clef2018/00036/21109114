Agreement of visual estimation of coronary artery calcium from low-dose CT attenuation correction scans in hybrid PET/CT and SPECT/CT with standard Agatston score. We sought to evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of visual estimation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) from computed tomography attenuation correction (CTAC) scans performed for hybrid positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI).At the time of MPI, hybrid systems obtain a low-dose, non-electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated CT scan that is used to perform attenuation correction. Utility of this CTAC scan in estimating actual CAC as measured by Agatston score (AS) on standard ECG-gated scans has not been previously studied.A total of 492 patients, from 3 centers, receiving both MPI with CTAC and a standard CAC scan were studied. At each site, experienced readers blinded to AS reviewed CTAC images, visually estimating CAC on a 6-level scale: classifying patients as estimated AS of 0, 1 to 9, 10 to 99, 100 to 300, 400 to 999, or â‰¥1,000. Agreement between visually estimated coronary artery calcium (VECAC) on CTAC and AS, measured standardly and converted to the same scale, was evaluated, as was inter-reader agreement.Although CTAC images are low dose and nongated, a high degree of association was observed between VECAC and AS, with 63% of VECACs in the same category as the AS category and 93% within 1 category. Weighted kappa was 0.89 (95% confidence interval: 0.88 to 0.91, p < 0.0001). High weighted kappa statistics were observed for each site, scanner type, and sex. Readers reported identical scores in 65% of cases and scores within 1 category in 93%.CAC can be visually assessed from low-dose CTAC scans with high agreement with AS. CTAC scans should be routinely assessed for VECAC.
