Patient and image data management in positron emission tomography-computed tomography for radiation therapy and therapy response assessment. This article provides an overview of the primary considerations of positron emission tomography-computed tomographic (PET-CT) workflows specifically related to patient and image data management in radiation therapy (RT) planning and therapy response assessment. PET-CT has become increasingly integral to the RT planning and therapy response assessment. There are numerous workflow challenges related to integrating PET-CT in the framework of RT planning and therapy assessment. For PET-CT scan used for RT planning, accurate patient positioning and scan registration with the simulation is critical. For therapy assessment PET-CT scans, consistency in patient preparation, scanning and image reconstruction parameters, and image analysis are critical.
