Best practices: consensus on performing positron emission tomography-computed tomography for radiation therapy planning and for therapy response assessment. The incorporation of positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) into oncological imaging has expanded rapidly since the hybrid scanners were introduced approximately 10 years ago. PET-CT is becoming the standard of practice for the imaging diagnosis and staging of most cancers. Since its introduction, hardware-registered PET and CT images produced by a PET-CT scan were recognized as valuable not only for detection, staging and restaging applications but also for optimizing radiation treatment planning. Even before the introduction of PET-CT, the value of metabolic imaging with the use of FDG PET was recognized as a potentially powerful means of assessing response to various therapies, particularly chemotherapy regimens. To better understand the optimal use of PET-CT in radiation therapy planning and the role of PET-CT in assessing response to therapy, we invited experts from various disciplines to participate in focus group meetings that took place in 2009 and 2010. The Symposia focused on the use of PET-CT imaging in radiation therapy planning (2009) and the use of PET-CT in therapy response assessment (2010). This article will summarize areas of consensus reached by the group regarding many of the discussion topics. The consensus summaries covered in this article are meant to provide direction for future discussions on how to improve the application of this hybrid modality to optimize patient care.
