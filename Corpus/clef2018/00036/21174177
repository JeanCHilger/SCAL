Positive correlations between tumor uptake on FDG PET and energy expenditure of patients with esophageal cancer. Cancer patients are prone to clinical malnutrition moreover, the energy expenditure in patients with certain cancers is higher than that in healthy individuals, rendering their nutritional management a challenging issue. We hypothesized that 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D: -glucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) may be related to the energy expenditure and analyzed the FDG uptake and energy expenditure in esophageal cancer patients to clarify this.Esophageal cancer patients [n = 13, 10 males and 3 females, age 66.5 Â± 8.9 (51-82) years] were evaluated for FDG uptake using PET. The resting energy expenditure (REE) and basal energy expenditure (BEE) were calculated using indirect calorimetry and the Harris-Benedict formula, respectively. Regression analyses were performed to compare the parameters of imaging and energy expenditure.Positive correlations were found between tumor uptake on FDG PET and the parameters of energy expenditure. Among them, the correlations between SUV(max) and the ratio of REE to BEE (REE/BEE, r = 0.59 p = 0.035) and between SUV(max) and the difference between REE and BEE (REE - BEE, r = 0.58Significant positive correlations between SUV(max) on FDG PET and energy expenditure were noted in our study we consider that these results may aid in determining the nutritional management for esophageal cancer patients.
