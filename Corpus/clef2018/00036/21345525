Prognostic value of normal myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with 201Tl in post-acute myocardial infarction. The purpose of this work has been to determine the prognostic value of normal thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) in patients who had suffered myocardial infarction in the three months prior to the examination.A stress test followed by (201)Tl Gated SPECT was performed. A follow-up was made of 63 patients with normal perfusion scintigraphy. According to the MPS results, the patients were divided into 2 groups. Group I (n=63 57% males, age 65Â±12), patients with normal MPS, and group II (n=60Five events occurred in group I in 4 patients: 3 new infarctions and 2 cardiac deaths. In group II, there were 18 events in 14 patients: 8 new infarctions and 10 cardiac deaths (p<0,0001). The events were related with age, time from MPS, diabetes, size of perfusion defect and post stress ventricular ejection fraction. Mean survival en group I was 108 months (103-112) and in group II 97 (88-107) (p=0,01).Patients with normal MPS had fewer major events than patients with abnormal MPS. The size of MPS has been related with the appearance of events. A depressed post-stress left ventricular ejection fraction has a poor prognosis.
