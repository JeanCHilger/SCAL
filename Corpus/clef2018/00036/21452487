4-[ Chemokine receptors are G-protein–coupled receptors directing cell movement toward higher concentrations of chemokines. Chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and its ligand, stromal cell–derived factor-1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12), are known to play a major role in the migration of progenitor cells during embryonic development of the central nervous, cardiovascular, and hematopoietic systems (1, 2). In addition, this CXCR4-SDF-1 receptor system has a function in the development, progression, and spread of various cancers (3), and the CXCR4 acts as a co-receptor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on CD4
