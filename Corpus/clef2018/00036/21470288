18FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning in thyroid nodules with nondiagnostic cytology. To assess the role of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans with (18) FDG ((18)FDG-PET/CT) in the evaluation of thyroid nodules with nondiagnostic cytology.Eighty-eight patients with a single euthyroid nodule and repeatedly nondiagnostic ultrasound-guided fine-needle cytology (US-FNC) were enrolled in the present study. Nodules concentrating (18)FDG were considered positive (i.e. suspicious for malignancy). Histological findings were obtained after surgery in all patients.None of 41 patients with negative (18)FDG-PET/CT scan had a final histological diagnosis of malignancy (i.e. no false-negative results). Twenty-nine patients with final histological diagnosis of thyroid cancer had positive (18)FDG-PET/CT scan. Eighteen patients with final histological diagnosis of benign lesions (including four with follicular adenomas) also had positive (18)FDG-PET/CT scans. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 100%, 69%, 79%, 62% and 100%, respectively.A negative (18)FDG-PET/CT scan accurately excludes malignancy in thyroid nodules with non-diagnostic US-FNC procedures. Histology is still necessary to distinguish benign from malignant disease in (18)FDG-PET/CT-positive nodules, but unnecessary surgery could have been reduced from 88 to 41 cases (46%) in our series.
