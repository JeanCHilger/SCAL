An unusual case of adrenal metastasis from colorectal cancer: computed tomography and fluorine 18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography features and literature review. Incidentally discovered adrenal masses are a common diagnostic problem. While computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can adequately characterize most benign or malignant adrenal masses, in some cases the results are indeterminate. We report and discuss a case of an adrenal metastasis with misleading clinical and CT features, in which an abnormal metabolic uptake detected through fluorine 18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET)-CT raised the suspicion of adrenal metastasis relatively early compared with apparently normal results on repeated follow-up CT examinations.
