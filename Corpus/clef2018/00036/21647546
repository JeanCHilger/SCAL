Multidimensional alcohol craving scale and [123I] iodobenzamide SPECT as predictors of early relapse in alcohol-dependent patients. The Multidimensional Alcohol Craving Scale (MACS) and Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) with (123)I-iodobenzamide ((123)I-IBZM) can be useful tools for assessing relapse risk in early recovery from alcohol-dependency. The aim of this study was to assess possible relationships between MACS score, (123)I-IBZM binding and time to first heavy drinking day (TFHD) after detoxification treatment.Nineteen alcohol-dependent in-patients were evaluated by MACS scale and an 123I-IBZM-SPECT, performed following alcohol detoxification treatment. At discharge, participants were advised to take naltrexone 50 mg/day for relapse prevention. TFHD was assessed over a 12-week follow up.The MACS score at the beginning of the detoxification process and naltrexone treatment after detoxification were independent predictive factors for TFHD.The MACS scale is a better predictor of TFHD than IBZM binding. It is simple, non-invasive and inexpensive and appears to be a useful instrument both for clinical practice and for research.
