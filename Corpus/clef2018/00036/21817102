Plaque rupture and thrombosis are reduced by lowering cholesterol levels and crystallization with ezetimibe and are correlated with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. This study evaluated effects of lipid lowering with ezetimibe on plaque burden and associated cholesterol crystallization and inflammation in a rabbit model of plaque disruption and thrombosis.Atherosclerotic rabbits (Group I, n=10 without Group II, n=12 with ezetimibe, 1 mg/kg per day) were pharmacologically triggered for plaque disruption. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, RAM 11 macrophage staining, and serum inflammatory markers detected arterial inflammation. Serum and aortic wall cholesterol levels were measured, and thrombus area was planimetered. Cholesterol crystal density on aortic surface was scored (0 to +3) by scanning electron microscopy. Serum and aortic wall cholesterol, plaque area, and thrombosis area were significantly lower in Group II versus Group I (83.4±106.4 versus 608±386 mg/dL, P=0.002Lowering cholesterol levels with ezetimibe reduced plaque burden, crystallization, and inflammation, preventing plaque disruption and thrombosis.
