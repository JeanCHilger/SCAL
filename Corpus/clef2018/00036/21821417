A novel indium-111-labeled gonadotropin-releasing hormone peptide for human prostate cancer imaging. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tumor targeting and imaging properties of a novel (111)In-labeled gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) peptide {1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-Ahx-(D-Lys(6)-GnRH1)} for human prostate cancer. The biodistribution and tumor imaging properties of (111)In-DOTA-Ahx-(D-Lys(6)-GnRH1) were determined in DU145 human prostate cancer-xenografted nude mice. (111)In-DOTA-Ahx-(d-Lys(6)-GnRH1) exhibited rapid tumor uptake (1.27 Â± 0.40% ID/g at 0.5h post-injection) coupled with fast whole-body clearance through the urinary system. The DU145 human prostate cancer-xenografted tumor lesions were clearly visualized by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT at 0.5h post-injection of (111)In-DOTA-Ahx-(D-Lys(6)-GnRH1). The successful imaging of DU145 human prostate cancer-xenografted tumor lesions using (111)In-DOTA-Ahx-(d-Lys(6)-GnRH1) highlighted its potential as a novel imaging probe for human prostate cancer imaging.
