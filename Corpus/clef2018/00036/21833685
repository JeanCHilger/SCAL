Usefulness of whole-body fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in patients with large-vessel vasculitis: a systematic review. The objective of this study is to systematically review the role of positron emission tomography (PET) and PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in patients with large-vessel vasculitis (LVV). A comprehensive literature search of published studies through April 2011 in PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases regarding whole-body FDG-PET and PET/CT in patients with LVV was performed. We identified 32 studies including 604 LVV patients. The main findings of these studies are presented. The conclusions are the following: (1) FDG-PET and PET/CT are useful imaging methods in the initial diagnosis and in the assessment of activity and extent of disease in patients with LVV (2) the correlation between FDG-PET findings and serological levels of inflammatory markers, as well as the usefulness of FDG-PET and PET/CT in evaluating treatment response, remains unclear
