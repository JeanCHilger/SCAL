Influence of dietary state and insulin on myocardial, skeletal muscle and brain [F]-fluorodeoxyglucose kinetics in mice. We evaluated the effect of insulin stimulation and dietary changes on myocardial, skeletal muscle and brain [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) kinetics and uptake in vivo in intact mice.Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and imaged under different conditions: non-fasted (n = 7 "controls"), non-fasted with insulin (2 IU/kg body weight) injected subcutaneously immediately prior to FDG (n = 6), fasted (n = 5), and fasted with insulin injection (n = 5). A 60-min small-animal PET with serial blood sampling and kinetic modeling was performed.We found comparable FDG standardized uptake values (SUVs) in myocardium in the non-fasted controls and non-fasted-insulin injected group (SUV 45-60 min, 9.58 ± 1.62 vs. 9.98 ± 2.44 p = 0.74), a lower myocardial SUV was noted in the fasted group (3.48 ± 1.73Changes in organ SUVs, uptake rate constants and metabolic rates induced by fasting and insulin administration as observed in intact mice by small-animal PET imaging are consistent with those observed in isolated heart/muscle preparations and, more importantly, in vivo studies in larger animals and in humans. When assessing the effect of insulin on the myocardial glucose metabolism of non-fasted mice, it is not sufficient to just calculate the SUV - dynamic imaging with kinetic modeling is necessary.
