PET-radioimmunodetection of integrins: imaging acute colitis using a ⁶⁴Cu-labeled anti-β₇ integrin antibody. Integrins are involved in a wide range of cell interactions. Imaging their distribution using high-resolution noninvasive techniques that are directly translatable to the clinic can provide new insights into disease processes and presents the opportunity to directly monitor new therapies. In this chapter, we describe a protocol to image, the in vivo distribution of the integrin β(7), expressed by lymphocytes recruited to and retained by the inflamed gut, using a radiolabeled whole antibody. The antibody is purified, conjugated with a bifunctional chelator for labeling with a radiometal, labeled with the positron-emitting radionuclide (64)Cu, and injected into mice for microPET studies. Mice with DSS-induced colitis were found to have higher uptake of the (64)Cu-labeled antibody in the gut than control groups.
