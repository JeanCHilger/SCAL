Glucose metabolism of the midline nuclei raphe in the brainstem observed by PET-MRI fusion imaging. The brainstem contains various important monoaminergic neuronal centers, including the raphe nuclei which contain serotonergic neurons. The raphe nuclei, however, are not easily identifiable and located by conventional neuroimaging.Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in seven healthy subjects using a new PET-MRI, which consists of a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT) PET and 7.0 T-MRI. Glucose metabolism of raphe nuclei was semiquantitatively measured and identified along the midline brainstem region in vivo.Midline nuclei clustered in four groups appeared to be the raphe nuclei and could be clearly visualized specifically, we identified the groups as the dorsal raphe, raphe reticularis centralis superior, raphe pontis, and raphe magnus group.FDG imaging of the midline raphe nuclei in vivo could potentially be an important tool for investigating brain diseases as well as conducting functional brain studies in the context of sleep disorders, depression, and neurodegenerative disease.
