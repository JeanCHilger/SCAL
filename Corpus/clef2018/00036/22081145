Dual-isotope SPECT imaging of striatal dopamine: a comparative study between never-treated and haloperidol-treated first-episode schizophrenic patients. The aim of this dual-isotope SPECT imaging study was to evaluate striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) and D2 receptor availability in first-episode never-treated and haloperidol-treated schizophrenic patients and whether the availability is associated with psychopathology. Twenty-four inpatients with a first acute schizophrenic episode were enrolled in the study 12 of these patients were treated with haloperidol for 2 weeks before dual-isotope SPECT was performed, whereas the other 12 patients underwent the SPECT evaluation directly after enrollment. Twelve healthy control persons were also recruited and evaluated with the dual-isotope SPECT protocol. Psychopathology was assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and other scales. D2-radioligand binding did not differ between drug-naïve patients and the control group but was significantly lower in the haloperidol-treated group. DAT availability was also significantly lower in the haloperidol patients than in the other two groups and differed significantly between drug-naïve, positive-syndrome-type patients and healthy controls. The data obtained with the new dual-isotope SPECT technique reveal a direct effect of haloperidol at the D2 and DAT receptor level.
