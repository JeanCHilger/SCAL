Characterisation of [¹¹C]PR04.MZ in Papio anubis baboon: a selective high-affinity radioligand for quantitative imaging of the dopamine transporter. N-(4-fluorobut-2-yn-1-yl)-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4'-tolyl)nortropane (PR04.MZ, 1) is a PET radioligand for the non-invasive exploration of the function of the cerebral dopamine transporter (DAT). A reliable automated process for routine production of the carbon-11 labelled analogue [(11)C]PR04.MZ ([(11)C]-1) has been developed using GMP compliant equipment. An adult female Papio anubis baboon was studied using a test-retest protocol with [(11)C]-1 in order to assess test-retest reliability, metabolism and CNS distribution profile of the tracer in non-human primates. Blood sampling was performed throughout the studies for determination of the free fraction in plasma (f(P)), plasma input functions and metabolic degradation of the radiotracer [(11)C]-1. Time-activity curves were derived for the putamen, the caudate nucleus, the ventral striatum, the midbrain and the cerebellum. Distribution volumes (V(T)) and non-displaceable binding potentials (BP(ND)) for various brain regions and the blood were obtained from kinetic modelling. [(11)C]-1 shows promising results as a selective marker of the presynaptic dopamine transporter. With the reliable visualisation of the extra-striatal dopaminergic neurons and no indication on labelled metabolites, the tracer provides excellent potential for translation into man.
