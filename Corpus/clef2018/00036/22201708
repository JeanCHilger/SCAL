The ARRONAX project. A new high-energy and high-intensity cyclotron, ARRONAX, has been set into operation in 2010. ARRONAX can accelerate both negative ions (H- and D-) and positive ions (He++ and HH+). Protons can be accelerated from 30 MeV up to 70 MeV with a maximum beam intensity of 2 × 375 μAe whereas He++ can be accelerated at 68 MeV with a maximum beam current of 70 μAe. The main fields of application of ARRONAX are radionuclide production for nuclear medicine and irradiation of inert or living materials for radiolysis and radiobiology studies. A large part of the beam time will be used to produce radionuclides for targeted radionuclide therapy (copper-67, scandium-47 and astatine-211) as well as for PET imaging (scandium-44, copper-64, strontium-82 for rubidium-82 generators and germanium-68 for gallium-68 generators). Since the beginning of the project a particular interest has been devoted to alpha-radionuclide therapy using complex ligands like antibodies and astatine-211 has been selected as a radionuclide of choice for such type of applications. Associated with appropriate carriers, all these radionuclides will respond to a maximum of unmet clinical needs.
