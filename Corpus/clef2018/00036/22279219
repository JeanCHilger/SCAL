Higher binding of the dopamine D3 receptor-preferring ligand [11C]-(+)-propyl-hexahydro-naphtho-oxazin in methamphetamine polydrug users: a positron emission tomography study. Positron emission tomography (PET) findings suggesting lower D2-type dopamine receptors and dopamine concentration in brains of stimulant users have prompted speculation that increasing dopamine signaling might help in drug treatment. However, this strategy needs to consider the possibility, based on animal and postmortem human data, that dopaminergic activity at the related D3 receptor might, in contrast, be elevated and thereby contribute to drug-taking behavior. We tested the hypothesis that D3 receptor binding is above normal in methamphetamine (MA) polydrug users, using PET and the D3-preferring ligand [11C]-(+)-propyl-hexahydro-naphtho-oxazin ([11C]-(+)-PHNO). Sixteen control subjects and 16 polydrug users reporting MA as their primary drug of abuse underwent PET scanning after [11C]-(+)-PHNO. Compared with control subjects, drug users had higher [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the D3-rich midbrain substantia nigra (SN +46%
