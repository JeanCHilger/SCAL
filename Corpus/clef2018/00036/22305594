Breast inflammation: indications for MRI and PET-CT. Breast MRI should not be used for differential diagnosis between inflammatory breast cancer and acute mastitis (AM) prior to treatment. When mastitis symptoms persist after 10 to 15 days of well-managed medical treatment, MRI may be performed in addition to an ultrasound examination, a mammogram and to taking histological samples, in order to eliminate inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). For staging, MRI would seem to be useful in looking for a contralateral lesion, PET-CT for finding information about remote metastases and in certain centres, for information about the initial extension to local/regional lymph nodes, which would guide the fields of irradiation (since patients can become lymph node negative after neoadjuvant chemotherapy). MRI and PET-CT seems to be useful for early detection of patients responding poorly to neoadjuvant chemotherapy so that the latter may be rapidly modified.
