CT of coronary heart disease: Part 2, Dual-phase MDCT evaluates late symptom recurrence in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients after revascularization. The purpose of the study was to investigate dual-phase MDCT for assessing obstructive lesions and the extent and severity of the subtending myocardium at risk in patients presenting with chest pain syndromes 9 or more months after having undergone revascularization for the treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).Dual-phase 64-MDCT was performed on 135 patients with recurring chest symptoms 9 months or more after revascularization (mean ± SD, 23 ± 11 months after index invasive angiogram for treatment of STEMI). Obstructive lesions (≥ 50% stenosis) were detected by MDCT angiography and the extent of myocardium at risk was detected by delayed phase 3D myocardium maps. A myocardium at-risk score based on MDCT findings was defined as the extent of myocardium at risk governed by the coronary lesion and weighted by lesion severity. Results were compared with stress-redistribution (201)Tl-SPECT and invasive angiography.In restenotic, new, progressive, and previously obstructive lesions that are not currently progressive, analysis of assessable segments (1966/2025, 97.1%) obtained true-positive detection rates of 88.1%, 88.6%, 82.9%, and 100%, respectively false-negative detection rates were 5.3%, 1.6%, 2.9%, and 8.8%. In 124 patients (91.9%) in whom all segments were assessable, the MDCT-based myocardium at-risk score correlated with the SPECT-based summed difference score (SDS) (r = 0.841, p < 0.001). For detecting SPECT-based SDS ≥ 1 and SDS > 3, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the MDCT-based myocardium at-risk score were 0.874 (95% CI, 0.805-0.942) and 0.938 (95% CI, 0.895-0.981), with optimal cutoff values of 2.68 and 5.01, respectively.Dual-phase MDCT is useful in detecting different patterns of obstructive lesions and the extent of myocardium at risk as an alternative for therapeutic planning in patients presenting with late symptoms after treatment for acute myocardial infarction.
