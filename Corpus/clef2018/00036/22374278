Carcinoma of unknown primary: key radiological issues from the recent National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines. Carcinoma of unknown primary origin (CUP) accounts for 3-5% of cancer cases and is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in the UK. CUP management is challenging, partly owing to the heterogeneity of the condition and its presentation, but also owing to the lack of dedicated clinical services for these patients. The recent National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on metastatic malignancy of unknown primary origin were developed to improve the co-ordination of diagnostic and clinical services at hospitals treating cancer patients in England and Wales, in particular by the setting up of CUP teams to manage these patients. Radiologists have a vital role in the diagnosis of these patients and should work closely with the CUP team to streamline the diagnostic pathway. This article summarises areas of the NICE guidelines relevant to radiology and discusses the radiological management of patients with CUP, including initial investigation, the importance of biopsy, the management of specific presentations, special investigations and organisational issues.
