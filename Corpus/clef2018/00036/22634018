Extramedullary relapse of acute myeloid leukemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: an easily overlooked but significant pattern of relapse. Acute myeloid leukemia may manifest as myeloid sarcoma in a variety of extramedullary (EM) tissues at diagnosis or at relapse. Although EM relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) has been considered to be rare, recent studies have suggested that it occurs in 5% to 12% of patients who receive alloSCT, accounting for 7% to 46% of total relapses. The incidence of EM relapse after immunomodulation (eg, donor lymphocyte infusion) or a second SCT is even higher. Moreover, patients with EM relapse are more likely to have had preceding acute graft-versus-host disease or chronic graft-versus-host disease relative to those with bone marrow relapse. Collectively, these observations suggest that the preferential occurrence of the graft-versus-leukemia effect underlies the pathogenesis of EM relapse. Establishing an early diagnosis of EM relapse has been challenging because of the immense diversity in the relapse sites however, recent studies have suggested the usefulness of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans in the detection of EM relapse. As a treatment for EM relapse, a combination of local and systemic therapy should be considered, because local therapy alone often results in subsequent systemic relapse. The prognosis for patients who develop EM relapse after SCT remains poor but is slightly better than that after bone marrow relapse. In addition to an early diagnosis with new modalities, clinical studies using new agents that may offer systemic activity while preserving the graft-versus-leukemia effect are warranted as part of an effort to improve the clinical outcome.
