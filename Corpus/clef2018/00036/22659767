Relation between popliteal-tibial artery atherosclerosis and global glycolytic metabolism in the affected diabetic foot: a pilot study using quantitative FDG-PET. We evaluated the extent and the degree of active atherosclerosis in the popliteal-tibial arteries by quantitative techniques using [(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). An effort was made to determine whether there was a positive correlation between the level of ongoing atherosclerosis and subsequent chronic ischemia in the diabetic foot.A total of 115 diabetic patients were enrolled in this prospective research study and underwent lower-extremity FDG-PET and magnetic resonance imaging. We selected 36 diabetic patients with complicated diabetic foot for this analysis (11 men, 25 women mean age, 59.5 yearsFoot SUV(max) significantly correlated (P < .05) with the ratio of popliteal-tibial artery SUV(max) to background SUV (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.49). Foot MVP was also significantly correlated (P < .05) with the ratio of popliteal-tibial artery SUV(max) to background SUV (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.69).Using FDG-PET, one may be able to detect and quantify the degree of increased metabolic activity of early active atherosclerosis and the associated chronic tissue ischemic effects at the regional level and globally throughout the whole body during the asymptomatic phase of disease.
