Immunologic and metabolic biomarkers of β-cell destruction in the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (T1D), also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is a chronic disorder that results from autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β cells in the islets of Langerhans within the pancreas ( Atkinson and Maclaren 1994). This disease becomes clinically apparent only after significant destruction of the β-cell mass, which reduces the ability to maintain glycemic control and metabolic function. In addition, it continues for years after clinical onset until, generally, there is complete destruction of insulin secretory capacity. Because prevention and therapy strategies are targeted to this pathologic process, it becomes imperative to have methods with which it can be monitored. This work discusses current research-based approaches to monitor the autoimmunity and metabolic function in T1D patients and their potential for widespread clinical application.
