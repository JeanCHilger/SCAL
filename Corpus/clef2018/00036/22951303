Prevalence and distribution of Clostridium difficile PCR ribotypes in cats and dogs from animal shelters in Thuringia, Germany. Clostridium difficile is an important cause of nosocomial diarrhoea in humans. Pet animals and livestock are discussed as potential natural reservoirs and sources of infection. In this study faecal samples from dogs and cats were collected at 10 animal shelters in Thuringia, Germany. C. difficile was isolated from 9 out of 165 (5.5%) canine and 5 out of 135 (3.7%) feline samples. Five PCR ribotypes (010, 014/020, 039, 045, SLO 066) were identified. PCR ribotypes 010 and 014/020 were detected in more than one shelter and PCR ribotypes 014/020 and 045 were isolated from dogs and cats. MLVA profiles of strains of a PCR ribotype from one shelter were identical or closely related, while strains of the same PCR ribotype from different shelters showed significant differences. This study shows that dogs and cats kept in animal shelters are a reservoir of C. difficile PCR ribotypes which can infect also humans.
