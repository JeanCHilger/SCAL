The role and clinical value of thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy in ischemic heart disease. To define the role and clinical value of thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy in ischemic heart disease, 967 consecutive patients referred to our laboratory since 1985 were studied. The purpose of scintigraphy has changed from diagnosing myocardial ischemia to assessing myocardial viability with the progress of coronary angioplasty. At present, thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy has become an indispensable noninvasive method for the management of patients with ischemic heart disease.
