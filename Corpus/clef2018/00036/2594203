SPECT bone scintigraphy of benign and malignant lesions of the spine. 70 patients were examined with planar and SPECT bone scintigraphy. SPECT proved to be superior over planar bone scanning for imaging of traumatic, inflammatory, and malignant bone lesions. SPECT provides three-dimensional information and, therefore, delineates the exact location and extension of lesions. It also has a higher sensitivity than planar bone scintigraphy. The three-dimensional bone scan generates complementary diagnostic information which often facilitates an adequate therapy protocol.
