Positron emission tomography in schizophrenic patients with and without neuroleptic medication. Positron emission tomography using [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose was performed in nine chronic schizophrenic patients both when medication-free and when medicated with neuroleptics. Total brain cortex, temporal cortex, and basal ganglia glucose use was significantly increased with medication however, there was no change in anterior/posterior metabolic gradients.
