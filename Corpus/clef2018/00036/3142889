SPECT measurements with 99mTc-HM-PAO in focal epilepsy. The ability of SPECT measurements with [99mTc]-HM-PAO (Ceretec) to find the location of the epileptic focus was studied in patients under consideration for neurosurgical treatment for therapy-resistant focal epilepsy. The location of low [99mTc]-HM-PAO uptake regions found at interictal measurements, and of high [99mTc]-HM-PAO uptake regions found at ictal measurements, was compared to the findings of extensive ictal and interictal EEG examinations, and to the results of CT and MRT. While EEG revealed focal epileptic activity in all of the 14 patients, SPECT showed regional abnormalities in 13 (93%). CT and MRT showed abnormal findings in 30%.
