Myocardial positron tomography with manganese-52m. The biodistribution of radiomanganese (54Mn) was studied in mice, rats, and dogs. Disappearance of radioactivity from the blood was extremely rapid, with a half-time of approximately 0.8 minutes. This resulted in very favorable myocardium-to-blood ratios, even at early times after administration. The myocardial uptake in dogs was greater than 3% at three and 15 minutes, with myocardium-to-blood ratios of about 40:1 at 15 minutes. Positron tomograms obtained with 52mMn clearly demonstrated regional myocardial perfusion. There was good correlation (r = 0.89) of microsphere-to-radiomanganese distribution in the infarcted dog heart.
