Targeting radiopharmaceuticals: comparative biodistribution studies of gallium and indium complexes of multidentate ligands. New multidentate ligands with structures similar to N,N'-bis[2-hydroxybenzyl]ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (HBED) and N,N'-bis(pyridoxyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (PLED) were synthesized. The in vitro lipophilicity, electrophoretic behavior, and the in vitro biodistribution were studied for the 111In- and 67, 68Ga-complexes of N,N'-bis(2-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylbenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (Me4HBED) N,N'-bis(5-t-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-methylbenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'-diac eti c acid (t-butyl HBED)
