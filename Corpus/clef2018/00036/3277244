Colorectal tumors: scintigraphy with In-111 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody and correlation with surgical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical findings. A prospective clinical study of 17 patients with a histologic diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma proved at colonoscopy and surgery was performed with indium-111 anticarcinoembryonic-antigen (CEA) monoclonal antibody (MoAb), ZCE-025. MoAb scanning depicted nine of 16 primary colorectal carcinomas on planar scintigrams (true-positive findings = 56%) and ten of 16 lesions on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans (true-positive findings = 62%). Liver metastases were detected in three of three patients, and lymph node metastases were detected in one of four patients. Immunohistochemical examination for CEA in resected colorectal cancer tissues demonstrated a positive correlation between MoAb imaging of primary lesions and cytoplasmic-stromal intracellular CEA distribution. There was no correlation between CEA serum levels and lesion detectability with MoAb scanning.
