Automated body contour detection in SPECT: effects on quantitative studies. To perform accurate in vivo quantitation by single photon emission computed tomography, we have developed a new method for detecting body contours for the correction of tissue attenuation. Our method can rapidly derive the best fit contours throughout the body by using the measured axial length of the patient body and Fourier filtering the detected contours which are defined by a unique bit-plane algorithm. We have also evaluated the effects of the body contours on the reconstructed images by using various attenuation correction techniques including a precorrection method (Sorenson, 1974), a postcorrection method (Chang, 1978), a weighted backprojection method, and a radial post correction method (Tanaka, 1983 and 1984). Counts in the specified region-of-interest in phantom images reconstructed by the radial postcorrection, weighted backprojection, and postcorrection methods were more strongly affected by inaccurately detected contours than were counts derived from images reconstructed by the precorrection method.
