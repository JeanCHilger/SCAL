Positron emission tomography in minor ischemic stroke using oxygen-15 steady-state technique. A study with positron emission tomography (PET) was performed on 10 patients with ischemic stroke and mild disability. The patients underwent cerebral angiography, x-ray computed tomography (CT) scan and regional cerebral measurements of CBF, CMRO2, oxygen extraction ratio (OER), and cerebral blood volume (CBV). Only minor arterial involvement was detected by angiography. In all patients, PET images of functional defects were more extensive than the corresponding CT hypodensity, and there were statistically significant reductions in CBF, CMRO2, and CBF/CBV ratio as compared with control subjects. Half of the regions analyzed in the affected hemisphere demonstrated a disruption of the normal coupling between CBF and CMRO2 as reflected by OER values significantly higher or lower than those of the corresponding region of the contralateral hemisphere. The pathophysiological pattern of high OER combined with a reduction in CBF proportionally greater than the reduction in CMRO2 was particularly indicative of regional chronic hemodynamic compromise in these patients.
