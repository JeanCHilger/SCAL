Painful pseudarthrosis following lumbar spinal fusion: detection by combined SPECT and planar bone scintigraphy. Twenty-six adult patients more than 6-months post-lumbar spinal fusion were studied. Flexion and extension radiographs showing motion or bone scintigrams showing focal areas of increased activity within the fusion mass were considered positive for pseudarthrosis. Patients were classified as either symptomatic or asymptomatic. Among the 15 symptomatic patients, scintigraphy had a sensitivity of 0.78 and a specificity of 0.83 which was superior to the 0.43 sensitivity and 0.50 specificity of radiography. Six of the 11 asymptomatic patients had focal areas of increased activity in the bony fusion mass, possibly reflecting painless pseudarthrosis. Planar imaging was substantially enhanced by SPECT in 14 of the 26 cases. It is concluded that for the patient who remains symptomatic after lumbar spinal fusion, bone scintigraphy with SPECT is of significant value in detecting painful pseudarthrosis.
