Clinical brain imaging with isopropyl-iodoamphetamine and SPECT. In recent years, fierce competition has developed between the new high technology specialties of ultrasound, nuclear medicine, computerized transmission tomography, and most recently, nuclear magnetic resonance. Conventional brain scintigraphy, once the most common nuclear medicine procedure, has fallen victim to this rivalry despite the fact that routine scintigraphy remains a good diagnostic test. The agony of this defeat initially caused self-doubt among nuclear medicine physicians, but out of this gloom has emerged a number of radionuclide tests which have the potential to revolutionize how clinical neurology/psychiatry is practiced.
