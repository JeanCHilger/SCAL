Brain MRI and SPET in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We describe 5 cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) with neurological manifestations. All of the patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following recovery two underwent single photon emission tomography (SPET) during the acute phase of the disease. SPET showed reduced cerebral blood flow, whereas the results of brain MRI were normal in all patients. Plasma exchange (PE) treatment was promptly instituted in all cases. Our findings show that prompt treatment with PE may avoid permanent brain damage even when the neurological signs and symptoms are relate to brain ischemia.
