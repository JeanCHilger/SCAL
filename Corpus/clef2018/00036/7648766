Central nervous system effects of subdissociative doses of (S)-ketamine are related to plasma and brain concentrations measured with positron emission tomography in healthy volunteers. Plasma concentrations, maximum regional brain concentrations, and specific regional binding in the brain after administration of 0, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/kg doses of (S)-ketamine were measured in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in five volunteers and were related to induced effects such as analgesia, amnesia, and mood changes. Specific binding in the brain was assessed by simultaneous administration of (S)-[N-methyl-11C]ketamine quantified by positron emission tomography. High radioactivities in the brain corresponded to regional distribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complexes. A significant and dose-dependent reduction of binding was measured as a result of displacement of (S)-[N-methyl-11C]ketamine. Memory impairment and psychotomimetic effects were related to dose, plasma concentration 4 minutes after administration, and decreased regional binding of (S)-ketamine in the brain and were consistently seen at plasma and maximum regional brain (S)-ketamine concentrations higher than 70 and 500 ng/ml, respectively. The magnitude of specific binding of (S)-ketamine, measured with positron emission tomography, can be related directly to drug effects.
