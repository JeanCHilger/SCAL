Imaging modalities and low back pain: the role of bone scintigraphy. The role of bone scintigraphy, both planar and single photon emission tomography (SPET), in investigating cases of chronic back pain is assessed in conjunction with other imaging modalities. A review of the literature was undertaken and an imaging strategy is suggested. It is concluded that bone scintigraphy has an important role as an imaging modality in investigating cases of chronic low back pain.
