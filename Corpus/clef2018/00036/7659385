Myocardial metabolism of 123I-BMIPP in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: assessment by radial long-axis SPET. To elucidate the metabolism of free fatty acid in the myocardium of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), SPET was performed with 123I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-R,S-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP), an analogue of free fatty acid, and with 201Tl in nine patients with HCM and eight healthy volunteers who acted as controls. For quantitative analysis of the apical area, a radial long-axis tomogram was reconstructed every 6 degrees after short-axis tomography. The relative regional uptake (RRU, %) in each segment was obtained by normalizing to the maximal value among all segments. The 3-h washout rate was calculated both for BMIPP and for 201Tl. The ratio of the RRU of BMIPP to that of 201Tl was significantly lower in the apical and antero-septal regions compared with other walls (P < 0.01) in the patients with HCM, whereas uptake of both BMIPP and 201Tl in the controls was homogeneous and there was a significant correlation between them. The coefficient of variation (CV) in all segments in the HCM patients was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than that of the controls both BMIPP and 201Tl, indicating inhomogeneous uptake of BMIPP in the HCM patients. The washout rate of BMIPP over 3 h was significantly higher in the patients with HCM (mean +/- S.D. 26.3 +/- 7.3%) than the controls (18.3 +/- 7.5%, P < 0.05). The ratio of segmental washout rate of BMIPP to that of 201Tl in the HCM patients was increased, especially in the septum and apex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
