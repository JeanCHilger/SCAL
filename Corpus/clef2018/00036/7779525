Regional cerebral blood flow, blood volume, oxygen extraction fraction, and oxygen utilization rate in normal volunteers measured by the autoradiographic technique and the single breath inhalation method. By means of a high resolution PET scanner, the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), cerebral blood volume (rCBV), oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF), and metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2) for major cerebral gyri and deep brain structures were studied in eleven normal volunteers during an eye-covered and ear-unplugged resting condition. Regional CBF was measured by the autoradiographic method after intravenous administration of H2(15)O. Regional OEF and rCMRO2 were measured by the single inhalation of 15O2. With MR T1-weighted images as an anatomical reference, thirteen major cerebral gyri, caudate nucleus, lentiform nucleus, thalamus, midbrain, pons, cerebellum and vermis were defined on the CMRO2 images. Values were read by using circular regions of interest 16 mm in diameter. The posterior part of the cingulate gyri had the highest rCBF and rCMRO2 values among brain structures, followed by the lentiform nucleus, the cerebellum, the caudate nucleus, and the thalamus. Parahippocampal gyri had the lowest rCBF and rCMRO2 values among the cortical gyri. Regional OEF for the pontine nuclei (0.34 +/- 0.04), the midbrain (0.35 +/- 0.05), the parahippocampal gyri (0.35 +/- 0.04 for the right and 0.37 +/- 0.05 for the left), and the thalami (0.37 +/- 0.05 for the right and 0.36 +/- 0.04 for the left) were significantly lower than the mean OEF for the cerebral cortices (0.42 +/- 0.04) (p < 0.05 or less). The global CBF and CMRO2 were consistent with those obtained by the Kety-Schmidt method.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
