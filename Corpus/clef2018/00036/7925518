Effects of nisoldipine therapy on myocardial perfusion and neuro-hormonal status in patients with severe ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction. The effects of nisoldipine on regional myocardial perfusion and neuro-hormonal status were assessed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 32 patients. All patients had ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, with a left ventricular ejection fraction between 25% and 35% per protocol, they were stratified according to concomitant use of ACE inhibitors. After baseline measurements at rest, including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with Tc-MIBI, plasma neuro-hormones (norepinephrine, renin, arginine vasopressin, atrial natriuretic peptide) and echocardiography, the patients were randomized to nisoldipine (core coat tablet, 20 mg once daily
