Parietal lobe epilepsy: clinical features and seizure localization by ictal SPECT. We studied clinical and ictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) features in 14 patients with parietal lobe epilepsy, nine of whom had structural parietal lobe lesions. Thirteen patients had simple partial seizures of somatosensory (eight), psychic (four), and motor (nine) types. Complex partial seizures (CPS) occurred in seven patients six were psychoparetic (prominent staring, relative immobility) and one had hyperkinetic activity. Seizures lasted 7 to 110 seconds
