Influence of exercise-induced coronary artery spasm on thallium-201 initial distribution and washout kinetics in patients with variant and classic angina pectoris. Thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography was performed immediately, and 2 and 4 hours after exercise-induced anginal attack in 2 groups of patients with either exercise-induced coronary spasm or severe fixed stenosis on the isolated proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. All patients with variant angina had transient ST-segment elevation during the exercise-induced attack for thallium-201 scintigraphic study. Both perfusion defects and 4-hour washout abnormalities were significantly greater in patients with variant angina than in those with stable effort angina (p < 0.01). In patients with stable effort angina, thallium-201 activity in ischemic regions (as a percentage of initial count in the normal region) progressively decreased, whereas in patients with variant angina it increased from 38% (initial) to 48% (2 hours), and then declined to 42% (4 hours). The initial normalized thallium-201 activity in the ischemic regions was significantly lower in patients with variant angina than in those with stable effort angina (p < 0.001). In conclusion, perfusion and washout abnormalities during exercise-induced angina are greater in patients with variant angina than in those with stable effort angina. Exercise-induced coronary spasm seems to contribute to the profound reduction in initial thallium-201 distribution and delayed thallium-201 accumulation in the ischemic region.
