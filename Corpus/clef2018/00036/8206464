Functional significance of calcinosis of the basal ganglia via positron emission tomography. Four patients with symmetrical basal ganglia calcification of different etiologies detected by cranial computed tomography (CT) were clinically evaluated and underwent positron emission tomography (PET) with (18F)-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). All patients were subjected to extensive laboratory investigation and neuropsychological testing. In two patients we found typical laboratory signs of hypoparathyroidism, the other two patients had no endocrinological alterations. Changes of glucose metabolism were mainly detected only in calcified tissues. Particularly in two patients with test psychologically confirmed psychomotoric retardation we did not find any cortical dysfunction. In conclusion, basal ganglia calcification in contrast to primary degenerative diseases has no influence on metabolic function in tissue that is not calcified.
