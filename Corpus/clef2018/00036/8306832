Immunoscintigraphy with 111In-satumomab pendetide in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma: performance and impact on clinical management. The role of immunoscintigraphy with 111In-satumomab pendetide in the medical and/or surgical management of colorectal cancer patients was evaluated in a multicenter trial.This 103 patient study population included 46 individuals with rising serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels and otherwise negative diagnostic evaluation, 29 patients with known recurrence, presumed to be isolated and resectable, and 28 patients for whom standard diagnostic tests provided equivocal information.No adverse reactions were noted following intravenous administration of 1 mg of satumomab pendetide radiolabeled with approximately 5 mCi of 111In. Thirty percent of patients developed human anti-mouse antibodies postinfusion. In the 84 patients for whom correlation with histopathologic, diagnostic, and/or clinical findings was available, antibody imaging demonstrated a sensitivity of 73 percent in patients with confirmed tumor (36/49) and negative results for all 35 patients with no evidence of malignancy. Occult disease was detected in 18 patients.111In-satumomab pendetide immunoscintigraphy was helpful in the medical and/or surgical management of 45 (44 percent) patients and provided information unavailable from other diagnostic modalities.
