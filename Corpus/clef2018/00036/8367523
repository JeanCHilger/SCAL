Measuring astatine-211 distributions with SPECT. We have investigated standard SPECT techniques (rotating gamma cameras, multi-hole collimators, and filtered backprojection reconstruction) for imaging astatine-211 distributions. Since 211At emits alpha particles, this nuclide has potential for use in radiotherapy. The capability of imaging this nuclide would allow in vivo evaluation of the distribution and stability of potential 211At-labelled radiotherapeutic agents. 211At decay yields x-rays in the 77-92 keV range in addition to 500-900 keV gamma rays. This study evaluates the feasibility of SPECT imaging using the x-ray emissions of 211At. We have evaluated several collimators, with the determination that the medium-energy collimators we used are suitable, with 7% penetration (uncollimated counts versus collimated counts). Several phantoms were imaged and attenuation coefficients were measured (narrow-beam mu = 0.182 cm-1 for 77-80 keV x-rays in water). Reconstructed images demonstrate qualitative capabilities and a simple quantitative study demonstrates good correction for attenuation and scatter (approximately 10% error), at low count densities, at least for the phantom geometries used in this study.
