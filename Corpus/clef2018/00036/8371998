Nuclear medicine diagnosis of focal liver lesions. Confirmation and exclusion of benign focal liver lesions are the main object of liver studies in nuclear medicine. Hepatobiliary sequence scintigraphy (focal nodular hyperplasia, adenoma), blood pool scintigraphy (hemangioma) and, in some cases, colloid scintigraphy are the methods most frequently employed. Receptor scintigraphy with octreopeptides, immunoscintigraphy with monoclonal antibodies, PET and gamma camera scintigraphy with 18FDG, are used to solve special diagnostic problems, particularly in oncology. A stepwise diagnostic approach needs to be used for a successful classification of focal liver lesions and an extensive knowledge of indications for additional supplementary diagnostic procedures is required.
