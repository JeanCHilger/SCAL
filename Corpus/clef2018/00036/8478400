PET study of changes in local brain hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism after unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion in baboons. Local cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism were measured by positron emission tomography (PET) with the oxygen-15 (15O) steady-state method in baboons, immediately before (T0), 1 (T1), and 3-4 (T2) h after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). At T1, there was a marked fall in both cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the CBF/cerebral blood volume (CBV) ratio in the occluded territory these changes were sustained at T2, indicating stable reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure and lack of spontaneous reperfusion within this time range. Compared with preocclusion conditions, the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in the occluded territory was elevated at both T1 and T2, indicative of a persistent oligemia/ischemia for up to 3 h after MCAO. At T2, however, this OEF increase had lessened, concomitantly with a decline in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). This impairment of oxidative metabolism occurred earlier in the deep, compared with the cortical, MCA territories
