Supplementary sensorimotor area seizure and ictal single-photon emission tomography. Focal tonic seizures [supplementary motor seizures in the terminology of Penfield and Jasper (1) are often difficult to diagnose in terms of this chapter was undertaken to investigate whether ictal single-photon emission CT (SPECT) scanning could contribute to the diagnostic accuracy of this epileptic condition. In 15 patients (mean age, 21.3 years ranges, 3 to 39 years) suffering from focal tonic seizures as the initial and most prominent seizure type, ictal SPECT scans were obtained after injection of 99mTc HMPAO within 30 seconds after clinical seizure onset. In 6 patients (40%
