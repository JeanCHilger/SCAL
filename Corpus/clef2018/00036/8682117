Comparison of exercise stress testing with simultaneous dobutamine stress echocardiography and technetium-99m isonitrile single-photon emission computerized tomography for diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The object of our study was to compare the value of exercise stress testing with simultaneous dobutamine stress echocardiography and technetium-99m isonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Sixty-nine patients with either suspected or proven coronary artery disease underwent simultaneous dobutamine technetium-99m isonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography and stress echocardiography, and treadmill exercise electrocardiography. Dobutamine echocardiography and technetium-99m isonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography revealed a higher overall sensitivity than exercise testing (94 vs 60%, P < 0.001), but dobutamine stress echocardiography showed a higher specificity than both technetium-99m isonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography and exercise testing (86 vs 64%, P < 0.05, for both tests). In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of dobutamine stress echocardiography and technetium-99m isonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography was higher than that of exercise testing (91 vs 61%, P < 0.001 86 vs 61%, P < 0.001, respectively). Dobutamine stress echocardiography and technetium-99m isonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography are superior to exercise testing in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, and dobutamine stress echocardiography can act as an alternative to technetium-99m isonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography.
