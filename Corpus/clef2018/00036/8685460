Scintigraphic characterization of expansive lesions located in the adrenals. Comparison with magnetic resonance imaging. In this study, 35 patients (11 men and 24 women, mean age 47 +/- 16 years) with unilateral adrenal masses underwent nor-cholesterol (nor-Chol) (n = 11), metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) (n = 15) or nor-Chol and MIBG (n = 9) radionuclide studies. In all patients Magnetic Resonance (MR) adrenal imaging was also performed. In 19 (54%) patients, no laboratory abnormalities of adrenal function were observed. In the other 16 (46%) patients, adrenal hyperfunction was found. In 21 lesions, histology showed 10 pheochromocytomas (Pheos), 6 adenomas, 3 metastases, 1 cyst and 1 nodular focal liver hyperplasia. In the remaining 14 lesions, increased cortisol (n = 4) or aldosterone (n = 2) levels and/or intense nor-Chol uptake (n = 14) were considered suggestive of adenoma. Diagnostic accuracy of both nor-Chol and MIBG radionuclide studies in correctly identifying adenoma or Pheos was 100%. Conversely, qualitative MR signal intensity (SI) analysis on T2-weighted images did not allow to accurately distinguish lesions of different nature. In particular, 10 Pheos, 8 adenomas, 3 mestastasis and 1 cyst clearly showed on T2-weighted images higher SI than the liver 5 adenomas had a slight higher SI
