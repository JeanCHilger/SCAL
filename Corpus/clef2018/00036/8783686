Neuroimaging findings in patients with AIDS. An increasing number of patients are presenting with central nervous system complications of human immunodeficiency virus infection. New imaging technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance proton spectroscopy, single-photon emission computed tomography, and positron emission tomography are playing an ever-increasing role in the diagnosis of these complications. As therapeutic modes improve, imaging may assume a growing role in monitoring the responses to therapy among these patients.
