Improvement of oxygen metabolic reserve after extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery in patients with severe haemodynamic insufficiency. The effectiveness of extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass (EC-IC bypass) surgery on impaired haemodynamic status was studied in 12 patients with reduced regional cerebral perfusion pressure (rCPP) and elevated regional oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF) in the area distal to the symptomatic arterial lesion. Postoperative positron emission tomography (PET) study demonstrated a statistically significant decrease of rOEF in the operated hemispheres with disappearance of the pre-operative interhemispheric rOEF difference. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional cerebral oxygen metabolism (rCMRO2) were also increased in the operated hemispheres with disappearance of the pre-operative interhemispheric differences. Regional CBF/regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) ratios of the symptomatic hemispheres were increased after surgery, but were still lower than in the contralateral hemispheres. We conclude that EC-IC bypass surgery improves impaired cerebral oxygen metabolic reserve.
