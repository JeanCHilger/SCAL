Do organic solvents induce changes in the dopaminergic system? Positron emission tomography studies of occupationally exposed subjects. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that long-term occupational exposure to organic solvents may effect the levels and turnover of dopamine in man.A study was performed on 17 patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms due to occupational solvent exposure, and 11 healthy non-exposed male volunteers (controls). Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to assess striatal dopaminergic function, using L-[11C]DOPA, [11C]nomifensine and [11C]raclopride as tracers.The rate of dopamine synthesis was significantly increased among subjects with occupational exposure to organic solvents compared with non-exposed controls. After controlling for the difference in age between exposed and controls, the effect of solvent exposure became less apparent and was reduced from +32% (P = 0.009) to +25% (P = 0.07). There were no differences with regard to the binding of [11C]nomifensine. Patients with and without the diagnosis of toxic encephalopathy did not differ with regard to their putaminal uptake of L-[11C]DOPA, [11C]nomifensine and [11C]raclopride.The data support the hypothesis that long-term exposure to organic solvents may increase the rate of dopamine synthesis in the brain without affecting the number of presynaptic terminals or postsynaptic dopamine receptors.
