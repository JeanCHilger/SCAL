Behavioral disorders in psittacines. 2: Therapeutic measures. The main principal in the treatment of behavioural disorders in psittacines consists of optimizing the keeping conditions which have to be ruled out by precise anamnesis. Wounds caused by automutilation require a collar to be put around the patient's neck. This, however, is not a method for longterm preventing of feather plucking. A balanced diet that takes into account the bird's natural behaviour in food intake, larger cages and suitable toys as well as close relationship between bird and bird keeper are changes that should be achieved. Manifest behavioural disorders can only be treated successfully by keeping the bird together with a partner. Exceptionally this may be a bird of a different species. The problems of abnormal fixation to human beings are discussed.
