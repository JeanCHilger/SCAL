Therapeutic possibilities in metastatic pheochromocytoma. Malignant pheochromocytomas are rare. Although 5-year survival is less than 50%, the prognosis varies. Some patients, even those with extensive metastases, have been followed up for many years. If the tumor tissue's uptake is adequate (> 5 Gy/100 mCi) the therapeutic use of 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidin (131I-MIBG) is at present the therapy of first choice. The use of cytostatic chemotherapy should be limited to patients with rapidly progressive disease.
