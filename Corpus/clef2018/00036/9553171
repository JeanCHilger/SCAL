Preliminary application of dynamic pulmonary xenon-133 single-photon emission tomography in the evaluation of patients with pulmonary emphysema for thoracoscopic lung volume reduction surgery. Dynamic pulmonary xenon-133 single-photon emission tomography (SPET) with three-dimensional (3D) displays was preliminarily applied to select resection targets for thoracoscopic lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) and to assess regional ventilatory changes following surgery. Dynamic SPET was performed using a triple-detector SPET system in 14 patients with pulmonary emphysema before and after LVRS. After reconstructing colour-illuminated, surface-rendered 3D images of equilibrium (EQ) and 3-min washout (WO3), a single 3D fusion display was created from these two different time-course image sets, in which the 3D WO3 image indicating 133Xe retention was visible through the overlying 3D EQ image delineating lung contours. Volumetric extent of retention on this display was quantified by a 133Xe retention index, defined as the ratio (%) of total pixel numbers of segmented 3-min WO data to those of EQ data. 133Xe SPET and appropriately thresholded 3D displays efficiently localized a total of 36 retention sites 19 (52.7%) of these sites were not localized by CT because they were within the widely or homogeneously spreading non-bullous emphysematous lung tissues. The 3D displays enhanced the perception of anatomical configurations and the extent of 133Xe retention compared with multislice tomograms. Postoperatively, 3D fusion display visualized the details of regional changes in retention, and changes in the retention index on the 3D display with a standardized threshold correlated well with changes in 133Xe clearance time (T1/2) and %FEV1 (r = 0.881 and 0. 856, respectively
