Effect of recombinant alpha-interferon on pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, toxicity, and efficacy of 131I-labeled monoclonal antibody CC49 in breast cancer: a phase II trial. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that recombinant IFN-alpha (rIFN-alpha) can enhance the tumor associated glycoprotein 72 (TAG-72) on tumors. To determine whether rIFN-alpha could enhance TAG-72 expression in vivo in patients, 15 women with breast cancer were randomized to receive daily injections of rIFN-alpha (3 x 10(6) units/m2 for 14 days) beginning on day 1 (group 1 = 7 patients) or on day 6 (group 2 = 8 patients). On day 3, all patients received a 10-20-mCi tracer dose of 131I-CC49, a high-affinity murine monoclonal antibody reactive against TAG-72, followed by a therapy dose of 60-75 mCi/m2 of 131I-CC49 on day 6. Whole body and single-photon emission computed tomography scans along with whole blood pharmacokinetics were performed following tracer and treatment phases. Hematological toxicity was considerable reversible grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was observed in 12 of 15 patients. Twelve of 14 patients tested developed human antimouse antibodies 3-6 weeks after treatment. For group 1 patients, whole blood residence time increased significantly between that predicted from the tracer doses and therapy doses (42.6 +/- 4.7 versus 51.5 +/- 4.8 h, respectively
