Assessment of myocardial viability by dobutamine echocardiography, positron emission tomography and thallium-201 SPECT: correlation with histopathology in explanted hearts. We examined the relationship among viability assessment by dobutamine echocardiography (DE), positron emission tomography (PET) and thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (TI-SPECT) to the degree of fibrosis.DE, PET and TI-SPECT have been shown to be sensitive in identifying viability of asynergic myocardium. However, PET and TI-SPECT indicated viability in a significant percentage of segments without dobutamine response or functional improvement after revascularization.Twelve patients with coronary artery disease and severely reduced left ventricular function (EF 14.5+/-5.2%) were studied with DE prior to cardiac transplantation: 5 had additional PET and 7 had TI-SPECT studies. Results of the three techniques were compared to histologic findings of the explanted hearts.Segments with >75% viable myocytes by histology were determined to be viable in 78%, 89% and 87% by DE, PET and TI-SPECT those with 50-75% viable myocytes in 71%, 50% and 87%, respectively. Segments with 25-50% viable myocytes showed response to dobutamine in only 15%, but were viable in 60% by PET and 82% by TI-SPECT. Segments with <25% viable myocytes responded to dobutamine in 19%These findings suggest that contractile reserve as evidenced by a positive dobutamine response requires at least 50% viable myocytes in a given segment whereas scintigraphic methods also identify segments with less viable myocytes. Thus, the methods may provide complementary information: Nuclear techniques appear to be highly sensitive for the detection of myocardial viability, and negative tests make it highly unlikely that a significant number of viable myocytes are present in a given segment. Conversely, dobutamine echo may be particularly useful for predicting recovery of systolic function after revascularization.
