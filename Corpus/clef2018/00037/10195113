Right parietal cortex is involved in the perception of sound movement in humans. Changes in the delay (phase) and amplitude of sound at the ears are cues for the analysis of sound movement. The detection of these cues depends on the convergence of the inputs to each ear, a process that first occurs in the brainstem. The conscious perception of these cues is likely to involve higher centers. Using novel stimuli that produce different perceptions of movement in the presence of identical phase and amplitude modulation components, we have demonstrated human brain areas that are active specifically during the perception of sound movement. Both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrated the involvement of the right parietal cortex in sound movement perception with these stimuli.
