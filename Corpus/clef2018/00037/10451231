Prediction of coronary artery lesions in unstable angina by iodine 123 beta-methyl iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP), a fatty acid analogue, single photon emission computed tomography at rest. Iodine 123 beta-methyl iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (123I-BMIPP), a beta-methyl-branched fatty acid analogue, has been proven by experimental studies to reveal abnormalities in fatty-acid-related metabolism. This study was undertaken to validate the accuracy and limitations of 123I-BMIPP imaging at rest in detecting myocardial metabolic abnormalities and predicting coronary lesions in unstable angina (UA). One hundred UA patients without prior myocardial infarction were studied. 123I-BMIPP and thallium 201 chloride (201TlCl) imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and coronary and left ventricular cineangiography (LVC) were performed 1 week after the last episode of angina. There was reduced uptake of 123I-BMIPP imaging in 70 patients, reduced uptake of 201TlCl in 41, and abnormal LVC contraction in 49 patients. There were significant increases in severity scores of 123I-BMIPP imaging along with increases in the number of stenosed coronary arteries and the severity of stenosis in individual coronary arteries. There was a significant reduction in 123I-BMIPP severity scores 1 month after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (p < 0.01) and a significant correlation between the severity scores of 123I-BMIPP and LVC (r=0. 579, p<0.001). Overall rates of sensitivity and specificity in detecting significant coronary stenosis by 123I-BMIPP imaging were 74% and 86%, respectively, whereas rates of sensitivity and specificity in detecting significant coronary stenosis by 201TlCl were 31% and 91%, respectively. 123I-BMIPP sensitivity increases to 86% if only advanced coronary stenosis of >90% is included. In conclusion, 123I-BMIPP myocardial imaging is an effective method of predicting coronary artery lesions of UA patients without provocative test.
