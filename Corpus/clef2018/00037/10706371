Neuroanatomical correlates of implicit and explicit memory for structurally possible and impossible visual objects. Implicit memory refers to nonconscious retrieval of past experience demonstrated by facilitation in test performance on tasks that do not require intentional recollection of previous experiences. Explicit memory, in contrast, refers to the conscious retrieval of prior information, as demonstrated during standard recall and recognition tasks. In this experiment, positron emission tomographic (PET) measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), a marker of local neuronal activity, were used to identify and contrast brain regions that participate in the perception, implicit memory, and explicit memory for structurally possible and impossible visual objects. Ten CBF images were acquired in 16 normal women as they made possible/impossible and old/new recognition decisions about previously studied (old) and nonstudied (new) structurally possible and impossible objects. As reported previously, object decisions for familiar possible objects were associated with increased CBF in the vicinity of the left inferior temporal and fusiform gyri and recognition memory for familiar possible objects was associated with increased CBF in the vicinity of the right hippocampus. In this report, we provide more extensive analyses of the roles of the inferior temporal cortex, the hippocampus, the parahippocampus, and the pulvinar in encoding and retrieval operations. Additionally, patterns of CBF increases and decreases provide information regarding the neural structures involved in implicit and explicit memory.
