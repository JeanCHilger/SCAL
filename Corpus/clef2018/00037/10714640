Mammalian microsporidiosis. The phylum Microspora contains a diverse group of single-celled, obligate intracellular protozoa sharing a unique organelle, the polar filament, and parasitizing a wide variety of invertebrate and vertebrate animals, including insects, fish, birds, and mammals. Encephalitozoon cuniculi is the classic microsporidial parasite of mammals, and encephalitozoonosis in rabbits and rodents has been and continues to be recognized as a confounding variable in animal-based biomedical research. Although contemporary research colonies are screened for infection with this parasite, E. cuniculi remains a cause of morbidity and mortality in pet and conventionally raised rabbits. In addition, E. cuniculi is a potential pathogen of immature domestic dogs and farm-raised foxes. The recent discovery and identification of Encephalitozoon intestinalis, Encephalitozoon hellem, and Enterocytozoon bieneusi, in addition to E. cuniculi, as opportunistic pathogens of humans have renewed interest in the Microspora. Veterinary pathologists, trained in the comparative anatomy of multiple animal species and infectious disease processes, are in a unique position to contribute to the diagnosis and knowledge of the pathogenesis of these parasitic diseases. This review article covers the life cycle, ultrastructure, and biology of mammalian microsporaidia and the clinical disease and lesions seen in laboratory and domestic animals, particularly as they relate to Encephalitozoon species. Human microsporidial disease and animal models of human infection are also addressed. Often thought of as rabbit pathogens of historical importance, E. cuniculi and the related mammalian microsporidia are emerging as significant opportunistic pathogens of immunocompromised individuals.
