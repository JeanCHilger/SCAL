Functional imaging of craving. To visualize brain activity associated with mental states, such as craving for alcohol and other drugs (AODs), researchers have begun to use functional imaging techniques. Three commonly used techniques are single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Studies using these three approaches have been reviewed in order to evaluate the validity of a proposed model of the brain regions involved in alcoholism and the craving for alcohol. This model suggests a central role for a connected group of brain regions that include the basal ganglia, thalamus, and orbital cortex. A study using SPECT technology in alcoholics, however, found altered brain activity in only some of those regions during craving. Additional studies in alcoholics, as well as cocaine users, identified several other brain regions whose activities appeared to change in response to craving. These studies have led to the development of a revised model of brain regions involved in craving for AODs. Numerous questions remain, however, that must be answered before the brain areas involved in craving can be identified conclusively.
