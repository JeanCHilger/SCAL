Changes in respiratory control in humans induced by 8 h of hyperoxia. In humans, 8 h of isocapnic hypoxia causes a progressive rise in ventilation associated with increases in the acute ventilatory responses to hypoxia (AHVR) and hypercapnia (AHCVR). To determine whether 8 h of hyperoxia causes the converse of these effects, three 8-h protocols were compared in 14 subjects: 1) poikilocapnic hyperoxia, with end-tidal PO(2) (PET(O(2))) = 300 Torr and end-tidal PCO(2) (PET(CO(2))) uncontrolled 2) isocapnic hyperoxia, with PET(O(2)) = 300 Torr and PET(CO(2)) maintained at the subject's normal air-breathing level
