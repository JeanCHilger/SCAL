Age-related changes in apparent digestibility in growing kittens. The ability of the growing kitten to digest protein, fat, carbohydrate, dry-matter and energy were assessed. Kittens were divided into two groups one group was fed a wet diet, the other a dry diet. Both groups were allowed ad libitum access to food. Apparent digestibility of the two diets, and kitten bodyweights were measured over a 24-week period. There were no significant differences in mean bodyweight between the two groups. Digestible energy intake of the kittens decreased with increased age
