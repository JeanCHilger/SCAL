Animal-assisted activity and infection control implications in a healthcare setting. Animal-assisted activity/therapy (AAA/T) is an emerging science using animals to solve human problems. It is an interdisciplinary approach using animals as an adjunct to other conventional therapies. The benefits include improved physical, social, emotional or cognitive functioning. Studies in the past have shown lowering of blood pressure and increased survival in those who own a pet. This may not be effective for all individuals, however, it is essential that a complete assessment be made before implementation of AAA/T. The goals of such a therapy must be defined. Animal bites, allergies and zoonoses are the major animal-associated health hazards. The type of AAA/T and needs of the patients are important issues to be considered. Specific guidelines including suitability of patients, animals and infection control policies need to be formulated before initiation of AAA/T. Such an intervention would also require additional resources and there may be legal implications.
