SPECT and PET in Parkinson's disease. In Parkinson's disease(PD) cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolic rate measurements using SPECT and PET have demonstrated functional abnormality in basal ganglia-thalamocortical and its related circuits. [123I] IBF SPECT and [11C] raclopride PET seemed promising tools to assessing D2 receptor status in humans. Studies of D2 status have demonstrated normal or increased receptor density in PD and decreased receptor density in multiple system atrophy. Marked differences of the dopamine transporters located on dopaminergic terminals in the striatum has been demonstrated in healthy controls and PD patients using SPECT. The correlation of SPECT measures of dopamine transporters and motor severity suggests that this may be an useful marker of disease severity in PD.
