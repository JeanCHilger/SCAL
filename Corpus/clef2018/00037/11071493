Activation of language cortex with automatic speech tasks. To identify automatic speech tasks that reliably demonstrate increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in Broca's and Wernicke's areas of the cortex using PET.Localizing language with direct cortical stimulation mapping requires that patients have a stable baseline on tests that engage eloquent cortex. For dysphasic patients or younger children, automatic speech tasks such as counting are often used in lieu of more complex language tests. Evidence from both lesion and neuroimaging studies suggests that these tasks may not adequately engage language cortices. In this study, we examined rCBF during automatic oromotor and speech tasks of varying complexity to identify those eliciting increased CBF in Broca's and Wernicke's areas.Eight normal volunteers underwent PET during rest, tongue movements, and three automatic speech tasks: repeating a phoneme sequence, repeating the months of the year, and reciting a memorized prose passage. Images were averaged across subjects and compared across tasks for regional localization and laterality.Whereas all activation tasks produced increased relative CBF in brain regions that correlated with articulation and auditory processing, only the two tasks that used real words (versus phonemes) showed left-lateralized rCBF increases in posterior superior temporal lobe (Wernicke's area), and only the prose repetition task produced left lateralized activity in Broca's area.Whereas automatic speech typically does not engage language cortex, repeating a memorized prose passage showed unambiguous activation in both Broca's and Wernicke's areas. These results caution against the use of common automatic speech tasks for mapping eloquent cortex and suggest an alternative task for those with poor language abilities or acquired dysphasia who cannot perform standardized language tests reliably.
