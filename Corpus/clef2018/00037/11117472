Reduced reward processing in the brains of Parkinsonian patients. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in healthy controls and non-demented, non-depressed Parkinsonian patients was measured using H2(15)O PET while subjects performed a prelearned pattern recognition task with delayed response. To investigate differences between the two groups in response to reward, the experimental design consisted of three reinforcement conditions: no reinforcement consisting of nonsense feedback, positive symbolic reinforcement and monetary reward. In the controls, monetary reward activated bilaterally the striatum and anterior cingulate gyrus, as well as unilaterally the left cerebellum, midbrain and medial frontal gyrus. Symbolic reinforcement revealed a similar pattern of activation, except that the striatum and left midbrain showed no activation. The Parkinsonian patients responded to monetary reward with increased activation bilaterally in the cerebellum, medial frontal gyrus, and anterior cingulate gyrus as well as unilaterally in the right fusiform gyrus and midbrain and left caudate nucleus and precentral gyrus. Symbolic reinforcement induced significantly increased rCBF in the right cerebellum only. Compared with symbolic reinforcement, monetary reward produced extended activation of temporoparietal association cortex. The pattern observed in the controls demonstrates the role in reward processing of dopaminergic mesolimbic pathways in the healthy human brain, whereas the pattern in the Parkinsonian patients suggests the involvement of compensatory cortical loops in the diseased brain.
