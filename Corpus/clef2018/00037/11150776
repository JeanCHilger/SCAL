19. Correlation between FDG PET data and EEG dipole modeling. Purpose: FDG-PET images and EEG dipole modelling were used to localization of interictal epileptogenic foci. A multimodality approach with the analysis of FDG-PET images, EEG dipoles and anatomical images (MRI) were applied to patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.Methods: Source location was determined using Brain Electromagnetic Source Analysis (BESA) program. The dipole location provided by BESA was then transformed into PET co-ordinates using the patient's MRI previously registered with the PET image. As a difference with other methods, no external markers are necessary.Results: The study group includes ten drug-resistant epileptic patients. FDG hypometabolism was found in all patients. Abnormalities in glucose uptake were always ipsilateral to the EEG dipole. However, quantitative analysis of FDG-PET within hypometabolic areas showed no significant correlation between decrease glucose uptake and location of EEG-dipole source. The comparison of the results using both methods shows that the dipole location matches the FDG-PET hypometabolic area for all the patients. Combining the spatial localization on FDG-PET with the temporal accuracy of EEG dipole source aids in the exact localization of the epileptogenic focus.Conclusion: As a conclusion, the results show that projection of EEG dipole data onto FDG-PET may play a key role in the indication of surgery for the treatment of drug-resistant epileptic patients, provided it is simple and easy to perform.
