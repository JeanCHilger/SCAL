Ferret respiratory diseases. Ferret behavior often brings them into close contact with potential respiratory pathogens and traumatic insults. Although respiratory disease accounts for a small percentage of cases, they are usually dramatic. Acute and chronic conditions occur, and many lesions are confined to the upper or lower respiratory tree but may not involve both. Pathogens such as influenza A account for a large percentage of upper respiratory infections and often mirror the "flu" season of humans. Traumatic insults to the head and chest are relatively common and account for many veterinary visits. Numerous diseases affecting the upper and lower respiratory systems are discussed, with suggestions for diagnostics and therapies.
