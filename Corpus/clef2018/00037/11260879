Bartonella henselae infection in domestic cat and dog fleas. We studied on the infection of domestic cat and dog fleas with Bartonella henselae by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 62 fleas (36 Ctenocephalidis felis from cats, 24 C. felis from dogs and 2 Ctenocephalidis canis from dogs), stored in 70% ethanol, were analyzed by PCR for B. henselae specific DNA. Of the 62 fleas, C. felis from cats and dogs were positive for B. henselae specific DNA in 12 of the 36 (33.3%) and in 5 of the 24 (20.8%), respectively, and C. canis from dogs was positive in 2 of the 2 (100%). Our results demonstrated that pet fleas were infected with B. henselae, and suggest that flea transmission of B. henselae between cats or dogs may occur, and direct transmission of B. henselae from pet fleas to human may cause cat scratch disease.
