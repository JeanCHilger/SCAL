Metabolism of 99mTc-ethylcysteinate dimer in infarcted brain tissue of rats. Brain SPECT with 99mTc-ethylcysteinate dimer (99mTc-ECD) reveals a subacute cerebral infarct as a hypoactive area, even in the presence of postischemic hyperperfusion. The brain retention of 99mTc-ECD depends on hydrophilic conversion mediated by enzymes, and impaired enzymatic trapping is hypothesized to depress the retention efficiency in the infarcted region. The aim of this study was to determine whether the metabolic rate of 99mTc-ECD is actually reduced in infarcted brain tissue.In 50 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 99mTc-ECD was incubated for 30 min with homogenates of rat brain tissue with and without triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. The ratio of polar products was determined by thin-layer chromatography as a function of incubation time, and metabolic rates were obtained. Permanent focal ischemia was induced by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) in rats. The brain was removed 24 h after MCA occlusion, and the infarcted area was defined by TTC staining. The metabolic rate of 99mTc-ECD was determined in homogenates of infarcted tissue, contralateral noninfarcted tissue, and tissue sampled from sham-operated rats. The infarct volume was measured by direct and indirect methods to assess volume expansion caused by edema, and the metabolic rate in infarcted tissue was corrected for the effect of edema.TTC staining had no effect on the metabolic rate of 99mTc-ECD. The metabolic rates in the infarcted tissue were 0.222%/min +/- 0.054%/min and 0.285%/min +/- 0.064%/min before and after correction for edema, respectively. These rates were significantly lower than those in the contralateral noninfarcted tissue (0.426%/min +/- 0.028%/min) and the tissue sampled from the sham-operated rats (0.439%/min +/- 0.031%/min). No substantial difference in rates was observed between the contralateral tissue and the tissue from the sham-operated rats.The results of this study showed that infarction decreases the activity of enzymes that mediate the hydrophilic conversion of 99mTc-ECD in the brain and suggest that reduced metabolic activity is related to decreased accumulation of 99mTc-ECD in hyperperfused infarcts.
