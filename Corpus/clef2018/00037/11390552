The diagnostic role of radionuclide imaging in evaluation of patients with nonhypersecreting adrenal masses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of radionuclide imaging in the characterization of nonhypersecreting adrenal masses.A total of 54 patients (19 men, 35 women mean age, 50 +/- 16 y) with nonhypersecreting unilateral adrenal tumors that had been originally detected on CT or MRI underwent adrenal scintigraphy using different radiotracers. None of the patients showed specific symptoms of adrenal hypersecretion. Screening tests for excess cortical and medullary products showed normal adrenal hormone levels. Radionuclide studies (n = 73) included (131)I-norcholesterol (n = 24), (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) (n = 23), and (18)F-FDG PET (n = 26) scans.Histology after surgery (n = 31) or adrenal biopsy (n = 23) was obtained. Adrenal lesions were represented by 19 adenomas, 4 cysts, 1 myelolipoma, 1 neurinoma, 2 ganglioneuromas, 5 pheochromocytomas, 4 pseudotumors, 6 carcinomas, 2 sarcomas, and 10 metastases (size range, 1.5- to 5-cm diameter mean, 4.9 +/- 3.1 cm). For norcholesterol imaging, diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 100%, 71%, and 92%, respectivelyIn patients with nonhypersecreting adrenal masses, radionuclide adrenal imaging, using specific radiopharmaceuticals such as norcholesterol, MIBG, and FDG, may provide significant functional information for tissue characterization. Norcholesterol and MIBG scans are able to detect benign tumors such as adenoma and pheochromocytoma, respectively. Conversely, FDG PET allows for recognition of malignant adrenal lesions. Therefore, adrenal scintigraphy is recommended for tumor diagnosis and, hence, for appropriate treatment planning, particularly when CT or MRI findings are inconclusive for lesion characterization.
