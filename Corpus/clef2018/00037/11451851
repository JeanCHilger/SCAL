Thoracoscopy or CT-guided biopsy for residual intrathoracic masses after treatment of lymphoma. An intrathoracic mass persists after completion of treatment in 20% of the patients treated for Hodgkin's disease (HD) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Gallium scan and positron emission tomography allow for diagnosis in most cases. However, in some patients, a pathologic examination of the residual mass (RM) is required. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of a thoracoscopic approach for intrathoracic RM, as compared with image-guided biopsies.From 1996 to 1998, 29 consecutive patients treated for NLH (n = 11) or HD (n = 18) were referred either to radiology (group R n = 8) or to surgery (group SNo significant procedure-related complications occurred in either group. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range, 13 to 72 months). In group R, residual lymphoma was found in only one patient. In group S, residual lymphoma was found in seven patients (p = 0.5). In the seven patients of group R with a diagnosis of benign mediastinal lesion, two patients had a local recurrence and one had a recurrence within the abdomen. In the 15 patients of group S in whom no residual disease was found, 1 patient had an intrathoracic recurrence (p = 0.5) while 2 patients had recurrence in a remote site.Despite the limited number of patients in this series, results suggest that a thoracoscopic approach yields better data than image-guided biopsies.
