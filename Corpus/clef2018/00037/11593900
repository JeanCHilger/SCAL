Therapy with somatostatin analogs in patient with orbitopathy and positive Octreoscan. We prospectively evaluated 28 persons with active endocrine ophthalmopathy and positive sonographic criteria (A-mode) on extraocular eye muscles. To evaluate somatostatin-receptor status SPECT of the orbits was performed with a double-headed rotating gamma camera after application of 110 MBq 111-In-Pentreotide. 9 patients (12/56 eyes respectively) showed a marked uptake ratio (> 2 in circular ROIs by semiquantitative calculation) and were selected for lanreotide (30 mg i.m. every 14 d) treatment. 5 individuals had control scan after clinical progression which became positive in two of them. All but one tolerated modest side-effects of lanreotide treatment (diarrhea). Therapy was discontinued after 3-10 months when thyroid eye disease had lead to fibrotic stage. This subgroup, with the exception of two women, who received corticosteroids additionally, presented stable disease. One of those had to be sent to surgery because of endangered optical nerve. Clinical ophthalmological control showed promising results in patients receiving somatostatin analogues at early stage when positive on octreo-scan.
