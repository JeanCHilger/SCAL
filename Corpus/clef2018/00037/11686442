Detection of motion in hybrid PET/SPECT imaging based on the correlation of partial sinograms. This paper describes a motion detection method specific to hybrid positron emission tomography/single photon emission computed tomography systems. The method relies on temporal fractionation of the acquisition into three data sets followed by an algorithm based on the cross correlation (CC) of partial sinograms from successive sets at different rotations of the camera. Spatial inconsistencies due to motion are detected by decreases in the CC between two sets. This permits to separate data into premotion and postmotion sets of consistent data that are reconstructed independently then registered and summed. Rigid motions greater than 1-cm translation or 10 degrees rotation were detected with this method from experimental data obtained by manually moving phantoms made of radioactive spheres as well as from a patient lung study corrupted by artificial motion. The different motion studies showed that the image contrast does not seem to be a limiting factor and that the motion is best detected when the gantry is parallel to the direction of motion. The registration and fusion of the reconstructed premotion and postmotion sets lead in all cases to a reduction of the motion artifacts and an increase in signal-to-noise ratio.
