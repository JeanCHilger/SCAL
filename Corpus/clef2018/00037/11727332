Central venous pressure and arterial blood pressure measurements. Arterial blood pressure measurement and central venous pressure monitoring are important tools in the management of the critically ill pet. Central venous pressure is reflective of right atrial pressure and provides information concerning volume status. Arterial blood pressure is helpful in determining if perfusion to vital tissues is adequate. By providing more information with which to tailor fluid therapy and by prompt recognition of hypo- or hypertension, these monitoring tools are instrumental in the management of the critically ill pet.
