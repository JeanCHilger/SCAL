Value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging in staging of non-small cell lung cancer. To evaluate the accuracy and value of fluorine desoxy-glucose Positron emission tomography (FDG PET) imaging in the staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).A retrospective analysis of 82 patients with NSCLC confirmed by pathological examination was made to study the staging of whole-body FDG PET scanning compared with computerized tomography (CT).The intake of FDG increased in the lung and metastatic foci among all 82 NSCLC patients. Whole-body PET scanning showed concentrated FDG in the 41 NSCLC patients with extrathoracic metastasis. The sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET in prediction of metastasis of mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with lung cancer were 94.4% and 100% respectively. The accuracy of PET scanning in staging of NSCLC was 95.2% in 42 patients who underwent operation after PET imaging. 37 NSCLC patients (45.1%) were restaged after the whole-body FDG PET scanning and their treatment programs were changed.PET is more advantageous in pre-operational staging of NSCLC than other conventional imaging techniques, such as CT. For accurate positioning, PET should be combined with anatomical imaging techniques.
