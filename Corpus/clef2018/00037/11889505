Comparison of brain activity during different types of proprioceptive inputs: a positron emission tomography study. It has been shown that the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, as well as the supplementary motor area (SMA), are involved in central processing of proprioceptive signals during passive and active arm movements. However, it is not clear whether different cortical areas are involved in processing of different proprioceptive inputs (skin, joint, muscle receptors), what their relative contributions might be, where kinesthetic sensations are formed within the CNS, and how they interact when the full peripheral proprioceptive machinery acts. In this study we investigated the representation of the brain structures involved in the perception of passive limb movement and illusory movement generated by muscle tendon vibration. Changes in cortical activity as indicated by changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were measured using positron emission tomography (PET). Twelve subjects were studied under four conditions: (1) passive flexion-extension movement (PM) of the left forearm (2) induced illusions of movements (VI) similar to the real PM, induced by alternating vibration of biceps and triceps tendons (70-80 Hz) at the elbow
