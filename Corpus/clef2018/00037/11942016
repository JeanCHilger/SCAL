Radiofrequency ablation in primary and secondary liver tumors. The authors report the preliminary results of a new treatment for primary and secondary hepatic malignancies called radiofrequency ablation. Seven patients undergoing the new radiofrequency ablation procedure (4 M and 3 F mean age 62 years) were studied. The 3 female patients were suffering from breast cancer metastases (1 case), left colon cancer metastases to the first hepatic segment with caval and portal compression (1 case), and metastases to the eighth hepatic segment from an operated left colon cancer (1 case). The 4 male patients were suffering from carcinoma of the first hepatic segment on a cirrhotic liver (1 case), two liver metastases from left a colon cancer (1 case), a single 3-cm diameter metastasis treated by laparotomic radiofrequency ablation after resection of a gastric cancer (1 case), and one metastasis to the eighth hepatic segment from an operated left colon cancer (1 case). Prior to treatment all patients were subjected to investigation of routine blood-chemistry parameters, hepatic enzymes, cancer markers (Ca 19.9, alphafetoprotein, cytokines), abdominal spiral CT or MRI or PET (18 FDG)
