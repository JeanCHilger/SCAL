Preparation of (99m)Tc-C(60)(OH)(x) and its biodistribution studies. The biological behavior of fullerene derivatives shows their considerable potential for medical applications. In order to provide a C(60) derivative for biodistriburtion studies, the (99m)Tc-labeling of C(60)(OH)(x) was optimized. Gamma counting and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were used to assess the biodistribution of the (99m)Tc-labeled compound in mice and rabbits. Biodistribution studies in mice and imaging of rabbits indicated that (99m)Tc-C(60)(OH)(x) was widely distributed in all tissues. A significant percentage of total activity was retained for 48 h, particularly in the kidneys, bone, spleen, and liver. All tissues displayed a slow clearance over 48 h, except for bone, which showed slightly increasing localization within 24 h.
