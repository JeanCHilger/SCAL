The current status of noninvasive cardiac diagnosis in women with suspected coronary heart disease. Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of mortality among women in the industrial countries. Unfortunately, the routinely available noninvasive tests used to screen the presence of coronary artery disease have been relatively insensitive and nonspecific for women. The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of pretest coronary artery disease probability and to determine whether the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic parameters is a relevant diagnostic tool in women with suspected coronary artery disease.Electrocardiography at rest and during exercise, echocardiography at rest with evaluation of systolic and diastolic functional parameters, dobutamine stress echocardiography, exercise thallium myocardial scintigraphy, and coronary angiography were performed in 180 consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease.Coronary angiography revealed significant coronary artery disease in 104 patients. Angina pectoris, resting and exercise electrocardiography had a very low pretest probability in women. Dobutamine stress echocardiography, myocardial scintigraphy and the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function showed less relevant gender-related differences and had a significantly better pretest probability.Dobutamine stress echocardiography and exercise thallium myocardial scintigraphy are reliable methods of diagnosing coronary artery disease in women. Echocardiographic assessment of diastolic left ventricular function represents another screening test for the evaluation of suspected coronary artery disease in women. All three methods, however, are not able to discriminate between coronary macro- or microangiopathy.
