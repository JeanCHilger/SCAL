Nonhealing subcutaneous wounds in the cat and proposed surgical management techniques. Nonhealing wounds in cats are a source of frustration for veterinarians and pet owners alike. These wounds are known for their insidious onset and tendency to recur after standard surgical closure. The presence of a feline wound that fails to heal in the face of appropriate therapy should initiate an extensive diagnostic evaluation for an etiologic agent. Initially animals should be screened for causes of immunosuppression or systemic disease. The local wound environment should then be evaluated through a combination of wound exploration, cytology, histopathology and tissue culture for evidence of a foreign body, neoplasia, or other less common etiologies of these wounds. Many of the less common etiologic agents require specific tissue handling for successful microscopic identification and culture. It is therefore essential for veterinarians to be familiar with the various causes of nonhealing wounds in cats so that laboratories can be alerted of the need for specific diagnostic techniques. Recent surgical and medical advances have the potential to facilitate the successful treatment of these wounds. With improved veterinary awareness of the potential etiologies of nonhealing wounds in cats and improved medical and surgical management techniques many wounds can now successfully be treated.
