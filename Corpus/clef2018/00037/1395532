Information compression in dynamic radiological studies. The large volumes of digital image data from radiological examinations demand further research and practical solutions in image compression before PACS solutions in large radiological departments are plausible. But another type of compression of image information is also possible, which has, in fact, been somewhat utilized already in analog form, but which has far better possibilities in the digital world. The number of essential images in dynamic X-ray, nuclear medicine, examinations etc. can be greatly reduced. These examinations producing image series are reviewed in terms of compression of information. 3-D displays are very useful in slice imaging, because they provide a means to see easier inside the human body than a number of slice images side by side. We also provide a new method, dynamic pulmonary imaging with digital fluoroscopy, as an example of the digital possibilities to compress a number of images into parametric images, numbers, histograms and curves. These processes also have other positive consequences information is transformed into a more easily perceptible form.
