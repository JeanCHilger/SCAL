Imaging of adenosine A1 receptors in the human brain by positron emission tomography with [11C]MPDX. We report the first clinical PET study using [1-methyl-11C]8-dicyclopropylmethyl-1-methyl-3-propylxanthine ([11C]MPDX) for imaging adenosine A1 receptors in the human brain. The binding of [11C]MPDX evaluated quantitatively as the distribution volume by a graphical analysis was high in the striatum and thalamus, and low in the cerebellum. The distribution pattern of [11C]MPDX was coincident with that of adenosine A1 receptors in vitro reported previously, and was different from those of blood flow and [18F]FDG. The [11C]MPDX PET has the potential for mapping adenosine A1 receptors in the human brain.
