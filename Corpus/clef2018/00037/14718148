Use of Gated-SPECT with with 99mTC-MIBI in the evaluation of the prognostic significance of ventricular arrhythmias during a stress test. The presence of ventricular complex cardiac arrhythmias in coronary patients, both at rest or during physical exercise, is considered a risk factor for future coronary events or sudden death during long time follow up. The meaning of ventricular complex arrhythmias (VCA) in patients with normal ventricular function and without myocardium ischemia has still not been explained. This study aimed to evaluate if patients with normal ventricular function and no evidence of cardiac ischemia (determined by means of Gated SPECT) who developed VCA during stress test show an increase in cardiac events on later monitoring.All patients were studied by means of an ergometric exercise test using a standard Bruce protocol and Gated SPECT with Methoxyisobutyl Isonitrile-99mTechnetium (99mTC-MIBI). Sixty-seven (67) patients with normal ventricular function and no evidence of cardiac ischemia were included.13 patients had VCA and 54 had no ventricular arrhythmias during stress test. During the follow up of 681.3 +/- 469 days, none of the 13 patients had sudden death, angina pectoris or myocardium infarction.In our sample, the appearance of VCA during stress test in patients without myocardium ischemia and normal ventricular function was not associated with an increase of cardiac events during the monitoring which was carried out.
