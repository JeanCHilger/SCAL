Significance of white matter lucencies in posthypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: comparison of clinical status and of computed and positron emission tomographic findings. The clinical status and the computed and positron tomographic findings were compared in 10 patients with sequelae of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy after cardiopulmonary arrest and successful resuscitation. Conscious patients with moderate neuropsychiatric deficits had no significant computed tomography (CT) scan changes and normal values of regional cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption, while patients in vegetative state had definite cerebral atrophy on CT scan and a severe and widespread decrease of regional cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption. This decrease was even more pronounced in vegetative patients with the worst neurological score and with CT scans demonstrating additional diffuse white matter lucencies and hypodensities in the basal ganglia. In this group of patients increased regional oxygen extraction rates mainly in the white matter indicated the occurrence of delayed ischemic changes. The positron emission tomography and CT findings correlated well with the degree of posthypoxic-ischemic damage and the clinical status of the studied subjects.
