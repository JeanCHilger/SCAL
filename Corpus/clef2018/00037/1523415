Considerations in setting up a positron emission tomography center. Clinically oriented imaging with position emission tomography (PET) has come of age. Given an adequate referral base and physician interest, a compelling argument can be made at all levels of the review process for setting up a PET program in a clinical setting. PET is expensive. It is obvious that the cost of running a PET service depends heavily on an institution's ability to obtain reasonable financing. Educational institutions have the opportunity to acquire special funding through a variety of sources. On the other hand, money can be expensive for private entrepreneurs. It appears that in the near future PET centers will probably remain at educational institutions or large well-financed community hospitals able to raise money at reasonable rates until reimbursement issues are better resolved. Finally, the future of clinical PET may hinge significantly on the ability of commercial radiopharmaceutical suppliers to provide regional fluorodeoxyglucose distribution. As an institutional program development, PET offers opportunities by providing unique clinical data aiding the referral pattern. PET may serve as a magnet for recruitment in many areas and may promote interdisciplinary cooperation. A clinical PET center serves both as a model for future and more widespread use of PET and as a training ground for medical personnel. Finally, the unique capabilities of PET may facilitate grant opportunities.
