Dystonic posturing associated with putaminal hyperperfusion depicted on subtraction SPECT. Dystonic posturing (DP) is one of the most reliable lateralizing indicators for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We evaluated the ictal hyperperfusional areas in patients with DP by using ictal-interictal subtraction single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Ninety-seven patients were treated surgically for intractable TLE, and 39 patients underwent ictal and interictal SPECT studies with the same isotope. These patients were divided into three groups: group I with DP of the contralateral side extended to the epileptogenic focus, group II with elevated muscle tonus but without DP, and group III without DP or alteration of muscle tonus. Ictal, interictal SPECT and thin-slice magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were overlaid by using the automatic multimodality registration program to construct ictal-interictal subtracted images of SPECT on MRI.Thirteen patients belonged to group I 14, to group IIA strong correlation between DP and hyperperfusion in the putamen and mesial temporal lobe was demonstrated. Some patients showed a wide hyperperfusion area extending from the mesial temporal lobe to putamen, which may correspond to the propagation of epileptic discharges. Our results suggest a correlation between hyperperfusion of putamen and contralateral dystonic posturing.
