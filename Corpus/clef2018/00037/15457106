Deficits in verbal declarative memory function in women with childhood sexual abuse-related posttraumatic stress disorder. Several studies have shown deficits in verbal declarative memory function in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Most of these studies have been performed in men with combat-related PTSD compared with healthy subjects relatively little is known about memory function in women with abuse-related PTSD, or whether these effects are specific to PTSD or are a nonspecific outcome of exposure to early abuse. The purpose of this study was to assess declarative memory function in women with and without a history of early childhood sexual abuse and PTSD. Forty-three women with and without a history of early childhood sexual abuse and PTSD underwent neuropsychological testing with subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale--Revised for measurement of verbal and visual memory and subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale for measurement of IQ, and behavioral ratings of PTSD and other psychiatric symptoms. Abused women with PTSD had deficits in verbal declarative memory as measured with the subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale--Revised compared with women with early abuse without PTSD and nonabused women without PTSD. There were no significant differences in IQ. These findings suggest that early abuse with PTSD is associated with deficits in verbal declarative memory, and that these effects are not related to the nonspecific effects of childhood abuse.
