Overexpression of soluble human thymosin alpha 1 in Escherichia coli. Synthesized gene of human thymosin alpha 1 (Talpha1) was inserted into pET-28a, pET-9c, pThioHis B, pGEX-2T or pBV222 and then inductively expressed in strains of Escherichia coli. Among the five expression systems, the BL21/pET-28a system provides the highest expression level of fusion protein in a soluble form, which is up to 70% of total expressed bacterial proteins as visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The resulting fusion protein purified through nickel affinity chromatography accounts for 2.53% of the wet bacterial pellet weight and reaches 94.5% purity by SDS-PAGE. These results indicate the potential of this expression system for high-throughput production of recombinant Talpha1.
