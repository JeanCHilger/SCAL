Quantitation of house dust mite allergens (Der f 1 and group 2) on the skin and hair of dogs. To determine the concentration of house dust mite (HDM) allergens, Der f 1 and group 2, on the skin and hair of dogs and whether associations exist between the presence of Der f 1 and group 2 allergens on the skin and hair of dogs and household and dog characteristics.63 pet dogs from 50 homes.Dogs were weighed and body surface area in square meters was determined. Skin and hair samples were obtained by vacuuming dogs. Collected dust was analyzed by use of standard ELISA techniques.HDM allergen was detected in 21 of 59 skin and hair samples. Presence of group 2 allergen on skin and hair of dogs was significantly associated with long hair, compared with short or medium length hair. Median house dust sample concentrations of Der f 1 and group 2 allergens were high in homes with dogs that had skin and hair samples that were positive for Der f 1 and group 2 allergens. Dogs with skin and hair samples that were positive for Der f 1 and group 2 allergens resided in homes with a high number of house dust samples that were positive for Der f 1, group 2, or both allergens and in homes with a mean house dust sample allergen concentration of > or =2 microg/g of dust.Associations exist between environmental HDM allergen concentrations and HDM allergens on the skin and hair samples of dogs. Environmental allergen load is a major factor in accumulation of allergens on the skin and hair of dogs.
