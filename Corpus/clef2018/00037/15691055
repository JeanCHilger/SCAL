Diabetes and coronary artery disease: the role of stress myocardial perfusion imaging. Stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has the potential not only to improve clinical outcomes in diabetic patients, but also to decrease unnecessary use of health care resources. However, before routine screening can be recommended, cost-effectiveness analyses are required to identify patients in whom such testing is appropriate. Nevertheless, MPI is clearly emerging as a valuable tool for improving management of coronary artery disease in all patients with diabetes mellitus.
