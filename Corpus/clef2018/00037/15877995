Myocardial technetium-99m-tetrofosmin single-photon emission computed tomography compared with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose imaging to assess myocardial viability. Technetium-99m-tetrofosmin single-photon emission computed tomography at rest is practical for routine assessment of viability in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, underestimation of viability may occur compared with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose single-photon emission computed tomography, especially in the inferoposterior and septal regions.
