Protection of crayfish, Cambarus clarkii, from white spot syndrome virus by polyclonal antibodies against a viral envelope fusion protein. White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is a large double-stranded DNA virus, causing considerable mortality in penaeid shrimp and other crustaceans. WSSV produces five major structural proteins, including two major envelope proteins, VP28 and VP19. To produce VP28 and VP19 as a single protein for antibody production, DNA sequences encoding both open reading frames were fused together and cloned into pET-22b(+) expression vector. The fusion protein, VP(19+28), was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified using Ni2+ His affinity chromatography and injected into a rabbit. Antiserum collected from the immunized rabbit was tested in vivo for ability to protect crayfish, Cambarus clarkii, from disease caused by WSSV. Fifteen days after challenge with WSSV, treatment with VP(19+28) antiserum gave 100% protection against disease in the ambient temperature range of 15-22 degrees C and 65% protection at a constant temperature of 26 degrees C. These results demonstrated VP(19+28) antiserum is effective in protection of crayfish from WSSV and confirmed that VP19 and VP28 play an important role in WSSV host infection. Targeting both VP19 and VP28 may be effective for the design of both immunotherapeutic medicines and reagents to detect WSSV.
