Influence of collimator choice and simulated clinical conditions on 123I-MIBG heart/mediastinum ratios: a phantom study. (123)I presents imaging problems owing to high-energy photon emission. We investigated the influence of collimators on (123)I-MIBG heart/mediastinum ratios (H/M ratios). Secondly, we assessed the influence on H/M ratios of different activity concentrations, simulating clinical conditions. Thirdly, the value of scatter correction was assessed.The AGATE cardiac phantom was filled with (123)I in three sequential conditions: A, heart and mediastinal activity B, adding lung activityPlanar H/M ratios were influenced by scatter and septal penetration from increasing amounts of liver activity. These effects were less pronounced for ME collimators. Although the TEW scatter correction increased ratios overall, TEW correction did not improve the relative differences between the ratios. TEW correction therefore does not add any benefit to obtain an accurate reflection of myocardial activity concentrations.For straightforward implementation of semi-quantitative (123)I-MIBG myocardial studies, we recommend the use of ME collimators without scatter correction.
