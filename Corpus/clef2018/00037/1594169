The effect of atenolol on dipyridamole 201Tl myocardial perfusion tomography in patients with coronary artery disease. The effect of atenolol on dipyridamole 201Tl myocardial perfusion tomography was evaluated in 12 patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease. The patients had dipyridamole 201Tl tomography performed after 7 days treatment with 50 mg atenolol and then repeated after a further 7 days treatment with placebo. The images were interpreted qualitatively by two experienced observers and quantitatively using the Bullseye technique. Qualitative analysis of the images revealed that four of the 12 patients had larger defects on their scans whilst receiving atenolol compared to placebo. The remaining eight patients had defects which were the same size on both treatments. The severity of defects assessed qualitatively was not significantly influenced by atenolol therapy (P = 0.13, McNemera's test). The results obtained with the Bullseye method did not demonstrate significant statistical differences for defect size, degree of reversibility or percentage reversibility whilst the patients were receiving atenolol or placebo (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test). Atenolol increased the size of perfusion defects on dipyridamole 201Tl tomography qualitatively and quantitatively for four patients in this group of 12 with proven coronary artery disease. Although this did not achieve a high level of statistical significance physicians should be aware that atenolol can influence the images obtained at dipyridamole 201Tl tomography.
