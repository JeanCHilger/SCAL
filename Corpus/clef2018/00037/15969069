Molecular cloning, expression mutation of myostatin and study on biochemical activity of its C-terminal peptide. Myostatin, a member of the TGF-beta family, negatively regulates skeletal muscle development. Mutation of myostatin activity leads to increases muscle growth and carcass lean yield. The bovine myostatin mutation cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and then sub-cloned into the expression vector pET-30a( + ) to form the expression plasmid pET30a (+)-action/ Myostatin. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21. The overexpression product of pET30a (+)-action/ Myostatin was been showed in vitro. Sheep skeletal muscle cell were cultured with the purified myostatin mutation C-terminal peptide. The results of this study suggest that had a powerful activity to stimulate the hyperplasia and proliferation of sheep muscle cells and shows high biochemical activity.
