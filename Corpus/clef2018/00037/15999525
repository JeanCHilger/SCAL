Preoperative preparation for esophageal surgery. Careful preoperative assessment is crucial in patients undergoing esophagectomy. The procedure carries significant morbidity and mortality, and careful evaluation is vital to minimizing risks. Tumor stage and the patient's general medical condition play equally important roles in determining operability. Patients with impaired pulmonary, cardiac, or nutritional function need to be identified, and reversible impairments need to be treated preoperatively. Preoperative tumor staging is done with a combination of tests, which should include CT, PET, and EUS for best noninvasive staging and more invasive techniques used on an individual basis.
