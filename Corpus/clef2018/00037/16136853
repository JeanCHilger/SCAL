Scar detection by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in chronic coronary artery disease: a comparison with nuclear imaging and echocardiography. We compared contrast-enhanced MRI (CeMRI) with the most widely used imaging techniques for myocardial infarct (MI) diagnosis, SPECT and Echo, in unselected patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD). Two blinded operators assessed scars on MRI, SPECT and Echo images using a 16-segments LV model. We studied 105 consecutive patients: 50 had Q-wave MI (Q-MI), 19 non Q-wave MI or rest angina (nonQ-MI/RA) and 36 effort angina (EA) history. CeMRI was positive, respectively, in 96%, 37%, and 6%, SPECT in 90%, 53%, and 44%, and Echo in 84%, 32%, and 28% of patients (within Q-MI: CeMRI vs. SPECT p < 0.03, vs. Echo p < 0.001 within EA CeMRI vs. SPECT and ECHO p < 0.001
