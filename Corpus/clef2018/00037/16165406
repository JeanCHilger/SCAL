Purification and partial characterization of recombinant Cu, Zn containing superoxide dismutase of Cordyceps militaris in E.coli. The cDNA of Cu, Zn containing superoxide dismutase from the Cordyceps militaris SH (cm-SOD) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE3) using the pET-21a expression vector. The recombinant cell overexpressed the protein corresponding to 35+/-3% of total bacterial protein in cytosol. The purification was performed through three steps: DEAE-FF, CM-52, and G-100. After this purification procedure, a specific activity of 27272.7 U/mg of protein was reached, corresponding to 6.1-fold purification with a yield of 85.0%. The purity was homogeneous by SDS-PAGE analysis and 94.2+/-1.0% by CZE analysis. A subunit molecular mass of the recombinant enzyme was 15704 Da with a Cu and Zn element. In addition, the dimeric and polymeric structures were observed on MALDI-TOF-MS. Isoelectric point value of 7.0 was obtained for the recombinant enzyme that was sensitive to H2O2 and KCN. The recombinant enzyme remained 80+/-2% residual activity at pH 7.8, at 50 degrees C for 4h incubation. The properties: N-terminal amino acid sequence (the first 12 amino acid residues), pI, subunit molecular mass, thermo-stability of the purified recombinant SOD are similar to that of the native Cu, Zn-SOD from C. militaris (N-cm-SOD).
