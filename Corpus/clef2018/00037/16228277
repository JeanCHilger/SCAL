Effects of a combinations of emodepside and praziquantel on parasites of reptiles and rodents. A new combination of two anthelmintic compounds containing emodepside and praziquantel (Profender, Bayer AG, Levekusen, Germany) was tested in pet rodents and reptiles. Topical application of the two compounds led to the quick disappearance of nematodes and cestodes from a broad spectrum of hosts including mice, jirds, snakes, anole lizards, turtles, monitor lizards, etc. In reptiles the dosage had to be increased, since the thick outer layer of the epidermis hinders the penetration of the compounds. In animals with an extremely thick epidermis (e.g. monitor lizards, leguans) the new product was applied under the armpits.
