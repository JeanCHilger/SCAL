Cloning and expression of Yersinia pestis V antigen in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The structure gene of V antigen was amplified from the wild strain of Yersinia pestis by means of PCR, and was cloned into vector pET-42b (+). Then, V antigen was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) with the induction of IPTG. The expressing amount of the aim protein is as high as 32.8 percent of the total bacterial protein.
