Quantitative CT analysis for assessing response in lymphoma (Cheson's criteria). Standardized CT-based criteria used for lymphoma staging and follow-up and the current role of FDG-PET are reviewed. The current CT-based International Workshop Criteria (IWC) still have the main advantage of representing standardized criteria allowing comparability of clinical trials in patients with lymphoma. However, functional imaging with integrated IWC and FDG-PET provide more accurate response assessment, and challenge the current paradigm. Although integration of FDG-PET in IWC requires validation in a prospective trial with a large number of patients, new long-term clinical and therapeutic trials probably need to be designed using these new and hopefully standardized functional criteria. This potentially could allow a more risk-adapted approach to the treatment of aggressive lymphoma: intensive (reinforced) therapies for non-responders vs. less intensive therapies for good responders with the main goal of improved clinical outcome.
