MRI and PET in monitoring response in lymphoma. The potential of FDG-PET and MRI in monitoring response to treatment in lymphoma is reviewed. Both FDG-PET and MRI can provide whole body imaging. Both also share the advantage of combining functional and anatomical information. At present, hybrid FDG-PET and MDCT is the best technique for monitoring response to treatment, especially early response to treatment. Early assessment of response to treatment has the potential to tailor therapy. MR imaging is useful especially in assessing bone marrow and central nervous system involvement.
