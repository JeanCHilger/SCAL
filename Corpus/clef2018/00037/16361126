Role of imaging to choose treatment. Radiologists perform various examinations at every step of lymphomas. The role of imaging is atypical or a 'classical' oncologic radiologist, as multiple non-radiological criteria are combined to decide on treatments. A good knowledge of the practical use of the results helps the radiologist to seek the useful pieces of information. In treatment evaluation, uncertain complete response is only used in lymphomas. Imaging is changing, with the emergence of PET and whole body MRI but CT remains the key examination today. The WHO criteria are the only ones used to evaluate treatment results on CT, even though the use of PET is increasingly used, with better and better results.
