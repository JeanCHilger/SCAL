Expression and purification of the synthetic preS1 gene of Hepatitis B Virus with preferred Escherichia coli codon preference. To produce high levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) preS1 protein at low cost, a DNA fragment encoding the preS1 region, residues 1-119, of HBV adr subtype was synthesized by overlapping-PCR according to Escherichia coli (E. coli) B preferred codon usage. The synthetic preS1 gene (spreS1) was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET-30a and transferred into the expression strain E. coli BL21(DE3). Recombinant preS1 protein with an N-terminal His6 tag was expressed at high levels in soluble form, yielding about 44% of the total cellular protein. This technique overcomes problems that existed in previously reported expression systems of preS1 or its epitope, i.e., low-level expression or expression in inclusion bodies. Using this His-tagged preS1 expression system, recombinant protein was purified by single-step affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA column resulting in a yield was about 28 mg recombinant protein per liter culture. Furthermore, Western blotting and indirect ELISA analysis demonstrate that the reactivity of preS1-specific antibody is comparable between the recombinant and commercialized preS1 protein. Thus, our improved expression system could be used for practical, low-cost large-scale production of recombinant preS1 without refolding steps.
