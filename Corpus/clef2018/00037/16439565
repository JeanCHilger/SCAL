Perfusion MR imaging with FAIR true FISP spin labeling in patients with and without renal artery stenosis: initial experience. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate an arterial spin-labeling technique, flow-sensitive alternating inversion-recovery (FAIR) true fast imaging with steady-state precession (FISP), for noninvasive quantification of renal perfusion in patients without a history of renal artery stenosis (RAS) and in patients with proved RAS. The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and all participants provided written informed consent. Six patients with hypertension but no history of renal artery disease and 12 patients with RAS underwent FAIR true FISP magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in a whole-body 1.5-T unit. RAS grade and scintigraphic perfusion data served as the reference standards. On the FAIR true FISP perfusion images, severe RAS (>70% luminal narrowing) could be clearly distinguished from no or mild RAS and moderate RAS (< or =70% luminal narrowing) (P < .005). Significant correlations between FAIR perfusion data and stenosis grade (r = -0.76) and between FAIR and single photon emission computed tomographic perfusion values (r = 0.83) were observed. FAIR true FISP was found to be suitable for quantitative perfusion imaging of the kidneys in patients with RAS.
