Improvement of tomographic reconstruction in bone SPECT. The comparison between iterative reconstruction and filtered backprojection in the reconstruction of bone SPECT in the diagnosis of skeletal metastases.47 consecutive patients (vertebral segments: n = 435), with suspected malignancy of the vertebral column, were examined by bone scintigraphy and MRI (maximal interval between the two procedures +/- 5 weeks). The SPECT-data were reconstructed with an iterative algorithm (ISA) and with filtered backprojection. We defined semiquantitative criteria in order to assess the quality of the tomograms. Conventional reconstruction was performed both by a Wiener-filter and a low-pass-filter. Iterative reconstruction was performed by the ISA algorithm. The clinical evaluation of the different reconstruction algorithms was performed by MRI as the gold-standard.Sensitivity (%): 87.3 (ISA), 86.4 (low-pass), 79.7 (Wiener) specificity (%): 95.3 (ISA), 95 (low-pass), 85.4 (Wiener). The sensitivity of iterative reconstructed SPECT and low-pass reconstructed SPECT was significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared with the sensitivity of SPECT reconstructed by the Wiener-filter. The specificity of iterative reconstruction ISA and low-pass-filter reconstructed SPECT were significantly higher compared with the SPECT data reconstructed by the Wiener-filter. ISA was significantly superior to the Wiener-SPECT relating to all criteria of quality. Iterative reconstruction was significantly superior to the low-pass-SPECT relating to 2 of 3 criteria. In addition the Wiener-SPECT was significantly inferior to the low-pass-SPECT regarding to 2 of 3 criteria.In our series the iterative algorithm ISA was the method of choice in the reconstruction of bone SPECT data. In comparison with conventional algorithms ISA offers a significantly higher quality of the tomograms and yields a high diagnostic accuracy.
