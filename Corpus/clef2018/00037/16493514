Comparison of diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET, (123)I-IMT- and (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT: evaluation of tumour progression in irradiated low grade astrocytomas. To evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of the SPECT-tracers 3-(123)I-alpha-methyl-L-tyrosine (IMT) and (99m)Tc(I)- hexakis(2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile) (MIBI) as well as the PET-tracer 2-(18)F-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) for detecting tumour progression in irradiated low grade astrocytomas (LGA).We examined 91 patients (56 males 35 femalesIn the patient groups nPT and PT, L/N ratios for FDG (GS) were 0.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.5 (p = 0.003), for FDG (WS) 1.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.4 (p < 0.001), for IMT 1.1 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.4 (p < 0.001) and for MIBI 1.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.6 +/- 2.2 (p = 0.554). Areas under the non-parametric ROC-curves were: 0.738 +/- 0.059 for FDG (GS), 0.790 +/- 0.057 for FDG (WS), 0.937 +/- 0.037 for IMT and 0.564 +/- 0.105 for MIBI.MIBI-SPECT examinations resulted in a low accuracy and especially in a poor sensitivity even at modest specificity values. A satisfying diagnostic accuracy was reached with FDG PET. Using WM as reference region for FDG PET, a slightly higher AUC as compared to GM was calculated. IMT yielded the best ROC characteristics and the highest diagnostic accuracy for differentiating between PT and nPT in irradiated LGA.
