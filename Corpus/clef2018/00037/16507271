Management of advanced stage Hodgkin lymphoma. Although advanced Hodgkin lymphoma is highly curable, balancing the high cure rate with long-term toxicity is challenging. ABVD (doxorubicin [Adriamycin], bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) is the standard chemotherapy regimen, producing a high cure rate with acceptable toxicity. Stanford V and BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) are new regimens with encouraging results and are undergoing randomized clinical trials. The International Prognostic Score provides a clinical tool that may help identify patients with high-risk disease who may require a more aggressive regimen. Consolidative radiation's role in managing advanced Hodgkin lymphoma is still controversial, but it is most accepted for bulky or residual disease or after brief chemotherapy. The development and integration of newer imaging tools, such as fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography imaging, may allow a more precise evaluation of disease and help define which patients might benefit from consolidative treatment.
