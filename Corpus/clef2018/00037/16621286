Seroepidemiological survey on canine leishmaniasis among dogs from an urban area of Brazil. A cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey on canine leishmaniasis among pet dogs was carried out in an urban area in the State of Pernambuco (Brazil) where human cases of visceral leishmaniasis have sporadically been reported. Using an indirect fluorescent antibody test, anti-Leishmania antibodies were detected in 130 out of 322 dogs, confirming previous exposure to Leishmania parasites. The overall seroprevalence found was 40.3% (95% confidence interval: 34.9-45.9). Data analysis revealed that serological positivity was statistically associated with male (chi2=20.60, P-value=0.000) and juvenile dogs (chi2=4.24, P-value=0.039). Furthermore, it was observed that 85.3% of all seropositive dogs showed no clinical signs of leishmaniasis. The results showed a high seroprevalence of anti-Leishmania antibodies among dogs from an urban area of Pernambuco - with a large proportion of asymptomatic seropositive dogs - indicating that the prevalence of Leishmania infection in this area has been underestimated.
