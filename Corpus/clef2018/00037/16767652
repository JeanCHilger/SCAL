Toward a practice-based approach to legal education in the veterinary medical curriculum. I have a little dog, a little Maltese dog, Billy Byrd. He is approaching his 14th birthday. If I ever saw in this world anything that was made by the Creator's hand that is more dedicated, more true, more undeviant, more faithful than this little dog, I am at a loss to state what it is . . .We love that little dog. (Robert S. Byrd, U.S. Senator).
