Identification of the dominant translation start site in the attB1 sequence of the pET-DEST42 Gateway vector. Gateway technology is a powerful system for converting a single entry vector into a wide variety of expression vectors. We expressed recombinant influenza matrix protein M1 (FMP), a potent antigen for cytotoxic T cells, using the Gateway vector pET-DEST42 containing the FMP cDNA, and purified the expressed FMP as a single 32 kDa recombinant protein. N-terminal and internal protein sequencing, however, showed that the recombinant FMP contained an extra 10 amino acids fused to the N-terminal of native FMP. Further investigation of the DNA sequence adjacent to the 5'-FMP cDNA indicated that the "TTG" in the attB1 site (30 bp upstream of the "ATG" in the 5'-FMP cDNA) behaved as a dominant translation start site, resulting in a 10 amino acid extension of the recombinant FMP. Thus, it is possible that recombinant proteins produced by this Gateway vector contain unexpected vector-derived peptides, which may affect experimental outcomes.
