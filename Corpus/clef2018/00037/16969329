Basics of PET and PET/CT imaging: instrumentation and radiopharmaceuticals for clinical diagnosis. Positron emission tomography (PET), like scintigraphy, is a type of functional and molecular imaging. Image resolution is better than with scintigraphy, and tomographic slices are obtained, as with CT and MRI. Modern PET machines are coupled with CT (PET/CT) and yield fused images that combine metabolic and anatomic approaches. Fludeoxyglucose (FDG), a radiolabeled glucose analog, is the most widely used radiopharmaceutical for clinical PET, but several other molecules are proposed for routine use. Clinical trials will determine which are of clinical interest. FDG imaging necessarily involves PET but clinical PET is not only FDG imaging.
