ProstaScint(R) Scan: Contemporary Use in Clinical Practice. Indium In 111 capromab pendetide (ProstaScint(R) Cytogen Corporation, Princeton, NJ), a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody to prostate-specific membrane antigen, offers a potential means of localizing sites of soft tissue metastasis in prostate cancer patients. Although the test was previously limited by poor positive predictive value and specificity owing to the inherent limitations of single photon emission computed tomography, improvements in techniques of anatomic localization, along with increased reader experience, have significantly improved its accuracy. In addition to the conventional roles for ProstaScint, such as staging and detection of relapse, a number of new potential applications have emerged.
