Metabolism of the A1 adenosine receptor PET ligand [18F]CPFPX by CYP1A2: implications for bolus/infusion PET studies. The A1 adenosine receptor positron emission tomography (PET) ligand 8-cyclopentyl-3-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-1-propylxanthine ([18F]CPFPX, ) undergoes a fast hepatic metabolism. An optimal design of PET quantitation approaches (e.g., bolus/infusion studies) necessitates the knowledge of factors that influence this metabolism. Metabolites of were separated by radio thin-layer chromatography. Metabolism in vivo, in pooled human liver microsomes and in recombinant human cytochrome isoenzyme preparations was studied. Dynamic PET studies using were performed on three controls and two patients, one treated with the antidepressant and inhibitor of cytochrome CYP1A2 fluvoxamine, the other suffering from liver cirrhosis. CPFPX is metabolized by cytochrome CYP1A2 with high selectivity [KM=1.1 microM (95% confidence interval, or CI, 0.6-2.0 microM) and Vmax=243 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) (95% CI, 112-373 pmol min(-1) mg(-1)) corresponding to 2.4 pmol min(-1) pmol(-1) cytochrome P-450]. This metabolism can competitively be inhibited by fluvoxamine with KI=68 nM (95% CI, 34-138 nM). At least eight compounds found in human plasma and in the CYP1A2 in vitro preparations have an identical migration pattern and account together for >90% and >80% of the respective metabolite yield. Metabolism was considerably delayed in the two patients. In conclusion, is metabolized by cytochrome CYP1A2. Its metabolism is therefore subdued to disease-related or xenobiotic-induced changes of CYP1A2 activity. The identification of the metabolic pathway of 1 allows to optimize image quantification in A1 adenosine receptor PET studies.
