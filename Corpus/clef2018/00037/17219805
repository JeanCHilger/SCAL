The value of FDG PET/CT, ultrasound and CT in diagnosing recurrent ovarian carcinoma. The diagnosis of recurrent ovarian cancer can be complicated and variable sensitivities, specificities and accuracies have been reported for integrated positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT). The aim of the study was to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PET/CT, ultrasound and CT in the diagnosing recurrent ovarian cancer.27 women in the follow-up after cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy of ovarian cancer, underwent ultrasound, CT and PET/CT to assess for possible recurrence.Recurrence of ovarian cancer was detected in 22 patients (laparotomy or cytology of ascites or pleural effusion). 5 disease-free patients were followed-up for 8-14 months. FDG-PET, ultrasound and CT had sensitivities of 81,82%, 45,45%, 55.56%, specificities of 60%, 60%, 60% and accuracies 77,78%, 48,15%, 52,17% respectively.1. FDG PET/CT is a useful technique to in diagnosing recurrent ovarian cancer. 2. PET/CT depicts/detects recurrent ovarian cancer with higher diagnostic accuracy comparing to the standard imaging and provides the chance to detect disease at an earlier stage during follow-up.
