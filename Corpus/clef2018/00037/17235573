Von Hippel-Lindau disease. Interdisciplinary patient care. Von Hippel-Lindau disease is an important hereditary tumor syndrome with a clear option for effective treatment if diagnosed in time. Interdisciplinary cooperation is the key to successful management. Major components of the disease are retinal capillary hemangioblastomas, hemangioblastomas of cerebellum, brain stem and spine, renal clear cell carcinomas, pheochromocytomas, multiple pancreatic cysts and islet cell carcinomas, tumors of the endolymphatic sac of the inner ear, and cystadenomas of the epididymis and broad ligament. A well structured screening program should be performed at yearly intervals.
