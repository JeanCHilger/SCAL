Diagnostic and therapeutic use of radioisotopes for bony disease in prostate cancer: current practice. Nuclear medicine techniques continue to be important non-invasive imaging tools assisting the diagnosis, monitoring and--in some cases--treatment of prostate cancer. Bone scintigraphy was the premier modality to have an extensive role in the staging of prostate cancer and has remained an integral tool for over three decades in the assessment of newly diagnosed disease or in follow-up staging. Therapeutic treatment and palliation of disseminated disease, particularly in the skeleton, has also been successful with several radioisotopes including strontium-89 chloride. Despite advances in nuclear medicine techniques and molecular imaging technology such as positron emission tomography and radioimmunoscintigraphy, bone scintigraphy still remains the gold standard in the assessment of osseous metastatic disease in prostate cancer. Thus, it is important to continually review the modalities that have remained important over time and not just to focus on newer technologies. This article summarizes the current diagnostic and therapeutic use of radioisotopes for bony disease in prostate cancer with particular reference to radionuclide bone scintigraphy and positron emission tomography.
