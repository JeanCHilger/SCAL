Serotonin transporter occupancy of high-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during major depressive disorder measured with [11C]DASB positron emission tomography. Previous work has shown 80% serotonin transporter (5-HTT) occupancy to be a consistent finding at the minimum therapeutic dose during selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment. [(11)C]N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-cyanophenylthio) benzylamine positron emission tomography ([(11)C]DASB PET) is currently the best method available to quantify 5-HTT occupancy in humans.The purpose of the present study is to determine 5-HTT occupancy during high dose SSRI treatment using [(11)C]DASB PET.Twelve healthy subjects and 12 subjects with major depressive disorder completed the protocol. Depressed subjects received one [(11)C]DASB PET scan after a minimum of 4 weeks treatment at high doses of venlafaxine, sertraline, or citalopram. Baseline 5-HTT binding potential (BP) was taken as the average 5-HTT BP of the 12 healthy subjects.Mean striatal 5-HTT occupancy for each antidepressant group was approximately 85% at high therapeutic dose. This was significantly greater than 80% (one-sample t test p < 0.04, venlafaxine groupSignificantly greater 5-HTT blockade at high dose provides a rationale for raising the dose from the minimum therapeutic dose in specific clinical circumstances. It is likely that 15% unoccupied 5-HTT remains, which should be addressed in future drug development.
