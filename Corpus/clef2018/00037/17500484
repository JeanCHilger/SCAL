Validation of a new dental plaque quantification method in dogs. Current methods for the quantification of plaque accumulation in cats and dogs are well-accepted adaptations of traditional human models, but have required substantial modifications in order to compensate for the inherent differences in compliance, cooperation, and temperament between animals and humans. While these modifications have sought to maintain or improve upon the accuracy and reproducibility of the original methods, they also have increased the complexity of the technique and have required additional scorer time and animal cooperation, which leads to increased cost of trials. Therefore, research was directed toward the development and validation of a new substrate scoring system that reduces resources while maintaining or increasing the reproducibility attributed to the more traditional methods. This new gingival contour plaque index was shown to be accurate and reproducible, but used fewer animals, required less time, and eliminated the need for many of the specialized procedures required by traditional methods.
