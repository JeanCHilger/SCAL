Production of radioactive quality assurance phantoms using a standard inkjet printer. This note proposes the use of a standard inkjet printer to produce radioactive (99m)Tc phantoms that can be used for routine quality control of gamma cameras. The amount of activity that will be deposited on paper per unit area was predicted and compared to the measured activity. The uniformity of the printouts was compared to the uniformity obtained with a standard (57)Co flood source. A scintillation detector connected to a multi-channel analyzer was used to evaluate the uniformity of the printout independently from the gamma camera. Joining two A4 size printed phantoms to create larger sources was evaluated. The spatial resolution obtained with printed sources was compared to that obtained using standard line source techniques. The results indicated that the uniformity of the printed phantoms compared well with those obtained with the (57)Co flood source (integral uniformity 2.29% (printed source) and 2.10% ((57)Co flood source)). There was no difference in the resolution measurements obtained with the printed sources and those obtained with the standard methods. This study demonstrates that affordable phantoms can easily be created to evaluate system uniformity and resolution in any department where a standard PC and inkjet printer are available.
