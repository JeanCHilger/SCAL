Lesion detectability and clinical effectiveness of dual-head coincidence gamma camera imaging in comparison with dedicated PET systems in tumour patients. The lesion detection capability and clinical effectiveness of dual-head coincidence gamma camera imaging (c-PET) were compared with those of dedicated positron emission tomography (d-PET) in 37 cancer patients who underwent whole-body c-PET and d-PET imaging after administration of 370 - 540 MBq (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Eighty-nine lesions were detected on c-PET whereas 133 lesions were seen with d-PET imaging. The relative sensitivity of c-PET compared with d-PET was 62% and 73% for lesions < 15 and > or = 15 mm, respectively, and the relative concordance rate was 84% when the patients were restaged. Since the lesion detection rate of c-PET imaging was lower than that of d-PET, the detection of small lesions, therefore, requires care. The clinical effectiveness of c-PET, however, was similar to that of d-PET and, therefore, it is concluded that c-PET can be used as an alternative to d-PET, particularly considering the high cost and limited availability of d-PET cameras.
