Effects of feline immunodeficiency virus on feline monocyte-derived dendritic cells infected by spinoculation. During type 1 human immunodeficiency virus infection, not only can dendritic cells (DCs) prime T cells against the virus, but they can also infect them in trans. Feline AIDS is caused by feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and is considered a model for the human illness because the two diseases have many features in common. Little is known about the interaction of feline DCs with FIV therefore, this study attempts to tackle such an issue. Infection of feline monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) was attempted by spinoculation with FIV strains Petaluma (FIV-Pet) and M2. FIV-Pet was released rapidly in the supernatants of both infected MDDCs and activated T cells after spinoculation. It is shown that FIV-Pet was produced by MDDCs by monitoring viral content in the supernatants of infected MDDCs, by intracellular staining for p25 and by showing its cytopathic effect. Although activated T cells were better substrates for FIV replication, leading to prolonged viral shedding, both immature MDDCs and MDDCs matured with lipopolysaccharide supported virus production, mostly during the first 2 days after infection. At later times, FIV induced syncytium formation by MDDCs. Concerning the FIV receptors, MDDCs were shown to be CD134-negative and CXCR4-positive, a phenotype compatible with permissiveness to FIV-Pet. These results also suggest that maturation is not hampered by FIV infection and that virus exposure itself does not induce MDDC maturation. It is also shown that infected MDDCs can infect activated PBMCs efficiently in trans. It is concluded that MDDCs can be infected by FIV, although infection does not appear to influence their functionality.
