Diagnosis of recurrent and metastatic disease using f-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography in breast cancer. One of the major strengths of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in breast cancer imaging is in the evaluation of patients who have suspected loco-regional recurrence or distant metastasis. In general, FDG-PET is more sensitive than conventional imaging for the detection of recurrent disease. Because of its ability to more accurately stage patients who have advanced breast cancer, FDG-PET has a significant impact on choice of treatment and management in this patient group.
