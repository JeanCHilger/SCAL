Detection of bone metastases in breast cancer by positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) is able to demonstrate changes in the metabolism of malignant tumors and metastases before they become visible on anatomical imaging. The skeleton is the most common site of distant metastases of breast cancer. There is convincing evidence that FDG-PET is more sensitive in detecting osteolytic metastases than bone scintigraphy, whereas bone scintigraphy is more sensitive in detecting osteoblastic metastases. Because both types of metastases can occur in breast cancer, bone scintigraphy and FDG-PET should be considered as complementary and can currently be regarded as standard of care for staging in breast cancer patients, whereas the decision to use F-18 fluoride PET should be made individually for each patient, depending on the expected change of therapy management.
