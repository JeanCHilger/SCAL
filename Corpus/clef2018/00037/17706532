Normal and abnormal patterns of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT in lymphoma. In spite of the high performance of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET for the evaluation of lymphoma, inherent limitations of this modality underscore the additional value of PET/CT as an important tool in the assessment of this disease. Accumulating data on the use of PET/CT in lymphoma indicate the contribution of hybrid imaging to improved interpretation accuracy of PET using FDG and CT. Knowledge of the normal and abnormal patterns of FDG-PET/CT imaging and their variability in patients with lymphoma is important to provide a comprehensive clinically significant interpretation that has an impact on patient management and potentially on outcome.
