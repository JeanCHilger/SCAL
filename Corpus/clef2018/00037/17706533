PET and PET/CT in management of the lymphomas. Within recent years, F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET has become the most important nuclear medicine and radiology imaging modality in the management of lymphoma. FDG-PET detects more disease sites and involved organs than conventional staging procedures, including CT, and has a large influence on staging. FDG-PET performed during and after therapy seems to provide considerable prognostic information. The impact on patient outcome is not clear, however, because no controlled trials have yet been conducted and follow-up periods are generally short.
