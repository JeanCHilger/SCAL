123I]FP-CIT striatal binding in early Parkinson's disease patients with tremor vs. akinetic-rigid onse. We performed [123I]FP-CIT/SPECT in 20 drug-naive Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, 10 with unilateral akinesia/rigidity at onset (arPD) and 10 with additional tremor-at-rest (tPD), to evaluate whether resting tremor at onset is associated with differences in striatal dopamine transporter binding. Patients of the two cohorts were matched for age, disease duration (<3 years) and severity of non-tremor motor symptoms 31 healthy participants served as controls. Mean striatal dopamine transporter binding reduction in PD patients vs. controls was 42% for arPD and 50% for tPD
