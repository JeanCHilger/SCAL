Sensitivity and prognostic value of positron emission tomography with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and sensitivity of immunoscintigraphy in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma treated with anticarcinoembryonic antigen-targeted radioimmunotherapy. Patients with progressive medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) undergo multiple imaging procedures for diagnosis of relapse and staging.Our objective was to assess the sensitivity and prognostic value of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), and the imaging sensitivity of pretargeted iodine-131-radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in patients with progressive MTC.We performed a prospective multicenter study in high-risk patients with rapidly progressing MTC enrolled in a phase-II pretargeted RIT study, as documented by short serum calcitonin (Ct) or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) doubling time (DT). INTERVENTIONS/MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients underwent neck-thoracic-abdominal CT, spine and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging, whole-body post-RIT immunoscintigraphy (IS) with iodine-131, and whole-body 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging. Imaging sensitivity and the correlation between FDG uptake and biomarkers DT were evaluated.A total of 33 patients with mean CEA and Ct DTs of 1.90 yr (range 0.21-8.50) and 1.52 yr (range 0.09-6.01), respectively, were evaluated. Sensitivity of FDG-PET/CT was 83% for neck, 85% for mediastinal, 75% for lung, 60% for liver, and 67% for bone metastases overall sensitivity was 76%. Median standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was 5.23 (2.06-13.90). SUVmax correlated significantly with Ct DT (P = 0.011) and minimal DT (minimal value between CEA DT and Ct DT) (P = 0.027). Overall sensitivity of post-RIT IS, CT, and bone magnetic resonance imaging were 94, 74, and 85%, respectively.These results demonstrate the value of FDG-PET/CT for staging of patients with progressive MTC, especially in the neck and mediastinum, with possible prognostication by SUV quantification. Post-RIT IS was the most sensitive of the imaging modalities studied prospectively.
