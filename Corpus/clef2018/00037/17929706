Identification of enteric Helicobacter in avian species. The presence of enteric Helicobacter species was investigated in poultry (n=130) and in pet and ornamental birds (n=50) using a PCR sequencing method which permits the differentiation of many Helicobhacter species derived from animal tissues. All samples were of Italian origin, except for 21 Guinea fowl from a French flock. About 80% of poultry (chickens, laying hens, Guinea fowl) were positive to Helicobacter DNA. H. pullorum was most frequently (62.1%) identified whereas H. pylori and 3 H. sp. hamster B strains were seen in only 3 cases each. Pet and ornamental birds were all negative. H. canadensis was found in all Guinea fowl from a French farm. This is the first report on the occurrence of this bacterium in poultry.
