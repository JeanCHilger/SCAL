Three-pinhole collimator to improve axial spatial resolution and sensitivity in pinhole SPECT. The aim of this study was to improve the uniformity of the axial spatial resolution and sensitivity in pinhole single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and to extend the axial field of view, by using a dedicated three-pinhole collimator.A rectangular tungsten plate with three pinhole apertures of 1.5 mm diameter was designed to image a cylindrical field of view of 55 mm diameter and 160 mm axial length using a clinical gamma camera. To evaluate the non-uniformity of spatial resolution and noise, a multiple-disk phantom was built. The phantom was filled with Tc-99m, and data were acquired using a circular orbit and reconstructed with a dedicated iterative reconstruction algorithm. The axial spatial resolution together with the noise was measured in each disk. These measurements were compared to a single-pinhole system using an identical acquisition geometry and reconstruction.At the central slice, a spatial resolution of 2.7 mm was observed for both the three-pinhole and single-pinhole geometries. At 17.5 mm from the central slice, the axial spatial resolution deteriorated to 10.3 mm when using a single pinhole, while the spatial resolution remained 2.7 mm for the three-pinhole system. In the central slice, 19% noise was observed for both geometries. At 31.5 mm from this central slice, the noise remained 19% for the three-pinhole geometry, while it increased to 32% using a single pinhole.The presented three-pinhole collimator improves the uniformity of the axial spatial resolution and sensitivity in pinhole SPECT and consequently extends the axial field of view, a requirement for whole-body small-animal imaging.
