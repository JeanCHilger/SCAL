Hypotensive activity and cerebroprotective properties of carvedilol in patients with arterial hypertension associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Aim of the study was to elucidate peculiarities of influence of carvedilol on 24-hour blood pressure (BP) profiles and changes of parameters of cerebral perfusion in patients with arterial hypertension (AH) associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Investigations were performed in 30 patients with I-III degree AH associated with type 2 diabetes of compensation and subcompensation stages. At baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment with carvedilol we carried out 24-hour BP monitoring, single photon emission computer tomography of the brain, and assessed the state of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. According to data of 24-hour BP monitoring marked lowering of BP parameters occurred under the influence of therapy. This was accompanied with 26% decrease of the number of hypoperfused sectors of the brain (chi2=6.04, =0.014). During adenosine test number of hypoperfused sectors decreased from 136 to 117 (chi2=2,10, =0,147) what evidenced for a tendency to improvement of reactivity of cerebral vessels in response to vasodilating influences. The preparation exerted favorable effect on metabolic parameters and lowering of level of postprandial glycemia in dynamics of treatment was statistically significant.
