Improvement of brain tissue oxygenation by inhalation of carbogen. Hyperoxic therapy for cerebral ischemia is suspected to reduce cerebral blood flow (CBF), due to the vasoconstrictive effect of oxygen on cerebral arterioles. We hypothesized that vasodilation predominates when 5% CO(2) is added to the inhaled oxygen (carbogen). Therefore, we used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure CBF and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) during inhalation of test gases (O(2), CO(2), carbogen and atmospheric air) in 10 healthy volunteers. Arterial blood gases were recorded during administration of each gas. The data were analyzed with volume-of-interest and voxel-based statistical methods. Inhalation of CO(2) or carbogen significantly increased global CBF, whereas pure oxygen decreased global CBF. The CMRO(2) generally remained unchanged, except in white matter during oxygen inhalation relative to condition of atmospheric air inhalation. The volume-of-interest results were confirmed by statistical cluster analysis. Oxygen and carbogen were equally potent in increasing oxygen saturation of arterial blood (Sa(O2)). The present data demonstrate that inhalation of carbogen increases both CBF and Sa(O2) in healthy adults. In conclusion we speculate that carbogen inhalation is sufficient for optimal oxygenation of healthy brain tissue, whereas carbogen induces concomitant increases of CBF and Sa(O2).
