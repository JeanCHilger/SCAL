Analytic system matrix resolution modeling in PET: an application to Rb-82 cardiac imaging. This work explores application of a novel resolution modeling technique based on analytic physical models which individually models the various resolution degrading effects in PET (positron range, photon non-collinearity, inter-crystal scattering and inter-crystal penetration) followed by their combination and incorporation within the image reconstruction task. In addition to phantom studies, the proposed technique was particularly applied to and studied in the task of clinical Rb-82 myocardial perfusion imaging, which presently suffers from poor statistics and resolution properties in the reconstructed images. Overall, the approach is able to produce considerable enhancements in image quality. The reconstructed FWHM for a Discovery RX PET/CT scanner was seen to improve from 5.1 mm to 7.7 mm across the field-of-view (FoV) to approximately 3.5 mm nearly uniformly across the FoV. Furthermore, extended-source phantom studies indicated clearly improved images in terms of contrast versus noise performance. Using Monte Carlo simulations of clinical Rb-82 imaging, the resolution modeling technique was seen to significantly outperform standard reconstructions qualitatively, and also quantitatively in terms of contrast versus noise (contrast between the myocardium and other organs, as well as between myocardial defects and the left ventricle).
