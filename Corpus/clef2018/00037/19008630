Detection of diastolic abnormality by dyssynchrony imaging: correlation with coronary artery disease in patients presenting with visibly normal wall motion. Post-systolic shortening (PSS) is a sensitive indicator of myocardial ischemia.We have developed a tissue Doppler imaging technique that portrays PSS, and whether PSS correlates with coronary artery disease (CAD) was investigated in 186 patients presenting with chest pain and normal echocardiograms. Delays of the displacement peaks from end-systole were calculated in the apical views and displayed from green (0 ms) to red (>or=100 ms): detection of diastolic abnormality by dyssynchrony imaging (DADI). CAD was judged positive by DADI when the left ventricular segments were color-coded red. Patients subsequently underwent thallium-201 myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (n=150), coronary angiography (CAG, n=74), or both (n=37). CAD(-) was defined as negative scintigraphy test and/or no significant coronary artery stenosis by CAG. In 43 patients (23%), CAD(+) was confirmed by CAG as >75% diameter stenosis. DADI predicted CAD with sensitivity of 60%, specificity of 75%, predictive accuracy of 72%, positive predictive value of 42%, and negative predictive value of 86%. Among 74 patients who underwent CAG, sensitivity was best for the left anterior descending artery.DADI detected the regional diastolic abnormality, which correlated with the presence of CAD in patients presenting with visibly normal wall motion.
