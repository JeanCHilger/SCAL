Regional cerebral blood flow patterns of change following the own body image exposure in eating disorders: a longitudinal study. The aim of the present study is to see if the changes in the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) experienced by restrictive anorexia nervosa (AR) and bulimia nervosa (BN) patients, following the exposure to their own body image, persist at follow-up.Three single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were performed on nine patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of AR, 13 with BP, and 12 controls: at rest, following a neutral stimulus, and after exposure to their previously filmed whole body image. Body dissatisfaction was measured by means of the Body Dissatisfaction Questionnaire (BSQ). One year later the same assessment was repeated.Following the exposure to their own body image, BN showed an increase in body dissatisfaction, which was associated with the increase in the rCBF of the Right Temporal Area. Those changes persisted at follow-up.More specific long term therapies are needed for the treatment of the averse response showed by ED patients to their own body image exposure that is associated with the hyperactivation of the right temporal area when they are confronted with their whole body image.
