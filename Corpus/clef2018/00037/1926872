Quantification of human hepatic binding protein (HBP) via 99mTc-galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin (NGA) liver scintigraphy. 99mTc-galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin (99mTc-NGA) was synthesized by covalent coupling of 2-imino-2-methoxyethyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside to the primary amino groups of human serum albumin. Injection of 99mTc-NGA (150 MBq 3.5 mg (= 50 nmol)/ml demonstrated the liver to be the exclusive site of tracer-uptake. Simulation of 99mTc-NGA-kinetics allowed quantification of binding to the hepatic binding protein (HBP). Using this model we studied 250 patients with various liver disease. In alcoholic liver cirrhosis such patients with Child B and Child C stage cirrhosis had a lower HBP-concentration in the liver compared to control individuals (0.85-1.2 mumol/l). The group with the most advanced cirrhosis (Child C stage) had a significantly lower HBP-concentration (0.20-0.45 mumol/l) than Child A patients (0.60-0.85 mumol/l
