Clinical and molecular neuroimaging characteristics of Brazilian patients with Parkinson's disease and mutations in PARK2 or PARK8 genes. To describe clinical and neuroimaging (SPECT) characteristics of Brazilian patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and mutations in PARK2 or PARK8 genes.A total of 119 patients meeting clinical criteria for PD were evaluated.Of all patients studied, 13 had mutations in either PARK2 (n=9) or PARK8 genes (n=4). No statistically significant differences in clinical characteristics in both groups were seen. SPECT with [99mTc] TRODAT-1 showed significant differences between patient and control and the most remarkable difference was between PARK2 and control.The study found a frequency of mutation of 10.1% and it was most commonly seen in women. These patients had long disease course and high rates of dyskinesia after L-DOPA use. PARK8 patients did not have a relevant family history of PD.
