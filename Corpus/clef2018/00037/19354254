Potent, brain-penetrant, hydroisoindoline-based human neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists. 3-[(3aR,4R,5S,7aS)-5-{(1R)-1-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]ethoxy}-4-(4-fluorophenyl)octahydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl]cyclopent-2-en-1-one (17) is a high affinity, brain-penetrant, hydroisoindoline-based neurokinin-1 (NK(1)) receptor antagonist with a long central duration of action in preclinical species and a minimal drug-drug interaction profile. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies in rhesus showed that this compound provides 90% NK(1) receptor blockade in rhesus brain at a plasma level of 67 nM, which is about 10-fold more potent than aprepitant, an NK(1) antagonist marketed for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced and postoperative nausea and vomiting (CINV and PONV). The synthesis of this enantiomerically pure compound containing five stereocenters includes a Diels-Alder condensation, one chiral separation of the cyclohexanol intermediate, an ether formation using a trichloroacetimidate intermediate, and bis-alkylation to form the cyclic amine.
