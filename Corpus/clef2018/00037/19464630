Functional and metabolic magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography for tumor volume definition in high-grade gliomas. Although the addition of concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) to standard-dose radiation (60 Gy) improves survival, the pattern of failure continues to be local. Conventional contrast enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used for radiation planning reflect anatomic rather than molecular or functional, properties of the tumor. Functional and metabolic MRI and positron emission tomography are able to detect metabolic and functional abnormalities beyond the tumor volume seen on conventional MRI, assess early response to treatment, and delineate the regions of high risks for failure in high-grade gliomas. This article focuses on the potential of these functional and metabolic imaging techniques to refine our clinical target volumes.
