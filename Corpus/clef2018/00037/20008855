A Phase I Clinical Trial of CHT-25 a 131I-Labeled Chimeric Anti-CD25 Antibody Showing Efficacy in Patients with Refractory Lymphoma. PURPOSE: There is a need for new treatments for Hodgkin and T-cell lymphoma due to the development of drug resistance in a proportion of patients. This phase I study of radioimmunotherapy used CHT-25, a chimeric antibody to the alpha-chain of the interleukin-2 receptor, CD25, conjugated to iodine-131 ((131)I) in patients with refractory CD25-positive lymphomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fifteen patients were treated (Hodgkin lymphoma, 12 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, 1
