Petechial bleedings in sudden infant death. The autopsy reports of 484 cases of deceased infants (201 females, 283 males) were analysed retrospectively for the existence of external and internal petechial bleedings (PET). The cases were divided into five groups on the basis of the cause of death (sudden infant death syndrome, sepsis, airway infections, asphyxia and trauma). Internal PET (pleural, pericardial, epicardial, thymic and peritoneal) were observed in each group with a lower prevalence in cases of trauma. The highest prevalence of external (cutaneous and conjunctival) PET was detected in cases of asphyxia (38% and 31%, respectively). However, even if with low prevalence, such bleedings were detected in every group. Factors like sex, age, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and its duration did not influence the presence of PET. The detection of external PET at autopsy is a suspicious finding that suggests asphyxia. Because of the possible natural origin of these bleedings, the medicolegal investigation has to be as complete as possible and has to include histology as mandatory.
