Diagnostic value of (18)F-FDG PET for evaluation of paraaortic nodal metastasis in patients with cervical carcinoma: a metaanalysis. We assessed the diagnostic performance of (18)F-FDG PET in detecting paraaortic lymph node (PALN) metastasis in patients with cervical cancer.Through a search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (1980 to March 2009), we performed a random-effects meta analysis. A summary receiver-operating-characteristic curve was constructed using hierarchical regression models. To identify other sources of heterogeneity, regression meta analysis was performed.Patients (n = 385) from 10 studies were analyzed. Although specificity of (18)F-FDG PET was consistent (97% 95% confidence interval [CI], 93%-99%), sensitivity was low and heterogeneous among the studies (34%In detecting PALN metastasis, PET performs acceptably only in populations with a relatively high probability of PALN metastasis. Otherwise, we found no evidence to justify the evaluation of PALN based solely on PET in cervical cancer.
