Treatment outcomes of triplane and Tillaux fractures of the ankle in adolescence. To identify the fracture configuration and treatment results for patients with triplane and Tillaux fractures in the ankle joint.A retrospective study was performed on 14 patients with a more than one year follow-up. This study investigated the fracture configuration, concomitant fibula fracture, treatment methods and complications. The treatment outcomes were analyzed using modified Weber protocol.Among the 14 cases, 11 were triplane fractures and 3 were Tillaux fractures. Seven were two part triplane fractures, and 4 were three part triplane fractures. Eight were lateral triplane fractures, and 3 were medial triplane fractures. A fibula fracture was accompanied by 7. The fibular fracture comprised of oblique fractures in all cases. A closed and open reduction was performed in 6 and 8 cases, respectively. All but one showed excellent treatment outcomes at the final follow-up. Traumatic arthritis developed in 1 case.Precisely detecting the fracture configuration by computed tomography and understanding the injury mechanism have greatly improved the outcomes of triplane fractures and Tillaux fractures of the ankle in adolescent patients.
