Radiochemical synthesis, rodent biodistribution and tumor uptake, and dosimetry calculations of [¹¹C] methylated LY2181308. The aim of the study was to develop a rapid and reproducible method to label LY2181308, an antisense oligonucleotide to Survivin, with carbon-11 in order to study its in vivo biodistribution and tumor uptake in rodents and its human dosimetry based on baboon data.Randomly [¹¹C] methylated LY2181308 was produced with [¹¹C] methyl iodide. The biodistribution was performed in female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and EMT-6 tumor-bearing mice in the presence of nonradioactive LY2181308. Human dosimetry calculations were based on baboon PET studies.In SD rats, the kidney and liver were the organs with the most accumulation of radioactivity. Tumor uptake in mice was also relatively high after 5 min and remained constant for up to 1 h. Baboon dosimetry suggested that up to 42 mCi of radioactivity could be administered to human with a dose-limiting organ being the kidneys with a radiation dose of 32 µGy/MBq (0.118 rad/mCi).[¹¹C] methylated LY2181308 to rodents and baboons showed its biodistribution, tumor uptake, and human dosimetry evaluation. These results should facilitate the understanding of the pharmacokinetics of LY2181308 prior to use as a potential new therapeutic agent in oncology as well as to warrant more in vivo validations as a potentially useful tumor-imaging agent.
