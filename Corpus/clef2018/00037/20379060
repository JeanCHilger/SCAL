Evaluation of an attenuation correction method in brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography using magnetic resonance imaging. Generally, the Chang method depends on counts for the attenuation correction (AC) method in brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), because the head outlined for a uniform attenuation coefficient map is set to the sinogram of the projection data by the threshold (Sinogram Threshold Chang method). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a routine examination in our hospital. Patients who underwent N-isopropyl-p-[(123)I] iodoamphetamine ((123)I-IMP) SPECT are undergoing MRI. Therefore, we thought it help AC accuracy to set an accurate head outline by using the image. We jointly made "Software for an attenuation coefficient map using MRI" for trial purposes. This paper investigated whether the AC method using MRI promotes the accuracy of brain perfusion SPECT in some clinical samples. With AC methods using gamma ray transmission computed tomography (TCT) or X-ray CT (CT) also being taken into account, the AC method using MRI was compared with the Sinogram Threshold Chang method. As a result, count dependency was excluded by an accurate head outline setting that used MRI, and the AC method using MRI approached the effect of the AC method using TCT and CT more than the Sinogram Threshold Chang method. Therefore, it is suggested that the AC method using MRI is useful for the accuracy of brain perfusion SPECT.
