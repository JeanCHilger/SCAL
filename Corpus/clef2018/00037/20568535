Correlation of mucosal involvement as evaluated by computed tomography and bone single-photon emission tomography findings SPECT in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Osteitis has been proven to play important role in patophysiology of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Computed tomography (CT), a standard diagnostic technique used to evaluate the extent of the sinus disease, fails to show the bone involvement in patients with CRS. In contrast single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) yields adequate information on remodeling and bone turnover. Persistent osteitis may be one of the reasons of failure of adequate medical and surgical therapy for CRS and discrepancies between extent of the disease as evaluated by CT and symptom scores.is to evaluate correlation between the results of CT and SPECT in patients with CRS.29 patients with CRS (15 with nasal polyps and 14 without nasal polyps) were evaluated with CT and SPECT. The mucosal involvement of CRS graded on Lund-Mackay Scale (LMS) was compared to degree of bone involvement evaluated by SPECT with the use of modified LMS.The mean LMS grade was 13,3 for CT and 9,8 for SCPECT (modified LMS). A positive correlation between the results of two imaging methods was found r = 0.72 (p < 0.0001).The bone involvement as evaluated by SPECT correlates with the degree of mucosal changes showed by CT.
