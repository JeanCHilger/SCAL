4-(3-Cyclopentoxy-4-[ Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are composed of at least 11 families of enzymes that hydrolyze cyclic 3´,5´-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and/or 3´,5´-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to the corresponding inactive 5´-AMP and 5´-GMP, respectively (1, 2). These second-messenger cyclic nucleotides are formed in response to stimuli (such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and cytokines) to regulate cellular functions. PDEs are essential in the termination of cellular responses via their degradation of cyclic nucleotides. PDE type-4 (PDE4) is Ca
