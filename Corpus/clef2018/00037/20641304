. Hypoxia in malignant tumors can affect the outcome of anti-cancer treatments. Malignant tumors are relatively resistant to chemotherapy and irradiative therapy because of their lack of oxygen, a potent radiosensitizer. This is the reason for the multitude of efforts to develop methods and imaging techniques for measuring oxygen in tissues. Radiolabeled 2-nitroimidazole compounds have been developed to specifically detect tumor hypoxia, offering a less invasive and less technically demanding alternative to the Eppendorf (oxygen) electrode method. The imaging technique also avoids sampling bias. [
