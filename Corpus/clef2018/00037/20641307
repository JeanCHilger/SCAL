 Sigma receptor (SR) subtypes 1 (Sig-1R) and 2 (Sig-2R) and are known to be present primarily in the central nervous system and the peripheral tissues. Both receptor subtypes have a different distribution in the two types of tissues, and the exact biological function of these receptors is not known (1). Of the two receptor subtypes, only the Sig-1R has been cloned, expressed, and purified (2). The Sig-2R is known to be overexpressed in various malignant tumors and is believed to promote cell proliferation, indicating that these receptors may play a role in the development of some cancers (3). As a consequence, the Sig-2R have been suggested to be biomarkers for tumor cell proliferation (4) and could be targeted for the development of different anti-cancer drugs (5) or imaging agents for tumors that overexpress Sig-2R (3, 5). Several clinical trials have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the evaluation of drugs that target the Sig-2R for the imaging and treatment of different clinical conditions. In addition, Sig-2R ligands have been used in preclinical studies to chemosensitize tumors to low doses of anti-cancer drugs that are otherwise toxic when given at high doses to animals bearing mammalian cell line tumors (6, 7). Investigators have developed and characterized several SR ligands, but most of them are either selective only for the Sig-1R or have similar affinity for both SR subtypes, therefore limiting their use as anti-cancer drugs that target the Sig-2R or as detection and imaging agents for this receptor (3, 7). In an effort to develop a ligand with high specificity for Sig-2R, Tu et al. synthesized a series of
