 Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays an important role in the pathophysiology of many diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, vascular disorders, and chronic hepatitis, as well as in the biology of normal cells, such as epithelial cells and immune cells (1). Apoptosis is gene regulated (2) and involves the proteolysis of intracellular components by activation of a series of proteolytic enzymes, called caspases, and changes of plasma membrane structure by translocase, floppase, and scramblase (3-5). As a result, there is rapid redistribution of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner membrane leaflet to the outer membrane leaflet of apoptotic cells, exposing the anionic head group of PS. On the other hand, PS is also accessible for annexin V binding in necrotic cells because of disruption of the plasma membrane. Annexin V is a 36-kDa endogenous human protein that is produced by the epithelial cells of many tissues, such as placenta, umbilical vessels, liver, spleen, kidney, heart, uterus, and skeletal muscle, as well as by erythrocytes, leukocytes, endothelial cells, and platelets (6). Annexin V binds to PS with high affinity (
