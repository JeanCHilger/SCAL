Normal Positron Emission Tomography-Computerized Tomogram in a Patient with Apparent Mesenteric Panniculitis: Biopsy Is Still the Answer. Mesenteric panniculitis (also known as sclerosing mesenteritis) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the mesenteric connective tissue. It is known to have a wide spectrum of clinical and radiological presentations. In general, biopsy is recommended for diagnosis however, a recent study proposed that a negative positron emission tomography- computerized tomography (PET-CT) scan is accurate in differentiating benign and neoplastic mesenteric processes [Br J Radiol 2006
