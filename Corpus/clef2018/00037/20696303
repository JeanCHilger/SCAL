Multi-technique imaging of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown aetiology. The diagnosis is suggested on the basis of wide ranging clinical and radiological manifestations, and is supported by the histological demonstration of non-caseating granulomas in affected tissues. This review highlights the multisystem radiological features of the disease across a variety of imaging methods including multidetector computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as functional radionuclide techniques, particularly 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). It is important for the radiologist to be aware of the varied radiological manifestations of sarcoidosis in order to recognize and suggest the diagnosis in the appropriate clinical setting.
