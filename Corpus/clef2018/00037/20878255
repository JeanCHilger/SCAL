Comparison of gated single-photon emission computed tomography with magnetic resonance imaging for evaluation of left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. To prospectively compare the left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), end-systolic volume (LVESV), and ejection fraction (LVEF) obtained from gated perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (GSPECT) with those obtained from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC). Twenty-one patients with IDC (6 females) with a median age of 45 years (range 17-65) were scheduled for (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin-GSPECT and MRI within a 3 h interval. In both methods LV volumes were analyzed with the Simpson method. Both GSPECT and MRI were successfully completed in 90% of patients. Close linear correlations were observed between the two methods in LVEDV (R = 0.918 P < 0.001) and LVESV (R = 0.946
