Use of FDG-PET imaging for patients with disseminated cancer of the appendix. The goal of this study is to evaluate the use of positron emission tomography (PET) in evaluation of patients with peritoneal dissemination of carcinoma of appendiceal origin (PDA). Thirty-three patients with PDA, who had preoperative PET or PET/CT imaging, were analyzed. Using operative, pathology, and PET +/- CT data, presence or absence of disease in each abdominal quadrant was noted and the use of 18fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) PET for each quadrant was evaluated. The mean age was 52, and there were 17 males 58 per cent had low-grade lesions. PET was positive in only 35 per cent of cases overall (30 and 41% sensitivity for low-grade and high-grade, respectively). PET without CT sensitivity for low-grade and high-grade lesions was 21 and 8 per cent, respectively. PET imaging has limited use for patients with PDA. We do not recommend the use of FDG-PET for patients with PDA from cancer of the appendix.
