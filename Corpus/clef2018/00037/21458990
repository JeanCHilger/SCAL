2-Arylimidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazoles: a new family of amyloid binding agents with potential for PET and SPECT imaging of Alzheimer's brain. We designed and synthesized a small series of 2-aryl-imidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazole, representing a combination of motifs from the two most potent amyloid imaging agents, PIB and IMPY. The binding affinity of the new compounds ranged from 6 to 133 nM. Among the best compounds, 3b (K(i)=6 nM) can be labeled with (11)CH(3) for PET imaging whereas 3j (K(i)=10.9 nM) can be labeled with (123)I for SPECT imaging.
