Role of F-18-FDG-PET/CT in restaging of patients affected by gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are a subset of mesenchymal tumours that represent the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and account for less than 1% of all gastrointestinal tumours.We retrospectively evaluated 19 patients (6 females and 13 males median age: 61 years Â± 15 standard deviation) affected by GIST histologically documented after surgical intervention or biopsy.F18-FDG-PET/CT had identified pathologic uptakes and was considered positive for neoplastic tissue in 10 patients (53%) and negative in 9 (47%), in concordance with radiological findings.F18-FDG-PET/CT is a feasible, reliable, and accurate method to restage patients affected by previously histologically confirmed GIST, also in the absence of a staging study.
