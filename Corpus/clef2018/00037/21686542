Cardiac tamponade caused by epithelioid haemangioendothelioma. Epithelioid haemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a tumour of vascular endothelial origin. The rarity of EHE has limited the complete understanding of the disease. Here, a unique case of EHE complicated with cardiac tamponade with an unusual initial presentation, scoliosis, is reported. The discordant findings between a Tc99m bone scan and 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDP PET) also serve to impart another lesson about investigating bone metastasis in EHE.
