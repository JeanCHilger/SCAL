The impact of dialysis solution biocompatibility on ultrafiltration and on free water transport in rats. This study compares different peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDF) in rats over a short contact time. For greater accuracy, net ultrafiltration (UF) and peritoneal transport indices, mass transfer area coefficient (MTAC) were scaled for the in vivo peritoneal surface area recruited (ivPSA) measured by microcomputerized tomography. Wistar rats underwent nephrectomy (5/6ths), were randomized into two groups and given 1.5% glucose PDF, either conventional acidic lactate (n = 14) or pH neutral bicarbonate (BicaVera) (n = 13) MTAC and UF were measured using a 90-min peritoneal equilibrium test (PET), fill volume (IPV) of 10 ml/100 g
