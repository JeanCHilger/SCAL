Multidisciplinary management of ovarian epithelial cancer. Radiological diagnosis. In the context of a multidisciplinary approach for the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer, the contribution of radiology includes the following four fundamental points: identification of the lesion, its characterization, study of its extension and evaluation of its evolution. This article describes the findings and key diagnostic elements in MDCT (Multidetector Computed Tomography) and MR (Magnetic Resonance), the contribution and indication of other technologies like PET (Positron Emission Tomography), and outlines the emergent techniques based on functional image analysis (dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI studies and MRI diffusion studies).
