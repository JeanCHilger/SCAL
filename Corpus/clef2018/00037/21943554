Three-dimensional imaging in cardiac resynchronization therapy. Cardiac resynchronization therapy improves clinical symptoms and prognosis of heart failure patients. However, it has been shown that up to 40% of patients do not respond to this therapy. Three main determinants of cardiac resynchronization therapy response have been identified: left ventricular dyssynchrony, left ventricular lead position, and extent and location of myocardial scar tissue. Two-dimensional echocardiography is the first imaging technique to evaluate patients who may be candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy. However, a multimodality approach based on 3-dimensional imaging techniques may provide a more comprehensive evaluation of these patients by combining the assessment of the aforementioned pathophysiological determinants of cardiac resynchronization therapy response.
