Quantitative exercise thallium-201 rotational tomography for evaluation of patients with prior myocardial infarction. The utility of stress-redistribution thallium-201 myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with a prior single myocardial infarction was studied in 66 patients who were tested by both SPECT and coronary angiography. SPECT was quantified by comparing the patients' circumferential count profiles to a previously established normal data base and by plotting the results onto a polar coordinate map that localized defects to the 3 major coronary artery territories. The pattern of reversibility of the quantitatively detected defects was assessed by consensus visual analysis. SPECT thallium-201 detected myocardial infarction in 62 of 66 patients (sensitivity = 94%). Sixty-five percent of the infarct zones showed some reversibility at 4-hour imaging which corresponded with angiographic evidence of flow to the infarct zones in 95.5% of cases. Late (18 to 24 hours) imaging, done in 26 patients, showed complete or partial reversibility of 29% of infarct zone segments which were nonreversible on 4-hour images. To improve specificity for detection of disease in coronary arteries supplying the non-infarct territories, new quantitative criteria were developed that took into consideration contiguity of defects with the infarct zone. Accuracy for detection of patients with multivessel coronary disease by quantitative thallium-201 SPECT was 86%, which was significantly higher than those of the clinical response to exercise (48%), the exercise electrocardiographic response (56%) or their combination (65%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
