Peptoid and Positron Emission Tomography: an Appealing Combination. Non-invasive and quantitative imaging of tumor angiogenesis is essential for lesion detection, patient stratification, drug development, and personalized anti-cancer therapies. In particular, the right timing is critical for anti-angiogenic cancer therapy and non-invasive imaging can help determine whether to start and when to start such treatment. In this inaugural issue of the American Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, a peptoid-based positron emission tomography (PET) tracer was reported for imaging of VEGFR expression in a prostate cancer model. This important proof-of-principle study opened the door to a fertile area of research, which holds tremendous potential for various applications in future personalized medicine.
