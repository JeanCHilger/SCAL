SUV-measurements and patient-specific corrections in pediatric Hodgkin-lymphoma: is there a benefit for PPV in early response assessment by FDG-PET? To evaluate the influence of different SUV-measurements and patient-specific corrections thereof on the positive predictive value (PPV) of FDG-PET in pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma (pHL) using SUV-based response assessment.PET-datasets of 33 children [female, n = 13, male, n = 20 range of age, 8.0-17.8 (mean, 15.0) yearsThree patients had recurrence of disease. ROC-analysis showed the most accurate differentiation of responders and non-responders for ΔSUVmax_BSA [AUC, 0.97 P = 0.0026At early response assessment by FDG-PET, patient-specific correction of ΔSUVmax by BSA improves PPV without impairment of excellent NPV in pHL. However, it is not statistically superior to simple ΔSUVmax-analyses. Larger cohorts are needed to investigate this observation.
