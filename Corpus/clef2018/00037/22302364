Site-selective radiolabeling of peptides by (18)F-fluorobenzoylation with [(18F)]SFB in solution and on solid phase: a comparative study. Peptides labeled with short-lived positron-emitting radionuclides are of outstanding interest as probes for molecular imaging by positron emission tomography (PET). Herein, the site-selective incorporation of fluorine-18 into lysine-containing peptides using the prosthetic labeling agent N-succinimidyl 4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB) is described. The reaction of [(18)F]SFB with four biologically relevant resin-bound peptides was studied and optimized. For comparison, each peptide was 18F-fluorobenzoylated in solution under different conditions and the product distribution was analyzed confirming the advantages of the solid-phase approach. The method's feasibility for selective radiolabeling either at the N-terminus or at the lysine side chain was demonstrated. Labeling on solid phase with [(18)F]SFB resulted in crude (18)F-fluorobenzoylpeptides whose radiochemical purities were typically greater than 90% and that could be prepared in synthesis times from 65 to 76 min.
