Synthesis of galactooligosaccharides by CBD fusion β-galactosidase immobilized on cellulose. The β-galactosidase gene (bgaL3) was cloned from Lactobacillus bulgaricus L3 and fused with cellulose binding domain (CBD) using pET-35b (+) vector in Escherichia coli. The resulting fusion protein (CBD-BgaL3) was directly adsorbed onto microcrystalline cellulose with a high immobilization efficiency of 61%. A gram of cellulose was found to absorb 97.6 U of enzyme in the solution containing 100mM NaCl (pH 5.8) at room temperature for 20 min. The enzymatic and transglycosylation characteristics of the immobilized CBD-BgaL3 were similar to the free form. Using the immobilized enzyme as the catalyst, the yield of galactooligosaccharides (GOS) reached a maximum of 49% (w/w) from 400 g/L lactose (pH 7.6) at 45 °C for 75 min, with a high productivity of 156.8 g/L/h. Reusability assay was subsequently performed under the same reaction conditions. The immobilized enzyme could retain over 85% activity after twenty batches with the GOS yields all above 40%.
