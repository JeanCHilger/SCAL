Inflammatory aortitis in giant cell arteritis. A sub-clinical inflammatory aortitis is very frequent in patients with giant cell arteritis, and can be the only localization of the disease. In most patients, this aortitis is asymptomatic and is of no consequence on the patient's survival. The relative risk of developing an aortic dissection or aneurysm is 17.3. Evolution towards an aneurysm or an aortic dissection is unpredictable and rare and seems independent of the disease activity and the associated vascular risk factors. Isolated aortitis treatment is not consensual, but often similar to the treatment of giant cell arteritis and adapted to clinical and biological markers of disease activity. Screening for sub-clinical aortitis with FDG-PET should not be prescribed in patients with typical presentation of giant cell arteritis. A systematic screening of aortic complications in giant cell arteritis patients could be done with a chest X-ray and an abdominal ultrasound possibly completed with an aortic CT-scan at time of diagnosis, in order to look for aneurysms with possible surgical indication.
