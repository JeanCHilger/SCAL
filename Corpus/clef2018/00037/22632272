Comparative study of the value of dual tracer PET/CT in evaluating breast cancer. The present study was conducted to assess the relationship between tumor uptake and pathologic findings using dual-tracer PET/computed tomography (CT) in patients with breast cancer. Seventy-four patients with breast cancer (mean age 54 years) who underwent (11)C-choline and 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT prior to surgery on the same day were enrolled in the present study. Images were reviewed by a board-certified radiologist and two nuclear medicine specialists who were unaware of any clinical information and a consensus was reached. Uptake patterns and measurements of dual tracers were compared with the pathologic findings of resected specimens as the reference standard. Mean (±SD) tumor size was 5.9 ± 3.2 cm. All primary tumors were identified on (18)F-FDG PET/CT and (11)C-choline PET/CT. However, (18)F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated focal uptake of the primary tumor with (n = 38 51%) or without (n = 36
