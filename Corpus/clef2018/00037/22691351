Expression and purification of recombinant Trail protein in E.coli and the optimal conditions for Trail purification. To construct the expression vector pET-28α-Trail(114-281) and find the optimal conditions for target gene expression,  host bacteria lysis,  and protein purification, and to  detect the apoptosis function of the recombinant  protein.The functional domain of Trail(114-281) was amplified by PCR and  cloned into the expression vector pET-28α(+). After confirmed by DNA sequencing,  the Trail(114-281)The 516 bp Trail(114-281) gene was cloned,  and expressed in E.coli BL21.  When  A(600)The expression vector pET-28α-Trail(114-281) can be   constructed and expressed in E.coli  BL21 successfully.  Temperature is a more important effect factor of Trail(114-281)
