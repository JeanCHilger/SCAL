Prokaryotic expression and polyclonal antibody preparation of human novel gene CTRP4. To   further investigate the  biological function of human novel gene CTRP4 by constructing   the prokaryotic expression vector of human CTRP4,   inducing the expression of and purifying  hCTRP4-his protein in E.coli,  and preparing  polyclonal antibody against human CTRP4.Human CTRP4 gene was amplified by PCR,  digested with enzymes,  and subcloned into a his-tagged prokaryotic expression vector to generate a recombinant plasmid named pET-32a-hCTRP4. The pET-32a-hCTRP4 was transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3). The hCTRP4-his fusion protein was induced by IPTG,  purified by Ni-NTA purification system,  and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant vector pcDNA3.1-myc/his(-)B-hCTRP4 expressing full-length human CTRP4 and purified prokaryotic protein hCTRP4 were used to immunize BALB/c mice to produce polyclonal antibody. The anti-serum was purified and the characteristics of the antibody were identified by ELISA,  Western blotting,  immunofluorescence cytochemistry  and immunohistochemistry.The prokaryotic expression vector of pET-32a-hCTRP4 was   constructed successfully. hCTRP4-his fusion protein was expressed in E.coli BL21(DE3) after IPTG induction. The titer of the anti-serum reached 1:20 000,  and its specificity was proved by Western blotting. The results of immunofluorescence cytochemistry   and immunohistochemistry indicated that CTRP4   was       mainly localized in the cytoplasm of hepatic cells.hCTRP4-his fusion protein can be successfully expressed in E.coli. A specific polyclonal antibody against human CTRP4 has been  successfully prepared.
