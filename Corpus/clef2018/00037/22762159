Description of high purity and high specific activity of [11C]Choline synthesis using TRACERlab FXc module, and detailed report of quality controls. We proposed a method of synthesis to produce [11C]Choline using TRACERlab FXc module that utilized gas phase iodination. The product had radiochemical purity of 99.79 ± 0.14 % and specific activity of 45.7 ± 7.59 GBq/μmol. [11C]Choline did not have at the moment a specific monograph in European Pharmacopeia therefore we used, when possible, as quality controls reference the monograph of [18F]FDG and we proposed suitable methods to verify radiochemical purity and to quantify residual DMAE and choline amounts.
