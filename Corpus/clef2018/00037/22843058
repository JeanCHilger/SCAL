Comparative diagnostic performance of ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT versus whole-body MRI for determination of remission status in multiple myeloma after stem cell transplantation. To compare the diagnostic performance of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WBMRI) versus (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for determination of remission status in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) after stem cell transplantation (SCT).Thirty-one patients were examined by both WBMRI and PET/CT after SCT. Imaging results and clinical remission status as determined by the clinical gold standard (Uniform Response Criteria) were compared.One hundred four lesions were detected in 21 patients. PET/CT had a sensitivity of 50.0 %, a specificity of 85.7 %, a positive predictive value of 62.5 %, a negative predictive value of 78.3 %, and an overall accuracy of 74.2 % for determination of remission status. MRI had a sensitivity of 80.0 %, a specificity of 38.1 %, a positive predictive value of 38.1 %, a negative predictive value of 80 %, and an overall accuracy of 51.6 %. Concordant results were observed in only 12 (11.5 %) of the 104 lesions.In the post-treatment setting, both FDG PET/CT and WBMRI provide information about the extent of disease, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of persisting or recurrent myeloma. MRI may often be false positive because of persistent non-viable lesions. Therefore, PET/CT might be more suitable than MRI for determination of remission status.
