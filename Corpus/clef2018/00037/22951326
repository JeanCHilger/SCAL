Kinetic parameter estimation using a closed-form expression via integration by parts. Dynamic emission computed tomographic imaging with compartment modeling can quantify in vivo physiologic processes, eliciting more information regarding underlying molecular disease processes than is obtained from static imaging. However, estimation of kinetic rate parameters for multi-compartment models can be computationally demanding and problematic due to local minima. A number of techniques for kinetic parameter estimation have been studied and are in use today, generally offering a tradeoff between computation time, robustness of fit and flexibility with differing sets of assumptions. This paper presents a means to eliminate all differential operations by using the integration-by-parts method to provide closed-form formulas, so that the mathematical model is less sensitive to data sampling and noise. A family of closed-form formulas are obtained. Computer simulations show that the proposed method is robust without having to specify the initial condition.
