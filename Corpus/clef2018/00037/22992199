Comparison of ( 18 ) F-FLT PET and ( 18 ) F-FDG PET for detection of cervical lymph node metastases in head and neck cancers. Despite low uptake of tracer, 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine (FLT) PET could detect cervical lymph node metastases as well as 2-deoxy-2-(18)F-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) PET.The diagnostic efficacy of FLT PET was compared with that of FDG PET regarding nodal staging of head and neck squamous cell cancers.Twenty-three patients were examined with FLT PET and FDG PET. PET images were evaluated qualitatively for regions of focally increased metabolism and maximum standardized uptake values (SUV) were calculated for semiquantitative analysis.The mean (± SD) FLT SUV in visualized metastatic lymph nodes was 4.8 ± 2.9 as compared with 6.9 ± 4.9 for FDG SUV (p < 0.001). Significant correlations were found between the area of metastatic lymph nodes and both FLT SUV (r = 0.8 p < 0.0001) and FDG SUV (r = 0.84
