Lung perfusion scintigraphy by SPECT--new application of Bull's eye analysis. The present study reports the characteristic performance using lung segmental phantom filled in Tc-99m-pertechnetate. To evaluate the segmental defect in lung perfusion scintigraphy, we applied Bull's eye analysis in addition to planar image set. Bull's eye analysis especially facilitated the interpretation in both middle and lower lobes.
