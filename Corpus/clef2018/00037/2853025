The value of SPECT imaging in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma. Radionuclide flow studies, planar, and SPECT hepatic blood pool imaging were performed in 23 patients with 39 hepatic hemangiomas, 23 patients with primary and secondary liver tumors, 12 patients with hepatocellular disease, two patients with hepatic cysts, and 10 patients with no evidence of liver disease. The hepatic SPECT imaging identified all 39 hemangiomas as having a sequestration pattern compared with a yield of 69% (27 of 39 cases) for the planar imaging. None of the 47 other patients demonstrated this pattern. The SPECT approach is considered superior to planar blood pool imaging because of improved diagnostic yield, reduced patient imaging time, and greater ease of correlation with other cross-sectional imaging modalities.
