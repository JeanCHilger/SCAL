Providing antibacterial properties to a vascular prosthesis made of polyethylene terephthalate fibers. We made the synthesis of a new antibacterial product satisfying the requirements and being similar to polyethylene terephthalate fibres PET from which implants designed for people are made. Proper solvents were worked out and the parameters of processing were determined. The vascular prostheses subjected to the antibacterial processing proved very good and longlasting antibacterial properties.
