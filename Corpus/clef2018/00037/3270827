Cerebral blood flow and metabolism of oxygen and glucose in young autistic adults. Regional cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption and glucose consumption were measured by positron emission tomography in six young autistic men. No significant differences were found between patients and normal controls for any of the physiological variables. The results do not substantiate the previous finding of glucose hypermetabolism in autism the likely reasons for the variance in findings are discussed.
