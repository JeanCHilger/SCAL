Putrescine metabolism in human brain tumors. The metabolism of the polyamines, putrescine, spermidine and spermine, was studied in human brain and brain tumors. Samples of brain and tumors were incubated with 3H-putrescine and the amounts of labeled polyamines were measured. The amount of putrescine conversion was found to be greater in tumors that in normal brain samples. Furthermore, the metabolism of putrescine in brain tumors was related to tumor type and appeared to correlate with the degree of malignancy. The significance of these findings with regard to positron emission tomographic scanning and therapy of patients with malignant gliomas is discussed.
