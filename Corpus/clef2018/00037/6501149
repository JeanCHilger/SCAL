Simple, rapid method for determination of total extractable fat in canned pet foods. The rapid column method described, unlike AOAC method 7.056, determines both neutral ("crude") and total fat in canned pet foods, and uses nonflammable solvent mixtures and simple laboratory equipment. Neutral fat values are obtained by eluting the column with dichloromethane, whereas total fat values are determined by using dichloromethane-methanol (9 + 1). For 7 samples analyzed in triplicate, fat ranged from 2.9 to 10.8%. Neutral fat values by the dry column method were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than were those by 7.056 (6.29 vs 6.49), although these differences were practically unimportant. Total fat determinations by the dry column method and by 7.056 yielded overall means of 7.40 and 6.49%, respectively. The 0.91% mean difference is significant (P less than 0.01) and represents a more complete extraction of polar lipids by the proposed method.
