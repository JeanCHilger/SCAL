Myocardial uptake of an iodinated branched fatty acid analog, assessed by SPECT, may detect metabolic derangement of the myocardium in diabetic patients with coronary heart disease. The clinical implications of single-photon emission computed tomography using both a beta-methyl-branched fatty acid analog, 123I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-methyl-pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP), and thallium-201 (201Tl) were assessed in 30 patients with myocardial infarction (MI), 8 diabetics, 4 patients with impaired glucose tolerance, and 18 nondiabetic patients. Discordant decreases in BMIPP uptake, as compared with 201Tl uptake, in diabetic patients were significantly (p < 0.01) more frequent than in nondiabetic patients. The left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction in diabetics was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced and the LV diastolic dimension was significantly increased (p < 0.01), as compared with those in nondiabetic subjects. Analysis of peripheral blood showed no significant differences among the three test groups in metabolic abnormality. A discordant decrease in BMIPP uptake, as compared with Tl uptake, in cardiac tomography may indicate a metabolic derangement of the myocardium in diabetic patients with MI.
