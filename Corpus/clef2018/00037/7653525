Lipid signal transduction pathways in angiotensin II type 1 receptor-transfected fibroblasts. A stable Chinese hamster ovary fibroblast line expressing the rat vascular type 1a angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor was used to study the lipid-derived signal transduction pathways elicited by type 1a ANG II receptor activation. ANG II caused a biphasic and dose-dependent increase in diacylglycerol (DAG) accumulation with an initial peak at 15 s (181 +/- 11% of control, P < 0.02) and a second sustained peak at 5-10 min (214 +/- 10% of control, P < 0.02). The late DAG peak was derived from phosphatidylcholine (PC), and the formation was blocked by ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. ANG II also increased phosphatidic acid (PA) production nearly fourfold by 7.5 min. In the presence of ethanol, ANG II markedly increased phosphatidylethanol (PEt) formation, indicating activation of phospholipase D (PLD). ANG II was shown to increase the mass of three separate PA species, one of which apparently originated from DAG kinase action on PC-phospholipase C (PLC)-produced DAG, providing evidence for PC-PLC activity. ANG II also formed a third PA species, which originated neither from PLD nor from DAG kinase. These results demonstrate that multiple lipid signals propagated via collateral stimulation of PLC and PLD are generated by specific activation of the vascular type 1a ANG II receptor.
