Feasibility of planar fluorine-18-FDG imaging after recent myocardial infarction to assess myocardial viability. The aim of this study was to define the clinical feasibility of planar myocardial 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) imaging and to assess the relation between 201Tl, FDG and left ventricular function early after myocardial infarction.Fifty-one patients were studied 5 +/- 2 days after infarction. Scintigraphic images were visually and quantitatively analyzed using a circumferential profiles technique. FDG uptake was normalized to the area with maximal 201Tl uptake. Scintigraphic data were compared with left ventricular wall motion as assessed by ventriculography in 22 patients. Relative regional 201Tl uptake was categorized as normal (> or = 75% of peak activity), moderately reduced (50%-75%) or severely reduced (< 50%). These tracer defects were considered viable if FDG uptake exceeded 201Tl uptake by > or = 20% and/or if FDG uptake was normal (> or = 75%). All regions with FDG uptake 20% less than 201Tl uptake were considered nonviable.Four hundred forty-one myocardial regions were analyzed 200 showed normal 201Tl uptake, 241 had reduced uptake, 191 had moderately reduced 201Tl uptake and 50 regions had severely reduced uptake. Viability for moderately and severely reduced regions was observed in 62% and 48%, respectively. A concordance between flow and metabolism was observed in 38% and 52%, respectively.Myocardial FDG imaging is feasible with standard gamma camera systems and enables the identification of regions with preserved glucose metabolism in patients shortly after infarction.
