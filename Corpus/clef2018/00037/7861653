Simple method to estimate cardiac output using first-pass data on RI angiography. In order to estimate cardiac output (CO) without using data equilibrium state, a simple index (cardiac output index, COI) was developed from the first-pass data as a ratio of the integrated radioactivity on the right ventricle to the total injected radioactivity. COI was well correlated with CO calculated by the conventional Stewart-Hamilton method (r = 0.894, p < 0.01), and thus, CO could be readily estimated from COI. This index might be useful to estimate CO since it can be obtained even with the agents which distribute to organs.
