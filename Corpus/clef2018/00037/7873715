Value of 3-dimensional emission scintigraphy in evaluating the osseointegration properties of endoprostheses. The Three-dimensional display of functional images generated by single photon emission computed tomography gives a three-dimensional picture of the bone and the activity of a radionuclide after endoprosthetic joint replacement and allows a judgement of osteoblastic activity concerning bone ingrowth in macroporous surfaces of non-cemented implants. Osteolytic processes can be demonstrated in the same way.
