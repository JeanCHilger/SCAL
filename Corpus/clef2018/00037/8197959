Location of hand function in the sensorimotor cortex: MR and functional correlation. To determine the location of hand function in the sensorimotor cortex using MR and positron emission tomography imaging studies.Anatomic and physiological methods were used for this study. Anatomic study was based on the MR analysis of 22 subjects. The length of the sensorimotor cortex was measured in the axial and sagittal planes. Physiologic study was based on the positron emission tomography studies of 4 subjects. Each of the studies was correlated with MR.We found that the superior genu of the central sulcus corresponds to hand function in the sensorimotor cortex. This level may prove useful for any clinical correlations or for surgery.From this study, the hand function area in the sensorimotor cortex is easily understood with its characteristic shape in axial MR scan. The comparison of MR and positron emission tomography data clearly show anatomic correlations. This may be applied to the functional mapping of the pathologic studies in the sensorimotor cortex regions.
