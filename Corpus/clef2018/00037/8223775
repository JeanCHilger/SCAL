Myocardial viability: what do we need? Coronary revascularization in patients with chronic coronary heart disease (CHD) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is mainly based on factors such as coronary anatomy, ventricular function, accompanying diseases and the patient's biological age. Rest- or exercise-induced ischaemia should be proven before a bypass operation or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Although a significant amount of ischaemic but still viable myocardium is a necessary condition for successful revascularization, the detection of viable myocardium is of major importance in a rather small subset of patients. These are patients with hibernating (or a combination of hibernating and stunned) myocardium in whom the aforementioned parameters do not yield an unequivocal result. Thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy with re-injection or rest-redistribution is an established, proven and cost-effective way of detecting viable myocardium. Other methods such as positron emission tomography with different tracers or technetium-99m sestamibi SPET are discussed and compared to thallium-201 SPET. In conclusion, the detection of ischaemic but still viable myocardium is of importance in only a rather small subset of patients with CHD. In this context thallium-201 myocardial SPET is and still remains the method of choice.
