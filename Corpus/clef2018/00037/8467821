Dopamine receptor SPET imaging in Parkinson's disease: a [123I]-IBZM and [99mTc]-HM-PAO study. Single photon emission tomography (SPET) with the novel ligand [123I]-IBZM was used to image central dopamine D2 receptors in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The aim was to assess basal ganglia (BG) receptor densities in relation to the response to L-dopa therapy. To better characterize the clinical potential of [123I]-IBZM SPET, each patient underwent a second study with the regional perfusion tracer [99mTc]-HM-PAO. Tracer activity ratios were calculated for caudate and putamen with mean activity over the cerebellar hemispheres as internal standard. In PD patients we found a significant decline of mean caudate [123I]-IBZM activity, as compared with age-matched control subjects. However, when patients were grouped according to their therapeutic behavior, the [123I]-IBZM uptake in BG ganglia regions of the PD patient group with a poor and fluctuating response to L-dopa was significantly reduced from mean values of patients with a sustained response to L-dopa therapy. [99mTc]-HM-PAO caudate and putamen uptake indexes in PD were similar to control values, even in patients with deteriorated therapeutic response. Our results indicate that BG D2 receptor alterations in PD may contribute to the altered response to L-dopa.
