SPECT and planar brain imaging in crack abuse: iodine-123-iodoamphetamine uptake and localization. The uptake, distribution, and clearance properties of 123I-IMP in the brain were evaluated in controls and asymptomatic crack users to investigate cerebral blood flow alterations in crack abuse. Serial dynamic planar images of the brain (0-25 min), SPECT of the brain (0.5 hr and 4 hr) and whole-body scans (75 min) were obtained in 21 crack abusers and 21 control subjects. Major observations include: (a) foci of abnormally reduced 123I-IMP activity mainly in the frontal and parieto-occipital cortex or marked irregularities in the uptake of 123I-IMP throughout the cerebral cortex consistent with moderate to severe disruption in regional cerebral blood flow were observed on the 0.5 hr SPECT images of 16/21 asymptomatic crack users (b) no correlation could be demonstrated between the incidence or severity of SPECT perfusion abnormality with the frequency, amount or length of time of crack use
