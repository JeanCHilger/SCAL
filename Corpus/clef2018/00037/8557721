Endothelial cells on Dacron vascular prostheses: adherence, growth, and susceptibility to neutrophils. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) on knitted and woven Dacron prostheses were compared with HUVEC on smooth surfaces (tissue culture polystyrene, PET film, and Natrix) with regard to adherence, growth, and susceptibility to injury by neutrophils (PMN). These are properties of importance for successful seeding or coating of prostheses. For prosthetic material of given macroscopic dimensions, more endothelial cells (EC) adhered than to smooth surfaces. However, the prostheses had a greater effective surface area as determined by the number of EC at confluency. When this parameter was taken into account, fewer EC were found adherent to prosthetic material per unit effective surface area than for the smooth surface substrates. Growth on prostheses was clearly inferior to that on smooth surfaces, and EC on prostheses were more susceptible to attack by activated PMN than on smooth surfaces. These differences may reflect the topographic differences in cells attached to fibers where they assume more distorted shapes by stretching to span fibers.
