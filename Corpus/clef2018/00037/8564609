Stability of ramipril in water, apple juice, and applesauce. The stability of ramipril in water, in apple juice, and in applesauce was studied. The contents of a single capsule each of ramipril 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg were mixed in glass beakers with 120 mL of deionized and filtered water, apple juice, or applesauce. Each mixture was apportioned into 10 120-mL amber polyethylene terephthalate (PET) containers. Five of the containers in each set were stored at 23 degrees C, and samples were taken at 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours. The other five containers were stored at 3 degrees C, and samples were taken at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours. The samples were analyzed for ramipril concentration by stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The quantity of drug remaining in the PET container after "administration" was determined by mixing the contents of single 5-mg ramipril capsules with 60 mL of apple juice, pouring the mixture into a waste receptacle, rinsing the PET container three separate times with 10 mL of water, and analyzing the pooled fluid from these rinses for ramipril concentration by HPLC. Under no condition did the percentage of ramipril remaining drop below 90%. No peaks for degradation products appeared in the chromatograms. The mean +/- S.D. quantity of ramipril remaining in the PET containers after draining was 0.3 +/- 0.3% for the apple juice. Ramipril from 1.25-, 2.5-, and 5-mg capsules mixed in water, in apple juice, and in applesauce was stable for 24 hours at 23 degrees C and for 48 hours at 3 degrees C.
