Regional myocardial perfusion assessed with generator-produced copper-62-PTSM and PET. We have previously demonstrated that myocardial perfusion can be estimated accurately in experimental animals with the generator-produced positron-emitting tracer, 62Cu-pyruvaldehyde bis (N4-methylthio- semicarbazone)(62Cu-PTSM) and PET. This study evaluated the feasibility of quantifying regional myocardial blood flow using 62Cu-PTSM and PET in human subjects.Regional perfusion was estimated using a previously described and validated two-compartment model from dynamic PET scans obtained after an intravenous bolus of 62Cu-PTSM in 10 healthy volunteers and in 6 patients with coronary artery disease at rest: and in 9 of the volunteers and 4 of the patients after administration of dipyridamole intravenously. Flow estimates were compared with those obtained using H2(15)O.Contrast was high between myocardium and blood or lung with 62Cu-PTSM, resulting in high-quality myocardial images. Liver uptake was also high. At flows of up to 1.5 ml/g/min, flow estimated with 62Cu-PTSM correlated closely with estimates obtained with H2(15)O (y = 0.71x .21, n = 169 regional comparisons, r = 0.66, p < 0.55), but this relationship was not maintained at higher flows.The results demonstrate that quantification of myocardial perfusion with 62Cu-PTSM is feasible in human subjects but cannot be used to estimate hyperemic flows due most likely to the strong binding of the tracer to human serum albumin. Copper-62-PTSM congeners with less avidity for human albumin may prove more suitable for evaluation of hyperemic flows.
