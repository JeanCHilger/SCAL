Quantitative analysis of the tomographic technetium-99m MIBI (99mTc-MIBI) myocardial bullseye display: application to diagnosis of coronary artery disease. In this study, the 99mTc-MIBI myocardial bullseye display of 31 healthy persons and 34 patients with myocardial ischemia and 17 patients with myocardial infarction were analyzed quantitatively and compared with the results of myocardial tomography analysis and qualitative bullseye analysis. The sensitivities of the three methods were 88.2%, 91.2% and 94.1% respectively (P > 0.05), and the specificities were 93.5%, 83.9% and 83.9% respectively (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the quantitative analysis obviously outperformed the other two methods in the detection of ischemic segments of myocardium near infarction zone (P < 0.01). The quantitative analysis of 99mTc-MIBI myocardial bullseye (quantitative bullseye) was an objective, specific and sensitive method for diagnosis of coronary artery disease.
