Transcranial Doppler assessment of cerebral blood flow velocity during visual spatial selective attention in humans. Blood flow velocities of the posterior cerebral arteries were obtained while healthy subjects were engaged in a visual spatial attention task. Experimental runs consisted of series of stimuli comprised of four elements (two left and two right of a central fixation point) presented briefly in blue against a purple screen. After a period of passive viewing a left or right pointing arrow indicated the visual half-field to be attended by the subjects in order to detect identical symbols on the attended side. Relative to the passive viewing condition a marked increase of flow was seen in both posterior cerebral arteries during the attention period. No differential increase of flow as a function of attended field was detected. These results are discussed in comparison with recent positron-emission tomography (PET) and electrophysiological data obtained with the same task.
