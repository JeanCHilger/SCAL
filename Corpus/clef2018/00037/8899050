Basal ganglia and thalamo-cortical hypermetabolism in patients with spasmodic torticollis. The basal ganglia are thought to be involved in the primary dystonias, largely because of the repeated demonstration of neuropathological changes in these nuclei in the secondary dystonias. A hyperactivity of a network involving basal ganglia has been suggested in experimental animal dystonia. To test this hypothesis in humans, we studied the functional correlates of primary cervical dystonia using [18F]FDG and PET.Regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMRglc) was measured in 10 patients with idiopathic torticollis (6 drug-free and 4 drug-naive) and in 15 normal controls, using 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET).A significant hypermetabolism in the basal ganglia, thalamus, premotor-motor cortex and cerebellum in the patients compared with normal controls was found. The patients were correctly assigned to their clinical category by a discriminant function analysis with a total accuracy of 96%.The results support the hypothesis that a dysfunction of a subcortical-cortical motor network may play a role in the pathogenesis of focal dystonia, in agreement with the experimental dystonia models.
