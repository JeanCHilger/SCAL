Positron emission tomographic imaging of head and neck lesions. Positron emission tomography (PET) produces images that reflect the rate and distribution of biochemical and physiological processes in tissue in vivo. This has been observed with many types of neoplasm not evident when using such anatomical imaging techniques as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. We evaluated the feasibility of 2-18F-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET studies in diagnosing and assessing the effects of treatment on lesions of the tongue, maxillary sinus and nasopharynx. FDG-PET imaging was performed 45 times in 17 patients with tumors before treatment. Ten patients with malignant lesions also underwent imaging after treatment. The differential absorption ratio (DAR) of the isotope was calculated at 55 min and the time activity curve (TAC) was obtained by dynamic emission scans for 0-55 min following injection of FDG. FDG-PET images, DAR and TAC were evaluated in all lesions. Findings showed that FDG-PET images could be used to diagnose malignant tumors and evaluate treatment when the DAR was > 4.0 and TAC was steep upward. Images suggestive of benign lesions had low DAR values (< 4.0) and mildly upward or flat TACs.
