Integration of functional and anatomical brain images. This article concerns the integration of functional and anatomical volumetric brain images. Integration consists of two steps: matching or registration, where the images are brought into spatial agreement, and fusion or simultaneous display where the registered multimodal image information is presented in an integrated fashion. Approaches to register multiple images are divided into extrinsic methods based on artificial markers, and intrinsic matching methods based solely on the patient related image data. The various methods are compared by a number of characteristics, which leads to a clear preference for one class of intrinsic methods, viz. voxel-based matching. Furthermore, two- and three-dimensional techniques to display multimodality image information are outlined.
