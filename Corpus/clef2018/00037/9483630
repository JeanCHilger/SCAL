Use of forward projection to correct patient motion during SPECT imaging. We have developed an iterative method to correct axial and tangential patient motion occurring during tomographic acquisition. The method uses axial images reconstructed from the uncorrected projection images, which are then forward projected to form a basis for registering the original planar images and, in the process, directly seeks to establish a consistent data set. Our method can be applied to all SPECT scans including myocardial and brain SPECT. We demonstrate that the method is capable of detecting and quantitatively correcting for complex motion in both axial and tangential directions. Results from phantom experiments show excellent resolution and contrast recovery after simulated movement in both the axial and tangential directions and initial results with clinical data sets are encouraging.
