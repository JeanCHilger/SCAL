Evaluation of different procedures for processing avian air sac lavage fluid. Air sac lavage has become a routine diagnostic tool used in pet birds however, cytologic techniques for collection and handling of avian cells have not been reported. In this study, directed endoscopy was used to obtain the air sac washes. Different factors were compared that might affect final preservation of cell morphology, such as centrifugation speed, anticoagulant, storage temperature, time to processing, addition of glutaraldehyde to the sample, and addition of protein. The goal was to find the processing technique best suited for the evaluation of cells from air sac washes. The use of an anticoagulant did not influence cell quality. Optimal cell morphology was achieved when the sample was centrifuged at a speed of 1000 rpm (89.4 X g) and when prepared in less than an hour from the time of collection. Low temperature (5 C) tended to preserve cell quality better. The addition of protein (fetal bovine serum) helped to preserve cell quality and was of value if the sample storage time was greater than 30 min. The addition of glutaraldehyde resulted in a significant reduction in cell quality.
