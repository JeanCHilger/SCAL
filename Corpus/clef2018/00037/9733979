A novel MPTP primate model of Parkinson's disease: neurochemical and clinical changes. Positron emission tomography (PET) and the dopamine (DA) metabolism tracer, [18F]6-fluoro-L-m-tyrosine (FMT) were used to evaluate the relationship between DA metabolism and the clinical stage of parkinsonism monkeys following either unilateral ICA MPTP infusion or unilateral ICA MPTP infusion and subsequent varying sequential systemic doses of MPTP. Clinical stage corresponded to PET measures of striatal DA metabolism, showing the usefulness of the overlesioned hemiparkinsonian monkey as a stable model of various stages of Parkinson's disease (PD).
