Synthesis of 2-iodo- and 2-phenyl-[11C]melatonin: potential PET tracers for melatonin binding sites. Two 11C-labelled melatonin derivatives, 2-iodo-[11C]melatonin (2-iodo-5-methoxy-N[11C-acetyl]-tryptamine, an agonist) and 2-phenyl-[11C]melatonin (2-phenyl-5-methoxy-N[11C-acetyl]tryptamine, a putative antagonist) were synthesized from [11C]carbon dioxide. The reaction sequence was common to both compounds and consisted of three steps: (i) carbonylation of methyl magnesium bromide with [11C]carbon dioxide, (ii) conversion of the adduct to [11C]acetyl chloride, (iii) acetylation of the amine precursors (2-iodo-5-methoxy-tryptamine or 2-phenyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine) with [11C]acetyl chloride. The precursors were especially prepared. The radiochemical yield was 19% for 2-iodomelatonin and 32% for 2-phenymelatonin, based on [11C]carbon dioxide the specific activity ranged from 300 to 600 mCi/mumol. Both labelled 2-substituted-melatonins are intended to be used as radiotracers to study melatonin binding sites in man with positron emission tomography.
