Humoral immunity status in neonates born to pre-eclamptic toxaemia mothers. A prospective study on 90 neonates born to age matched normal mothers (set I) and mothers (set II) with pre-eclamptic toxaemia (PET) was undertaken to assess and compare the humoral immunity status of the neonates. All of them had normal vaginal delivery. IgG, IgA and IgM were estimated by radial immunodiffusion technique from cord blood of neonates. It was observed that IgA and IgM levels were insignificant in the cord blood. IgG level was low in normal birth weight (NBW) neonates born to PET mothers, when compared to that of NBW neonates born to normal mothers. Again low birth weight (LBW) babies of both the sets showed lower values of IgG than that of NBW babies. Apgar scoring showed direct relationship with IgG levels e.g., higher the Apgar score higher the level of IgG. Thus the IgG level was directly related to the birth weight of the neonates of the respective sets as well as with the Apgar scoring of the neonates.A prospective study conducted at the Medical College in Calcutta, India, assessed the immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels of infants born to mothers with pre-eclamptic toxemia (PET).  90 low-income mothers 17-32 years of age admitted to the facility in 1992-93 were enrolled 46 had normal pregnancies and 44 had PET.  Women with PET were admitted at 28-30 weeks of gestation to ensure adequate rest and nutrition before delivery.  67.4% of infants of women with a normal pregnancy and 54.4% of those in the PET group were low birth weight.  Apgar scores were good to excellent in both groups.  In both study groups, IgG levels were higher in infants of normal birth weight and higher Apgar scores than in those with low birth weight and lower Apgar scores.  The lower level of IgG in low-birth-weight infants is probably attributable to blockage of the IgG-specific Fc receptor site in the placenta due to acute atherosis and reduced uteroplacental perfusion.
