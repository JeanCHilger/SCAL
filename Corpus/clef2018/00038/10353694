Binding of GM-CSF to adherent neutrophils activates phospholipase D. When the hematopoietic growth factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was incubated with neutrophils adherent to plastic tissue culture plates or plates coated with extracellular matrix proteins, a rapid (3 min) but transient formation of phosphatidic acid was observed. This stimulation was dependent on the dose of GM-CSF, with an EC50 of 140 pM, and was further enhanced (up to 350%) with the PA phosphatase inhibitor propranolol in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, GM-CSF was unable to trigger any PA formation in neutrophils maintained in suspension, even in the presence of soluble fibronectin. However, GM-CSF did prime the cells for enhanced PA formation in the presence of a secondary stimulus (fMet-Leu-Phe or PAF). GM-CSF also caused a time-dependent stimulation of diacylglycerol formation in adherent, but not suspended, cells and elicited a time-dependent stimulation of phosphatidylethanol formation, with a concomitant decrease in the formation of PA only at early (< 7 min) times. These observations were consistent with a rapid activation of the enzyme phospholipase D in adherent cells stimulated with GM-CSF. Additional data indicated that the source of DAG was PLD coexisting with PLC, especially at later times ( > 7 min) of stimulation with GM-CSF. Finally, the formation of PA and PEt, and to a minor extent, DAG, were inhibited by the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor erbstatin in conditions in which tyrosine phosphorylation occurred. Taken together the data indicate that GM-CSF rapidly activates PLD in adherent cells, which is responsible for the generation of PA. Thus, PLD activation is an early event in neutrophil signal transduction following exposure of adherent cells to GM-CSF.
