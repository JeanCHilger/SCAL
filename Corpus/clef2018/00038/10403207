Localized pain associated with seizures originating in the parietal lobe. Ictal pain is a rare symptom of seizures. Epileptic pain may be experienced unilaterally (lateral/ peripheral), cephalically, or in the abdomen. Painful seizures have been associated with seizure origin in both the parietal and the temporal lobes. We report on the different types of epileptic pain and discuss its etiology and possible localizing value.We reviewed the records of patients referred to our epilepsy program over the last 6 years. Eight (1.4%) of 573 patients had pain as an early prominent symptom of their seizures.Pain was predominantly unilateral in three patients, cephalic in two, and abdominal in three patients. Seizure onset was in or involving the parietal lobe in all patients, and when the painful symptoms were lateralized, they were contralateral to the side of seizure origin. Parietal lobe seizure origin was determined by both intracranial EEG recording and neuroimaging [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)] in five patients, and by both scalp EEG and neuroimaging in three patients.We conclude that ictal pain is a rare symptom of parietal lobe seizure origin with lateralizing potential.
