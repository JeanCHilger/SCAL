Horner's syndrome revisited: with an update of the central pathway. A brief summary is presented of the life of Johann Friedrich Horner, the eminent Swiss ophthalmologist, renowned for describing the effects of paralysis of the human cervical sympathetic nerves. His early education, the quality of his professional training, and the influence of his mentors, notably Carl Ludwig and Albrecht von Graefe, contributed to his discovery of the syndrome. The full text of Horner's original work (translated by J. F. Fulton, 1929a, Arch. Surg. 18:2025-2039) is cited. The history of clinical and experimental work carried out on the autonomic nervous system prior to Horner's discovery is reviewed, including the studies of Pourfour du Petit (cited in Fulton, 1929a and Singer and Underwood, 1962, Clarendon) Hare, 1838, Lond. Med. Gaz. 23:16-18
