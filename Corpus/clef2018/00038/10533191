Fluorodeoxyglucose PET in the evaluation of amputations for soft tissue sarcoma. The aims of this study were to evaluate the uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the stumps of patients who have had amputations for soft tissue sarcoma and assess its utility in identifying local recurrence of disease. Sixteen patients who had either an upper or a lower limb amputation were evaluated. FDG PET scans (half body scans to the stump +/- local emission transmission views of the stump) were performed as part of their routine follow-up for evidence of metastases over a number of years (mean = 2.6 years range 0.25-8 years). Diffuse uptake was found in 10 stumps for up to 18 months post-surgery without any evidence of disease recurrence. Focal areas of uptake were associated with known pressure areas with skin breakdown that could be seen clinically. In the absence of localized clinical changes, these areas represented a recurrence and needed a biopsy.
