Glucose and methionine uptake and proliferative activity in meningiomas. Despite similar benign histological appearances, proliferative activity of meningiomas varies tumor to tumor, and even region to region in a tumor. To predict proliferative potential before surgery, we compared regional uptake of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) and L-[methyl-11C]methionine ([11C]MET) with histological indices of tumor proliferative activity in 17 specimens from six patients with meningioma obtained by PET guided stereotactic biopsies. Uptake of [11C]MET, an index of protein synthesis rate, significantly correlated not only with the count of nucleolar organizer regions (NORs), a histological index of protein synthesis, but also with Ki-67 index, a histological index of proliferative activity. On the other hand, [18F]FDG uptake showed no significant correlation with Ki-67 index or clinical malignancy. These results suggest that [11C]MET-PET is a useful tool for predicting tumor proliferative potential in meningiomas.
