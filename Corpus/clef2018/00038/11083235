Reproducibility and effect of levodopa on dopamine transporter function measurements: a [18F]CFT PET study. The objective of this article was to study the reproducibility and effect of levodopa on dopamine transporter function measurements using 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-[18F]fluorophenyl)tropane ([18F]CFT) positron emission tomography (PET). Seven de novo patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were studied twice, before and after three months of levodopa medication. Eight healthy volunteer subjects participated in the reproducibility study. The [18F]CFT PET scan was done twice with an interval of approximately 2.5 months. The regions of interest (anterior and posterior putamen, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum) were drawn on individual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, matched with the PET images, and copied onto the PET images. The [18F]CFT uptake was calculated as the region-cerebellum:cerebellum ratio at 180 to 210 minutes. Three-month levodopa treatment in PD patients had no significant effect on [18F]CFT uptake in any striatal subregion between the two PET scans. In PD patients, the percent change from baseline was 4.1% in the anterior putamen, 1.9% in the posterior putamen, and 4.0% in the caudate nucleus. No significant differences in [18F]CFT uptake between the first and second PET scan in any striatal subregion occurred in healthy controls. The intraclass correlation, indicating the reproducibility of the PET scan within subjects, was 0.94 for the anterior putamen, 0.86 for the posterior putamen, and 0.91 for the caudate nucleus. The percent change from baseline was 4.0% in the anterior putamen, 1.1% in the posterior putamen, and 2.8% in the caudate nucleus. Long-term levodopa treatment in PD patients had no effect on the [18F]CFT uptake in the striatum and the test-retest reproducibility was very high. These findings confirm [18F]CFT as a suitable ligand to monitor progression of PD.
