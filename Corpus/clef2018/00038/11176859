Advances in biomedical imaging. In the 21st century, diseases will be diagnosed and treated using increasingly less invasive, more sophisticated imaging and image-guided procedures. During the past 100 years, the field of biomedical imaging has developed from Roentgen's original discovery of the x-ray to the imaging tools of today, such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and ultrasonography. The benefits of using these sophisticated noninvasive imaging tools are already evident: more accurate and timely diagnosis of disease has translated into improved patient care. Recent advances in imaging research have shown the potential to change many aspects of clinical medicine within the next decade. Major new areas of research focus on development of the molecular, functional, cellular, and genetic imaging tools of the future, aided by new information technology and image fusion/integration capabilities. Image-guided therapy is growing rapidly, with advances in computer science, technology, and noninvasive treatment methods, such as focused ultrasonography. Undoubtedly, these and other new imaging techniques will enhance the ability to accurately diagnose and recognize disease and allow understanding of the molecular mechanisms of diseases and their respective responses to therapy. Given this explosion in new technologies, the next 25 years promise to result in dramatic changes in diagnostic imaging, particularly with respect to detection and recognition of disease.
