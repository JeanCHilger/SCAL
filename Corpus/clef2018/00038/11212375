A Jini service to reconstruct tomographic data. Distributed computing that uses dynamic networks will change the way we work and communicate thanks to the interaction of devices and services, that are automatically added and removed from the network as needed. The Jini technology, which is built atop the Java programming language, provides a homogenous view of the network and extends the ability of code to migrate in Java. This software design model simplifies the configuration and access to hardware devices and software services in a network. Thus, it becomes possible to execute new services without pre-installing software on client machines. This new programming paradigm is especially important in medical applications, where the reliable transmission of information is essential. This paper demonstrates how single photon emission computerized tomography data can be iteratively reconstructed using a Jini service.
