Gated single-photon emission computed tomographic myocardial imaging: a new tool in clinical cardiology. Gated single-photon emission computed tomography (gated SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging allows the analysis of left ventricular (LV) perfusion and function during the same acquisition.Gated SPECT provides additional information to myocardial perfusion, which improves test specificity in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease and hence diminishes the amount of borderline diagnosis. Because gated SPECT provides reliable information on LV ejection fraction and LV volumes, it is also a valuable tool in risk stratification. In addition, from gated SPECT, images can be reconstructed from which wall motion can be assessed showing a good correlation with wall motion assessed by accepted imaging modalities as echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and contrast angiography. In the future wall motion analysis from gated SPECT may also be used for revascularization stratification.Gated SPECT gives important additional information beyond myocardial perfusion imaging alone, which could have major clinical implications for optimal patient management.
