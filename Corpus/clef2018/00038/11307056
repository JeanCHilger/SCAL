New advances in brain tumor imaging. During the period of this review, there has been continued use and development of neuroimaging techniques in brain tumor diagnosis and management. Although no monumental developments or improvements in neuroimaging techniques or technology have occurred, important studies continue to be published showing the clinical impact and utility of various neuroimaging techniques to improve the care of patients with brain tumors. Several studies have shown the power of functional neuroimaging techniques with both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron-emission tomography (PET) to map eloquent cortex and assist in the planning of surgical and radiation therapy. New nuclear imaging radiopharmaceuticals, including various PET ligands and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) agents, have also been developed and show their potential power in the evaluation of brain tumor patients. New MRI pulse sequences to improve image quality and shorten imaging time have also been developed. Several excellent reviews of the use of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET and MRI techniques were also published. This article reviews the relevant and important neuroimaging literature related to brain tumor that was published during the defined time period of November 1, 1999 to October 31, 2000. Discussion is organized by modality, including nuclear imaging techniques (SPECT and PET) and MRI (pulse sequence development, contrast agent development, functional MRI developments, and general MRI-related information).
