Prognostic predictive value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for patients with pancreatic cancer. 18Fluorine-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) is a unique imaging diagnostic tool to evaluate glucose metabolism and hexokinase activity which may reflect the aggressiveness of a tumor. Thirty-seven patients with primary pancreatic cancer were evaluated with 18F-FDG-PET. Thirteen patients underwent resection for the pancreatic cancer and 24 patients had unresectable tumors. The standardized uptake values (SUV) of 18F-FDG in the primary tumors were calculated. No correlations were found between the SUV in the tumors and the metastatic status to the peritoneal/liver, TNM factors/stage, or resectability. The patients were divided into 2 groups with high and low SUV, with the cut-off value being 3.0 (median SUV value of 37 cases). No differences in the probability of survival were observed between the 2 groups in the patients with resectable tumors. However, in the patients with unresectable tumors, those in the high SUV group had a significantly shorter prognosis than those in the low SUV group. Moreover, a multivariate analysis of survival indicated that SUV is an independent prognostic factor for patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.
