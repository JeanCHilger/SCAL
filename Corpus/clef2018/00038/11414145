Molecular radiology. II: Molecular imaging. The most important strategies for molecular imaging are presented. Processes can now be imaged in vitro and in vivo at the molecular level with the help of modern procedures such as SPECT, PET, MRI, and highly developed optical methods. The ability to view the expression of genes, the pharmacokinetics of gene therapy vectors, of therapeutic DNA, and of classical pharmacons in vivo opens up completely new perspectives for the research on, diagnosis of, and therapy for diseases. The current status of these developments are described, potential fields of use and possibilities for further development are outlined.
