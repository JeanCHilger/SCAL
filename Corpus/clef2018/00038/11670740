Mixed Chloride/Phosphine Complexes of the Dirhenium Core. 3. Novel Structures with Diethylphosphido-bridges and Terminal Diethylphosphines. The interaction between octachlorodirhenium anions and diethylphosphine has been shown to strongly depend on reaction conditions, mainly the nature of the solvent and the amount of phosphine. As a result, novel dirhenium products with oxidation states ranging from Re(II) to Re(IV) have been obtained. The reaction of [Re(2)Cl(8)](2)(-) with an excess of PEt(2)H in dichloromethane or acetonitrile led to the first example of a face-sharing complex of rhenium(IV) with three phosphido-bridges, namely [Bu(n)(4)N][Re(2)(&mgr-PEt(2))(3)Cl(6)] (1). The unusual edge-sharing Re(2)(&mgr
