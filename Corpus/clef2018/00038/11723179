Evaluation of neurotoxicity of TIQ and MPTP and of parkinsonism-preventing effect of 1-MeTIQ by in vivo measurement of pre-synaptic dopamine transporters and post-synaptic dopamine D(2) receptors in the mouse striatum. Parkinsonism-inducing neurotoxicity of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ), as contrasted to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), and parkinsonism-preventing effect of 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (1-MeTIQ) have been investigated in mice by measuring their effects on the in vivo binding of radioligand to pre-synaptic dopamine transporters (DATs) or to dopamine D(2) receptors (D2R) in the striatum. A significant reduction of the ligand-DATs binding was found in the mice treated with MPTP, but not with TIQ, under the dosage inducing behavioral abnormality and loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in the substantia nigra. A slight decrease in the ligand-DATs binding was observed in the mice given a larger dose of TIQ. Compensatory up-regulation in the post-synaptic D2Rs was found in the MPTP-treated mice. Pre-treatment with (S)-enantiomer, but not (R)-enantiomer, of 1-MeTIQ prevented the degeneration of DATs to some extent. We concluded that the TIQ-induced parkinsonism model is different from the MPTP-induced model as evaluated by the radioligand-DATs binding and that (S)-1-MeTIQ has a preventing effect for the degeneration of the DATs to a certain extent.
