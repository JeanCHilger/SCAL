Prefrontal blood flow dysregulation in drug naive ADHD children without structural abnormalities. Recent studies suggest a role for prefrontal cortex abnormalities in the pathogenesis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We evaluated young drug-naive ADHD outpatients without MRI structural abnormalities to detect prefrontal cortex regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) functional dysregulation correlation between age and rCBF
