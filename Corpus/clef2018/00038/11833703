Off-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in patients on chronic hemodialysis. Off-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(CABG) has gained much support but has been scarcely reported in patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD). The details of CABG for such patients on chronic HD are presented.Between January 1998 and December 1999, off-pump CABG was performed in 5 patients on chronic HD. All patients presented with unstable angina pectoris. The indication for off-pump CABG was suitable coronary anatomy (N = 5) and expected high risks associated with cardiopulmonary bypass due to reoperation (N = 1) and impaired cerebral blood flow (N = 2). The approach was median sternotomy (N = 4) and left anterior short thoracotomy (N = 1). The mean graft number was 2.0 +/- 1.0 (range, 1-3). In situ arterial grafts were mainly used: the in situ left internal thoracic artery was used in four patients, the in situ right gastroepiploic artery in two, the in situ right internal thoracic artery in two, and the saphenous vein in two patients.There were no deaths or complications. Nine of 10 grafts were confirmed fully patent by postoperative angiography before hospital discharge. In a mean follow-up of 17.2 months, no patients had developed recurrence of angina or any cardiac symptom.Off-pump CABG using in situ arterial grafts can be performed on patients on chronic hemodialysis subject to suitable anatomy of the target coronary arteries.
