Comparison of electrocardiographic-gated technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging and rest-redistribution thallium-201 in the prediction of myocardial viability. Although the combined assessment of perfusion and function using rest electrocardiographic (ECG)-gated technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging has been shown to improve sensitivity and accuracy over perfusion alone in the prediction of myocardial viability, no data are available comparing this technique with rest-redistribution thallium-201. Thirty patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < or = 40%) underwent rest-redistribution thallium-201 and rest ECG-gated Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT imaging before revascularization and rest ECG-gated Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT imaging at 1 or 6 weeks after revascularization. All thallium-201 and Tc-99m sestamibi images were interpreted by a consensus agreement of 3 experienced readers without knowledge of patient identity or time of imaging with Tc-99m sestamibi (before or after revascularization) using a 17-segment model. Concordance between techniques for the prediction of viability was 89% (kappa 0.556 +/- 0.109). With rest-redistribution thallium-201, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and predictive accuracy were 95%, 59%, 88%, 78%, and 86%, respectively. With rest ECG-gated Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT imaging, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and predictive accuracy were 96%, 55%, 87%, 80%, and 86%, respectively (p = NS vs rest-redistribution thallium-201). Although both techniques are comparable for detecting viable myocardium, rest ECG-gated Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT imaging allows direct assessment of both myocardial perfusion and ventricular function, which may be clinically useful in patients who require assessment of myocardial viability.
