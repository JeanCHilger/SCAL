Hydroxyethyl starch for hypervolemic hemodilution in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II safety study. Hypervolemic hemodilution (HH) with hydroxyethyl starch (HES) significantly increases cerebral blood flow and thus may reduce ischemic tissue damage in the penumbra zones when given within the therapeutic time window. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety of a 10% solution of HES 130/0.4 versus 0.9% saline solution in acute ischemic stroke by the incidence of adverse events (AEs).In a controlled, double-blind, randomized, multicenter, phase II, parallel-group study, 106 patients with acute ischemic stroke received high-dose HH with HES 130/0.4 or placebo within 6 h of symptom onset with a randomization ratio of 2:1 in favor of HES therapy.There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to the incidence of the specific AEs (cardiovascular events, bleeding complications, allergic reactions) assessed over days 1-30, or mortality over days 1-8. In addition, global tests of efficacy showed a trend towards a better functional outcome with HES therapy however, the study was not designed to prove efficacy.High-dose HH with HES or NaCl was generally safe and well tolerated. Safety profiles were similar for the two treatment groups, and there was a nonsignificant trend towards a better functional outcome with HES therapy.
