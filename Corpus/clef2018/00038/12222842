Use of 201Tl SPECT imaging to assess the response to therapy in patients with high grade gliomas. To assess the potential role of 201Tl single photon emission tomography (201-Thallium SPECT) when compared to other imaging modalities in the evaluation of the response to therapy in high grade gliomas.Twenty patients with histologically proved high grade glioma have been included: 15 with glioblastoma (GBM), 3 with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and 2 with anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (AOA). Patients were assessed by 201Tl SPECT, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at (a) either at the moment of maximum response to first line chemotherapy, or after the completion of radiotherapy and chemotherapy if post-surgical residual disease was present, and (b) after the completion of second line chemotherapy if disease persisted, or either a relapse or disease progression was confirmed. Final response was evaluated according to the McDonald criteria, and by comparing SPECT, CT and MRI results.According to the McDonald criteria, clinical response after first line chemotherapy was 5 partial response, 7 stable disease and 8 progressive disease. Evaluation by 201Tl SPECT was in agreement with such criteria in nearly all patients (90%). MRI findings closely agreed with the clinical follow-up. CT findings clearly differed from those observed by SPECT and MRI. After second line therapy, 10 patients progressed, 3 had stable disease and 7 had partial response. 201Tl SPECT agreed with the clinical status in 89% cases, whereas MRI and, specially CT, fared significantly lower.Compared to conventional neuroimaging, 201Tl SPECT added valuable information in the assessment of the response to therapy in our patient population whenever findings were not conclusive and in the case of disagreement between CT and MRI findings.
