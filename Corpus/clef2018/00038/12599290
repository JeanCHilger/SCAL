Detection of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinomas with thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with indeterminate magnetic resonance imaging findings after radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of thallium-201 (Tl-201) single-photon emission CT (SPECT) to detect recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) when MRI findings are indeterminate.After radiotherapy, 26 NPC patients with indeterminate MRI findings were included in this study. MRI, Tl-201, and biopsy were performed at least 4 months after radiotherapy and within 1 week. The final results were based on histopathologic findings and clinical follow-up after at least 6 months.For detecting recurrent NPC in indeterminate MRI findings, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of Tl-201 SPECT were 92.3%, 92.3%, and 92.3%, respectively.On the basis of this result, Tl-201 SPECT seems to be effective in detecting recurrent NPC when MRI findings are indeterminate.
