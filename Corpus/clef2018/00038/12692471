Semi-quantitative CBF and CBF ratios obtained using perfusion-weighted MR imaging. To clarify the utility of semi-quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements using perfusion-weighted MR imaging (PWI), a comparison of this method with quantitative CBF obtained using PET was conducted in 10 patients with chronic occlusive cerebrovascular disease and unilateral occlusion of the cerebral artery. Semi-quantitative CBF obtained using PWI and quantitative CBF obtained using PET showed no statistically significant correlation. The CBF ratios of the affected side relative to the contralateral unaffected side obtained using PWI and PET were 0.94 +/- 0.22 and 0.88 +/- 0.19, respectively. A statistically significant positive correlation was obtained between these ratios (p < 0.01). The CBF ratio, but not the semi-quantitative CBF, obtained using PWI has a potential to detect changes in the CBF.
