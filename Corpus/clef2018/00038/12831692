New strategies in the management of low back injuries in gymnasts. Low back pain is an extremely common complaint in competitive gymnasts, and these athletes are at risk for multiple potential structural injuries to the spine. Of particular concern among gymnasts is spondylolysis. Unfortunately, there are no published, controlled trials on the diagnosis or treatment of spondylolysis in adolescent athletes. However, based on the current literature, there would appear to be little role for the use of plain radiography in the diagnosis of symptomatic spondylolysis nuclear imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) appears to represent the best screening tool for diagnosis. Given the limited specificity of nuclear imaging in the spine, it is generally best to follow any positive study with a limited thin-cut computed tomography scan of the region of concern on the SPECT. Treatment should be based on the radiographic stage of the lesion. Relative rest is an essential component of care. Although the rehabilitation of gymnasts with lumbar injuries is poorly studied, the related literature would support incorporating the concepts of dynamic lumbar stabilization and sport-specific training into their rehabilitation programs.
