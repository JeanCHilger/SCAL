Cross-modal plasticity for sensory and motor activation patterns in blind subjects. Experimental data on cortical reorganization in blind subjects using H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) showed activation of the visual cortex related to Braille reading and tactile discrimination tasks in congenitally and early blind subjects. The purpose of our study was to differentiate whether occipital activation of blind subjects during Braille reading is task specific or only triggered by sensory or motor area activation. Twelve congenitally and early-onset blind subjects were studied with fMRI during Braille reading, discriminating nonsense dots, sensory stimulation with electromagnetic pulses, and finger tapping. All experiments were performed utilizing a block design with 6 active epochs alternating with 6 rest conditions lasting 34 s each. Echo-planar imaging sequences with 34 transversal slices were performed on a 1.5-T MR scanner. All blind individuals reading Braille and discriminating nonsense dots showed robust activation of the primary, secondary, and higher visual cortex. Application of peripheral electrical stimuli to the reading hand revealed expected sensory activation of the primary somatosensory cortex, but no activation in the visual cortex. Pure motor activation during finger tapping with the reading hand showed expected precentral activation and no activation of visual cortex. In conclusion, occipital activation during Braille reading and discrimination tasks is not due to plasticity of sensory or motor function pure motor or sensory tasks do not lead to an activation of striate cortex. The brain learns to differentiate between "finger touching" and "finger reading." Our results suggest that activation of the visual cortex in blind subjects is related to higher and more complex brain functions.
