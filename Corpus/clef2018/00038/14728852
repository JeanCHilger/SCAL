Role of positron emission tomography in diagnosis of recurrent ovarian cancer. To investigate the efficiency of positron emission tomography (PET) with (fluorine-18)-2-deoxyglucose ((18)FDG) in diagnosis of recurrent ovarian cancer.(18)FDG-PET scanning and computerized tomography (CT) were performed on 31 patients 35 times, who were clinically free of disease after optimal cytoreductive surgery and first-line chemotherapy. Twenty-two patients were confirmed pathologically after second-look or re-debulking operation and the others were followed up by many methods (ultrasonography, CA(125) and pelvic examination combined), evaluating the role of PET and CT in the diagnosis of recurrent ovarian cancer.(1) PET demonstrated recurrent sites through increased (18)FDG uptake. In 35 times, PET showed 1 false-negative and 1 false-positive cases. (2) The sensitivity of (18)FDG-PET is 96.3%, and CT is 70.4%. There was significant difference between two groups (P < 0.05).PET is more sensitive in diagnosing recurrent ovarian cancer than CT, so it improve early diagnosis in recurrent ovarian cancer.
