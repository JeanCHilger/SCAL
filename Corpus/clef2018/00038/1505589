Does the severity of leukoaraiosis contribute to senile dementia? A comparative computerized and positron emission tomographic study. The present study evaluates the origin, severity and location of leukoaraiosis in senile dementia and in normal ageing. The regional white-matter lucency scores, determined on computed-tomographic scan of the brain, are compared to the regional blood flow, oxygen extraction rate and oxygen consumption, determined by the [15O] steady-state technique with positron emission tomography. Thirty patients, classified according to the presence or absence of leukoaraiosis and their mental status, are examined. The occurrence and severity of dementia appear to be mainly correlated to decreased blood flow and oxygen metabolism in the frontal, temporal and parietal cerebral cortex. Leukoaraiosis in demented and nondemented patients is associated with lowered blood flow in the frontal and parietal white matter. The regional lucency score is increased, and blood flow and oxygen consumption decreased in the frontal white matter of severely demented patients. Frontal leukoaraiosis contributes to dementia and is probably of ischemic origin, while parietal and occipital leukoaraiosis is due to wallerian degeneration.
