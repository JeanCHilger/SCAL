Lumbosacral transitional vertebral articulation: evaluation by planar and SPECT bone scintigraphy. It has been suggested that low back pain (LBP) may arise from lumbosacral transitional vertebral articulation (LSTVA) itself. It is known that bone scintigraphy is a valuable tool for the recognition of pain arising from bone and articular diseases. Therefore we aimed to show planar and SPECT bone scintigraphic findings of LSTVA and compare them with the LBP and X-ray findings. Twenty-eight patients (aged 20-63 years) in whom LSTVA had been identified radiographically were evaluated with planar bone scintigraphy, utilizing 99mTc methylene diphosphonate and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) bone scintigraphy. Eighteen patients had LBP whereas 10 had not. There were 25 type IIA, one type IIB and two type IIIA LSTV articulation. On planar images, normal or non-focal minimally increased uptake superimposed on the upper sacroiliac joint was seen in patients without degenerative changes regardless of LBP whereas SPECT showed non-focal mild increased uptake on the area medial to the upper sacroiliac joint. Planar scans showed normal to non-focal mild, and mild-to-moderately increased uptake whereas SPECT demonstrated focal mild-to-moderately and markedly increased uptake in patients with degenerative changes without LBP and with LBP, respectively. The X-ray results showed an association of LBP degenerative changes, and the SPECT results showed a focal, markedly increased, uptake. We conclude that this focal, markedly increased, uptake may show the metabolically active degenerative changes of LSTV articulation and may help to reveal the pain arising from LSTVA. Therefore we propose that bone scintigraphy may be considered for the evaluation of patients with LBP thought to arise from LSTV articulation.
