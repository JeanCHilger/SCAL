Quantitative Tc-99m sestamibi attenuation-corrected SPECT: development and multicenter trial validation of myocardial perfusion stress gender-independent normal database in an obese population. A gender-independent stress normal database and criteria for abnormality for attenuation-corrected rest-stress technetium 99m sestamibi same-day myocardial perfusion imaging were developed by evaluation of 112 patients, validated against an obese population of 95 patients from four different clinical sites, and compared with conventional gender-matched database quantification of non-attenuation-corrected studies.These 95 validation patients (63 men) were used for prospective quantitative evaluation (mean weight, 213 +/- 57 lb mean body mass index, 32 +/- 9 kg/m(2)). This group included 21 patients (12 men) with a lower than 5% likelihood of coronary artery disease (mean weight, 226 +/- 72 lbAttenuation-corrected studies can be quantified with a single gender-independent normal database and a single criterion for abnormality without loss of sensitivity and with significantly better specificity and normalcy rate.
