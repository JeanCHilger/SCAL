Impact of photon energy recovery on the assessment of left ventricular volume using myocardial perfusion SPECT. Photon energy recovery (PER) is a spectral deconvolution technique validated for scatter removal in patients and phantom studies. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of PER on left ventricular volume measurement based on myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).SPECT acquisitions were performed by use of a static cardiac phantom and in 25 patients after a rest injection of technetium 99m sestamibi by use of multiple energy windows (126-136, 137-144, and 145-154 keV). Data were successively reconstructed with and without PER, by use of iterative reconstruction and post-processing filtering (Butterworth filter order, 5PER has a significant impact on image contrast and left ventricular volume measurement by use of perfusion SPECT. PER improves the accuracy of phantom volume assessment. In patients, volume increase is correlated to image contrast increase and is higher in those with small ventricles.
