A New STLV-1 in a household pet Cercopithecus nictitans from Gabon. A recent serological survey of wild-born captive monkeys from Gabon, Central Africa, revealed that 1 of 20 Cercopithecus nictitans tested was infected with a new simian T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (STLV-1). We investigated the molecular relationship between the STLV-1 strain present in this C. nictitans (CN01) and the other available HTLV/STLV strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the env (gp46 and gp21) region showed that the new STLV(nict) clusters with the HTLV-1/STLV-1 group and not with the other nictitans STLVs belonging to the STLV-3 group. Moreover, our new STLV(nict) is closely related to the molecular subtype D, which presently includes five HTLV-1 and three mandrill STLV-1 strains from Gabon and two from Cameroon. These data show that C. nictitans may be the natural carrier of two different molecular types of STLV, one related to STLV-3 and the other possibly one of the simian STLV type 1 counterparts of HTLV-1 subtype D.
