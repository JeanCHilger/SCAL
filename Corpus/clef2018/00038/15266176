Diagnosis of infection of implantable central venous catheters by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in the diagnosis of infection of implantable vascular catheters.We evaluated six patients with haematological cancer and infection of their implantable vascular catheter and who underwent FDG PET imaging around the time of their infection.Six patients with multiple myeloma who developed infection of their implantable device (five port pocket infections and one tunnel infection) were identified. FDG PET revealed increased uptake at the site of the implantable catheter (SUV 2.7-4.5) in all six patients, even in the absence of signs or symptoms of infection at the site of the device (three), and the presence of severe neutropenia (four). The three patients who did not have local inflammation at the site of the device were profoundly neutropenic. The FDG PET diagnosis led to removal of the device in two patients.FDG PET is a safe, rapid and accurate tool for diagnosing infection of an implantable catheter, including among those patients not exhibiting local signs and symptoms of infection, and in whom the diagnosis of infected device may be difficult. FDG PET may help prevent the unnecessary removal of implantable intravascular catheters and the unwarranted use of antibiotics.
