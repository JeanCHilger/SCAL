Glutamatergic neurotransmission and neuronal glucose oxidation are coupled during intense neuronal activation. 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments have previously shown that glutamatergic neurotransmitter flux (Vcycle(Glu/Gln)) changes proportionately with neuronal glucose oxidation (CMRglc(ox)N) in the nonactivated cortex of anesthetized rats. Positron Emission Tomography measurements of glucose and oxygen uptake during sensory stimulation had shown that the incremental glucose utilization is greater than oxygen leading to the suggestion that the energy required for stimulated neuronal activity arises from nonoxidative glucose metabolism. In this study, the authors used spatially localized 1H-observed, 13C-edited NMR spectroscopy during an infusion of [1,6-13C2]glucose to assess the relationship between changes in Vcycle(Glu/Gln) and glucose utilization (CMRglc(ox)N and CMRglc(nonox)) during the intense cortical activity associated with bicuculline-induced seizures. Metabolic fluxes were determined by model-based analysis of the 13C-enrichment time courses of glutamate-C4 and glutamine-C4 (CMRglc(ox)N, Vcycle(Glu/Gln)) and lactate-C3 (CMRglc(nonox)). The exchange rate between alpha-ketoglutarate and glutamate was found to be significantly faster than TCA cycle flux both for control (41 micromol.g(-1).min(-1) 95% CI, 5 to 109 micromol.g(-1).min(-1)) and during seizures (21 micromol.g(-1).min(-1)
