Comparison of brain activation after sustained non-fatiguing and fatiguing muscle contraction: a positron emission tomography study. The concept of fatigue refers to a class of acute effects that can impair motor performance, and not to a single mechanism. A great deal is known about the peripheral mechanisms underlying the process of fatigue, but our knowledge of the roles of the central structures in that process is still very limited. During fatigue, it has been shown that peripheral apparatus is capable of generating adequate force while central structures become insufficient/sub-optimal in driving them. This is known as central fatigue, and it can vary between muscles and different tasks. Fatigue induced by submaximal isometric contraction may have a greater central component than fatigue induced by prolonged maximal efforts. We studied the changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of brain structures after sustained isometric muscle contractions of different submaximal force levels and of different durations, and compared them with the conditions observed when the sustained muscle contraction becomes fatiguing. Changes in cortical activity, as indicated by changes in rCBF, were measured using positron emission tomography (PET). Twelve subjects were studied under four conditions: (1) rest condition (2) contraction of the m. biceps brachii at 30% of MVC, sustained for 60 s
