Clinical decision-making and myocardial viability: current perspectives. Not all myocardium involved in a myocardial infarction is dead or irreversibly damaged. The balance between the amount of scar and live tissue, and the nature of the live tissue, determine the likelihood that contractile function will improve after revascularisation. This improvement (which defines viability) may be predicted with about 80% accuracy using several techniques. This review examines the determinants of functional recovery and how they may be integrated in making decisions regarding revascularisation.
