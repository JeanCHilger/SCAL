18F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by positron emission tomography predicts outcome of non-small-cell lung cance. To determine whether the standardized uptake value (SUV) of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by positron emission tomography could be a prognostic factor for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).One hundred sixty-two patients with stage I to IIIb NSCLC were analyzed. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and local-regional control (LRC) were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and evaluated with the log-rank test. The prognostic significance was assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses.There were 93 patients treated with surgery and 69 patients treated with radiotherapy. A cutoff of 5 for the SUV for the primary tumor showed the best discriminative value. The SUV for the primary tumor was a significant predictor of OS (P = .02) in both groups. Low SUVs (</= 5.0) showed significantly better DFS rates than those with high SUVs (> 5.0 surgery group, P = .02The SUV of the primary tumor was the strongest prognostic factor among the patients treated by curative surgery or radiotherapy.
