Arterial clearance and cerebral uptake of Tc-99m ECD in patients with cerebrovascular disease compared with PET. Technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) has recently developed for SPECT imaging in assessment of cerebral perfusion. We evaluated the arterial blood clearance and the regional brain uptake of Tc-99m ECD compared with the regional CBF measured by PET in patients with cerebrovascular disease. Nine patients with diagnosis of cerebral ischemic disorders (N = 7) and cerebral hemorrhage (N = 2) were studied. PET study was performed with HEADTOME IV by O-15 steady state inhalation method. Immediately after the PET study, 555-740 MBq (5-20 mCi) of Tc-99m ECD was injected intravenously. After injection arterial blood sampling was performed sequentially, and we separated lipophilic fraction from whole blood using ethyl acetate in two cases. The SPECT imaging with Tc-99m ECD (ECD-SPECT) was started 5 min (first imaging) and 60 min (second imaging) after the administration using a high resolution ring type SPECT system (HEADTOME II). Several ROIs were placed on practically the same anatomical location on both SPECT and PET images. Clearance of the tracer in arterial whole blood and lipophilic fraction was rapid. Concerning to the distribution pattern of ECD-SPECT images there was no differences between the 1st imaging and the 2nd imaging, although about 15% of diffuse decrease of Tc-99m ECD uptake was shown in the 2nd images. The brain distribution of ECD-SPECT was comparable to the pattern of CBF image by PET. The regional relative counts of ECD-SPECT corresponded closely to the CBF value by PET, but it was no linear correlation between brain uptake of ECD-SPECT and PET-CBF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
