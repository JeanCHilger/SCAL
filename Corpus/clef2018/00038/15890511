New insights in allergen avoidance measures for mite and pet sensitized patients. A critical appraisal. It is widely acknowledged that avoidance of allergens such as those derived from foods, drugs, latex and stinging insects results in a complete disappearance of symptoms. By contrast, although it has been clearly shown that allergens are an important risk factor for the development of respiratory symptoms and that several avoidance measures reduce allergen levels, whether this gives clinical improvement in symptoms is debatable. Many reasons could be invoked to justify this evident discrepancy. Apart from the intrinsic methodological aspects (e.g. single or combined interventions measure, population studied, severity of respiratory symptoms, outcomes, evaluated parameters, etc.), it is important to outline that a successful approach requires that the avoided allergen is the only and real factor responsible for symptoms, the patient's education and the use of a comprehensive protocol to reduce allergen exposure. Other important factors include the involvement of the patient, the relevance of other allergens/non-specific agents, and exposure to sensitizing agents also outside patient's home. It is likely that the clinical phase of allergic airway disease and the degree of bronchial (and also nasal) remodelling, in each individual, represent relevant factors for the clinical outcome of allergen avoidance procedures. Since the management of respiratory allergy is a complex strategy (including drugs, allergen avoidance, immunological and educational interventions), it is difficult in real life to distinguish the efficacy of a single intervention in comparison to the others. A combined strategy is likely to produce better clinical results.
