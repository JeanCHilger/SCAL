Physical, occupational, respiratory, speech, equine and pet therapies for mitochondrial disease. Treatments for mitochondrial disease, while developing, remain limited. Therapies complementary to traditional medical and surgical approaches may benefit the patient with mitochondrial disease. The goals of the 'allied health professions' of physical, occupational, speech and respiratory therapies are to maintain and if possible, improve patients' existing strength, functioning and mobility. These therapists also play an important role in helping patients to compensate for disabilities and adapt to progressive symptoms. Novel forms of physical and occupational therapies, equine or "hippotherapy" and pet therapy, use the human to animal relationship to improve physical and emotional health. To enhance quality of life, an integrated team of experts, under the guidance and supervision of the physician, should be available to the patient with mitochondrial disease.
