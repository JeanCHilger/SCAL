Cortico-cortical networks and cortico-subcortical loops for the higher control of eye movements. There are multiple distinct regions, or eye fields, in the cerebral cortex that contribute directly to the initiation and control of voluntary eye movements. We concentrate on six of these: the frontal eye field, parietal eye field, supplementary eye field, middle superior temporal area, prefrontal eye field, and area 7 m (precuneus in humans). In each of these regions: (1) there is neural activity closely related to eye movements (2) electrical microstimulation produces or modifies eye movements
