New trends in medical imaging. In the past decades new imaging techniques and developments in existing systems have been introduced. Novel ideas with strong potential in areas such as radiography, nuclear magnetic resonance, ultrasound and nuclear medicine have recently emerged or are still under development or evaluation. Positron emission tomography (PET) is finally garnering enormous interest for high-sensitivity and high-specificity molecular imaging. The combination of PET and computed tomography is proving to be very useful in clinical oncology. Functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy are also emerging as strong partners in terms of functional information. Recent improvements in ultrasound imaging, such as a 3-D, tissue harmonics, high-frequency, real time, extended field of view and new contrast agents, show the potential of this methodology. Film/screen mammography represents the ultimate in radiography capacities, but new digital systems are beginning to offer even better response.
