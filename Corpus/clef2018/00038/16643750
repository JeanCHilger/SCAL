The action of dexamethasone on trans epithelial electrical resistance and the expression of aquaporin-1 in immortalized trabecular cells. To study the effect of dexamethasone on trans epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the expression of AQP-1 in immortalized trabecular cells.Immortalized human trabecular cells were cultured on PET membrane in 24 wells plate. The cells were treated with Dexamethasone in concentration of 10(-7) mol/L. After the cultured cell became confluence, TEER of the cells was detected to evaluate the resistance of outflow pathway at different time points. Western blot was used to analyze the expression of AQP-1 in the trabecular cells.The TEER and the expression of AQP-1 were much higher in the cells treated by Dexamethasone in comparison to control without dexamethasone exposure.The TEER and expression of AQP-1 in immortalized trabecular cells can be enhanced by Dexamethasone. AQP-1 upregulation induced by Glucocorticoid may relate with the increased resistance of outflow pathway in glaucoma.
