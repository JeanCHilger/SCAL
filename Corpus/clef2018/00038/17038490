Visualizing lung function with positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) provides three-dimensional images of the distributions of radionuclides that have been inhaled or injected into the lungs. By using radionuclides with short half-lives, the radiation exposure of the subject can be kept small. By following the evolution of the distributions of radionuclides in gases or compounds that participate in lung function, information about such diverse lung functions as regional ventilation, perfusion, shunt, gas fraction, capillary permeability, inflammation, and gene expression can be inferred. Thus PET has the potential to provide information about the links between cellular function and whole lung function in vivo. In this paper, recent advancements in PET methodology and techniques and information about lung function that have been obtained with these techniques are reviewed.
