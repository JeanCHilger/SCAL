Maximum effort breath-hold times for males and females of similar pulmonary capacities during sudden face-only immersion at water temperatures from 0 to 33 degrees C. For non breath-hold-trained males and females matched for pulmonary capacity and body size, the effects of sex, water temperature, and end-tidal gas tensions were studied for their potential influences on breath-holding ability. Maximum breath-hold time (BHTmax) was measured a total of 546 times in 13 males and 13 females, each repeating 3 trials of sudden face immersion (i.e., no prior hyperventilation) in water at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 33 degrees C and in an air control condition (AIR). End-tidal carbon dioxide (P(ET)CO2) and oxygen (P(ET)O2) gas tensions were measured before and after breath-holding in a subset of 11 males and 11 females. For BHTmax there was no main effect of sex (p = 0.20), but there was a main effect of immersion condition (p < 0.001). Relative to pre-immersion rest values, end-tidal gas tensions were significantly higher in males than in females (p <or= 0.05) and significantly lower at decreased water temperatures relative to AIR (p <or= 0.05). In conclusion, for these matched groups (i) sex did not influence BHTmax (ii) irrespective of sex, decreases in water temperature at 0, 5, 10, and 15 degrees C gave proportionate decreases of BHTmax
