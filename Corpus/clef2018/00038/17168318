Cloning and expression of the genes encoding glycerol dehydratase reactivase and identification of its biological activity. The gdrA, gdrB gene coding glycerol dehydratase reactivase factor were amplified by using the genomic DNA of Klebsiella pneumoniae as the template. The gdrA and gdrB were inserted in pMD-18T to yield the recombinant cloning vector pMD-gdrAB. After the DNA sequence was determined, the gdrAB gene was subcloned into expression vector pET-28a(+) to yield the recombinant expression vector pET-28gdrAB. Under screening pressure by ampicillin and kanamycin simultaneously, the activity of glycerol dehydratase reactivase was characterized by coexpression of pET-32gldABC, which carry the gldABC gene encoding glycerol dehydratase, and pET-28gdrAB in E. coli BL21(DE3).
