The utility of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose whole body PET imaging for determining malignancy in cystic lesions of the pancreas. Previous studies have suggested that whole body positron-emission tomography (PET) can distinguish between benign and malignant cysts of the pancreas. Patients were identified (n = 68) who had undergone whole body PET imaging for a cystic lesion of the pancreas between Jan. 1997 and May 2005. Cross-sectional imaging studies were reviewed by a single blinded radiologist, and positive PET studies were reviewed by a blinded nuclear medicine physician. Operative resection was performed in 21 patients (31%), and 47 patients were managed with radiographic follow-up. F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lesions were identified in eight of the 68 patients (12%). Within the resected group of patients (n=21), four of the seven patients (57%) with either in situ or invasive malignancy (adenocarcinoma: 3 of 5, papillary mucinous carcinoma: 1 of 2) had positive PET imaging (mean SUV, 5.9 range 2.5-8.0), and 2 of the 14 patients (14%) with benign lesions had positive PET imaging (serous cystadenoma, n=1, SUV=3.3
