Differential diagnosis of benign and malign pancreatic masses with 18F-fluordeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography recorded with a dual-head coincidence gamma camera. Metabolic imaging using 18F-fluordeoxyglucose and a ring-positron emission tomography camera is an established method in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic masses. Ring-positron emission tomography cameras, however, are expensive and available in only few specialized centres. The aim of this study was to investigate how far 18F-fluordeoxyglucose scan with a conventional dual-head gamma-camera could differentiate between benign and malign pancreatic masses.Forty-one patients (male/female: 25/16 mean age: 64.0 yearsIn 22 patients carcinoma was diagnosed (pancreatic cancer: n=17 endocrine tumour: n=318F-fluordeoxyglucose scan with a conventional dual-head gamma-camera is a highly sensitive and specific method in the differential diagnosis of benign and malign pancreatic masses.
