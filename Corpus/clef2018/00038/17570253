Hypoadiponectinemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus in men is associated with sympathetic overactivity as evaluated by cardiac 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. Hypoadiponectinemia is associated with insulin resistance. However, there is very limited information about the relationship between plasma adiponectin and cardiac autonomic nervous function. We tested the hypothesis that hypoadiponectinemia is associated with cardiac sympathetic overactivity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thirty-three male type 2 diabetic patients not on insulin treatment were classified into a hypoadiponectinemia group (plasma adiponectin concentration, <4.0 microg/mL age, 58.6 +/- 8.6 years [mean +/- SD]
