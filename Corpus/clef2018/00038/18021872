Pioglitazone improves myocardial blood flow and glucose utilization in nondiabetic patients with combined hyperlipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This study's aim was to examine whether treatment with pioglitazone, added to conventional lipid-lowering therapy, would improve myocardial glucose utilization (MGU) and blood flow (MBF) in nondiabetic patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL).Thiazolidinediones were found to improve insulin sensitivity and MGU in type 2 diabetes and MBF in Mexican Americans with insulin resistance. Familial combined hyperlipidemia is a complex genetic disorder conferring a high risk of premature coronary artery disease, characterized by high serum cholesterol and/or triglyceride, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and insulin resistance.We undertook a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 26 patients with FCHL, treated with pioglitazone or matching placebo 30 mg daily for 4 weeks, followed by 45 mg daily for 12 weeks. Positron emission tomography was used to measure MBF at rest and during adenosine-induced hyperemia and MGU during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp at baseline and after treatment.Whereas no change was observed in the placebo group after treatment, patients receiving pioglitazone showed a significant increase in whole body glucose disposal (3.93 +/- 1.59 mg/kg/min to 5.24 +/- 1.65 mg/kg/min p = 0.004) and MGU (0.62 +/- 0.26 micromol/g/min to 0.81 +/- 0.14 micromol/g/minIn patients with FCHL treated with conventional lipid-lowering therapy, the addition of pioglitazone led to significant improvements in MGU and MBF, with a favorable effect on blood lipid and metabolic parameters.
