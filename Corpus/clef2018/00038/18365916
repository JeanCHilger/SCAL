Video capsule endoscopy in small-bowel tumours: a single centre experience. Early diagnosis of small-bowel tumours is crucial for curative surgery. Although videocapsule endoscopy (VCE) has improved the diagnosis of small-bowel diseases, there are few data about the role of this examination in small-bowel malignancies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic yield of VCE in small-bowel malignancies.From March 2001 to July 2006, 380 patients were studied by VCE in our centre. Data on 13 consecutive patients (3.4%) affected by small-bowel malignancy were retrospectively assessed from a prospectively collected database. Indications for VCE were: obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in 9 patients (70%), abdominal pain, coeliac disease, long-lasting fever and hepatic metastasis in the other 4 patients, respectively, (7.5%). Before VCE, patients had undergone 65 procedures, including oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, push-enteroscopy, small-bowel radiographies, abdominal CT scanning, nuclear medicine bleeding-scan, positron emission tomography and octreoscan.VCE detected jejunal polyps in 6 patients (46.2%), ulcerated stricture in 3 (23%), and erosions, stricture with ileal inflammation, submucosal nodule and active bleeding in 4 patients, respectively. The diagnosis was confirmed after surgery in 11 cases. One patient died of ischaemic myocardial infarction 3 days after VCE, before surgery. Histological examination showed lymphoma (n=3), small-bowel metastasis from colonic carcinoma (n=3), carcinoid tumour (n=3), gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) (n=2), metastatic melanoma (n=1) and primary small-bowel adenocarcinoma (n=1). VCE had an influence on the diagnosis or management of 10/13 patients.VCE is the diagnostic test with the highest yield for small-bowel malignancies, since it can detect small-bowel tumours that are often missed by traditional examinations.
