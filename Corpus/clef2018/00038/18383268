Dynamic contrast-enhanced quantitative perfusion measurement of the brain using T1-weighted MRI at 3T. To develop a method for the measurement of brain perfusion based on dynamic contrast-enhanced T(1)-weighted MR imaging.Dynamic imaging of the first pass of a bolus of a paramagnetic contrast agent was performed using a 3T whole-body magnet and a T(1)-weighted fast field echo sequence. The input function was obtained from the internal carotid artery. An initial T(1) measurement was performed in order to convert the MR signal to concentration of the contrast agent. Pixelwise and region of interest (ROI)-based calculation of cerebral perfusion (CBF) was performed using Tikhonov's procedure of deconvolution. Seven patients with acute optic neuritis and two patients with acute stroke were investigated.The mean perfusion value for ROIs in gray matter was 62 mL/100g/min and 21 mL/100g/min in white matter in patients with acute optic neuritis. The perfusion inside the infarct core was 9 mL/100g/min in one of the stroke patients. The other stroke patient had postischemic hyperperfusion and CBF was 140 mL/100g/min.Absolute values of brain perfusion can be obtained using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. These values correspond to expected values from established PET methods. Furthermore, at 3T pixelwise calculation can be performed, allowing construction of CBF maps.
