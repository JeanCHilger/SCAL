Role of whole-body [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) and conventional techniques in the staging of patients with Hodgkin and aggressive non Hodgkin lymphoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in the staging of Hodgkin's and aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL and NHL), comparing it with conventional diagnostic methods, i.e. contrast-enhanced CT and bone marrow biopsy.Sixty-five consecutive patients (30 HL and 35 NHL) who underwent conventional disease staging and FDG-PET/CT were included. Concordance between conventional methods and PET was established when both procedures identified the same disease stage. Discordant findings were investigated further by using other diagnostic techniques (ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging) and/or clinical follow-up.PET correctly staged 93.8% of enrolled patients (61/65), whereas conventional techniques correctly staged 89.2% (58/65 p=NS, Chi(2) test). There was complete concordance in 54/65 patients (83.1%)Our data confirm the high accuracy of FDG-PET/CT in staging HL and NHL. FDG-PET/CT should therefore be used routinely in the initial evaluation of both patient subgroups.
