Cloning expression and purification of glycerol dehydrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae. The gldA gene coding glycerol dehydrogenase (GDH) was amplified by PCR with the genomic DNA of Klebsiella pneumoniae as the template. The gldA were inserted in pMD-18T to construct the recombinant cloning vector pMD-gldA. After the DNA sequence was determined, the gldA was subcloned into expression vector pET-32a (+) to construct the recombinant expression vector pET-32gldA. Upon lactose induction, soluble GDH was over-produced by E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring the expression construct. Recombinant GDH purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography showed a single band about 54 kD on SDS-PAGE gel, and the specified activity was about 188 u/mg, the purification fold is 3 times and the activity recovery is 67.5%.
