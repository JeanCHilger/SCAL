Avian hematology and related disorders. Hematology is an essential component of veterinary practice. The interpretation of avian blood cells provides many challenges. Practitioners must be able to recognize normal morphology and function of cells to interpret changes in those cells. This article describes the normal morphology of avian erythrocytes, leukocytes, and thrombocytes. Changes observed in erythrocytes and leukocytes during disease and major differential diagnoses are discussed. A brief overview of avian blood parasites is also presented.
