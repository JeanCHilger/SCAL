Cone-beam transmission computed tomography for nonuniform attenuation compensation of SPECT images. This paper develops and tests cone-beam transmission computed tomography (CB-CT) for attenuation compensation of SPECT images. CB-CT was implemented on a rotating gamma camera with a point source (1-2 mCi) of 99mTc, and a light-weight aluminum source holder. A cone-beam collimator may be used but is not required. Since the point source is either located at the collimator focal point, or the camera is uncollimated, CB-CT has excellent sensitivity (at least 150 times that of a parallel-hole, high-resolution collimator). The predicted resolution is equal to the intrinsic gamma camera resolution (3-4 mm), which is much higher than for a high-resolution, parallel-hole collimator (10-20 mm). In the present study, CB-CT provided low noise, high-resolution attenuation maps for use in a nonuniform attenuation-weighted backprojection algorithm. The attenuation compensation accuracy was tested using basic geometries of line sources and nonuniform density models. For the appropriate scaling of the attenuation map, the attenuation compensation was accurate and removed the SPECT image distortion associated with nonuniform attenuation. Attenuation maps acquired either with cone beam collimator or without any collimator were both successful. Using CB-CT, SPECT can thus be made much more accurate without adding unduly to the imaging time, complexity, or cost.
