Clinical applications of 68Ga-DOTANOC in neuroendocrine tumours. Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) are relatively rare neoplasms affecting principally the gastroenteropancreatic tract, but with potential ubiquitary location, as the neural crest cells, origin of this group of tumours, are dispersed in various organs and tissues. After the discovery of somatostatin receptors (SSTR) over-expression in this group of neoplasms, NET management has significantly improved. This is witnessed by the development of new tracers in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of NETs belonging to the family of radio-labelled somatostatin analogues, that significantly improved the accuracy of diagnosis and, more recently, opened the way to the innovative targeted radionuclide therapies. First introduced in clinical application in 2005, 68Ga-DOTANOC (one of the most used radio-labelled somatostatin analog for PET imaging) has revealed promising results in preliminary studies for the main clinical indications: staging NET suspected NET of unknown primary
