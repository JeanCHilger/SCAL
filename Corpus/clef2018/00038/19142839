MCI-plus: mild cognitive impairment with rapid progression. Part II: Biomarkers and research methods. Long-term studies will be pivotal in order to examine the efficacy of preventive and early therapeutic interventions during the preclinical phase of dementia. Biomarkers will be of importance due to the large sample sizes and the necessary logistic efforts, high drop-out rates and slow clinical progression. The validity of functional and even structural imaging methods is currently investigated with early and promising results it is presently unclear whether conventional csf-markers of Alzheimer's disease (beta-amyloid and tau-proteins) are sufficiently sensitive to monitor the effects of early interventions. It also remains doubtful whether modifications of these methods will ever be useful and available for practical purposes.
