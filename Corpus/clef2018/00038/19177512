Magnetosensory function in rats: localization using positron emission tomography. The aim of this study was to show that low-strength electromagnetic fields (EMFs) produced evoked potentials in rats and to localize the activated region in the brain. In response to a 2.5-G, 60-Hz stimulus, onset- and offset-evoked potentials were detected (P < 0.05 in each of the 10 animals studied) the evoked potentials had the same magnitude, latency, and nonlinear relationship to the field seen in previous studies on rabbits and human subjects. The neuroanatomical region of activation associated with the electrophysiological effect was identified by positron emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose. Paired emission scans (the same animal with and without field treatment) from 10 additional rats were differenced and averaged to produce a t-statistic image using the pooled variance
