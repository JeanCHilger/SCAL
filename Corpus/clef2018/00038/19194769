Treatment of T3 gallbladder cancer. Until recently, advanced stage gallbladder cancer has been viewed with great pessimism and many patients abandoned as without potentially curative treatment option. Recent results have significantly improved due to a number of advances. Improvements in radiologic staging including positron emission tomography now allow selection of patients with disease treatable by local regional resection. With improvements in surgical and anesthetic techniques, aggressive surgery has proven T3 and T4 tumors to be resectable with safety and result in long-term survival.
