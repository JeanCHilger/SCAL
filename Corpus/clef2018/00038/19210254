Comparison of the guaranteed analysis with the measured nutrient composition of commercial pet foods. To compare guaranteed and measured concentrations of nutrients in commercial pet foods.Cross-sectional study.Annual inspection reports of pet food analyses from 5 states.Guaranteed and measured concentrations of crude protein (CP), crude fat (CF), crude fiber (CFb), moisture, and ash in pet foods were compared. The concentration difference for each nutrient was compared among types of food, target species, target life stages, manufacturers, and laboratories.The guaranteed and measured concentrations of nutrients were significantly different. For all foods, mean concentration differences were as follows: CP, 1.5% CF, 1.0%Addition of 1.5% and 1% to the guaranteed minimums for CP and CF, respectively subtraction of 0.7%, 4%, and 0.5% from the guaranteed maximums for CFb, moisture, and ash, respectively
