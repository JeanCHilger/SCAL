EBV-related lymphoproliferative disease complicating therapy with the anti-CD2 monoclonal antibody, siplizumab, in patients with T-cell malignancies. We report an increased incidence of EBV-induced B-cell lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) in patients treated with siplizumab, an anti-CD2 antibody. The development of EBV-LPD has been associated with the use of immunosuppressive agents used in solid organ, bone marrow, and stem cell transplantation and in certain congenital immunodeficiencies.We conducted a single-institution phase I dose-escalation trial of siplizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to CD2, in 29 patients with T-cell malignancies.Although initial responses were encouraging, 4 (13.7%) patients developed EBV-LPD and the trial was stopped. Reductions in CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell count numbers in response to therapy were seen in all patients, but in those patients developing EBV-LPD a significantly greater reduction in natural killer (NK) cell number and CD2 expression on T cells was seen. These findings highlight the importance of NK-cell depletion and CD2 expression in addition to T-cell depletion in the etiology of EBV-LPD.The emergence of EBV-LPD may be associated with the ability of siplizumab to deplete both T and NK cells without affecting B cells. Agents that deplete T- and NK-cell populations without affecting B cell number should be screened for this potentially serious adverse event.
