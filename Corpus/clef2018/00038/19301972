Assessing the microlesion effect of subthalamic deep brain stimulation surgery with FDG PET. The authors investigated whether the insertion of deep brain stimulation electrodes into the subthalamic nucleus can alter regional brain metabolism in the absence of stimulation.Six patients with Parkinson disease (PD) underwent preoperative FDG PET scanning, and again after STN electrode implantation with stimulation turned off.Compared with baseline values, glucose utilization was reduced in the postoperative off-stimulation scans in the putamen/globus pallidus and in the ventral thalamus (p < 0.01), and there was increased metabolism in the sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum (p < 0.005). The expression of a specific PD-related spatial covariance pattern measured in the FDG PET data did not change after electrode implantation (p = 0.36), nor was there a significant change in clinical motor ratings (p = 0.44). Differences in PD-related spatial covariance pattern expression among the patients after electrode implantation did, however, correlate with the number of microelectrode recording trajectories placed during surgery (r = -0.82, p < 0.05).These findings suggest that electrode implantation can impart a microlesion effect on regional brain function. Nonetheless, these local changes did not cross the threshold of network modulation needed to achieve clinical benefit.
