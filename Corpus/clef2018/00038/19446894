Heart rate recovery after exercise: an important prognostic criterion. Exercise stress testing gives important data about autonomic nervous system activity. It has been demonstrated that heart rate profile parameters such as resting heart rate before exercise, maximum heart rate at peak exercise, heart rate increment during exercise, and heart rate decrement after exercise (heart rate recovery) are important prognostic factors in a variety of patient population. These simply measured parameters give significant and valuable data about prognosis.
