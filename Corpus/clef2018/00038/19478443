Crystallographic characterization of the passenger domain of the Bordetella autotransporter BrkA. Autotransporters (ATs) are proteins that deliver effectors (the passenger domain) to the surface of Gram-negative bacteria by the type V secretion pathway. The passenger domain of BrkA, a Bordetella pertussis autotransporter mediating serum resistance and adherence, was cloned in a pET expression system and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The gene product was correctly refolded, purified to homogeneity and crystallized. The crystals diffracted to 2.8 A resolution. The space group was assumed to be P4(1)2(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 108.19, c = 115.35 A.
