Evaluation of low-density neutral oral contrast material in PET/CT for tumor imaging: results of a randomized clinical trial. The objective of this study was to determine the impact on image quality and risks in terms of artifacts and side effects of a low-density barium-based suspension as oral contrast material for CT during PET/CT examinations of an oncologic patient population.Eighty-five patients (51 men and 34 women mean age, 53 yearsNone of the patients who received oral contrast material experienced side effects. All 85 PET examinations were considered adequate with no observable artifacts. The mean bowel opacification scores of the oral contrast group (2.59 and 2.93) as evaluated by radiologists 1 and 2, respectively, were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than those of the control group (1.55 and 1.59). The level of attenuation achieved in the contrast group was significantly higher than in the control group. The interobserver variability was moderate (kappa = 0.32).The use of low-density neutral oral contrast material for CT during combined FDG PET/CT studies significantly improves visualization of the bowel structures compared with no contrast material without causing side effects or clinically detectable errors in the attenuation correction of the FDG PET study.
