Effect of intracoronary streptokinase administered immediately after primary percutaneous coronary intervention on long-term left ventricular infarct size, volumes, and function. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reflections of the improvement in microvascular perfusion provided by adjuvant intracoronary streptokinase (ICSK) on late-phase infarct size and left ventricular volumes and functions.It has been shown that ICSK given immediately after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) improves myocardial perfusion in the early days of ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction.Ninety-five patients undergoing primary PCI were randomized to ICSK 250 kU (n = 51) or no additional therapy (n = 44). Two days later, coronary hemodynamic indexes were measured to evaluate tissue-level perfusion. After 6 months, angiography, echocardiography, and technetium-99m single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were performed.At 2 days, all indexes of microvascular function were significantly better in the ICSK group than in the control group, including coronary flow reserve (2.5 vs. 1.7, p < 0.001) and index of microvascular resistance (20.2 vs. 34.2, p < 0.001). At 6 months, infarct size (22.7% vs. 32.9% p = 0.003) and left ventricular end-systolic (41.1 ml vs. 60.9 mlIn this study, it has been demonstrated that low-dose ICSK given immediately after primary PCI significantly limits long-term infarct size and preserves left ventricular volumes and functions.
