A study of the effects of ranolazine using automated quantitative analysis of serial myocardial perfusion images. This study examined the hypothesis that the improvement in myocardial blood flow (MBF) with ranolazine therapy could be detected by serial automated quantitative myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial ischemia.Myocardial ischemia enhances late sodium current, which then causes cellular calcium overload leading to mechanical left ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias. Ranolazine inhibits late sodium current and improves diastolic tension and MBF in the animal model.In this open-label, nonrandomized pilot study, we recruited 20 patients with known or a high probability of CAD and who had reversible perfusion defects on exercise treadmill gated single-photon emission computed tomography MPI while receiving conventional antianginal therapy. Ranolazine (up to 1,000 mg twice daily) was added to baseline therapy and a repeat treadmill MPI was obtained after 4 weeks. The extent and severity of total and reversible left ventricular perfusion abnormality (based on polar maps and a 17-segment model) were determined quantitatively using automated methods.We screened 100 patients for 27 potential candidates 5 declined and 2 did not complete the follow-up study. The mean age of the remaining 20 patients was 64 +/- 9 yearsIn this preliminary hypothesis-driven study, short-term ranolazine therapy was shown to improve myocardial perfusion and decrease the ischemic burden in patients with CAD.
