Perspectives of nuclear diagnostic imaging in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a ventricular dysfunction in the absence of coronary artery disease, valvular or hypertensive heart disease. The mechanisms underlying diabetic cardiomyopathy may involve metabolic disturbances, myocardial fibrosis, small vessel disease, microcirculation abnormalities, cardiac autonomic neuropathy and insulin resistance. Diagnostic problems emerge because no specific disease pattern characterizes the disease and because there may be coexistence in diabetes of coronary artery disease and hypertension as independent but compounding causes of biochemical, anatomical and functional alterations impairing cardiac function. In this paper we will review the role of nuclear imaging today, concentrating on the diagnostic capabilities of radionuclide ventriculography, to study the effect of insulin resistance and, more extensively, gated-single photon emission computed tomography with Tc-99m labelled agents. A broad analysis will be dedicated to: 1) positron emission tomography using perfusion agents, with the potential to quantify resting and stress blood flow and coronary flow reserve 2) radionuclide procedures evaluating aerobic and anaerobic cardiac metabolism
