The aim of this review is to identify, discuss, and illustrate some of the major thoracic complications in patients with primary intrathoracic or extrathoracic neoplasms particular focus is placed on issues in which radiologic imaging may have a significant impact on patient management, including superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, post-obstructive pneumonia, diaphragmatic paralysis, pleural effusions, pericardial disease, tracheo-esophageal fistula, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.
