Development of high-resolution molecular phase-contrast stereoscopic X-ray imaging for accurate cancer diagnostics. A new high-resolution molecular phase-contrast stereoscopic X-ray imaging (PSXI) modality is under development. It is aimed at offering oncologists and radiologists a system solution to discover and locate early-stage cancers and to assess tumour characteristics and therapeutic responses. The method is primarily developed for clinical implementation of biologically optimised target-specific cancer therapy to maximise cure and improve quality of life of cancer patients. The investigations here indicate theoretically that it is possible to achieve high-resolution and high-contrast 3D medical imaging with the PSXI technique at relatively low dose, almost an order of magnitude lower than those used in conventional computed tomography (CT) imaging, depending on image resolution and contrast of interest. Unique features of this new molecular imaging modality will be discussed in comparison with currently available molecular imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography-computed tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. Some challenging issues with respect to the possible use of nanotechnology with the new molecular imaging modality will also be discussed.
