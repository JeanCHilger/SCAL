Gallbladder imaging. The treatment of gallbladder disease has been revolutionized by improvements in laparoscopic surgery as well as endoscopic and radiologic interventional techniques. Therapeutic success is dependent on accurate radiologic assessment of gallbladder pathology. This article describes recent technical advances in ultrasonography, multidetector computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and scintigraphy, which have significantly improved the accuracy of noninvasive imaging of benign and malignant gallbladder disease. The imaging findings of common gallbladder disorders are presented, and the role of each of the imaging modalities is placed in perspective for optimizing patient management.
