Sex differences in the relationship of regional dopamine release to affect and cognitive function in striatal and extrastriatal regions using positron emission tomography and [¹⁸F]fallypride. The purpose of this study was to examine sex differences in the correlations of d-amphetamine (d-AMPH) induced displacements of [¹⁸F]fallypride in striatal and extrastriatal regions in relation to affect and cognition. Seven male and six female healthy subjects, whose mean age was 25.9 years, underwent positron emission tomography (PET) with [¹⁸F]fallypride at baseline and 3 h after a 0.43 mg/kg oral dose of d-AMPH. Percent displacements in striatal and extrastriatal regions were calculated using regions of interest (ROI) analysis and on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Subjects underwent neuropsychological testing prior to the baseline PET study and one hour after d-AMPH administration for the second PET. In order to examine the subjective effect of d-AMPH, subjects rated PANAS at baseline and after administration of amphetamine. Correlations of changes in cognition and affect with regional dopamine (DA) release revealed several significant sex related differences. The results of this study demonstrate in vivo sex related differences in the relationship of regional DA release to affect and cognitive function.
