Clinical utility of positron emission tomography/computed tomography in inflammatory bowel disease. The clinical utility of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in comparison to standard workup in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unknown.Clinical data were collected on seven patients with known or suspected IBD undergoing PET/CT. Standard workup included history, physical exam, laboratory tests, colonoscopy and/or cross-sectional imaging. We divided the intestine into five regions [small bowel and four colon (ascending, transverse, descending and rectosigmoid)] and graded relative standard uptake values 0, 1, 2 or 3 by comparison to the liver, using a region-of-interest analysis (0 = no activity, 1 = liver, 2 and 3 = significant inflammation).In patients 1 and 2, PET/CT demonstrated more activity than we thought clinically present. The other patients avoided unnecessary escalation or initiation of IBD therapy based on PET/CT results. Compared with standard workup, all seven patients had superior results when therapeutic decisions were based on PET/CT.We found PET/CT to be very useful in diagnosis and management in patients with known or suspected IBD.
