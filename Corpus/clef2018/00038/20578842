Stability of 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine standardized uptake values in head and neck cancer over time. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the consistency of 3'-deoxy-3'[(18)F]fluorothymidine (FLT) standardized uptake values (SUVs) over the time course of imaging in head and neck cancer. Thirteen (13) subjects (all male age: 56.9 +/- 6.7 years) with squamous cell head and neck cancer, stage III/IV, were administered FLT and imaged dynamically for 1 hour over the tumor and then underwent whole-body (WB) imaging commencing at 74 +/- 6 minutes. Imaging was repeated after 5 days of radiotherapy (10 Gy) and a single course of platinum-based chemotherapy. Volumes-of-interest (VOIs) were created on the last dynamic frame (SUV(60)). The pretherapy WB and midtherapy images were coregistered to the dynamic sequence and VOIs were applied. Mean and maximum SUVs (SUV(60) and SUV(WB)) and the change with treatment were evaluated. The correlations (Spearman's rho) between SUV(60) and SUV(WB) for all VOIs (pre- and midtherapy, n = 108 data pairs) were 0.98 for mean and 0.97 for maximum SUVs (p < 0.0001). Average absolute differences between SUV(60) and SUV(WB) were 0.18 +/- 0.15 and 0.29 +/- 0.32 SUV units, respectively. Correlations (Spearman's rho) between the change in SUV with therapy were 0.90 for mean and 0.89 for maximum SUV (p < 0.0001), with differences in the change values averaging 0.03 +/- 0.36 and -0.17 +/- 0.57 units, respectively. FLT SUVs are stable and comparable for images initiated between 55 and 100 minutes postinjection whether acquired pre- or midtherapy in head and neck cancer.
