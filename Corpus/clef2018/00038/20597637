Voxel-based statistical analysis of thalamic glucose metabolism in traumatic brain injury: relationship with consciousness and cognition. To study the relationship between thalamic glucose metabolism and neurological outcome after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).Forty-nine patients with severe and closed TBI and 10 healthy control subjects with (18)F-FDG PET were studied. Patients were divided into three groups: MCS&VS group (n = 17), patients in a vegetative or a minimally conscious state In-PTA group (n = 12), patients in a state of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA)Thalamic hypometabolism was the most prominent in patients with low consciousness (MCS&VS group) and the thalamic hypometabolism in the In-PTA group was more prominent than that in the Out-PTA group. Healthy control subjects showed the greatest thalamic metabolism. These differences in metabolism were more pronounced in the internal regions of the thalamus.The results confirm the vulnerability of the thalamus to suffer the effect of the dynamic forces generated during a TBI. Patients with thalamic hypometabolism could represent a sub-set of subjects that are highly vulnerable to neurological disability after TBI.
