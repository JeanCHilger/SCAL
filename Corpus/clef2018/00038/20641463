. A number of neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases (1-3), involve a dysfunction of the brain’s serotonin system. The serotonergic neurons – present in wide areas of the brain, including the hypothalamus, thalamus and cerebral cortex – bear a protein called “serotonin transporter” (SERT) (4). SERT is a specific marker for the number and integrity of presynaptic terminals of serotonin-producing neurons. It regulates neurotransmission by removing released serotonin from the extracellular space back into the presynaptic neuron. A variety of radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET) have been evaluated for imaging SERT. The most recent include [
