Navigation systems for ablation. Navigation systems, devices, and intraprocedural software are changing the way interventional oncology is practiced. Before the development of precision navigation tools integrated with imaging systems, thermal ablation of hard-to-image lesions was highly dependent on operator experience, spatial skills, and estimation of positron emission tomography-avid or arterial-phase targets. Numerous navigation systems for ablation bring the opportunity for standardization and accuracy that extends the operator's ability to use imaging feedback during procedures. In this report, existing systems and techniques are reviewed and specific clinical applications for ablation are discussed to better define how these novel technologies address specific clinical needs and fit into clinical practice.
