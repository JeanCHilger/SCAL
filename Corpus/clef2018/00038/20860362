Highly fluorescent platinum(II) organometallic complexes of perylene and perylene monoimide, with Pt Ïƒ-bonded directly to the perylene core. 3-Bromoperylene (BrPer) or N-(2,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)-9-bromo-perylene-3,4-dicarboximide (BrPMI) react with [Pt(PEt(3))(4)] to yield trans-[PtR(PEt(3))(2)Br] (R = Per, 1a R = PMI, 1b). Neutral and cationic perylenyl complexes containing a Pt(PEt(3))X group have been prepared from 1a,b by substitution of the Br ligand by a variety of other ligands (NCS, CN, NO(3), CN(t)Bu, PyMe). The X-ray structures of trans-[PtR(PEt(3))(2)X] (R = Per, X = NCS (2a)
