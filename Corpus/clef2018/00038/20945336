Imaging of apoptosis in the heart with nanoparticle technology. Apoptosis plays an important role in the loss of cardiomyocytes in both ischemic injury and heart failure. Pioneering work with single photon emission computed tomography imaging of (99)Tc-annexin showed that cell death in the heart could be imaged in vivo. Over the last 5 years a significant amount of experience with annexin-labeled magnetic nanoparticles, principally AnxCLIO-Cy5.5, has also been gained. Here, we review the experience with AnxCLIO-Cy5.5 in the heart and compare this experience to that of earlier studies with (99)Tc-annexin. The imaging of apoptosis with AnxCLIO-Cy5.5 provides valuable insights not only into molecular imaging in the heart but, more broadly, into the use of nanoparticle technology for molecular imaging in general.
