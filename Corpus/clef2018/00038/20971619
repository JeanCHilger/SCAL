Repetitive questioning behavior in Alzheimer's disease: relationship to regional cerebral blood flow. Repetitive questioning is among the most common and burdensome of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Regardless of the clinical significance of the repetitive questioning, the neural substrates involved remain unclear. Fifty-eight consecutive patients with AD participated in this study. The score of repetitive questioning behavior was evaluated by multiplying the severity by the frequency of the behavior. They underwent brain SPECT with (99m)Tc-ethylcysteinate dimer. Scores of repetitive questioning behavior had a significant positive correlation with regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the bilateral pericallosal regions. After removing the effect of memory test scores, we found a significant positive correlation of scores of repetitive questioning behavior to rCBF in the left pericallosal region. The pericallosal region includes the upper precuneus, cingulate, and posterior cingulate cortices on 3DSRT. Repetitive questioning behavior among AD patients might be a manifestation of mental state associated with a relative increase or preservation of rCBF in the left pericallosal region.
