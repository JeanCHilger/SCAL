Classifying human motion quality for knee osteoarthritis using accelerometers. In this paper, we describe methods for assessment of exercise quality using body-worn tri-axial accelerometers. We assess exercise quality by building a classifier that labels incorrect exercises. The incorrect performances are divided into a number of classes of errors as defined by a physical therapist. We focus on exercises commonly prescribed for knee osteoarthritis: standing hamstring curl, reverse hip abduction, and lying straight leg raise. The methods presented here will form the basis for an at-home rehabilitation device that will recognize errors in patient exercise performance, provide appropriate feedback on the performance, and motivate the patient to continue the prescribed regimen.
