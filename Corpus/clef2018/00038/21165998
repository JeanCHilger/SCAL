Role of FDG-PET staging in selecting the optimum patient for hepatic resection of metastatic colorectal cancer. Staging by FDG-PET of patients who are candidates for surgical treatment of colorectal metastases is an essential part of management of this problem. FDG-PET is highly sensitive and specific for intrahepatic colorectal tumors and the most sensitive test for extrahepatic tumors. FDG-PET alters management in 25% of patients, reducing futile laparotomies and hepatectomies.
