Clinical evaluation of ¹⁸F-FDG-SPECT/CT imaging in diagnosis and staging of patients with suspected lung cancer. Correct diagnosis is very important to patients with suspected lung cancer. According to the higher ¹⁸F-FDG intake of tumor tissues much more than normal tissues, this study evaluates the clinical value of ¹⁸F-FDG dual-head coincidence SPECT/CT in diagnosis of lung cancer.Sixty-one patients with lung mass underwent ¹⁸F-FDG dual-head coincidence SPECT/CT imaging and thoracic CT imaging before operation. These imageological results were compared with histological examination of lung mass.The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of ¹⁸F-FDG-SPECT/CT in differentiating malignant and benign lesions were 82%, 87%, 84%, respectively. Compared with thoracic CT imaging, diagnostic rate of mediastinal lymphatic metastasis was significantly higher by ¹⁸F-FDG-SPECT/CT (52% vs 81%, P < 0.05) .Combined functional-anatomical image of ¹⁸F-FDG-SPECT/CT has potential to improve staging and localizing procedures of lung cancer. It is an excellent modality in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of lung cancer.
