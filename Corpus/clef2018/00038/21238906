Diagnostic value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography in patients with fever of unknown origin. While fever of unknown origin (FUO) remains a challenging problem in clinical practice, fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has been considered helpful in diagnosing its cause. The present study is set to evaluate the diagnostic value of PET/CT for patients with FUO.We analyzed the records of 48 patients with FUO (34 men and 14 women mean age of 57-year-old with a range between 24- and 82-year-old). The patients were examined by (18)F-FDG PET/CT and the results were compared to a final diagnosis that was established by additional procedures.A final diagnosis was established for 36 patients (75%). Among them, 15 patients had infectious diseases, 12 patients had malignancies, and 9 patients had non-infectious inflammatory diseases. Thirty-two abnormal PET/CT results correctly revealed the source of fever (true-positives). Abnormal PET/CT results were considered false-positives for 8 patients without diagnoses. Normal PET/CT results in 4 patients with no diagnoses were classified as true-negatives. Four patients with normal PET/CT results with diagnosed cause for FUO were considered false-negatives. Therefore, PET/CT had a positive predictive value of 80%, a negative predictive value of 50%, a sensitivity of 89%, and a specificity of 33% in patients with FUO.Our study demonstrated that FDG-PET/CT is a valuable imaging tool for the identification of the etiology in patients with FUO. The results suggest that this procedure may be considered as a second-line test, especially when conventional structural imaging was normal or unable to distinguish lesions from benign and malignant.
