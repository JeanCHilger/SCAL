99mTc-OCTREOTIDE in patients with neuroendocrine tumors from the GI tract. It has been demonstrated that scintigraphy with somatostatin analogues is useful for the diagnosis, staging and follow up of patients with neuroendocrine tumors from the gastrointestinal tract (NET-GIT). Some studies suggest that the use of 99mTc-Hydrazinonicotinyl-Tyr3-octreotide (99mTc-HYNIC-TOC) yields similar diagnostic results than the use of 111In-DTPA-octreotide.To determine the clinical value of scintigraphy using 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC for the detection of primary and secondary lesions in patients with NET-GIT.From September 2004 to May 2009, 32 patients (17 women, age range 18 to 82 years old) with histologically proven or clinically suspected NET-GIT underwent scintigraphy using 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC Patients underwent a whole body scan, with additional static images of abdomen and pelvis, followed by SPECT at 4-hrs post injection of 925 MBq of the tracer. Patients underwent clinical, imaging and histopathology follow-up during 3 to 18 months.Histopathology demonstrated carcinoid tumor in 20 patients, insulinoma in 2, gastrinoma in 2 and non-specific NET-GIT in 6. Total sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were 87%, 100%, 100%, 89% and 94%, respectively. To detect the primary lesion, the values were 94%, 100% 100%, 94% and 97%, respectively and to detect secondary lesions, 79%, 100%, 100%, 86% and 91%, respectively.99mTc-HYNIC-TOC is a specific somatostatin analog, with high affinity to receptor subtype SST-2, widely available and affordable by Latin American countries. It has a good performance to be used for diagnosis, staging and follow-up of patients with NET-GIT.
