FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography and standardized uptake value in the primary diagnosis and staging of hilar cholangiocarcinoma. The diagnosis and staging of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA) remain challenging despite recent advances in imaging. Little is known about the use of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in HCCA.This study aimed to evaluate the additional value of FDG-PET/CT and standardized uptake value (SUV) in patients with highly suspected HCCA.Between February 2006 and August 2009, PET/CT was performed in 30 patients with highly suspected HCCA, all of whom were deemed resectable by conventional staging methods, including laparoscopy. The results of PET-CT and SUV were compared with intraoperative and histopathological findings.The primary tumour was (18) F-FDG-positive in 88% of patients. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of regional lymph node metastases and distant metastases were 67% and 68%, and 33% and 96%, respectively. The median SUV in the primary tumour was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in patients with (mean: 8.9) than without (mean: 6.1) distant metastases. The SUV in patients with benign disease (n= 4) showed a trend towards lower values than in patients with cholangiocarcinoma, although this was not significant.After conventional staging including diagnostic laparoscopy, the additional value of PET/CT is limited. This somewhat disappointing finding may reflect the fact that extensive staging studies were carried out prior to PET/CT. The SUV potentially predicts patients with distant metastases and may differentiate between HCCA and benign lesions that mimic malignancies.
