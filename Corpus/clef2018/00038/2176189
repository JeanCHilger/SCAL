Synthesis of 4-[18F]fluoro-L-m-tyrosine: a model analog for the in vivo assessment of central dopaminergic function. 4-[18F]Fluoro-L-m-tyrosine (6), a new analog of L-dopa for probing the presynaptic dopaminergic system by positron emission tomography has been synthesized in good radiochemical yields via the regioselective fluorodemercuration of the 4-mercurio derivatives 4a and 4b with 18F-labeled acetylhypofluorite. The chemical, radiochemical and enantiomeric purities were determined to be greater than 99%. The key step in the synthesis of the precursors 4 was the mercuration of the protected L-m-tyrosine 3. The position of mercuration on the aromatic ring was gleaned from the 13C-NMR spectral data. The non-radiolabeled counterpart of 6 was also synthesized. Structural analyses of all these compounds were carried out by 1H-, 13C-, 19F-NMR and mass spectroscopy.
