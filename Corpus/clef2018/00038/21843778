Distribution of adoptively transferred porcine T-lymphoblasts tracked by (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and position emission tomography. Autologous or allogeneic transfer of tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes is a promising treatment for metastatic cancers, but a major concern is the difficulty in evaluating cell trafficking and distribution in adoptive cell therapy. This study presents a method of tracking transfusion of T-lymphoblasts in a porcine model by (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) and positron emission tomography.T-lymphoblasts were labeled with the positron-emitting tracer [(18)F]FDG through incubation. The T-lymphoblasts were administered into the bloodstream, and the distribution was followed by positron emission tomography for 120 min. The cells were administered either intravenously into the internal jugular vein (n=5) or intraarterially into the ascending aorta (n=1). Two of the pigs given intravenous administration were pretreated with low-molecular-weight dextran sulphate.The cellular kinetics and distribution were readily quantifiable for up to 120 min. High (78.6% of the administered cells) heterogeneous pulmonary uptake was found after completed intravenous transfusion. The pulmonary uptake was decreased either by preincubating and coadministrating the T-lymphoblasts with low-molecular-weight dextran sulphate or by administrating them intraarterially.The present work shows the feasibility of quantitatively monitoring and evaluating cell trafficking and distribution following administration of [(18)F]FDG-labeled T-lymphoblasts. The protocol can potentially be transferred to the clinical setting with few modifications.
