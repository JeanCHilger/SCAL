Surveys of avian practitioners and pet owners regarding common behavior problems in psittacine birds. Avian veterinarians and pet bird owners were solicited to participate in online surveys to gather information about behavior problems in pet birds. A total of 84 avian veterinarians' and 203 psittacine bird owners' responses were analyzed. Behaviors with a high prevalence and a high level of owner concern, in descending order, were aggression, screaming, and feather picking. Veterinarians reported that the most common behavior problems presented to them were feather picking, chronic egg laying, aggression, and screaming, in that order. Most owners seeking advice went elsewhere before talking to their veterinarian. When consulted, most veterinarians recommended a combination of a medical workup, nutritional changes, housing changes, and environmental enrichments for these problem behaviors. Because owners do not often seek a veterinarian's advice, behavior problems exist in birds that are not being addressed by veterinarians. Advising veterinarians to question owners about problem behaviors at every visit will facilitate discussion and improve the treatment and welfare of pet psittacine birds.
