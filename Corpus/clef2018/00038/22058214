Plasma thymus and activation-regulated chemokine as an early response marker in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. Plasma thymus and activation-regulated chemokine is a potential biomarker for classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. To define its value as a marker to monitor treatment response, we correlated serial plasma thymus and activation-regulated chemokine levels with clinical response in newly diagnosed and relapsed classical Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.Plasma was collected from 60 (39 early stage and 21 advanced stage) newly diagnosed classical Hodgkin's lymphoma patients before, during, and after treatment, and from 12 relapsed patients before and after treatment. Plasma thymus and activation-regulated chemokine levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and were related to pre-treatment metabolic tumor volume, as measured by quantification of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography images, and to treatment response.Baseline plasma thymus and activation-regulated chemokine levels correlated with stage of disease and bulky disease, and more closely with metabolic tumor volume. Response to treatment was observed among 38 of 39 early stage and 19 of 21 advanced stage patients. Reduction in plasma thymus and activation-regulated chemokine to normal range levels could be observed as early as after one cycle of chemotherapy in all responsive patients, while plasma levels remained elevated during and after treatment in the 3 non-responsive patients. Plasma thymus and activation-regulated chemokine was elevated in all 12 relapsed patients at time of relapse and remained elevated after salvage treatment in the 4 non-responsive patients.Baseline plasma thymus and activation-regulated chemokine levels correlate with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma tumor burden and serial levels correlate with response to treatment in patients with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.
