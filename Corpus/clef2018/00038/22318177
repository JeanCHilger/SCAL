Imaging diagnosis for prostate cancer biochemical recurrence after radical treatment. The recent development in the imaging diagnostic techniques have improved the diagnosis of prostate cancer recurrence, mainly if it is local. Nowadays, the use of MRI based  morphologic and functional techniques has a better sensitivity for the diagnosis of local recurrence. Integration of MR imaging data with ultrasound guided transrectal biopsies has improved the accuracy in the diagnosis of local recurrence of the disease. However, there is a need for new or better methods that enable the detection of secondary systemic disease, the conventional methods being (CT and bone scintigraphy)  insufficiently sensitive. Nowadays the PET-CT is the most promising technique, for which the use of new radio-pharmaceuticals (on experimental  phases) would allow the  diagnosis of systemic disease more accurately. The combined and complimentary use of the different imaging techniques available, will permit to diagnose relapsing disease earlier and better, setting the field up  for more adequate treatments, reducing morbility and giving the opportunity to offer local, less aggressive treatments.
