Hypoxia assessed by 18F-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography in newly diagnosed gliomas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the degree of hypoxia in newly diagnosed gliomas using 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET and to compare the results with tumor grade.A total of 30 patients with newly diagnosed gliomas were examined using FMISO PET. Grading of the tumor was performed according to the WHO classification. The FMISO PET images were scaled to the venous blood concentration of FMISO activity to produce tumor-to-blood (T/B) values. Hypoxia was defined as a region with a T/B ratio of at least 1.2, and the maximum T/B (T/Bmax) value was calculated by region-of-interest analysis.There was a correlation between FMISO uptake and glioma grade, with all low-grade gliomas (grades I and II) demonstrating no hypoxia and all high-grade gliomas (grades III and IV) showing hypoxia. The mean T/Bmax in grade IV gliomas was significantly higher than that in grade III gliomas (P<0.02).FMISO PET is a potential tracer in the assessment of noninvasive tumor grading in newly diagnosed gliomas.
