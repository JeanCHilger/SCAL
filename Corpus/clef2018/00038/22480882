Association between contamination of public squares and seropositivity for Toxocara spp. in children. A concomitant study was carried out, of the association of positive serology for Toxocara spp. in 90 children who played in public squares used for leisure, with the frequency with which each child used these areas, and the presence of eggs of Toxocara spp. in the sand or grass in these locations. The sand and grass of their peridomiciles and school playgrounds, as well as the feces of their dogs were also analyzed for Toxocara. Serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies to Toxocara canis excreted-secreted larval antigens by ELISA, and blood samples for eosinophilia. The water-sedimentation technique was used to evaluate the presence of parasite eggs in the sand and grass turfs, and in feces of the dogs that also frequented these locations. 16/90 (17.8%) of the children were seropositive for Toxocara spp. There was a positive association between seropositivity in children who played in the public squares six or seven times a week, with a parasite load above 1.1 eggs/g of sand, as well as with contamination of the peridomicile, even at less than 1.0 egg/g of sand. Eosinophilia, the habit of geophagy, age from one to four years, and the presence of parasitized pet dogs were also positively correlated with seropositivity in the children. Eggs were found in 15/15 (100%) of the public squares, 17/90 (18.9%) of the peridomiciles, 3/13 (23.1%) of the schools, and 12/41 (29.3%) of the dogs living in the peridomiciles investigated.
