The diagnostic and prognostic value of ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT in the initial assessment of high-grade bone and soft tissue sarcoma. A retrospective study of 89 patients. To evaluate the feasibility of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for initial assessment in high-grade bone sarcomas (BS) and soft tissue sarcomas (STS).During the years 2001-2010, 89 patients (30 BS, 59 STS) referred for further evaluation and surgical treatment of a high-grade BS or STS also had a PET/CT scan performed for staging preoperatively (n = 68) or within 1 month of surgery (n = 21). Metastatic lesions suggested on the PET/CT scan were confirmed or rejected by histological evaluation, by additional imaging or by follow-up. In 68 patients (28 BS, 40 STS) the relationship between the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the primary tumour and survival was examined.The PET/CT scan suggested the presence of 13 metastatic lesions in BS patients (5 lymph node, 8 distant) and 21 metastatic lesions (6 lymph node, 15 distant) in STS patients. The calculated sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) were 95 % and 96 % for detection of distant metastases, and the predictive value (PV) of a positive or a negative test was 87 % and 98 %, respectively. SE and SP were 100 % and 90 % for detection of lymph node metastases, and the PV of a positive or a negative test was 27 % and 100 %, respectively. The 5-year survival was 81 % among patients with SUVmax below the median value (≤ 10), but was 33 % among those with SUVmax >10.FDG PET/CT for the initial assessment of patients with high-grade BS or STS was feasible with high SE and SP, but in those with lymph node metastases the PV of a positive test was low. The SUVmax of the primary tumour was a strong prognostic factor for survival.
