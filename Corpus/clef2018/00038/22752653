Automated radiosynthesis of [(18)F]ML-10, a PET radiotracer dedicated to apoptosis imaging, on a TRACERLab FX-FN module. [(18)F]ML-10 is the most advanced radiopharmaceutical for the clinical imaging of the apoptosis phenomenon by PET. The preparation of this radiopharmaceutical on a commercial radiosynthesis module and the requested quality controls for its release are presented herein.ML-10 as reference and its mesyloxy derivative as precursor for labelling with fluorine-18 were prepared. [(18)F]ML-10 was synthesized via a [(18)F]fluorine-de-mesyloxy aliphatic nucleophilic substitution via a GE TRACERLab® FX-FN module. Quality controls were performed.The labelling precursor was obtained in a four step synthesis in 28 % overall yield affording ML-10 in two steps (88 % yield). Pure [(18)F]ML-10 was obtained with a decay corrected yield of 39.8 % ± 8.4 % (n = 7) in 70 min and a specific activity of 235 ± 85 GBq/μmol at the end of synthesis.[(18)F]ML-10 was prepared on a widely available automated module and passed the quality control. A LC/MS method was developed to measure specific radioactivity.
