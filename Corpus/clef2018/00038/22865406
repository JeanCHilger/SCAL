Impact of Ga-68 DOTATOC PET/CT on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia. To evaluate the impact of Ga-68 DOTATOC PET/CT on diagnosis and therapeutic management of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN).We did 28 Ga-68 DOTATOC PET/CT in 21 MEN patients (10 female, 11 men mean age 41.3 years). 109 lesions detected were classified into MEN-associated lesions [i.e., neuroendocrine tumors (NET)] and non-MEN-associated lesions for PET, CT, and PET/CT. The impact of Ga-68 DOTATOC PET/CT on diagnosis and therapeutic management of patients with MEN were assessed by the records of the interdisciplinary NET tumor board including histopathological findings, clinical and radiological follow-up.Ga-68 DOTATOC PET/CT had an impact on diagnosis and therapeutic management in 10/21 (47.6%) MEN patients. For detecting NET lesions in MEN patients Ga-68 DOTATOC PET/CT reached a sensitivity/specificity of 91.7%/93.5%. There was a significant difference for the detection rate between Ga-68 DOTATOC PET/CT and CT alone (p < 0.001) both using contrast-agent (p = 0.002) or not (p < 0.001) and also a significant difference between contrast-enhanced (CE-) CT and non-CE-CT alone (p = 0.006).GA-68 DOTATOC PET/CT allows a high detection rate of NET lesions in the context of MEN-1 syndrome as well as influence therapeutic management in nearly up to half of the patients. GA-68 DOTATOC PET/CT should include a CE-CT to improve MEN-associated NET lesion detection.
