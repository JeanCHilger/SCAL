Tracing nanoparticles in vivo: a new general synthesis of positron emitting metal oxide nanoparticles by proton beam activation. The synthesis of (18)F-labelled positron emitting NPs by direct irradiation of (18)O-enriched aluminum oxide NPs with 16 MeV protons is reported. Biodistribution studies of the labelled particles after intravenous administration were performed in male rats using positron emission tomography. The simple and general activation strategy can be applied to any in situ prepared core metal oxide particle for direct use or subsequent bio-compatible coating or encapsulation followed by functionalization.
