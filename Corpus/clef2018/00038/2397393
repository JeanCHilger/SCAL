Effects of anterior corpus callosum section on cortical glucose utilization in baboons. A sequential positron emission tomography study. Cortical glucose utilization was measured under light anaesthesia using positron emission tomography and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose before and serially after stereotaxic anterior corpus callosum section in 3 adult baboons (Papio papio) in 1 animal needles were introduced but callosotomy was not performed ('sham' operation). Lesion efficacy was verified by x-ray computerized tomography and by postmortem examination which indicated effective anterior two-thirds callosal section in all 3 baboons, as well as a small contusional area in the medial frontal cortex. A two-way layout analysis of variance performed on the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGlc) data obtained in the frontotemporal, temporal and occipital areas revealed significant effects for both the time and the region factors (P less than 0.00001 for each)
