Effect of nitroglycerin on cerebral circulation measured by transcranial Doppler and SPECT. We used a combination of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and single-photon emission computed tomography to noninvasively assess changes in the diameter of the middle cerebral artery induced by sublingual nitroglycerin in 10 healthy subjects. Nitroglycerin reduced mean blood flow velocities without concurrently changing regional cerebral blood flow in the perfusion territory of this vessel. Our results strongly suggest that nitroglycerin causes vasodilatation of the basal intracranial arteries.
