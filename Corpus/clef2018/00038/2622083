Separate evaluation of beta-methyl fatty acid uptake and perfusion in rat myocardium. The kinetics and distribution of I-125 beta-methyl iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) in rat's heart were studied for separate evaluation of perfusion and metabolism. Tl-201 and BMIPP were simultaneously injected. The experimental groups consisted of control (C), glucose (G) and sodium lactate loaded group (L). In C, myocardial uptake at 5 minutes after BMIPP injection was 3.60% ID/g and remained constant up to 60 minutes. The myocardium/lung ratio (2.44) and the myocardium/muscle ratio (4.55) of BMIPP were almost equal to those of Tl-201. But myocardium/liver ratio was low (1.31). In G, myocardial uptake of BMIPP (1.94 +/- 0.36% ID/g) and g-BMIPP/Tl (0.31 +/- 0.03) at 15 minutes after injection were significantly decreased (p less than 0.001) than those of C (3.16 +/- 0.18% ID/g and 0.48 +/- 0.05). In L. myocardial perfusion was decreased and g-BMIPP/Tl (0.73 +/- 0.14) was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than those of C. Coefficient of variance of the density within a myocardium, and the ratio of inner to outer layer of myocardium (I/O ratio) were calculated from autoradiogram by videodensitometry. The myocardial distribution of BMIPP was more inhomogeneous, and the I/O ratio was lower than that of Tl-201, although these were not specific for metabolic interventions. In conclusion BMIPP is suitable for SPECT imaging and dual nuclide imaging by BMIPP and Tl-201 will provide informations about myocardial fatty acid metabolism and perfusion.
