Polar presentation of coronary angiography and thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography. A method for comparing anatomic and pathologic findings in coronary angiography with isotope distribution in thallium-201 myocardial SPECT. Individual results of coronary angiography were compared with tomographic myocardial scintigraphy (SPECT) in 99 patients. Coronary angiography findings were transferred to polar maps. Borders between arteries were assigned angles in a coordinate system constructed as a compass-rose. Areas perfused by different arteries were described by sectors. Findings were visually compared with the perfusion defects in a polar presentation of thallium-201 SPECT also described by angles. The mean values and SD for the angles representing arterial borders and perfusion defects were presented. The left ventricular myocardium was perfused by 3 coronary arteries in 92/99 patients. Dominant left artery was present in 7/99 patients 79 perfusion defects were related to 118 arterial sectors 84 per cent had totally or partially matched stenotic arteries. Inter-individual differences in distribution of coronary arteries influence the localization of perfusion defects in myocardial SPECT and can be estimated with this polar presentation method.
