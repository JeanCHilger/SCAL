A geriatric program in practice. The geriatric patient represents an underutilized resource for the small animal practitioner. Thorough examination of the pet annually in detail allows detecting problems before they are too advanced. By using the systems approach to patient evaluation, one is better able to detect diseases and proceed with techniques to diagnose them. The use of in-house hematology and serum chemistry equipment benefits the pet and owner through rapid return of information and provides an added source of revenue for the practitioner. Developing and maintaining a system to reevaluate the geriatric patient is one of the most important aspects of a geriatric practice. Reminding clients that you care about their pet through routine scheduled evaluations develops loyal clients, which in turn generates additional hospital income.
