Long-term performance of a multiplanar positron emission tomograph. A protocol for the daily quality assurance (QA) of a multiplanar positron emission tomographic (PET) system was developed. This was implemented on a daily basis for the PC 4600 Neuro-PET, a multiplanar PET system designed for quantitative brain imaging. Sensitivity data collected as part of the protocol are presented for a 22-mo time period. These data show the need to periodically monitor instrument performance if meaningful quantitation is to be achieved. The methods presented have direct application to any quantitative multiplanar emission tomographic imaging program.
