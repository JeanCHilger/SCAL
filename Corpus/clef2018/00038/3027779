Semiquantitative SPECT of anterior dislocation of the temporomandibular joint disk. SPECT examination of the TMJ using 99m Tc-MDP was performed in 43 patients with arthrographically proven anterior dislocation of the disc and in 30 normals. The results were evaluated visually and also in a semi-quantitative manner that took account of relative 99m Tc activity in the TMJ and of the age of the patient. In the presence of arthrographically proven anterior, but reversible, disc dislocation, the semi-quantitative method proved positive in 75% of cases (28 cases). In joints with fixed anterior dislocation (29 cases), bone changes were demonstrated in 86%. Visual evaluation was positive in 50% of reversible, and in 72% of non-reversible dislocations. Semi-quantitative SPECT of the TMJ is excellent for demonstrating bone reaction resulting from TMJ dysfunction and for indicating the severity of the joint abnormality.
