Regional correction of positron emission tomography data for the effects of cerebral atrophy. Given the low spatial resolution of positron emission tomography (PET), regional measurements of neural tissue are often inaccurate because of the presence of non-neural elements and to mixtures of different tissue types within the volume of space influencing the measurements. These effects are significant in scans of brains both with and without atrophy, but are particularly significant when comparing measurements of brains with atrophy with those of normals, as is typically done in studies of aging and dementia. Previous attempts to correct for cerebral atrophy have been limited to global measurements. Using computer simulations, we illustrate the effects of atrophy and describe a method for correcting regional PET data to represent units of actual neural tissue volume.
