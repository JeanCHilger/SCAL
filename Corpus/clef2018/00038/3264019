Normal SPECT thallium-201 bull's-eye display: gender differences. The bull's-eye technique synthesizes three-dimensional information from single photon emission computed tomographic 201TI images into two dimensions so that a patient's data can be compared quantitatively against a normal file. To characterize the normal database and to clarify differences between males and females, clinical data and exercise electrocardiography were used to identify 50 males and 50 females with less than 5% probability of coronary artery disease. Results show inhomogeneity of the 201TI distributions at stress and delay: septal to lateral wall count ratios are less than 1.0 in both females and males anterior to inferior wall count ratios are greater than 1.0 in males but are approximately equal to 1.0 in females. Washout rate is faster in females than males at the same peak exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure, despite lower exercise time. These important differences suggest that quantitative analysis of single photon emission computed tomographic 201TI images requires gender-matched normal files.
