Aphasia and neglect after subcortical stroke. A clinical/cerebral perfusion correlation study. Sixteen patients with unilateral subcortical haemorrhagic or ischaemic stroke, confirmed by CT, were evaluated for the presence of aphasia and neglect. Compared with patients without neuropsychological deficits, left brain-damaged aphasic and right brain-damaged neglect patients showed a significantly greater reduction of cortical perfusion on N,N,N1-trimethyl-N1-(2)-hydroxy-3-methyl-5-(I-123) iodobenzyl-1,3-propanediamine 2 HCl I-123 (HIPDM) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). These results suggest that major cortical derangement is the crucial factor for the appearance of aphasia or neglect after a subcortical stroke. These remote effects, which are related to the size of the subcortical lesion, are interpreted in terms of interruption of neural connections (diaschisis).
