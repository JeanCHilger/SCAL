An optimized collimator for single-photon computed tomography with a scintillation camera. The problem of nonuniform response, which is inherent in scintillationcamera emission computed tomography, can be minimized by proper collimator design. A specially fabricated collimator, optimized for emission computed tomography, was designed. This collimator has a calculated full width at half maximum of 1 cm at 15 cm in front of the collimator. When this collimator is used in conjunction with averaged opposed views, excellent uniformity across the reconstruction plane is achievable.
