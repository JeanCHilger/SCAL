Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging has reached the point at which it is clear that such images will have a definite role in clinical practice. This article reviews the basic physical principles of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, its current uses in disorders of the central nervous system, and its potential future applications in this field. The technique is also compared with computed tomography and positron emission tomography. Because nuclear magnetic resonance imaging is still in its infancy and its potential is great, definitive statements on present clinical use are difficult. Continual change and expansion of the role of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging in clinical practice in the next few years should be the rule.
