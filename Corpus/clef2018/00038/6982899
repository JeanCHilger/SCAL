A positron emission tomograph to study brain metabolism in man. The construction of a single ring positron emission tomograph with which to examine the brain is described. The ring comprises 160 bismuth germanate detectors that are not separated from each other by high Z septa. The thickness of the slice examined is 2 cm and the inherent resolution is 7 mm in the plane. The performance of the tomograph and representative clinical studies are illustrated.
