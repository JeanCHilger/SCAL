A new dual-isotope convolution cross-talk correction method: a Tl-201/Tc-99m SPECT cardiac phantom study. Simultaneous dual-isotope SPECT imaging provides a clear advantage in situations where two concurrent metabolic, anatomic, or background measurements are desired. It obviates the need for two separate imaging sessions, reduces patient motion problems, and provides exact image registration between images. However, a potential limitation of dual-isotope SPECT imaging is contribution of scattered and primary photons from one radionuclide into the second radionuclide's photopeak energy window, referred to here as cross-talk. Cross-talk in both photopeak energy windows can significantly degrade image quality, resolution, and quantitation to an unacceptable level. Simple cross-talk correction method used in dual-radionuclide in vitro counting, even applied on a pixel-by-pixel basis, does not account for the differences in spatial distribution of the photopeak and cross-talk photons. Here a new convolution cross-talk correction method is presented. The convolution filters are derived from point response functions (PRFs) for Tc-99m and Tl-201 point sources. Three separate acquisitions were performed, each with two 20% wide energy windows, one centered at 140 keV and another at 70 keV. The first acquisition was done with Tc-99m solution only, the second with Tl-201 solution only, and the third with a mixture of Tc-99m and Tl-201. The nonuniform RH-2 thorax-heart phantom was used to test a new correction technique. The main difficulty and limitation of the convolution correction approach is caused by the variation in PRF as a function of depth. Thus, average PRF should be used in the creation of an approximative filter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
