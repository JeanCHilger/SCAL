Regional sympathetic denervation detected by iodine 123 metaiodobenzylguanidine in non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and unstable angina. Previous studies have revealed that the sympathetic nervous system is more vulnerable to ischemia than the myocardium itself. Thus our study was undertaken to detect denervated myocardium in non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) and unstable angina with iodine 123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG), which can delineate myocardial sympathetic innervation. Eight patients with non-Q-wave MI and 12 with unstable angina were studied. Sequential 123I-MIBG and thallium-201 chloride (201TlCl) imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were performed at rest 24 +/- 12 days after the last ischemic attack. Myocardial perfusion defect was not detected by 201TlCl in 4 of 8 patients with non-Q-wave MI, whereas 123I-MIBG SPECT imaging revealed defects corresponding to myocardial ischemic areas predicted by coronary angiography in all 8 patients. 123I-MIBG imaging revealed defects in 7 of 12 patients with unstable angina corresponding to coronary angiographic findings, whereas no myocardial perfusion defect was detected by 201TlCl imaging in any of them. In conclusion, 123I-MIBG SPECT is a sensitive method for detecting myocardium exposed to transient ischemia that cannot be detected by 201TlCl imaging.
