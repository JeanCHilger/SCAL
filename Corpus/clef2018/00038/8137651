Comparison of dipyridamole Tc-99m myocardial imaging with dipyridamole electrocardiogram in detecting coronary artery disease. The authors compared the results of dipyridamole myocardial-SPECT (D-ECT) with dipyridamole electrocardiogram (D-ECG) in detecting coronary artery disease (CAD). According to the result of coronary artery angiogram. We analysed the results of D-ECT and D-ECG in 62 patients. In detecting CAD, the sensitivity and specificity of D-ECT were 89%, and 92%, while those of D-ECG were 54% and 76% respectively. In detecting single double, triple vessel diseases, the sensitivity of D-ECT was 76%, 100% and 100% respectively. The sensitivity of D-ECG was 35%, 73% and 67% respectively. In identifying left anterior descending, left circumflex and right coronary artery, the sensitivity of D-ECT was 73%, 80% and 80% respectively, while that of D-ECG was 54%, 20% and 25% respectively. The results showed that D-ECT was better than D-ECG in diagnosing CAD.
