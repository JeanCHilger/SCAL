Dynamic indium-111-pentetreotide scintigraphy in breast cancer. The efficacy of imaging breast cancer with 111In-pentetreotide (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy) was evaluate before surgery.Seventy-one whole-body scintigrams in 24 patients with known breast cancer and 24 whole-body scintigrams in 8 controls were obtained at 0.5, 5 and 24 hr after intravenous injection of 110 MBq 111In-pentetreotide. Anterior and posterior projection images were acquired simultaneously. SPECT of the thorax was performed at 5 or 24 hr after injection in all breast cancer patients. The specimens were imaged immediately after surgery and the distribution of pentetreotide was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively.Somatostatin receptor-positive tumors were found in 18/24 patients with breast cancer. Pentetreotide uptake was significantly greater in breast cancer patients compared to control patients. In all patients with positive images, the early scintigram (0.5 hr) showed abnormal uptake. It was possible to delineate three different dynamic patterns. Increased uptake was visually most distinct at each time (9 patients). Moreover, bilaterally increased pentetreotide uptake was observed in 10/18 true-positive patients (in 8 at each time and in 2 patients only at 5 hr), but only one patient had a known bilateral tumor.We found higher incidence of somatostatin receptors in patients with breast cancer than in the control group. Moreover, bilaterally increased pentetreotide uptake in clinically unilateral disease was an unexpected finding.
