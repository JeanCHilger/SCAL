In vivo trafficking of long-circulating liposomes in tumour-bearing mice determined by positron emission tomography. Various kinds of long-circulating liposome, such as ganglioside GM1-, polyethyleneglycol- (PEG-), and glucuronide-modified liposomes, have been developed for passive targeting of liposomal drugs to tumours. To evaluate the in vivo behaviour of such long-circulating liposomes, we investigated the liposomal trafficking, especially early trafficking just after injection of liposomes, by a non-invasive method using positron emission tomography (PET). Liposomes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and modifier, namely, GM1, distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG or palmityl-D-glucuronide (PGlcUA), were labelled with [2-18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([2-18F]FDG), and administered to mice bearing Meth A sarcoma after having been sized to 100 nm. A PET scan was started immediately after injection of liposomes and continued for 120 min. PET images and time-activity curves indicated that PEG liposomes and PGlcUA liposomes were efficiently accumulated in tumour tissues time dependently from immediately after injection. In contrast, GM1 liposomes accumulated less in the tumour as was also the case for control liposomes that contained dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) instead of a modifier. Long-circulating liposomes including GM1 liposomes, however, remained in the blood circulation and avoided liver trapping compared with control DPPG liposomes. These data suggest that PGlcUA and PEG liposomes start to accumulate in the tumour just after injection, whereas GM1 liposomes may accumulate in the tumour after a longer period of circulation.
