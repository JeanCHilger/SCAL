Prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases in Turkish university students in Ankara. An epidemiological study was performed in the students of Hacettepe University from various parts of Turkey to find the prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases and search for geographical differences in Turkey. A questionnaire related with symptoms of asthma and allergic diseases was distributed to 4600 students and filled by 4331 students (1884 males, 43.5%-2447 females, 56.5%). Periodic prevalence of asthma or allergic disease during the last 12 months was 13.5%. The prevalence of awakening with chest tightness and/or feeling of retrosternal pressure in the last month was 2%. The current prevalences of the seasonal and perennial rhinoconjunctivitis, flexural eczema, food and drug intolerances, pollen and pet animal hypersensitivities were 6.4%, 1.6%, 0.8%, 4.5%, 3%, 5.2%, and 1% respectively. Drug, food, and pollen hypersensitivities were distinctively more common in the females, whereas wheezing was more common in males. Wheezing, wheezing associated shortness of breath, nocturnal asthma for the last 1 and 12 months were more common in the students from eastern region than those from western region. The highest asthmatic attack rate was reported in the eastern region. Seasonal rhinitis and pollen allergy were more prevalent in central region than northern region. No significant geographical difference was observed regarding the drug and pet hypersensitivities. Our study has shown the importance of asthma and allergic diseases as a public health problem. Explanation of the observed geographical differences aware for further studies.
