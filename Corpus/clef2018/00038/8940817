Normal distribution of CBF with advancing age measured by HMPAO SPECT. SPECT with Tc-99m HMPAO was used to determine global and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 52 healthy subjects ranging from 2 to 85 years old. These subjects were divided into six groups according to age. SPECT images were obtained using a three-headed gamma camera system equipped with low-energy ultra-high-resolution fan beam collimators (LEUHR-FAN). Absolute CBF values were estimated in 21 of 52 subjects using a Patlak plot technique. The SPECT images were obtained 5-10 minutes after the injection of 740MBq of Tc-99m HMPAO. A supercomputer system was used to reconstruct transverse section images at levels of 8, 32, 44 and 67 mm above the orbitomeatal line (2.7 mm thickness), and oblique transverse section images parallel to the temporal lobe (1.56 mm thickness). Lassen's linearization correction was applied. The average counts of four or five ROIs in eight regions were calculated. The cerebral to cerebellar activity ratio (C/C ratio) was estimated by dividing counts in the cerebral regions by those in the cerebellum. The interhemispheric differences in C/C ratios in the eight regions of all the groups were not significant. In elderly subjects there was a tendency for C/C ratios to decrease except in the thalamus and basal ganglia. Mean global CBF in 21 of 52 subjects was 49.3 +/- 10 ml/100g/min. A significant negative correlation was found between global CBF and advancing age (p < 0.05), particularly in males (p < 0.01).
