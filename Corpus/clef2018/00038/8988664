Validation and clinical application of computer-combined computed tomography and positron emission tomography with 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose head and neck images. Positron emission tomography with 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (PET-FDG) improves the detection of head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), but lacks anatomical detail. The accuracy of registered computed tomography/magnetic resonance (CT/MR) and PET-FDG in delineation of HNSCC at the primary site and its clinical application was investigated.Preoperatively 30 patients were staged clinically and each had either CT (23), MR (5), or both CT and MR (2) scans, as well as CT/MR-PET-FDG registration. Tumor margins or infiltration of specific anatomical landmarks on the different scans were compared and judged against histology.For primary tumors CT-PET-FDG (97%) and MR-PET-FDG (100%) delineated the tumor more accurately than CT (69%) or MR (40%) alone. Similarly, CT-PET-FDG (98%) and MR-PET-FDG (100%) were better than CT (70%) and MR alone (80%) in identifying tumor invasion of specific anatomical structures. Management was altered in 7 of 30 patients. The registered images were particularly useful in delineating tumor extension in the infratemporal fossa, maxilla and mandible, and identifying recurrences obscured by scar tissue.It is possible to accurately register CT, MR, and PET-FDG data sets in the head and neck. The initial results show that registered CT/ MR-PET-FDG images provide additional clinically relevant information over that obtained from clinical evaluation or conventional CT/MR imaging.
