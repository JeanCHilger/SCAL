Is 'diaphragmatic' attenuation a misnomer?. Evaluation of the anatomic cause of 'diaphragmatic' attenuation in SPECT thallium scanning. The most common artifact on thallium scans in our laboratory has been posterior myocardial attenuation, mostly in males. In the past this has been thought due to the position of the diaphragm.To evaluate this concept, matching chest x-rays were examined and measured. Eleven examples of posterior myocardial attenuation were consecutively pulled from our files and compared to eleven consecutive controls.It was found that the diaphragm did not differ significantly. The ratio of the PA diameter of the chest to chest width was significantly (p < 0.03) less than controls.It is suggested that a male with a flat, wide chest is more prone to posterior myocardial attenuation. If a posterior defect is present in this type of patient it is suggested he be further evaluated to rule out artifact.
