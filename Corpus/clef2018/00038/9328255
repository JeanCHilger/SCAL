PET and SPECT in whiplash syndrome: a new approach to a forgotten brain? Whiplash associated disorders are a medicolegally controversial condition becoming increasingly worrisome in the western world. This study was designed to evaluate perfusion and glucose metabolism in whiplash brain. Using Tc-99m-bicisate (ECD) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, six clinically and neuropsychologically controlled patients (patient group) with whiplash syndrome and 12 normal controls (control group) were investigated. Standardised elliptical regions of interest (ROIs) were determined in three adjacent transaxial slices in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and parieto-occipital cortex, cerebellum, brain stem, basal ganglia, and thalamus. For PET, the glucose metabolic index (GMI =ROI uptake/global uptake at the level of the basal ganglia) and, for SPECT, the perfusion index (PI
