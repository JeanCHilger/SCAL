Comparison of S-T segment/heart rate slope with exercise thallium imaging and conventional S-T segment criteria in detecting coronary artery disease: effect of exercise level on accuracy. The S-T segment/heart rate (ST/HR) slope has been proposed as a more accurate electrocardiographic criterion for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, but studies comparing the diagnostic value of the ST/HR slope with exercise thallium imaging are scant. The aims of this study were to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the ST/HR slope, conventional S-T segment criteria and exercise thallium imaging in detecting coronary artery disease and to evaluate the effect of exercise level on the sensitivity and specificity of these three techniques. Ninety consecutive patients underwent treadmill testing and exercise thallium single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) simultaneously. All 90 patients also underwent coronary angiography within 1 month of the exercise test. We found that exercise thallium SPECT had a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than either the ST/HT slope or conventional S-T segment criteria (thallium imaging 82%, ST/HR slope 67%, conventional S-T segment criteria 63%). The overall accuracy of the ST/HR slope was slightly but insignificantly greater than conventional S-T segment criteria (ST/HR slope 67%, conventional S-T segment criteria 63% p = 0.639). In 50 patients with a lower exercise level, defined as not achieving 85% of their maximal predicted heart rate, the accuracy of the ST/HR slope was insignificantly greater (ST/HR slope 72%, conventional S-T segment criteria 66%
