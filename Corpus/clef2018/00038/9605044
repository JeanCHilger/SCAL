Predictive value of planar 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose imaging for cardiac events in patients after acute myocardial infarction. This long-term study examines the predictive value of planar myocardial 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) imaging for cardiac events after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). From December 1989 to April 1991, 59 consecutive patients with AMI had undergone planar rest thallium-201 (Tl-201)/FDG imaging for viability assessment 53 (42 men) were included in this study. Mean follow-up was 47 +/- 15 months. Cardiac events were defined as cardiac-related death, reinfarction, late revascularization, and unstable angina pectoris. A mismatch pattern was defined as a FDG uptake exceeding Tl-201 uptake by > or = 20%. A concordant reduction in flow and metabolism was defined as a match. In the mismatch group (n = 39) were 19 events versus 1 event in the match group (n = 14) (p <0.009). In the mismatch group were 5 cardiac deaths, 3 reinfarctions, 7 late revascularizations, and 4 patients had unstable angina pectoris. There was 1 cardiac death in the match group. The event-free rate estimated using Kaplan Meier curves for patients with and without a mismatch was significantly different (p = 0.018). The relative risk for patients with a mismatch for developing a future cardiac event was estimated at 7.8 versus patients with a match. Thus, planar myocardial FDG imaging shortly after AMI has important prognostic significance for prediction of future cardiac events. Patients with a mismatch shortly after AMI have a high risk for future cardiac events on medical therapy.
