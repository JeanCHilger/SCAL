Generalized linear least squares method for fast generation of myocardial blood flow parametric images with N-13 ammonia PET. In this paper, we developed and tested strategies for estimating myocardial blood flow (MBF) and generating MBF parametric images using positron emission tomography (PET), N-13 ammonia, and the generalized linear least square (GLLS) method. GLLS was generalized to the general linear compartment model, modified for the correction of spillover, validated using simulated N-13 ammonia data, and examined using PET data from several patient studies. In comparison to the standard model-fitting procedure, the GLLS method provided similar accuracy and superior computational speed.
