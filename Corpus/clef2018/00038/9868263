Advances in dietary management of obesity in dogs and cats. Recent evidence in humans has reemphasized the importance of specific lifestyle behaviors such as activity level on energy requirements. A recent survey of adult pet dogs has shown a clear association between the level of activity and energy requirement, and suggests that current feeding recommendations may overestimate the energy requirements of adult dogs. Although a reduction in feeding guides may help to reduce the risk of overfeeding and subsequent development of obesity in adult dogs, there is considerable individual variation in energy requirements, which emphasizes the importance of tailoring feeding practices to the individual. Diet clearly has a critical role to play in both the prevention and treatment of obesity. We have evaluated the effect of different dietary regimens on the treatment of obesity in companion animals. In cats, increased energy restriction results in more rapid weight loss. However, this is associated with less favorable changes in body composition. In dogs, we have evaluated the potential benefit of insoluble and soluble dietary fiber on satiety in dogs that have been restricted to an energy intake appropriate for weight reduction. Results of a series of studies have failed to show any benefit of either fiber type on satiety in energy-restricted dogs.
