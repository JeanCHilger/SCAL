The elderly and their pets. Supportive and problematic aspects and implications for care. A descriptive study. Pet ownership by elderly people is very common. This phenomenological study investigated why elderly people keep pets and what illness of the animals or their loss means to them. Nine women and three men owning either cats, dogs, or birds participated in this study. Their average age was 84. The results confirm on the one hand that elderly people experience happiness and joy thanks to having pets, giving them an ingenious social function as well as helping overcome the frequent passivity of old age. The problems arising with the ownership of animals are accident endangering (falls) and overexertion. An additional concern is the support of the animals during illness of the owner. The loss of animals is often connected with serious grief reaction and disorganisation of daily life. Serious, long-lasting, and pathological grief reactions were shown after a forced separation from the pet. Four recommendations for nursing practice resulted from this study: to approve and support the ownership of pets and domestic animals as a factor of the "good old age" to accept the pets as part of the 'family' and integrate them into nursing work, to encourage the owner to plan the future of the pet. Finally, to help overcome the loss of pets and animals a specific nursing therapeutic treatment is required.
