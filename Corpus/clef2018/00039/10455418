Noradrenaline transporter gene transfer for radiation cell kill by 131I meta-iodobenzylguanidine. Meta-iodobenzylguanidine conjugated to 131I-iodine is an effective agent for the targeted radiotherapy of tumors of neural crest origin which express the noradrenaline transporter (NAT). The therapeutic application of 131I MIBG is presently limited to the treatment of phaeochromocytoma, neuroblastoma, carcinoid and medullary thyroid carcinoma. To determine the feasibility of MIBG targeting for a wider range of tumor types, we employed plasmid-mediated transfer of the NAT gene into a human glioblastoma cell line (UVW) which does not express the NAT gene. This resulted in a 15-fold increase in uptake of MIBG by the host cells. A dose-dependent toxicity of 131I MIBG to the transfectants was demonstrated using three methods: (1) survival of clonogens derived from monolayer culture (2) survival of clonogens derived from disaggregated multicellular spheroids
