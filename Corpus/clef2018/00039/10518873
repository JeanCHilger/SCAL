Studies of oral malodor in the dog. We compared currently used methods for assessing oral malodor and found a significant, positive correlation between the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in breath and the human perception of malodor, but only within a limited range of VSC production. Daily tooth-brushing from an early age maintains a low and consistent level of oral malodor that does not differ significantly throughout the day. In contrast, dogs with elevated concentrations of VSC production suffer from the highest level of malodor early in the morning, prior to feeding and daily activities. Even in older dogs, periodontal therapy can result in a substantial reduction of oral malodor that remains significantly below pre-treatment values for up to 3 months after treatment.
