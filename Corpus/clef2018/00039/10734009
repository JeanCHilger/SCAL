Cerebral activation during micturition in normal men. Specific cerebral lesions have shown the crucial role of the brain in the control of micturition. The precise identification of the anatomical cerebral structures involved in micturition can contribute to a better understanding of the control of micturition and the development of therapeutic models. Various neuropathological and animal studies have referred to the medulla oblongata, pons, limbic system, superior frontal lobe and premotor cortical regions as areas implicated in micturition control. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the activity of these areas during micturition can be confirmed by PET in normal men. The distribution of the regional cerebral blood flow after bolus injection of (15)O water was used as an indirect measure of cerebral activation. PET scans were performed during the following three conditions: (i) at rest with the bladder empty (ii) during simulated micturition after instillation of isotonic saline into the urinary bladder
