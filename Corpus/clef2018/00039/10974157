Regional pharmacokinetics of orally administered PET tracers. Positron emission tomography (PET) is currently the most useful imaging technique for noninvasive measurement of drug pharmacokinetics regionally in a variety of tissues. Over the past decade, PET measurements have provided many critical insights about the tissue distribution of several classes of drugs neuroleptics, antimicrobials, antineoplastics, etc. PET measurements can be performed after any route of drug administration, intravenous, inhalation or oral, however, intravenously administered drugs have been the most extensively evaluated. Studies of orally administered drugs are clearly of great interest
