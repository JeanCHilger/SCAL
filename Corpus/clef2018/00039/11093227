Nanosized Pd(145)(CO)(x)(PEt(3))(30) Containing a Capped Three-Shell 145-Atom Metal-Core Geometry of Pseudo Icosahedral Symmetry This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (CHE-9729555). The CCD area detector system was purchased in part in 1995 with a NSF grant (CHE-9310428). Color figures were made with Crystal Maker, Interactive Crystallography for MacOS (David Palmer). Dedicated by L.F.D. to Professor Dr. Heinrich Vahrenkamp, an exceptional Inorganic Chemist and special friend, at the Festkolloquium (May 19, 2000) at the University of Freiburg.
