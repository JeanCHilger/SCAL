Positron emission tomography (PET) study of the alterations in brain pharmacokinetics of methamphetamine in methamphetamine sensitized animals. I investigated the differences in brain pharmacokinetics of [11C]methamphetamine ([11C]MAP) in normal and MAP sensitized animals using positron emission tomography (PET). [11C]MAP was synthesized by an automated on-line [11C]methylation system. I newly produced MAP sensitized dog and monkey by repeated MAP treatment. The maximal level of accumulation of [11C]MAP in the sensitized dog brain was 1.4 times higher than that in the control. This result suggests the changes in the pharmacokinetic profile of MAP in the brain affect the development or expression of MAP-induced behavioral sensitization. However, the overaccumulation of [11C]MAP in the sensitized monkey brain was not observed due to the influence of anesthesia.
