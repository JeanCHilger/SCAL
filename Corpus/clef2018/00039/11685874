Radiographic imaging in gynecologic oncology. Current radiographic techniques are useful for evaluating and managing patients with gynecologic malignancies. Lymphoscintigraphy may prove useful in limiting surgery in women with vulvar cancer who have negative sentinel groin nodes. Selected patients benefit from pretherapy MRI scanning to help determine treatment of cervical or endometrial malignancies. Sonographic techniques are helpful in discriminating benign from malignant adnexal or pelvic masses, and preoperative CT scans are helpful in determining the extent of advanced ovarian cancer. The FDG PET scans appear to help localize occult disease in patients with a variety of gynecologic malignancies. Further refinements of currently available techniques or newer techniques, however, are needed to increase the sensitivity for detection of subclinical or microscopic metastases in patients with gynecologic malignancies.
