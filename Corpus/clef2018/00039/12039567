Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of N,N'-diphenyl and N-naphthyl-N'-phenylguanidines as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ion-channel ligands. A series of N,N'-diphenyl and N-naphthyl-N'-phenyl guanidine derivatives was synthesized as potential N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor positron emission tomography (PET) ligands. The affinity of the different compounds was determined using in vitro receptor binding assays, and their log P values were estimated using HPLC analysis. The effect of N'-3 and N'-3,5 substitution on affinity and lipophilicity was examined. The K(i) values ranged from 1.87 to 839nM, while log P values between 1.22 and 2.88 were observed.
