Predicting the crystallization potential of urine from cats and dogs with respect to calcium oxalate and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite). The objective of this study was to validate two programs (SUPERSAT and EQUIL 2) for calculation of calcium oxalate (CaOx) and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite MAP) relative supersaturation (RSS) in dog and cat urine. Healthy adult cats (n = 10) and dogs (n = 9) were fed standard diets for a 3-wk period. Urine was collected (24 h, dogs
