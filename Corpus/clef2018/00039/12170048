Effects of surgical levels of propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia on cerebral blood flow in healthy subjects studied with positron emission tomography. The authors report a positron emission tomography (PET) study on humans with parallel exploration of the dose-dependent effects of an intravenous (propofol) and a volatile (sevoflurane) anesthetic agent on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using quantitative and relative (Statistical Parametric Mapping [SPM]) analysis.Using H(2)(15)O, rCBF was assessed in 16 healthy (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] physical status I) volunteers awake and at three escalating drug concentrations: 1, 1.5, and 2 MAC/EC(50), or specifically, at either 2, 3, and 4% end-tidal sevoflurane (n = 8), or 6, 9, and 12 microg/ml plasma concentration of propofol (n = 8). Rocuronium was used for muscle relaxation.Both drugs decreased the bispectral index and blood pressure dose-dependently. Comparison between adjacent levels showed that sevoflurane initially (0 vs. 1 MAC) reduced absolute rCBF by 36-53% in all areas, then (1 vs. 1.5 MAC) increased rCBF in the frontal cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum (7-16%), and finally (1.5 vs. 2 MAC) caused a dual effect with a 23% frontal reduction and a 38% cerebellar increase. In the propofol group, flow was also initially reduced by 62-70%, with minor further effects. In the SPM analysis of the "awake to 1 MAC/EC(50)" step, both anesthetic agents reduced relative rCBF in the cuneus, precuneus, posterior limbic system, and the thalamus or midbrain additionally, propofol reduced relative rCBF in the parietal and frontal cortices.Both anesthetic agents caused a global reduction of rCBF (propofol > sevoflurane) at the 1 MAC/EC(50) level. The effect was maintained at higher propofol concentrations, whereas 2 MAC sevoflurane caused noticeable flow redistribution. Despite the marked global changes, SPM analysis enabled detailed localization of regions with the greatest relative decreases.
