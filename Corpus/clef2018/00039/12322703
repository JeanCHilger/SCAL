Percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy as a treatment for recurrent pericardial effusion in 6 dogs. Percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy (PBP) has been performed in people and in a small number of dogs as a treatment for recurrent pericardial effusion with tamponade (PET). We performed this technique on 6 dogs with recurrent PET (5 with heart base tumors and 1 with no identifiable mass). Under general anesthesia and fluoroscopic guidance, a balloon-dilating catheter (diameters 14-20 mm) was introduced percutaneously at the 5th intercostal space through a sheath-introducing catheter, positioned across the parietal pericardium, and inflated 3 times. No dog experienced serious complications. The procedure was considered successful in 4 of 6 dogs. One dog is still alive without recurrence of PET 1 year after the procedure. Three dogs died of unrelated disease without recurrence of PET 5. 19, and 32 months after the procedure. The procedure was not beneficial in 1 dog that was euthanized 9 weeks later because of recurrence of pleural and abdominal effusion thought to be secondary to PET. One dog may have temporarily benefited but developed symptomatic PET 6 months after PBP. PBP appears to be a safe, economical, and potentially effective palliative treatment for recurrent PET and is a reasonable, less invasive alternative to surgery for dogs with recurrent PET, especially effusions caused by heart base tumors and possibly idiopathic pericardial effusion. Premature closure of the stoma is a potential cause for long-term failure and was thought to have been responsible for the recurrence of clinical signs in 2 dogs.
