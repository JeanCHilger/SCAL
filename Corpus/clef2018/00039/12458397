Clinical impact of diagnostic SPET investigations with a dopamine re-uptake ligand. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is based on clinical features with pathological verification. However, autopsy has been found to confirm a specialist diagnosis in only about 75% of cases. Especially early in the course of the disease, the clinical diagnosis can be difficult. Imaging of presynaptic dopamine transporters (DAT receptors) has provided a possible diagnostic probe in the evaluation of Parkinson's disease. The cocaine analogue [(123)I]-2-beta-carboxymethoxy-3-beta(4-iodophenyl)tropane ([(123)I]-beta-CIT) is one of several radioligands that have been developed for single-photon emission tomography (SPET). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of [(123)I]-beta-CIT SPET on the diagnosis and clinical management of patients with a primary, tentative diagnosis of parkinsonism. We undertook a retrospective evaluation of the clinical records of 90 consecutive patients referred to [(123)I]-beta-CIT SPET from the neurological department, Bispebjerg Hospital. In 58 subjects the scans revealed altered tracer uptake consistent with Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy. A significant change in the management or treatment because of the scan was found in 25 patients (28%). The sensitivity of the examination was 97% and the specificity 83%. In conclusion, a significant clinical impact of DAT receptor SPET imaging was found. DAT receptor imaging is a useful diagnostic probe in patients with a possible diagnosis of parkinsonism.
