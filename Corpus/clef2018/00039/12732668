Insulin stimulates liver glucose uptake in humans: an 18F-FDG PET Study. The liver is vital for the regulation of glucose metabolism, but inaccessibility of the organ for direct assessments has limited the study of its metabolic role in vivo.The effect of insulin and insulin sensitivity (IS) on hepatic glucose uptake was investigated using PET, (18)F-FDG, and graphical analysis and 3-compartment modeling in humans. We studied 16 healthy sedentary men (normal IS), 8 athletes (high IS), and 7 patients with coronary artery disease (low IS) either during fasting (n = 14) or during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia (n = 24).Whole-body insulin-mediated glucose uptake was 35 +/- 7 micro mol/min/kg for normal-IS subjects, 65 +/- 8 micro mol/min/kg for high-IS subjects (P < 0.05 vs. normal IS), and 24 +/- 3 micro mol/min/kg for low-IS subjects (P < 0.05 vs. normal IS and high IS). Hyperinsulinemia enhanced hepatic glucose influx (2.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.7 micro mol x min(-1) x 100 mL(-1), P < 0.05) and phosphorylation rates (0.55 +/- 0.24 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.19 min(-1) x 10(-2), P < 0.05) similarly in insulin-sensitive and -resistant subjects. During hyperinsulinemia, however, the glucose phosphorylation-to-dephosphorylation ratio was significantly lower in the low-IS group than in normal-IS subjects (P < 0.05) or high-IS subjects (P < 0.01) correspondingly, whole-body insulin-mediated glucose disposal was directly related to this ratio (r = 0.45Our study provided evidence that physiologic hyperinsulinemia enhances hepatic glucose uptake and that IS is related to the glucose phosphorylation-to-dephosphorylation balance in the liver. Graphical analysis and modeling proved to be applicable and complementary tools for the investigation of glucose metabolism in the liver.
