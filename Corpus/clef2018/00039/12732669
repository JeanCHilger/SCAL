Evaluation of 18F-FDG PET in patients with advanced, metastatic, or recurrent gastric cancer. PET with 18F-FDG has been widely used in oncology, but its application for stomach neoplasms has been limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the visual diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent gastric cancer and to generate semiquantitative values for lesions.18F-FDG PET scans were obtained on 42 patients (29 men, 13 women age, 27-78 yThe sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy as a whole were as follows: 71%, 74%, and 73%, respectively, with the SET2400W scanner and 47%, 79%, and 62%, respectively, with the PT931/04 scanner. Values were high for primary lesions, liver, lymph node, and lung metastases, but were low for bone metastases, ascites, peritonitis, and pleuritis carcinomatoses. SUVs were 8.9 +/- 4.2 (primary lesions, 19 patients/19 lesions), 6.5 +/- 2.2 (liver, 9/55), 6.1 +/- 2.5 (lymph nodes, 14/38), 6.5 +/- 1.8 (abdominal wall, 4/7), 3.9 +/- 2.0 (bone, 3/27), and 4.7 +/- 2.6 (lung, 2/3). Comparing SUVs and histologic findings for 17 untreated patients, values for well-differentiated and moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas versus poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas and signet ring cell carcinomas were 13.2 +/- 6.3 (4/4) versus 7.7 +/- 2.6 (13/13) (P < 0.05) for the primary lesions, 7.0 +/- 2.4 (5/39) versus 5.6 +/- 2.8 (2/2) for the liver, and 5.5 +/- 1.9 (9/28) versus 8.8 +/- 3.3 (3/8) (P < 0.05) for the lymph nodes.Our results indicate that 18F-FDG PET is a useful diagnostic modality for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent gastric cancer but not for detecting bone metastases, peritonitis, or pleuritis carcinomatoses. 18F-FDG uptake by gastric cancers is relatively high but does not parallel histopathologic features of malignancy.
