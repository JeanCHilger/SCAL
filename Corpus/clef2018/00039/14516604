A Voice for Clinical Positron Imaging, A Voice for ICP. With the advent of the Clinical Positron Imaging journal, a new vehicle has been created to facilitate the dissemination of information relevant to the clinical positron imaging community. In addition to providing technical, scientific, and medical information, this journal will also be used to address financial, regulatory, and legislative issues in clinical positron imaging. Since this is the journal of the Institute for Clinical PET (ICP), all of its members will receive it as an added service of ICP.
