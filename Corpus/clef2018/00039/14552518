Screening for domestic violence in the pediatric office: a multipractice experience. The purpose of our study was to screen for domestic violence (DV) in 4 different pediatric practice settings. Women who accompanied their children to well-child visits were eligible. The women were screened with a 6-question tool previously piloted by our group, which included questions on partner abuse, child abuse, and pet abuse. Over a 1-year period, 435 women were screened. Of these women, 95 (22%) described DV at some point in their lives. Sixty-nine (16%) reported abuse longer than 2 years before the screen and 26 (6%) reported more recent abuse. While 11 of 117 women screened in the more affluent private practice reported a history of past abuse, no women in that group reported DV occurring within 24 months. The proportion of women reporting violence did not differ significantly by site, but the proportion of patients reporting new violence was significantly lower at the private practice site by Chi-square analysis. In conclusion, women screened in a variety of pediatric settings will disclose DV. Recent abuse is more likely to be reported in settings with indigent patients. All pediatricians should be screening for DV and have protocols in place to offer women the services they need if DV is revealed.
