Anatomical and functional cerebral variables associated with basal symptoms but not risperidone response in minimally treated schizophrenia. In schizophrenia, structural and functional cerebral variables show an unclear association with clinical features and their value as predictors of response to a typical antipsychotic agents has yet to be determined. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationships between clinical variables (baseline syndromes and response to risperidone) and anatomo-functional brain variables. We studied 19 minimally treated patients with schizophrenia of recent onset using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) under resting conditions. The following brain variables were studied: volume of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and gray matter (GM) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and temporal lobe hippocampal metabolic activity and volume
