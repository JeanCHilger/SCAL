Transfusions in exotic species. There has been a considerable increase in the popularity of exotic species as pets, particularly, birds and domestic ferrets. Blood transfusions in birds and ferrets are discussed. There is a brief review of hematology, blood collection techniques, the selection and maintenance of donor animals, and the mechanics of transfusion. Because of the marked differences between birds and mammals, attention is given to avian anatomy and physiology as it applies clinically to blood transfusions.
