Exercise echocardiography after stabilization of unstable angina: correlation with exercise thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography. The diagnostic usefulness of predischarge exercise echocardiography in 35 patients with unstable angina who responded to medical therapy was correlated with exercise thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (TI-SPECT) performed, on the average, three days after the exercise echocardiography. None of the patients had myocardial infarction prior to hospitalization or before TI-SPECT and none had left bundle-branch block on their rest electrocardiogram (ECG). Exercise echocardiography was positive in 21 patients and TI-SPECT in 24. The results of the two techniques were concordant in 28 of 35 patients (agreement = 80%, k = 0.57 +/- 0.14, p less than 0.001). Wall-by-wall comparison of the distribution of exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities with reversible thallium defects showed complete or partial correlation in all of 19 patients in whom both the tests were positive. A positive exercise ECG and positive exercise echocardiography identified 11 of 11 patients with angiographically verified significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and 11 of 12 patients (92%) with positive TI-SPECT. Thus, exercise echocardiography is a valuable addition to routine predischarge exercise test in the noninvasive diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and shows a good correlation with TI-SPECT in detecting and localizing ischemia in patients with unstable angina stabilized on medical therapy.
