The influence of thyroglobulin on functional imaging in differentiated thyroid cancer. Recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (rhTSH) for an exogenous stimulation of TSH and consequent thyroglobulin (hTG) synthesis has reinitiated a discussion about the usefulness of diagnostic procedures for the follow-up of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).Fifty consecutive patients with DTC who received whole-body iodine scintigraphy (WBS) and positron emission tomography (PET) were evaluated.The work-up was normal in 18/50. In 32 patients, functional imaging detected DTC. In 44% exogenous TSH stimulation with rhTSH was used and thyroxin was withdrawn in the others. The hTG under stimulation ranged from 0.8 to 5.004 ng x ml(-1). It was below 2 ng x ml(-1) in four (12.5%) patients. In total, 91 tumour sites were identified by positron emission tomography (PET) and 47 sites by WBS. PET and WBS showed corresponding uptake in 38% of lymph node, 48% of parenchymal and 43% of bone metastases. PET detected additional 53% of lymph node (WBS 9%), 38% of parenchymal (WBS 14%) and 28.5% of bone metastases.It is concluded that PET is more sensitive than WBS for the detection of DTC. The follow-up of DTC patients with hTG levels alone misses a significant number of true positive cases. Its use should therefore be restricted to selected low risk patients only.
