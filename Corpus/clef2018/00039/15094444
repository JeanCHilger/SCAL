99mTc-HYNIC Annexin-V imaging of primary head and neck carcinoma. In this study, the potential of 99mTc-HYNIC Annexin-V scintigraphy to visualize primary head and neck carcinoma was assessed and compared with computed tomography (CT) findings and histology. Eighteen patients suspected of having primary head and neck carcinoma underwent a spiral CT scan and 99mTc-HYNIC Annexin-V scintigraphy within 1 week of each other, followed by resection of the suspected lesion. Results obtained by CT and scintigraphy were compared vs. histopathology. The diagnosis was primary head and neck carcinoma in 18 patients, accompanied by lymph node involvement in seven patients. 99mTc-HYNIC Annexin-V uptake was identified in five patients on planar images and in 17 patients on tomographic images (single-photon emission computed tomography, SPECT), corresponding to the pathological regions identified by CT. In the remaining patient, CT and 99mTc-HYNIC Annexin-V scintigraphy were false negative. In 11 patients, SPECT and CT scan were concordant, identifying all primary lesions and two sites of lymph node involvement. In the six remaining patients, CT and SPECT accurately identified the primary lesion, but were discordant with regard to the existence of lymph node involvement. In five of six patients, SPECT failed to identify lymph node involvement, whereas CT scan did not. In the remaining patient, CT scan was false positive for lymph node involvement, whereas SPECT was not. In this series, 99mTc-HYNIC Annexin-V allowed for the visualization of all primary head and neck tumours identified by CT scan, but failed to identify most of the sites of lymph node involvement.
