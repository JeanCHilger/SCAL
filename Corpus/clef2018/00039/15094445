The usefulness of adenosine 99mTc tetrofosmin SPECT for the diagnosis of left anterior descending coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain and left bundle branch block. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of 99mTc tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the diagnosis of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery disease in 60 subjects with left bundle branch block (LBBB) admitted for chest pain.Adenosine 99mTc tetrofosmin SPECT, transthoracic echocardiogram and coronary angiography were performed, by protocol, in 60 non-infarcted consecutive patients. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 41.6 +/- 10.8%. A significant angiographic disease of the LAD was found in 15 (25%) patients. The sensitivity and the specificity of SPECT was found to be 75% and 89%, respectively the positive predictive value (PPV) was 70% with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 91%. During the adenosine infusion the QRS complex width reduced from 131.3 +/- 29.6 ms to 125.5 +/- 28.6 ms in the patients without LAD involvement (P = 0.008) but remained unchanged in LAD disease patients (P = 0.1). Combining SPECT information and QRS analysis the sensitivity increased to 87% with unchanged specificity, the PPV was 74% and the NPV resulted 95%. At 2-year follow-up 13 (22%) patients experienced a cardiac event. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, an LVEF of < or = 35% was the only predictor of cardiac events (P = 0.01, log-rank 6.2).A quarter of patients with LBBB complaining of chest pain had LAD coronary disease. The highly negative predictive value of adenosine SPECT could help in the exclusion of LAD disease, especially when the SPECT image is combined with the QRS analysis.
