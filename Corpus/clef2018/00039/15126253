Coronary vasomotor abnormalities in insulin-resistant individuals. Insulin resistance is a metabolic spectrum that progresses from hyperinsulinemia to the metabolic syndrome, impaired glucose tolerance, and finally type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is unclear when vascular abnormalities begin in this spectrum of metabolic effects.To evaluate the association of insulin resistance with the presence and reversibility of coronary vasomotor abnormalities in young adults at low cardiovascular risk.Cross-sectional study followed by prospective, open-label treatment study.University hospital.50 insulin-resistant and 22 insulin-sensitive, age-matched Mexican-American participants without glucose intolerance or traditional risk factors for or evidence of coronary artery disease.3 months of thiazolidinedione therapy for 25 insulin-resistant patients.Glucose infusion rate in response to insulin infusion was used to define insulin resistance (glucose infusion rate < or = 4.00 mg/kg of body weight per minute [range, 0.90 to 3.96 mg/kg per minute]) and insulin sensitivity (glucose infusion rate > or = 7.50 mg/kg per minute [range, 7.52 to 13.92 mg/kg per minute]). Myocardial blood flow was measured by using positron emission tomography at rest, during cold pressor test (largely endothelium-dependent), and after dipyridamole administration (largely vascular smooth muscle-dependent).Myocardial blood flow responses to dipyridamole were similar in the insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant groups. However, myocardial blood flow response to cold pressor test increased by 47.6% from resting values in insulin-sensitive patients and by 14.4% in insulin-resistant patients. During thiazolidinedione therapy in a subgroup of insulin-resistant patients, insulin sensitivity improved, fasting plasma insulin levels decreased, and myocardial blood flow responses to cold pressor test normalized.The study was not randomized, and it included only 1 ethnic group.Insulin-resistant patients who do not have hypercholesterolemia or hypertension and do not smoke manifest coronary vasomotor abnormalities. Insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinedione therapy normalized these abnormalities. These results suggest an association between insulin resistance and abnormal coronary vasomotor function, a relationship that requires confirmation in larger studies.
