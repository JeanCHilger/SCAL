The cerebrovascular dilatation effects of olprinone, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, in comparison with acetazolamide--a pilot study. To examine the effects of olprinone, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, on cerebral blood flow (CBF), we compared the effects of olprinone on CBF to that of acetazolamide. Using technetium-99m-ethyl cysteinate dimer (99mTc-ECD) brain SPECT, we measured regional CBF (rCBF) at 33 sites, including 16 right and left pairs of non-infarct cerebral cortexes, in seven stroke patients (66.0+/-3.2 years) in a resting state and 15 min after the administration of acetazolamide. Within 1 week, rCBF at each site was measured 15 min after the initiation of olprinone infusion. Resting rCBF showed a significant negative correlation with the change in rCBF (DeltaCBF) during olprinone infusion (r = -0.43, P=0.013), but no significant correlation was seen following acetazolamide administration. The difference in rCBF between the right and left cortex increased more following acetazolamide administration (14.1+/-10.9 ml/(min 100 g)) than during olprinone infusion (5.4+/-4.8 ml/(min 100 g), P=0.013). The rCBF at four regions of interest (ROI) with low-resting CBF (< 49 ml/(min 100 g)) further decreased following the administration of acetazolamide. The vasodilatory effects of olprinone are dependent on resting CBF instead of on the intracerebral steal phenomenon that occurs with acetazolamide.
