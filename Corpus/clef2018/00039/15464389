Influence of ceftriaxone treatment on FDG uptake--an in vivo [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose imaging study in soft tissue infections in rats. Our aim was to determine the influence of antibiotic treatment using ceftriaxone on [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in experimental soft tissue infections. PET scans were performed in two groups (treated n=4 non-treated n=4) at days 3, 5, and 6 after inoculation of the infection. Additional autoradiography was performed in four animals at day 7 and in three animals at day 11. The difference of FDG uptake on day 5 (after three days of antibiotic treatment) between both groups proved to be significant (df=6
