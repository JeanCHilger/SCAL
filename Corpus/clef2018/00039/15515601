Echocardiography in the chinchilla. Heart disease has been described in the chinchilla and, with increasing popularity as a pet, the demand for diagnostic evaluation and treatment has increased. The goal of this study was to determine reference values for echocardiographic measurements in chinchillas and the effect of anesthesia on these measurements. Seventeen clinically healthy adult chinchillas were studied. All animals were anesthetized with isoflurane by mask. Standard echocardiographic views were used. A difference was seen in the echocardiographic measurements for left ventricular systolic dimension, fractional shortening, aortic (Ao) diameter, left atrial (LA) diameter, ratio of LA diameter to Ao diameter, and peak flow velocities and ejection times for Ao and pulmonary artery flows between awake and anesthetized chinchillas.
