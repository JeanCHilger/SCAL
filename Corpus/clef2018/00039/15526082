Combined Scanners (PET/CT, SPECT/CT) Versus Multimodality Imaging with Separated Systems. With increasing use of combined PET/CT scanners in the last few years, multimodality imaging (Nuclear Medicine/Radiology) found its way into clinical routine diagnostics. In this overview, necessary components for multimodality imaging, strategies for image analysis and image presentation, and diagnostic goals of combined imaging are demonstrated and discussed. A special focus is on the question, whether combined scanners can be replaced by a software approach with separated modalities. Advantages and limitations of multimodality imaging with combined or separated scanners are shown.
