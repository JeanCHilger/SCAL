Radiofrequency ablation therapy of remnant colorectal liver metastases after a course of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy. The present study evaluated the feasibility of combined therapy employing repeated hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) via a port-catheter system and radiofrequency (RF) ablation for unresectable metastatic liver cancer from the colo-rectum. RF ablation was performed for six patients with liver malignancies that had been well controlled and had decreased in number and size with repeated HAIC. After RF ablation subsequent to repeated HAIC, all six patients had stable disease or complete or partial remission as documented by follow-up contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) imaging. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F) showed complete response in all ablated lesions. In conclusion, RF ablation after a course of HAIC achieved complete necrosis in residual lesions after HAIC therapy.
