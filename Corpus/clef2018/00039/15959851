(11)C]d-threo-methylphenidate PET in patients with Parkinson's disease and essential tremo. Twenty Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, 6 patients with essential tremor and 10 healthy controls were studied with the dopamine transporter ligand [(11)C]d-threo-methylphenidate ([(11)C]dMP) and positron emission tomography (PET) to assess dopamine terminal loss in relation to disease duration and motor disability. Dopamine transporter availability was expressed as [(11)C]dMP binding potential (BP(dMP)) in percentage of the mean of healthy controls. In PD patients (age at onset 57.7 +/- 8.9 yrs disease duration 5.2 +/- 3.3 yrs
