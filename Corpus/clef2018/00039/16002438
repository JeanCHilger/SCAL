Cerebral blood flow changes associated with fluctuations in alpha and theta rhythm during sleep onset in humans. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is typically reduced during stable non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep compared with the waking level. It is not known when in the sleep cycle these changes occur. However, spontaneous fluctuations in alpha and theta rhythm during sleep onset are associated with marked changes in cardio-respiratory control. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that changes in CBF would occur during sleep onset and would be related to changes in cortical activity. Middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAV) was measured using transcranial Doppler ultrasound, as an index of CBF, in 10 healthy subjects. Sleep state, ventilation, end tidal carbon dioxide (PET,CO2), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and cardiac R-R interval (RR) were monitored simultaneously. Immediately following the transition from alpha to theta rhythm (the transition from wake to sleep), ventilation decreased by 13.4% and tidal volume (VT) by 12.2% (P<0.01) PET,CO2 increased by 1.9% (P<0.01)
