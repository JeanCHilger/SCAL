The prospective clinical and scintigraphic assessment of patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function after transmyocardial laser revascularisation. To analyse the clinical outcome and myocardial perfusion and function after transmyocardial revascularisation (TMR) in patients with normal left ventricular function and multivessel coronary artery disease non-amenable for standard revascularisation.Twenty three severely symptomatic patients (CCS score median 4) with normal left ventricular systolic function but coronaries non-amenable for either PTCA or CABG were subjected to TMR. The angina score, left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in radionuclide ventriculography at rest, exercise tolerance and myocardial perfusion--Thallium-201 SPECT (adenosine stress 74 and 37 MBq under nitrate cover) were evaluated before and 3, 6, 12 months post-operatively. After an average of 40 +/- 12 (range 14-56) TMR channels angina score decreased significantly (p< 0.0001) and the exercise tolerance increased (from 6.0 +/- 4.5 to 9.1 +/- 4.6 after 6 months, p< 0.05) in 21 patients. During the follow up period two patients had a myocardial infarction and one committed suicide after 6 months. Ejection fraction dropped significantly only after 1 year post-TMR from 70 +/- 13 to 63 +/- 0.13%, p < 0.05. The overall perfusion improved initially in 14 patients with subsequent deterioration in time. The changes in segmental perfusion were not associated with the symptomatic improvement.Transmyocardial revascularisation in patients with normal ejection fraction may improve the angina class, exercise tolerance and overall but not segmental perfusion and does not show any immediate effect on left ventricular function.
