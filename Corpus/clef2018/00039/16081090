Surface characterisation of plasma-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate). This paper reports the modifications produced by nitrogen and helium cold plasmas on the surface of PET. The changes have been studied by diffuse reflectance Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and inverse gas-solid chromatography (IGSC). Nitrogen and oxygen atoms seem to appear on the surface of PET as a consequence of the exposure to the atmosphere after the treatments with plasmas. AFM shows that both plasmas altered in different extent the surface of PET as they break the polymer chains producing low molecular products which appear as bumps on the surface. The surface area and the porosity of PET does not change by plasma treatments even after 15 min. The dispersive component of the surface free energy, gamma(s)(d), decreases after long treatments with nitrogen plasma whereas it remains almost unchanged after long treatment with helium plasma.
