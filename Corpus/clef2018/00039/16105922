Reduction of metastatic load to liver after intraarterial hepatic yttrium-90 radioembolization as evaluated by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic imaging. To assess the response of hepatic metastases after treatment with intraarterial yttrium 90 radioembolization (ie, use of SIR-Spheres) with use of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET).Nineteen patients with metastatic cancer to the liver from various solid tumors with progression despite polychemotherapy were included. All patients underwent baseline computed tomography, FDG PET, hepatic angiography, and intraarterial technetium 99 m macroaggregated albumin scan for assessment of lung shunting fraction. Patients were treated with 90Y resin microspheres on a lobar basis and were monitored for 3 months with use of dedicated attenuation-corrected PET. For each patient, regions of interest were drawn along the liver edge to measure total liver standard uptake value (SUV) on axial images, covering the entire liver. Visual estimates were also performed and graded as +1, 0, -1, -2, or -3 for progression, no change, and mild, moderate, and dramatic improvement by posttreatment PET.The median absorbed dose for the tumor was 76 Gy. There was a significant overall decrease in total liver SUV after treatment (baseline, 71,134 +/- 38,055 after SIR-Sphere treatment, 59,941 +/- 26,509The results suggest that there is significant reduction of hepatic metastatic load as evaluated objectively by PET after 90Y radioembolization for the treatment of unresectable metastatic disease to the liver. 90Y radioembolization provides encouraging results by arresting progression of metastatic cancer to the liver.
