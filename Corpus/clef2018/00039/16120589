Preparation of human recombinant kringle 1-5 and its bioactivity. To investigate antiangiogenesis activity and effects on endothelial cell proliferation of human recombinant K1-5 expressed in E.coli BL21, the cDNA of human K1-5 obtained from a cloning vector pUC57K1-5 by PCR, was inserted into an expression vector pET30(+) to construct a prokaryotic expression vector pET-K1-5. Recombinant K1-5 efficiently expressed in E.coli BL21 after IPTG induction was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an anti-angiostatin monoclonal antibody. The expressed K1-5 accounted for approximately 32% of the total bacterial proteins as estimated by densitometry, and existed mainly as inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were washed, lysed and purified to a purity of 96% by the nickel affinity chromatography. Refoled K1-5 protein was tested on chicken CAMs, and a large number of newly formed blood vessels were significantly regressed. In the present study, we demonstrated that bacterial-expressed K1-5 effectively inhibited angiogenesis of the chicken embryo in a dose-dependent manner through CAM assay. In addition, human recombinant K1-5 potently inhibited endothelial cell proliferation with no inhibition on non-endothelial cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that human recombinant K1-5 effectively inhibited angiogenesis of the chicken embryo in a dose-dependent manner and specially suppressed in vitro the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
