Envenomation by Amazonian freshwater stingray Potamotrygon motoro: 2 cases reported in Europe. Freshwater stingrays of the Potamotrygon genus are regarded by native people in the Amazonia as dangerous fishes responsible of frequent stings. Small freshwater stingrays are imported to Europe and sold as aquarium fish because they are easy to keep captive. The purpose of this report is to describe two new cases involving envenomation by freshwater stingray. One patient was an experienced 45-year-old French hobbyist. The second patient was a 35-year-old German pet store assistant. The clinical picture in both cases featured severe local pain with minimal systemic manifestations. Both patients recovered fully after symptomatic treatment. These two cases of envenomation call attention to the potential for injury among persons in close contact with venomous pets.
