110Sn/110In--a new generator system for positron emission tomography. A generator system, 110Sn/110In, is suggested for use in the labelling of leukocytes with this short-lived (t1/2 = 1.15 h) positron emitting (62%) isotope of indium. The half-life gives the labelled leukocytes time to be adequately distributed but is short enough to allow repeated studies within a few hours. The mother radionuclide 110Sn (t1/2 = 4.15 h) is produced by the reaction natIn(p, xn)110Sn which has a maximum cross-section of 110 mb at approx. 70 MeV and a practical yield of 400 MBq/microAh.
