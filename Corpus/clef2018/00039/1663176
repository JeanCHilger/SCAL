Can fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography evaluate the functional differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma. Tumor uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was studied by dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) in 23 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. The metabolic rate constants, K1 to K4, were generated by non-linear least square fitting method. We confirmed that K3 from the PET study significantly correlated with directly measured hexokinase activity of the cancer tissue. The region of HCC always had higher K3 values, which represents the hexokinase activity compared with the non-cancerous region. By FDG images, however, in 50% of cases the cancer region could not be clearly defined from the surrounding noncancerous hepatic tissue. These HCC cases without accumulation of FDG had a high ratio of K4/K3 (K4 represents glucose-6-phosphatase activity), which correlated well with the inverse ratio of FDG accumulating images on PET. According to the PET images which is represented by K4/K3 and the hexokinase activity which is represented by K3, we divided these 23 cases into three groups and retrospectively compared their survival rates. The groups with high K4/K3 (greater than or equal to 0.40) had longer survival than other groups. From the view point of glucose metabolism, the value of K4/K3 calculated from dynamic studies of FDG-PET may represent the functional differentiation of HCC.
