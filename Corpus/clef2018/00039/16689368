Cardiac imaging. Congestive heart failure is a state of inadequate cardiac function under various etiologies. Cardiac imaging plays an important role for accurate detection of heart failure, assessment of severity of LV function, and precise analysis of tissue function in vivo. Recently, multislice CT(MSCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography(PET) have been rapidly developed for clinical use for assessing patients with congestive heart failure. MSCT has been used for accurate assessment of LV function. Due to high spatial resolution, MSCT permits assessment of coronary stenosis without cardiac catheterization. MRI permits assessment of LV function and also tissue function. Particularly, infarcted myocardium is accurately delineated as an area of delayed enhancement by contrast enhancement MRI study. PET has been used for accurate assessment of myocardial viability based on the persistence of myocardial glucose metabolism. In addition, a various new PET tracers permit molecular and cellular function, such as neurotransmission and receptor function in vivo. These new imaging technique has a potential role for assessing risk stratification and providing appropriate treatment strategy.
