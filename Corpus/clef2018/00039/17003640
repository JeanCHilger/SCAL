Pancreatic imaging: current and emerging technologies. This review discusses the current imaging modalities for the diagnosis and staging of solid and cystic pancreatic lesions and for the assessment of acute and chronic pancreatitis, and the future role of emerging technologies in the management of pancreatic diseases. Multidetector row spiral computed tomography is superior to conventional single-detector row spiral computed tomography in the detection and staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Positron emission tomography is a sensitive but relatively nonspecific diagnostic modality. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography fusion may improve the staging accuracy for pancreatic cancer. Echo-enhanced ultrasound may have an emerging role in evaluating pancreatic masses. Endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration for cytology is the single best method for diagnosis and staging of nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer with a high accuracy for determining tumor resectability. In acute pancreatitis, a modification of the standard computed tomography severity index, which places greater emphasis on extrapancreatic complications, has shown superior correlation with various patient outcome measures. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is still the test of choice for morphological evaluation of chronic pancreatitis, whereas magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography offers a noninvasive alternative in selected patients. Endoscopic ultrasound can be useful for detecting early chronic pancreatitis. Secretin-stimulated imaging techniques may eventually provide a noninvasive method of reliably assessing pancreatic exocrine function.
