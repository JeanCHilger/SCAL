QT rate dependence in norm and myocardial infarction. To assess QT/RR relationship in healthy subjects and in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) using long term 12-lead ECG monitoring.We studied separately diurnal and nocturnal QT interval rate-dependence using a linear model "QT=beta+alphaxRR" in 42 patients with AMI on 2-nd week of the disease and in 14 healthy volunteers. All necessary parameters were automatically calculated from 24-hour 12 lead ECG recordings using special programs. Myocardial perfusion and infarct size were assessed using 99mTc-MIBI gated SPECT.Long-term ECG monitoring permitted: 1) to detect the ECG lead with most pronounced QT/RR relationship delineated by alpha(max) 2) to determine value of "deltaalpha=alpha(max)-alpha(min)", that characterized spatial heterogeneity of QT/RR relationship. In norm diurnal values of alpha(max) were significantly higher than nocturnal ones (0.207+/-0.037 vs. 0.151+/-0.035, respectivelyA new approach to the assessment of QT rate dependence with the use of 12-lead Holter monitoring widens possibilities of the method, firstly, because of selection of most informative ECG lead that shows maximal QT/RR relationship dynamic, and, secondly due, to discovery of the new field of ventricular repolarization research by assessment of space dispersion of QT/RR relationship. In patients with AMI when compared with healthy subjects we observed a decrease of QT/RR circadian modulation, increase of the slope and space dispersion of QT/RR rate dependence.
