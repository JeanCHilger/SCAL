Effect of CT-based attenuation correction on uptake ratios in skeletal SPECT. The AIM of this study was to determine the clinical relevance of compensating SPECT data for patient specific attenuation by the use of CT data simultaneously acquired with SPECT/CT when analyzing the skeletal uptake of polyphosphonates (DPD). Furthermore, the influence of misregistration between SPECT and CT data on uptake ratios was investigated.Thirty-six data sets from bone SPECTs performed on a hybrid SPECT/CT system were retrospectively analyzed. Using regions of interest (ROIs), raw counts were determined in the fifth lumbar vertebral body, its facet joints, both anterior iliacal spinae, and of the whole transversal slice. ROI measurements were performed in uncorrected (NAC) and attenuation-corrected (AC) images. Furthermore, the ROI measurements were also performed in AC scans in which SPECT and CT images had been misaligned by 1 cm in one dimension beforehand (ACX, ACY, ACZ).After AC, DPD uptake ratios differed significantly from the NAC values in all regions studied ranging from 32% for the left facet joint to 39% for the vertebral body. AC using misaligned pairs of patient data sets led to a significant change of whole-slice uptake ratios whose differences ranged from 3,5 to 25%. For ACX, the average left-to-right ratio of the facet joints was by 8% and for the superior iliacal spines by 31% lower than the values determined for the matched images (p < 0.05).AC significantly affects DPD uptake ratios. Furthermore, misalignment between SPECT and CT may introduce significant errors in quantification, potentially also affecting left-to-right ratios. Therefore, at clinical evaluation of attenuation-corrected scans special attention should be given to possible misalignments between SPECT and CT.
