Current control strategies targeting sources of echinococcosis in Japan. The authors describe the current control strategies targeting definitive hosts of the most important zoonotic parasite in Japan, Echinococcus multilocularis. A dramatic increase in the prevalence of echinococcosis in foxes in Hokkaido (the second largest of Japan's islands), the invasion of wild foxes into urban areas, infection among pet and stray dogs, and the possibility of spreading the disease to the main island of Japan (Honshu)--all these pose significant threats to public health. Previous research findings and current strategies such as control measures against infections in wild foxes, suggest that it will be possible to eliminate echinococcosis in the future. The enforcement of a national reporting system for veterinarians, international collaboration, and the establishment of a Forum on Environment and Animals (FEA) give further reason to believe that success is possible. This is the first report of a multifaceted control strategy against echinococcosis in definitive hosts that includes collaborative efforts with local residents. This model might provide new ideas for Veterinary Services worldwide in their efforts to control other related zoonotic diseases.
