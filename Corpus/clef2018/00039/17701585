Hodgkin lymphoma: Response assessment by revised International Workshop Criteria. Until recently, response assessment in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) was primarily performed by computed tomography (CT). Based on CT, International Workshop Criteria (IWC) were developed and widely used. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has a higher sensitivity and specificity compared with that of CT, and Revised International Workshop Criteria (IWC + PET) were recently proposed, which combine both imaging techniques. We determined whether these integrated IWC + PET-criteria can more accurately predict outcome compared with IWC-criteria in 56 patients with HL. Of the original 56 patients, nine patients relapsed and 47 are still in remission after a median follow-up of 9 years. Based on IWC-criteria, 15 patients had a complete remission (CR) after chemotherapy, 20 had complete remission unconfirmed (CRu), 19 had partial remission (PR) and two had stable disease (SD). In comparison, by IWC + PET, 47 had CR, seven had PR and two had SD. For IWC, outcome was not significantly different in patients with CR/CRu compared to PR (P = 0.61), while for IWC + PET criteria, time-to-next-treatment was significantly shorter in patients with PR compared to CR (P = 0.01). Therefore, IWC + PET-guidelines provide a more accurate response classification compared with that of IWC-guidelines, and are the preferred method for response assessment in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma.
