Nanoparticulate carrier containing water-insoluble iodinated oil as a multifunctional contrast agent for computed tomography imaging. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging is a valuable and routine strategy for the clinical diagnosis of various diseases. However, all current CT contrast agents are liquids, so they flow through the blood vessels and disappear very quickly by extravasation. If it were possible to make a blood-compatible particulate contrast agent, we could highlight a particular tissue by either passive or active targeting. In this work, Pluronic F127 and a naturally iodinated compound, Lipiodol, were used to form radiopaque nanoreservoir structures. The resultant nanoparticles have a stable structure at high concentrations, sufficient X-ray absorption, a safety profile similar to or better than that of Iopromide, and a longer circulation time than commercial iodinated preparations. The utility of the resultant radiopaque nanoparticles as a contrast agent was tested using micro-SPECT/CT imaging in vivo. Together with the very good solubility of hydrophobic drugs (e.g., Taxol) in Lipiodol, these results suggest the possibility that these particulate structures and their bioconjugates could become functional CT contrast agents that could deliver therapeutic agents to a particular tissue.
