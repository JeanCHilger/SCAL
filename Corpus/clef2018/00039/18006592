123I-FP-CIT SPECT imaging of dopamine transporters in patients with recurrent sudden falls: are such falls a distinct entity? Recurrent falls in older people are commonly associated with abnormalities that involve several parts of the central nervous system, especially with basal ganglion pathology. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the integrity of striatal dopamine transporters (DaTs) by use of (123)I-N-3-fluoropropyl-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane ((123)I-FP-CIT) SPECT of striatal DaTs in patients with recurrent sudden falls.Twenty-one patients without a definite neurologic diagnosis for recurrent sudden falls were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. SPECT with a DaT ligand was performed 180 min after injection of 185 MBq of (123)I-FP-CIT with a dual-head gamma-camera.DaT SPECT findings were normal in 15 of 21 patients (71%). Of those, 73% had abnormal MRI findings suggestive of atherosclerotic lesions. Eleven patients with normal DaT SPECT findings had mild parkinsonian symptoms. There was no correlation of the SPECT results with patient age, duration of occurrence of falls, or frequency of falls, and there was no significant difference in the relative distributions of SPECT findings between patients with and patients without parkinsonian symptoms or vascular risk factors.Recurrent sudden falls are, in most cases, not attributable to the degeneration of the nigrostriatal system.
