Synthesis of p-(di-tert-butyl[(18)F]fluorosilyl)benzaldehyde ([(18)F]SiFA-A) with high specific activity by isotopic exchange: a convenient labeling synthon for the (18)F-labeling of N-amino-oxy derivatized peptides. The syntheses of different (18)F-labeled peptides using the highly effective labeling synthon p-(di- tert-butylfluorosilyl) benzaldehyde ([ (18)F]SiFA-A) for the development of (18)F-radiopharmaceuticals for oncological positron emission tomography (PET) is reported. The novel and mild labeling technique for the radiosynthesis of [ (18)F]SiFA-A, based on an unexpectedly efficient isotopic (19)F- (18)F exchange, yielded the (18)F-synthon [ (18)F]SiFA-A in almost quantitative yields in high specific activities between 225 and 680 GBq/micromol (6081-18 378 Ci/mmol) without applying HPLC purification. The [ (18)F]SiFA-A was finally used to label the N-terminal amino-oxy (N-AO) derivatized peptides AO-Tyr (3)-octreotate (AO-TATE), cyclo(fK(AO-N)RGD and N-AO-PEG 2-[D-Tyr-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-betaAla-His-Thi-Nle-NH 2] (AO-BZH3, a bombesin derivative) in high radiochemical yields. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed high efficiency of the isotopic exchange, which is predicted to proceed via a pentacoordinate siliconate intermediate dissociating immediately to form the radiolabeled [ (18)F]SiFA-A.
