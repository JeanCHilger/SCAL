Preliminary results in the use of a new composite prosthesis in incisional hernia repair. The repair of incisional hernias with the use of prosthetic biomaterials is the standard of care today. There are different prosthetic biomaterials that can be used to repair incisional hernias. These materials can be divided into products that are single component or a combination. Incisional hernia repair using the intraperitoneal implantation of a prosthesis requires mesh with impervious properties. This is preliminary study with a new composite non resorbable mesh in polyethylene terephthalate-polyurethane (HI-TEX PARP MP) used for incisional hernia repair in intraperitoneal implantation. This mesh has one permeable side in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) for rapid tissue fixation and another side in polyurethane (PEU), hydrophobic in order to avoid cell penetration. This is a preliminary study of medical records of 24 patients (17 women and 7 men) in whom intraperitoneal placement of composite prosthetics in polyethylene terephthalate-polyurethane (HI-TEX PARP MP) was used between September 2004 and September 2006. The incisional hernias were recurrent in 8 patients. The underside of the mesh was placed in direct contact with the visceral peritoneum, whereas the upper side made contact with the subcutaneous tissue. No intraoperative complications occurred. Postoperatively, 1 had seromas, 1 had phlegmon of the wound without removing prosthetics. There was 1 death but not dependent of the surgical performance. The follow-up, was 12 months (range 1 month-2 years) none had discomfort
