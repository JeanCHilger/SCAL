Synthesis, in vitro and in vivo characterization of (64)Cu(I) complexes derived from hydrophilic tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphane and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane ligands. Four novel (64)Cu complexes ([(64)Cu(thp)(4)](+) (1), [(64)Cu(TPA)(4)](+) (2), [HC(CO(2))(pz(Me2))(2) (64)Cu(thp)(2)] (3) and [HC(CO(2))(tz)(2) (64)Cu(thp)(2)] (4), [where thp is tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphine, TPA is 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane, pz(Me2) is 3,5-dimethylpyrazole and tz is 1,2,4-triazole] were successfully synthesized and characterized. The complexes were produced in high radiochemical purity and yield (more than 98%) without the need for further purification. Their logP values and serum stabilities were measured and in vitro behavior was observed in cultured EMT-6 cells. The logP values (+/- standard deviation) obtained were -2.26 +/- 0.04 (1), 0.01 +/- 0.01 (2), -1.24 +/- 0.03 (3) and -2.06 +/- 0.03 (4). Complex 3 demonstrated the highest serum stability, with approximately 33% of the complex still intact after 1-h incubation. Complex 2 showed a rapid cell-association with EMT-6 cells, with more than 8.5% association at 2 h. This association was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than for the other three compounds after a 2-h incubation (1, 1.21% 3, 0.63%
