Does beta blocker therapy affect the diagnostic accuracy of adenosine single-photon-emission computed tomographic myocardial perfusion imaging? We retrospectively evaluated perfusion defect presence, extent, and severity in 158 consecutive patients receiving beta blockers, who underwent adenosine single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and coronary angiography. Seventy-six patients (group 1) had their beta blockers withdrawn 48 hours prior to testing, and 82 patients (group 2) remained on the beta blocker regimen. Groups 1 and 2 were similar in gender, age, pretest symptoms, and history of coronary artery disease (CAD). Group 1 patients had higher resting heart rates (79 +/- 19/min versus 68 +/- 13/min P < 0.001), peak heart rates (91 +/- 21/min versus 80 +/- 15/min
