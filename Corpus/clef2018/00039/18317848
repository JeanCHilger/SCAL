How I do it: surgical management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The surgical management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) has been impacted by the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), advances in surgical technique, and a better understanding of the natural history of this unique disease. In this article, we review the technical aspects of the operations, the expanding role of laparoscopy, and the indications for neoadjuvant and neoadjuvant TKI therapy in primary GIST. Furthermore, we explore the rationale for and incorporation of surgery in the multidisciplinary management of advanced GIST.
