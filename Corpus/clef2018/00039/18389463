Functional neuroimaging with SPECT in Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonisms. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and the different Parkinsonian syndromes is currently determined by applying established clinical criteria. Today, different neuroimaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT), are a valuable aid to further our understanding of both the pathophysiology and the diagnosis of the different Parkinsonian pictures. AIM. To examine the usefulness of the different tools utilised to assess the integrity of the nigrostriatal system by visualising the pre-synaptic dopamine transporters and post-synaptic D2 receptors using SPECT techniques we also sought to determine the role played by the alteration of the cardiac sympathetic innervation using meta-iodobenzylguanidine.We review the usefulness of the different nuclear medicine techniques for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the distinct clinical pictures that are accompanied by Parkinsonian symptoms, and we also discuss the possible future perspectives of said techniques.A combination of the different nuclear medicine techniques that have been reviewed here is useful in the study and characterisation of Parkinsonian syndromes. In the future they could be used to detect subjects who are possibly at risk of developing Parkinsonism and to be able to assess the effect of therapies that may have a potential modifying effect on the disease.
