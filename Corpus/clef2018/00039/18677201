Randomized, single-blind, factorial design study of the interaction of food and time on intestinal activity in 99mTc-tetrofosmin stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. Intestinal activity at the inferior myocardial wall represents an issue for assessment of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with 99mTc-labelled tracers. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of time and food on upper abdominal activity in 99mTc-tetrofosmin MPI.The study population consisted of 152 consecutive patients referred for routine MPI. All patients underwent 2-day stress-rest 99mTc-tetrofosmin single-photon emission computed tomography MPI. Before stress testing, patients were randomized in a factorial design to four different regimens. Group A: early scan (image acquisition initiated within 15 min after injection of the tracer) and no food group B: early scan and food (two pieces of white bread with butter and a minimum of 450 ml of water)The results showed statistical significant impact on both time and food on upper abdominal activity. The primary endpoint showed that the acceptance rate improved from 55% in group A to 100% success rate in group D. An early scan reduced the acceptance rate by 30% versus a late scan [hazard ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.58-0.84 P<0.0001], whereas the addition of food improved the success rate versus no food by 27% (hazard ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.51A combination of solid food and water administered after injection of the tracer and delayed image acquisition led to significant and clinically relevant decrease of interfering upper abdominal activity in 99mTc-tetrofosmin MPI.
