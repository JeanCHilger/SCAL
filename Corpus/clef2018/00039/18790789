Noninvasive imaging of cell proliferation following mitogenic extracellular kinase inhibition by PD0325901. The mitogenic extracellular kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) inhibitor, PD0325901, has potent activity in a number of cancer cell types in vitro. In SKMEL-28 human melanoma cells (BRAF mutant), the drug rapidly decreased phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, cyclin D1, and thymidine kinase 1 protein levels. We investigated if 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine-positron emission tomography ([18F]FLT-PET) could be used to image changes in cell proliferation following MEK1/2 inhibition in vivo. Mice bearing SKMEL-28 and human colon cancer HCT116 (K-RAS mutant) xenografts were treated daily with PD0325901 at 25 mg/kg and imaged by dynamic [18F]FLT-PET after 1 and 10 days of initiating treatment. The drug decreased tumor [18F]FLT uptake after 1 and 10 days of treatment compared with control animals. The normalized (maximal) [18F]FLT uptake in SKMEL-28 xenografts (at 60 minutes NUVmax) after 1 day of vehicle or PD0325901 therapy was 1.81 +/- 0.18 versus 1.23 +/- 0.10, respectively (P = 0.03). In this model, NUVmax after 10 days was 2.07 +/- 0.40 versus 1.08 +/- 0.14, respectively (P = 0.03). The corresponding values for HCT116 tumors were 2.30 +/- 0.84 versus 1.88 +/- 0.36 (P = 0.045) after 1 day, and 1.97 +/- 0.13 versus 1.00 +/- 0.03 (P = 0.03) after 10 days. Similar changes were found for other [18F]FLT retention variables. The drug decreased phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, cyclin D1, and thymidine kinase 1 protein. Tumor [18F]FLT-PET variables correlated with proliferation as measured by Ki67 labeling index (r > or = 0.6
