Clinical evaluation of 123I-MIBG for assessment of the sympathetic nervous system in the heart (multi-center clinical trial). Multi-center clinical trial of 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) was carried out to assess its utility as a scintigraphic imaging agent reflecting sympathetic neuronal function in cardiovascular field. Studies were performed on patients with heart diseases of three categories, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and cardiomyopathy. Scintigraphic images, reflecting sympathetic neuronal function were obtained with 123I-MIBG from all of those categories of patients and the efficacy of the imaging was revealed in 781 (95.0%) out of 822 patients. In some patients abnormality was suggested in sympathetic neuronal function with 123I-MIBG imaging, in spite of normal findings with myocardial perfusion scintigraphy by 201TlCl. In all 981 patients studied with 123I-MIBG, there have been no severe adverse reactions, except complaints of burning on injection site of the agent or nausea, etc. from 4 patients. We conclude that 123I-MIBG imaging is one of the effective tools for diagnostic use reflecting topical sympathetic neuronal function in the heart, judging from its safety and efficacy.
