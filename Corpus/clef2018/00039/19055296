Effect of acupuncture at acupoints of the Shaoyang Meridian on cerebral glucose metabolism in the patient of chronic migraine. To observe response characteristics of human brain to acupuncture of corresponding channel point selection and probe into the central nervous mechanism of acupuncture at the points selected along channel.Six cases of chronic migraine were treated with acupuncture at Fengchi (GB 20), Waiguan (TE 5), Yang-lingquan (GB 34) on the Shaoyang Channel. Positron emission computerized tomography (PET-CT) was used for scanning and statistic parameter map (SPM 2) software was used to analyze the data and compare with healthy human brain function imaging and investigate the changes of metabolism of glucose in the brain of the patient of migraine before and after acupuncture.After acupuncture, excitation areas of the pain brain regions such as the brain stem, insula, etc. obviously reduced, and the brain function-reducing area turned from the right temporal lobe as main to bilateral temporal lobes with symmetry.The pons, insula, anterior frontal gyrus, etc. possibly are the target points of analgesic effect of acupuncture at the Shaoyang Channel on chronic migraine, and the change of metabolism reduction on bilateral temporal lobes induced by acupuncture possibly is one of the mechanisms for acu-puncture at points on the Shaoyang Channel for treatment of migraine. Acupuncture achieves whole and beneficial therapeutic effect possibly through coordination and redistribution of energy metabolism in the brain.
