Multidisciplinary approach to tumors of the pancreas and biliary tree. Tumors of the pancreas and biliary tree remain formidable challenges to patients and clinicians. These tumors elude early detection, rapidly spread locally and systemically, and frequently recur despite apparently complete resection. Cystic tumors of the pancreas, however, may represent a subset of patients who do not uniformly require aggressive resection, and a thoughtful, evidence-based approach to work-up allows for the rational application of surgical therapy. Increasing evidence supports treating patients who have pancreaticobiliary disease in a multidisciplinary setting.
