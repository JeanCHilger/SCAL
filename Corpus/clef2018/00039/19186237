Multidisciplinary treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) has been recognized as a unique tumor only in the last decade. Although rare as a clinical entity, there is much interest in the pathology and treatment because the KIT protooncogene mutation common to most GISTs can be inhibited by imatinib mesylate. Diagnosing and treating GIST requires a multidisciplinary approach, given the combination of pathologic and radiographic evaluation, surgical treatment, and oncologic care required to successfully treat patients with GIST.
