Performance of integrated FDG-PET/contrast-enhanced CT in the staging and restaging of colorectal cancer: comparison with PET and enhanced CT. The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of PET/CT as a one step examination in patients with colorectal cancer. Therefore we proved whether diagnostic PET/CT adds information over PET or contrast-enhanced CT alone for staging or restaging of patients with colorectal cancer.Seventy-three patients (46 males and 27 females age range: 50-81 yearsOf the 73 patients 26 patients underwent PET/CT for staging and 47 for restaging. 266 metastases could be detected in 60 patients. Contrast-enhanced PET/CT had a lesion-based sensitivity of 100%, contrast-enhanced CT of 91% and PET of 85%. PET/CT identified 2 lesions as false positive. PET/CT could also reach a patient-based sensitivity of 100%, which was superior to contrast-enhanced CT and PET.Our study clearly demonstrated the added value of contrast-enhanced PET/CT in staging and restaging patients with colorectal cancer over CT and PET alone.
