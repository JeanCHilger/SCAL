Induction of GAP-43 modulates neuroplasticity in PBSC (CD34+) implanted-Parkinson's model. As a result of the progressive decrease in efficacy of drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) and the rapid development of motor complications, effective alternative treatments for PD are required. In a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced Parkinson's rat model, intracerebral peripheral blood stem cell (CD34(+)) (PBSC) transplantation significantly protected dopaminergic neurons from 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity, enhanced neural repair of tyrosine hydroxylase neurons through up-regulation of Bcl-2, facilitated stem cell plasticity, and attenuated activation of microglia, in comparison with vehicle-control rats. The 6-OHDA-lesioned hemi-Parkinsonian rats receiving intrastriatal transplantation of PBSCs also showed: 1) enhanced glucose metabolism in the lesioned striatum and thalamus, demonstrated by [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), 2) improved neurochemical activity as shown by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS), and 3) significantly reduced rotational behavior in comparison with control lesioned rats. These observations might be explained by an up-regulation of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) expression because improvements in neurological dysfunction were blocked by injection of MK-801 in the PBSC-treated group. In addition, a significant increase in neurotrophic factor expression was found in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the PBSC-treated group. In summary, this protocol may be a useful strategy for the treatment of clinical PD.
