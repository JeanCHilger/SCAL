Characteristics of integrated 18F-FDG PET/CT in Pulmonary Cryptococcosis. Pulmonary cryptococcosis is an uncommon cause of pulmonary nodules found by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) scans. It is rarely reported but may mislead interpretation.To describe the (18)F-FDG PET/CT findings of pulmonary cryptococcosis.The (18)F-FDG PET/CT images of seven patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis were evaluated.The (18)F-FDG PET/CT exams showed single or multiple nodular lesions. The standardized uptake values (SUV) in early images varied significantly for the seven patients (ranging from 2.2 to 11.6). Delayed SUVs showed significant increases in four patients.Pulmonary cryptococcosis mimics primary or metastatic lung cancer on (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan. Tissue confirmation should be considered for any suspicious pulmonary nodules found on (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan with an SUV score higher than 2.5, in order to avoid overdiagnosis or overstaging.
