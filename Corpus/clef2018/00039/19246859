Utility of positioning the gamma camera at 30 degrees at RAO on (99m)Tc-GSA hepatic scintigraphy. (99m)Tc-GSA hepatic scintigraphy can evaluate the physiopathology and hepatic functions in liver diseases. The procedure usually proceeds by placing a gamma camera in the anterior and frontal positions parallel to the frontal cross section of the patient. However, because the liver is situated from the front towards the right side of the body, the distance between the liver and the gamma camera can attenuate the isotope count. The present study examines the notion that placing the gamma camera at a RAO position for imaging will augment the counts from the liver, thus enabling a more accurate evaluation of hepatic function. We analyzed the Time Activity Curve on a RAO image selected from raw data acquired using dynamic SPECT. A comparison of images obtained in this manner with analytical data from frontal images indicated that positioning the gamma camera at 30 degrees at RAO, can capture more radioisotope counts than the frontal view, thus enabling a more accurate evaluation of hepatic function.
