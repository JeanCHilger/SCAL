Overexpression in Escherichia coli and purification of human fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2). Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) is a member of a large family of structurally related proteins that affect the growth, differentiation, migration, and survival of many cell types. The human FGF-2 gene (encoding residues 1-155) was synthesized by PCR from 20 oligonucleotides and cloned into plasmid pET-32a. A high expression level (1 g/liter) of a fused protein thioredoxin/FGF-2 was achieved in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). The fusion protein was purified from the soluble fraction of cytoplasmic proteins on a Ni-NTA agarose column. After cleavage of the thioredoxin/FGF-2 fusion with recombinant human enteropeptidase light chain, the target protein FGF-2 was purified on a heparin-Sepharose column. The yield of FGF-2 without N- and C-terminal tags and with high activity was 100 mg per liter of cell culture. Mutations C78S and C96S in the amino acid sequence of the protein decreased FGF-2 dimer formation without affecting its solubility and biological activity.
