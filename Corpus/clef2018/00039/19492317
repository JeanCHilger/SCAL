Hypercalcemia and osteoblastic lesions induced by 13-Cis-retinoic acid mimicking relapsed neuroblastoma. A 6-year-old male diagnosed with extensive neuroblastoma was treated with chemotherapy, surgery, autotransplantation, and radiotherapy. He was then enrolled on a study to assess the monoclonal antibody Ch14.18 (anti-GD2) with 13 cis-retinoic acid. 13-cis-retinoic acid therapy caused severe bone pain and hypercalcemia. Bone scans showed multiple osteoblastic lesions suggesting recurrent disease however MIBG scans were negative. Serum markers of bone turnover were increased and the patient required pamidronate therapy to treat persistent hypercalcemia. Retinoic acid toxicity needs to be considered in the differential of painful osteoblastic lesions and/or hypercalcemia. MIBG scans can assist in differentiating from recurrent disease.
