Autologous bone marrow stem cell neurotransplantation in stroke patients. An open study. Bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) were transplanted into the perilesional area in five patients bearing sequels of stroke, to evaluate the safety of the procedure and tolerance to the transplanted cells.Cells were obtained from bone marrow samples taken from the same patient and stereotactically implanted into the targets, determined using a combination of images, and trans-operative recording of multiunit activity. The cells were implanted in several points along tracts in the perilesional region.No important adverse events derived from surgery or transplant were observed during the one year follow-up period, or detected using a combination of tests and functional measurements applied pre- and post-surgically. In contrast, some improvements were observed regarding the neurological condition of the patients, but the small number of patients in the study does not allow any conclusive statement.Our results demonstrate that BMSC can be safely transplanted into the brain of patients, with excellent tolerance and without complications, using the methods described here.
