Modest anti-cancer activity of a bile acid acylated heparin derivative in a PC14PE6 induced orthotopic lung cancer model. A novel chemically modified heparin derivative, heparin-deoxycholic acid nano-particles, has lower anticoagulant activity, and was recently reported to have significant anti-tumor effects on squamous head and neck cancer cells. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-tumor effects of heparin-deoxycholic acid nano-particles in a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line.An orthotopic lung cancer model in 16 mice was developed using intra-thoracic injections of 0.5x10(6) PC14PE6 cells. Ten days after inoculation, the mice were divided into two groups. PBS and Heparin-DOCA particles were injected once a day every 3 days in the tail vein, for a total of 5 injections. The body weight and survival of each mouse were monitored and the tumor size in the lung was measured by SPECT-CT before and after heparin-DOCA nano-particle treatment.IThe HD particles had no significant cytotoxicity when the PC9 cells were treated in vitro. There was no statistical difference in tumor size, body weight and survival between the HD treated and control groups in vivo. Furthermore, there was no difference in the amount of CD31 between tumor tissues in the two study groups.HD synthesized with unfractionated heparin had no apparent inhibitory effects on tumor growth in a PC14PE6 cell induced orthotopic lung cancer mouse model. The HD particles did not significantly inhibit tumor-induced angiogenesis at the tumor sites.
