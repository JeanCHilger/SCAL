Hepatic metastases of gastric adenocarcinoma showing metabolic remission on FDG-PET despite an increase in size on CT. We report a gastric adenocarcinoma patient with liver metastases. The metastases showed progression on computed tomography (CT), but this was not true progression in terms of metabolic activity according to (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Discordance between size criteria and metabolic criteria has been reported in liver gastrointestinal stromal tumors, hepatomas, and renal cell carcinomas after dramatic responses with targeted therapies such as imatinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib (1-6). However, this discordance has been rarely reported in liver metastases of gastric adenocarcinoma when treated with conventional chemotherapy.
