(123)I-BMIPP and (99m)Tc-TF discordance on myocardial scintigraphy and it's correlation with functional recovery following acute myocardial infarction: role of conventional echocardiography. (123)I-beta-methyl-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) and (99m)Tc-Tetrofosmin (TF) mismatch designated as stunned myocardium having both systolic and diastolic components. The degree of mismatch might reflect subsequent functional improvement, and this study was designed to unravel the impact of mismatched defect score (MMDS) on recovery of both systolic and diastolic function following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Forty patients with recent AMI were recruited, and all of them underwent emergency percutaneous coronary intervention. Echocardiography and BMIPP and TF cardiac scintigraphy were performed on 7 +/- 3 days of admission. Follow up echocardiography was performed after 3 months. MMDS were compared with the systolic [ejection fraction (EF) and wall motion score index (WMSI)] and diastolic [peak velocity of early diastolic filling of mitral inflow/peak early diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus(E/E') and left atrial volume index(LAVI)] parameters. BMIPP defect score was significantly higher than the TF defect score and there was a strong positive correlation between them (r = 0.90, P < 0.00001). Thirty-two (80%) patients showed mismatched defect and rest 8(20%) showed matched defect. Of 32 patients 24(75%), 22(69%), 19(59%), and 20(62.5%) showed improved EF, WMSI, E/E' and LAVI respectively. Conversely out of 8 only 2(25%), 1(12.5%), and 2(25%) patients showed improvement of EF, WMSI and LAVI, respectively. E/E' was not improved in patients with matched defect. MMDS were significantly correlated with the improvement of EF (r = -0.46, P = 0.002), WMSI (r = 0.41, P = 0.007), E/E' (r = 0.56, P < 0.0002), and LAVI (r = 0.44, P = 0.004). Mismatched defect score could predict the approximate amount of viable dysfunctional myocardium, and the degree of mismatch showed a significant correlation with the improvement of both systolic and diastolic function.
