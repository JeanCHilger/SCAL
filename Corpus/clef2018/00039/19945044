Utilization of advanced imaging technologies for target delineation in radiation oncology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utilization of advanced imaging technologies for target delineation among radiation oncologists in the United States.A random sample of 1,600 radiation oncologists was contacted by Internet, e-mail, and fax and questioned regarding the use of advanced imaging technologies, clinical applications, and future plans for use. Advanced imaging technologies were defined as any of the following that were directly incorporated into radiation therapy planning: MRI, PET, single-photon emission CT, 4-D CT, functional MRI, and MR spectroscopy.Of 1,089 contactable physicians, 394 (36%) responded. Of respondents, 65% were in private practice and 35% were in academic practice. The proportion using any advanced imaging technology for target delineation was 95%. However, the majority reported only rare (in <25% of their patients 46.6%) or infrequent (in 25%-50% of their patientsAdvanced imaging technologies are widely used by US radiation oncologists for target delineation. Although the majority of respondents used them in <50% of their patients, the frequency of utilization is expected to increase. Studies determining the optimal application of these technologies in radiation therapy planning are needed.
