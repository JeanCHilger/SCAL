EEG-fMRI: adding to standard evaluations of patients with nonlesional frontal lobe epilepsy. In patients with nonlesional frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), the delineation of the epileptogenic zone is difficult. Therefore these patients are often not considered for surgery due to an unclear seizure focus. The aim of this study was to investigate whether EEG-fMRI can add useful information in the preoperative evaluation of these patients.Nine nonlesional FLE patients were studied with EEG-fMRI using a 3 T scanner. Spike-related blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes were compared to the topography of the spikes and to PET and SPECT results if available. The structural MRIs were reviewed for subtle abnormalities in areas that showed BOLD responses. For operated patients, postoperative resection and histology were compared to BOLD responses.Concordance between spike localization and positive BOLD response was found in 8 patients. PET and SPECT investigations corresponded with BOLD signal changes in 6 of 7 investigations. In 2 cases, reviewing the structural MRI guided by EEG-fMRI data resulted in considering a suspicious deep sulcus. Two patients were operated. In 1, the resected cortex corresponded with the suspicious sulcus and fMRI results and histology showed cortical dysplasia. In another, histology revealed an extended microdysgenesis not visible on structural MRI. EEG-fMRI had shown activation just adjacent to the resected pathologic area.Our study provides different types of support (topography, concordance with PET and SPECT, structural peculiarities, postoperative histology) that EEG-fMRI may help to delineate the epileptic focus in patients with nonlesional frontal lobe epilepsy, a challenging group in the preoperative evaluation.
