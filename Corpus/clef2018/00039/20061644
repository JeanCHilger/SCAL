Neuroimaging through the course of Alzheimer's disease. This review uses an image-indexed framework for the full course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to provide a perspective on recent neuroimaging findings in the literature. Modalities considered include morphometric, diffusion tensor, and functional magnetic resonance imaging, and resting/functional metabolic and amyloid-label positron emission tomography. The major focus is on the AD pre-states (normal but high AD risk and mild cognitive impairment), and transition from mild cognitive impairment to mild AD. Imaging results relevant to the conduct of future prevention and early intervention trials are emphasized.
