Incidence of Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism in northern Sweden: a population-based study. The differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders is difficult, especially early in the course of the diseases. The clinical subtypes of Parkinson's disease (PD) have not so far been described in newly diagnosed patients. We present a prospective incidence cohort study of patients with idiopathic parkinsonian syndromes in the Ume√• region in northern Sweden identified over a 4-year period. The clinical diagnoses were re-evaluated at follow-up visits at 12 months. We found 138 patients with parkinsonism: 112 PD, 12 multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), six progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and eight unclassifiable patients. The crude incidences for all age ranges per 100,000 were: PD 19.7 (95% confidence interval 16.1-23.3) MSA-P 2.1 (1.1-3.7)
