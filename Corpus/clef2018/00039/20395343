Tracing cardiac metabolism in vivo: one substrate at a time. In the myocardial cell, a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions results in the efficient transfer of chemical energy into mechanical energy. The goals of this article are to emphasize the ability of noninvasive imaging techniques using isotopic tracers to detect the metabolic footprints of heart disease and to propose that cardiac metabolic imaging is more than a useful adjunct to current myocardial perfusion imaging studies. A strength of metabolic imaging is in the assessment of regional myocardial differences in metabolic activity, probing for 1 substrate at a time. We hope that new and developing methods of cardiac imaging will lead to the earlier detection of heart disease and improve the management and quality of life for patients afflicted with ischemic and nonischemic heart muscle disorders.
