Radiosynthesis and biological evaluation of a promising sigma(2)-receptor ligand radiolabeled with fluorine-18 or iodine-125 as a PET/SPECT probe for imaging breast cancer. Sigma-2 receptors represent an endogenous marker for proliferation in solid tumors. The high affinity, high selectivity sigma(2) receptor ligand N-(4-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)butyl)-2-(2-fluoroethoxy)-5-iodo-3-methoxybenzamide (3) was separately radiolabeled with F-18 and I-125. The radiolabeling yield was 30% and 70% for [(18)F]3 and [(125)I]3, respectively. Studies of [(125)I]3 using murine 66 breast tumor membrane homogenates and evaluation of [(18)F]3 and [(125)I]3 in 66 tumor-bearing mice indicate that this ligand has potential as a PET or a SPECT probe for imaging sigma(2) receptors in breast cancer.
