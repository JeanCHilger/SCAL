 The lymphatic system consists of a complex network of lymph vessels, organs, and lymph nodes, and it plays important roles in fluid homeostasis, toxin removal, and immune function (1). Lymph nodes are responsible for filtering lymph fluid and removing foreign materials such as bacteria and cancer cells (2). When lymph nodes become infected or are the sites of tumor metastases, they increase in size. Imaging of a sentinel node, the first lymph node into which the primary tumor drains, can facilitate diagnosis of nodal metastases in cancers (1). Thus, the development of imaging agents to target lymph nodes provokes a great deal of research interest. Colloids that are 2 to 200 nm in length are found to enter into lymphatics through clefts in the lymphatic walls or by endocytosis through the walls (2). After interstitial injection, colloids are transported to the nearest draining lymph node (the sentinel node). The colloids are retained through nonspecific mechanical trapping in the reticular meshwork of the node (2). The trapped colloids are released with time for subsequent migration to other downstream nodes. Lyposomes, a special type of colloid, are used in lymph nodeâ€“targeted drug delivery and imaging (3). Encapsulation of imaging agents in liposomes increases lymph node targeting and yields enhanced detection sensitivity, for which only a small fraction of liposome-encapsulated labeling is cleared through the lymphatic vessels (3).
