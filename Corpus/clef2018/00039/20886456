The role of PET imaging in patients with lymphoma. Positron-Emission-Tomography (PET) has emerged as a diagnostic gold standard for most tumor entities during the last 20 years, especially for patients suffering from malignant lymphoma. The development and distribution of machines allowing for hybrid imaging, i.e. the simultaneous acquisition of PET and CT datasets, and the possibility to assess even small pathologic findings with fused PET/CT image visualization, once more significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy of PET. Based on an excellent sensitivity the metabolic imaging with PET or PET/CT allows for a reliable overall assessment of patients with malignant lymphoma before therapy, for the early identification of non-responders during therapy, and for the diagnosis of relapse after therapy.
