Imaging of the diabetic foot diagnostic dilemmas. Multiple diagnostic imaging modalities are available and beneficial for the evaluation of the diabetic foot. There is not yet "one best test" for sorting out the diagnostic dilemmas commonly encountered. The differentiation of cellulitis alone from underlying osteomyelitis and the early detection of abscesses remain important diagnostic goals. Equally important, differentiation of osteomyelitis and neuroarthropathy remains a difficult job. This is often compounded by postoperative diabetic foot states status after reconstruction. Diagnostic evaluation often involves multiple studies that are complementary and that include conventional radiography, computed tomography, nuclear medicine scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, and positron emission tomography.
