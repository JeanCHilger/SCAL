Activation of human neutrophil phospholipase D by three separable mechanisms. Activation of human neutrophils by receptor-mediated agonists, the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, or the protein kinase C activator phorbol myristate acetate all stimulated phospholipase D activity. This was demonstrated by the increased formation of phosphatidic acid, and in the presence of ethanol, phosphatidylethanol (PEt) accumulation. EGTA completely inhibited A23187-induced PEt formation, but only one-half of the fMLP-induced PEt accumulation. Staurosporin, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, strongly inhibited PMA-induced PEt formation, but actually stimulated the formation of PEt in response to fMLP by several-fold. Thus, increased cytosolic Ca2+ and activated protein kinase C can each lead to activation of phospholipase D, but neither is required for receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase D activity. Wortmannin is an irreversible inhibitor of the oxidative burst, but does not inhibit NADPH oxidase or known components of signal transduction. Wortmannin inhibited activation of phospholipase D in response to fMPL. It did not directly inhibit phospholipase D, as the response to A23187 was unaffected. Wortmannin did not inhibit other fMPL-stimulated events, such as aggregation or adherence. We conclude that inhibition by wortmannin defines a third pathway to activation of phospholipase D. Further, its effect on phospholipase D correlates with its effect on the respiratory burst.
