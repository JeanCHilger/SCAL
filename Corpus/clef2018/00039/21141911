Highly selective and sensitive near-infrared fluorescent sensors for cadmium in aqueous solution. On the basis of tricabocyanine, two near-infrared fluorescent sensors CYP-1 and CYP-2 have been designed and synthesized. Both of them can selectively and sensitively recognize Cd(2+) from other metal ions, especially the CYP-2, which can distinguish Cd(2+) in neutral buffer solution.
