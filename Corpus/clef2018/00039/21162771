Hemodynamic studies of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas using arterial spin-labeling MR imaging. Arterial spin-labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive acquisition of the brain perfusion information in cerebrovascular disease. We investigated hemodynamic changes in intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) using ASL-MRI. ASL-MRI by a Q2TIPS sequence on a 3.0-Tesla MRI was performed for three patients with Cognard's IIa+b type of DAVFs before and after treatment. Perfusion images obtained by ASL-MRI (ASL images) before treatment were visually compared with those by single-photon emission computed tomography images (SPECT images). Increasing rates of temporal changes of regional perfusion values in ASL images (ASL values) before and after treatment were also calculated. In all three patients, ASL images before treatment demonstrated high perfusion in regions around the shunting areas, where normal or low perfusion were detected on SPECT images thus, ASL images might have demonstrated the abundant arterial shunting flow via the fistulas. On days eight to 20 after treatment, ASL values around the shunt areas remained the same or decreased, and those in the regions other than the shunt areas increased in all three patients. This might have been due to a combination of the following: a decrease in shunt flow volume, an amelioration of venous congestion, and a sustained an upward shift in the autoregulation of the brain perfusion pressure. All regional ASL values decreased on days 112 and 120 after treatment in two patients, which possibly reflects a reduction in the upward shift in autoregulation. ASL-MRI might be useful for identifying the hemodynamic behavior of DAVFs before and after treatment.
