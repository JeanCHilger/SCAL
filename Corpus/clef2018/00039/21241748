Molecular imaging in neuroscience research with small-animal PET in rodents. Cognitive neuroscience, which studies the biological basis of mental processes, widely uses neuroimaging technologies like functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) to study the human brain. Small laboratory animals, like rodents, are commonly used in brain research and provide abundant models of human brain diseases. The development of high-resolution small-animal PET and various radiotracers together with sophisticated methods for analyzing functional brain imaging data have accelerated research on brain function and neurotransmitter release during behavioral tasks in rodents. In this review, we first summarize advances in the methodology of cognitive research brought about by the development of sophisticated methods for whole-brain imaging analysis and improvements in neuroimaging protocols. Then, we discuss basic mechanisms related to metabolic changes and the expression of neurotransmitters in various brain areas during task-induced neural activity. In particular, we discuss glucose metabolism imaging and brain receptor imaging for various receptor systems. Finally, we discuss the current status and future perspectives. Mechanisms of neurotransmitter expression will probably become an increasingly important field of study in the future, leading to more collaboration between investigators in fields such as computational and theoretical neuroscience.
