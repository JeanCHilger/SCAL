The value of 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging for sinonasal malignant melanoma. The aim this study was to evaluate imaging findings using position emission tomography (PET) in combination with computed tomography (CT) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) in sinonasal malignant melanoma (SNMM) of the head and neck in a retrospective analysis of a consecutive cohort of patients. (18)F-FDG-PET/CT examinations were performed for initial staging and compared with CT or magnetic resonance tomography (MRI), and (18)F-FDG-PET alone. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively with regard to the location and the size of the tumor. Furthermore, locoregional and distant metastases with a consecutive change in therapy detected by (18)F-FDG-PET/CT were assessed. Ten patients suffering from sinonasal malignant melanoma were staged and followed by (18)F-FDG-PET/CT imaging. A total of 34 examinations were obtained. (18)F-FDG-PET/CT depicted all primary tumors adequately. Aside from one cerebral metastasis all regional and distant metastases were truly identified by using this method. In summary, if available, (18)F-FDG-PET/CT is a valuable imaging modality for staging and re-staging sinonasal malignant melanoma to evaluate expansion of the primary tumor, locoregional disease, and distant metastases.
