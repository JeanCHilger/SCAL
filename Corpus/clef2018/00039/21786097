Comparison of diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of ¹⁸F-FDG-PET/CT, ¹³¹I-scintigraphy, and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging for postoperative thyroid cancer. The first aim of this study was to compare the detectability of metastasis of postoperative differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) among (131)I whole body scintigraphy (IWBS), fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT), and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). The second aim was to clarify the association between the image pattern and prognosis.We evaluated 70 postoperative DTC patients on both a patient basis and an organ basis (lymph nodes, lung, bone), and we analyzed the correlation between the image pattern and the prognosis.For the patient-basis analysis, the detectability by IWBS, PET/CT, and DWI was 67.1%, 84.2%, and 57.6%, respectively. IWBS provided complementary information to that provided by PET/CT in 11 of 70 (15.7%) cases. For the organ-basis analysis, IWBS was the best detector for lymph node metastasis (72.4%). PET/CT was superior to IWBS for detecting metastasis of bone (85.7% vs. 71.4%) and lung (94.1% vs. 62.7%). For the correlation analysis, PET and DWI positivity were the factors predicting a poor prognosis.PET/CT was the best modality for detecting metastases in postoperative DTC patients, although IWBS provided complementary information. Because PET/CT and DWI gave similar information (e.g., positivity) suggesting poor prognoses, the combination of IWBS and DWI might be the method of choice for monitoring postoperative DTC.
