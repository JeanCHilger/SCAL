Unusual metal ion selectivities of the highly preorganized tetradentrate ligand 1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-dicarboxamide: a thermodynamic and fluorescence study. Some metal ion complexing properties of the ligand PDAM (1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-dicarboxamide) in aqueous solution are reported. Using UV-visible spectroscopy to follow the intense π-π* transitions of PDAM as a function of metal ion concentration, log K(1) values in 0.1 M NaClO(4) and at 25 °C are, for Cu(II), 3.56(5) Ni(II), 3.06(5)
