Coronary artery calcium scoring. Numerous clinical studies have shown that coronary artery calcium scoring provides substantial incremental risk prediction beyond conventional coronary risk factors for coronary heart disease events. About half of all patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) present initially with unexpected myocardial infarction or sudden death. Early identification of this subgroup of patients is vital for institution of intensive, early preventive measures to decrease morbidity and mortality due to CAD.
