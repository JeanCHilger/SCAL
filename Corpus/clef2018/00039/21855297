Preictal changes in cerebral haemodynamics: review of findings and insights from intracerebral EEG. The possibility of recording changes in brain signals occurring before epileptic seizures is of considerable interest, both as markers for seizure anticipation and as a window into the mechanisms of seizure generation. Several studies have reported preictal changes on electrophysiological traces. More recently, observations have been made of changes occurring on haemodynamic signals before interictal events or before seizures, often without concurrent changes observed on electrophysiology. We present here a critical review of these findings, in optical imaging, SPECT and fMRI, followed by a discussion based on data from intracerebral EEG.
