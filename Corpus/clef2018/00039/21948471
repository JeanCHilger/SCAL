In vivo positron emission tomography imaging using the sodium iodide symporter as a reporter gene. Information regarding the biodistribution and kinetics of spread of oncolytic viruses is crucial for safety considerations in the design of future, more efficient reagents. Although optical imaging can be used to gain this information in rodent models, imaging with radioactive isotopes presents the advantage of being directly applicable to humans, and preclinical imaging data can provide a basis for the design of clinical protocols. In this chapter, we describe the use of the Na/I symporter as a reporter gene, associated with (124)I-NaI as a radiotracer, to monitor the anatomical localization, as well as the propagation, of oncolytic viruses using dedicated, preclinical positron emission tomography scanners.
