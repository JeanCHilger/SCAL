F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography in tuberculosis of the hip: A case report and brief review of literature. Tuberculosis (TB) has become a global health concern. Cross-sectional imaging modalities like ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging play an important role in the diagnosis, assessment of disease extent and response to treatment. PET/CT, a unique molecular imaging technique, allows the most accurate correlation of anatomic and metabolic information. We report a case wherein PET/CT played a significant role and contributed valuable information in the evaluation of a patient with TB of the hip. A brief review of the existing literature on the role of PET/CT in musculoskeletal TB is also discussed.
