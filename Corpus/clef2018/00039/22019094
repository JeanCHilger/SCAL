Radiation dosimetry estimates of [18F]-fluoroacetate based on biodistribution data of rats. We estimated the dosimetry of [(18)F]fluoroacetate (FAC) with the method established by MIRD based on biodistribution data of rats. We selected some important organs and computed their residence time, their absorbed doses and effective dose with the (%ID(Organ)) (human) data using OLINDA/EXM 1.1 program. We observed the highest absorbed doses in the heart wall (0.025mGy/MBq) and the lowest in skin (0.0079mGy/MBq). The total mean absorbed doses and the effective doses were 0.011mGy/MBq and 0.014mSv/MBq, respectively. A 370-MBq injection of FAC leads to an estimated effective dose of 5.2mSv. The potential radiation risk associated with FAC/PET imaging is well within the accepted limits.
