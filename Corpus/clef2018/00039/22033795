Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: update on combining genetic and brain-imaging measures. Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is often missed or delayed in clinical practice thus, methods to improve early detection would provide opportunities for early intervention, symptomatic treatment, and improved patient function. Emerging data suggest that the disease process begins years before clinical diagnostic confirmation. This paper reviews current research focusing on methods for more specific and sensitive early detection using measures of genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease and functional brain imaging. This approach aims to identify patients in a presymptomatic stage for early treatment to delay progressive cognitive decline and disease onset.
