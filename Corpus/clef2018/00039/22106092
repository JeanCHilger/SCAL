Selective two-step labeling of proteins with an off/on fluorescent probe. We present a novel design strategy for off/on fluorescent probes suitable for selective two-step labeling of proteins. To validate this strategy, we designed and synthesized an off/on fluorescent probe, 1-Ni(2+), which targets a cysteine-modified hexahistidine (His) tag. The probe consists of dichlorofluorescein conjugated with nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-Ni(2+) as the His-tag recognition site and a 2,4-dinitrophenyl ether moiety, which quenches the probe's fluorescence by photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) from the excited fluorophore to the 2,4-dinitrophenyl ether (donor-excited PeT d-PeT) and also has reactivity with cysteine. His-tag recognition by the NTA-Ni(2+) moiety is followed by removal of the 2,4-dinitrophenyl ether quencher by proximity-enhanced reaction with the cysteine residue of the modified tag
