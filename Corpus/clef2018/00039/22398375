Toward a dynamic biomarker model in Alzheimer's disease. Biomarkers, both biological and imaging, are indicators of specific changes that characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in vivo. Knowing the precise relationship between biomarkers and disease severity would allow for accurate disease staging and possible forecasting of decline. Jack et al. suggested as an initial hypothesis that this relationship be sigmoidal the objective of this article is to determine, using large-scale population data from ADNI, the precise shape of this association. We considered six different models (linear
