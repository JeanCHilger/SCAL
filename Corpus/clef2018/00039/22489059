Synthesis of Gd and (68)Ga complexes in conjugation with a conformationally optimized RGD sequence as potential MRI and PET tumor-imaging probes. We report the synthesis of novel chelates of Gd and (68)Ga with DPTA, DOTA, HP-DOA3, as well as with AAZTA, a novel chelating agent developed by our research group. These chelating agents were appropriately conjugated, prior to metal complexation, with DB58, an RGD peptidomimetic, conformationally constrained on an azabicycloalkane scaffold and endowed with high affinity for integrin α(ν)β(3) . Because α(ν)β(3) is involved in neo-angiogenesis in solid tumors and is also directly expressed in cancer cells (e.g. glioblastomas, melanomas) and ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers, these constructs could prove useful as molecular imaging probes in cancer diagnosis by MRI or PET techniques. Molecular modeling, integrin binding assays, and relaxivity assessments allowed the selection of compounds suitable for multiple expression on dendrimeric or nanoparticulate structures. These results also led us to an exploratory investigation of (68)Ga complexation for the promising (68)Ga-PET technique the AAZTA complex 15((68)Ga) exhibited uptake in a xenograft model of glioblastoma, suggesting potentially useful developments with new probes with improved affinity.
