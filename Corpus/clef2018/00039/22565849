Imaging of protein synthesis: in vitro and in vivo evaluation of (44)Sc-DOTA-puromycin. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether (44)Sc-labeled puromycin can be utilized for imaging of protein synthesis in vivo.For micro-positron emission tomographic (μPET) studies, 20-25 MBq of [(44)Sc]-DOTA-puromycin was administered to tumor-bearing rats, and animals were scanned for 1 h dynamically. Results were further validated by dissecting organs and tissues of the animals after the measurement and in vitro blocking experiments using puromycin or cycloheximide to block protein synthesis.μPET images of tumor-bearing rats showed significant tumor uptake of [(44)Sc]-DOTA-puromycin and a clear-cut tumor visualization. In both blocking experiments, cellular uptake of [(44)Sc]-DOTA-puromycin ([(44)Sc]-DOTA-Pur) could be suppressed by blocking protein synthesis.We report for the first time successful μPET imaging with (44)Sc obtained from a (44)Ti/(44)Sc generator, as well as noninvasive μPET imaging of ribosomal activity, respectively protein synthesis, with a puromycin-based radiopharmaceutical and the direct correlation between cellular uptake of [(44)Sc]-DOTA-Pur and protein synthesis.
