Synthesis and evaluation of [18F]Fluorobutyl ethacrynic amide: a potential PET tracer for studying glutathione transferase. [(18)F]Flurobutyl ethacrynic amide ([(18)F]FBuEA) was prepared from the precursor tosylate N-Boc-N-[4-(toluenesulfonyloxy)butyl]ethacrynic amide with a radiochemical yield of 3%, a specific activity of 48 GBq/μmol and radiochemical purity of 98%. Chemical conjugation of [(18)F]FBuEA with glutathione (GSH) via a self-coupling reaction and enzymatic conjugation under catalysis of glutathiontransferase alpha (GST-α) and π provided about 41% yields of radiochemical conjugated product [(18)F]FBuEA-GSH, 85% and 5-16%, respectively. The catalytic selectivity of this tracer toward GST-alpha was addressed. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of [(18)F]FBuEA in normal rats showed that a homogeneous pattern of radioactivity was distributed in the liver, suggesting a catalytic role of GST. By contrast, PET images of [(18)F]FBuEA in rats with thioacetamide-induced cholangiocarcinoma displayed a heterogeneous pattern of radioactive accumulation with cold spots in tumor lesions. PET imaging with [(18)F]FBuEA could be used for early diagnosis of hepatic tumor with a low GST activity as well as liver function.
