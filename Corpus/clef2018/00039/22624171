 Autoimmune processes and other environmental factors that destroy β-cells located in the pancreatic islet cells are known to promote the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1 diabetes) in individuals genetically predisposed to the disease (2). Due to this destruction, the net mass of the β-cells in the islet cells of the pancreas is reduced, which leads to decreased production of insulin in the individual, and the maintenance of blood glucose at proper physiological levels is impaired. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease and is primarily caused by insulin resistance as a consequence of low insulin secretion by the β-cells. This form of diabetes can often be corrected with exercise, diet control, and/or medication (3). Upon diagnosis of diabetes, it is important to determine the individual's β-cell mass (BCM) or volume to devise a successful treatment regimen for the condition (4). Changes in the BCM during the onset of diabetes is poorly understood, and an indirect method that measures the amount of stimulated insulin secretion by the pancreas is currently used to quantify the BCM in humans (5). However, the β-cells appear to have a reserved capacity to produce insulin, so the use of insulin secretion as a determinant of BCM is of limited value (5). As an alternative to determine insulin secretion to quantify BCM, investigators have evaluated the use of noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging techniques to determine the BCM in rats with the use of
