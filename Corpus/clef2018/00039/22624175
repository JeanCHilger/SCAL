 The β-cell mass (BCM) is a useful indicator of the function of the pancreas. In type I diabetes, β-cells are destroyed, leading to a dramatic decrease in BCM. In type II diabetes, there is a slow and continuous decrease in BCM because of peripheral insulin resistance and increased demand for insulin. Vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) is present in brain monoaminergic neurons and is responsible for collecting neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) from the cytoplasm and storing them in vesicles for synaptic release (1). VMAT2 is also highly expressed by β-cells in the endocrine pancreas but not in the exocrine pancreas. VMAT2 is expressed mainly on the β-cells in the islets of Langerhans and comprises 1%–2% of the pancreatic mass. VMAT2 is a potential target for noninvasive assessment of BCM and pancreatic function. VMAT2 has been studied noninvasively
