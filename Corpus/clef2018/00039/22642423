The emerging role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. Stereotactic radiosurgery is an emerging treatment option offered to patients with Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Radiosurgery is performed as an outpatient procedure and provides a safe and effective non invasive treatment for focal GBM. High energy beams originating from cobalt sources placed into an helmet (Gamma-Knife) or generated by a linear accelerator (LINAC) rotating on a gantry (X-Knife, Novalis) or maneuvered by a robotic arm (CyberKnife) are delivered with submillimetric accuracy to a selected intracranial target. Treatment accuracy is provided by image-guided volumetric CT and MR studies complemented with advanced metabolic neuroimaging techniques such as CT-PET. Radiosurgery is typically used as a salvage treatment in patients with recurrent GBM to avoid further surgical procedures or as a complement to conventional fractionated radiotherapy. This paper reviews the emerging role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of GBM.
