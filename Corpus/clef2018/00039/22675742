 The sodium-dependent phosphate transporter NaPi2b is overexpressed in 70%â€“90% of ovarian cancers (1). Although NaPi2b is believed to maintain phosphate homeostasis in the human body, the exact role of this transporter in neoplastic transformation and ovarian cancer tumor growth is unclear. Investigators have developed a murine anti- NaPi2b monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated MX35, and showed that
