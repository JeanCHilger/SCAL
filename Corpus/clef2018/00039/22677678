The role of brain glucose metabolism in the development of cognitive dysfunctions in patients with remitting and secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis. To study mechanisms of development of cognitive dysfunctions in multiple sclerosis (MS), brain glucose metabolism has been investigated using PET method. We have studied 61 patients with different types of MS course. Correlations between cognitive dysfunctions and regional glucose metabolic rate were revealed. The authors suggest that metabolic dysfunctions of the grey matter play the important role in the pathogenesis of cognitive disturbances in MS.
