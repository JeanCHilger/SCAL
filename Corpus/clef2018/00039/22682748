Spatially resolved regression analysis of pre-treatment FDG, FLT and Cu-ATSM PET from post-treatment FDG PET: an exploratory study. To quantify associations between pre-radiotherapy and post-radiotherapy PET parameters via spatially resolved regression.Ten canine sinonasal cancer patients underwent PET/CT scans of [(18)F]FDG (FDG(pre)), [(18)F]FLT (FLT(pre)), and [(61)Cu]Cu-ATSM (Cu-ATSM(pre)). Following radiotherapy regimens of 50 Gy in 10 fractions, veterinary patients underwent FDG PET/CT scans at 3 months (FDG(post)). Regression of standardized uptake values in baseline FDG(pre), FLT(pre) and Cu-ATSM(pre) tumour voxels to those in FDG(post) images was performed for linear, log-linear, generalized-linear and mixed-fit linear models. Goodness-of-fit in regression coefficients was assessed by R(2). Hypothesis testing of coefficients over the patient population was performed.Multivariate linear model fits of FDG(pre) to FDG(post) were significantly positive over the population (FDG(post) ~ 0.17 Â· FDG(pre), p = 0.03), and classified slopes of RECIST non-responders and responders to be different (0.37 vs. 0.07, p = 0.01). Generalized-linear model fits related FDG(pre) to FDG(post) by a linear power law (FDG(post) ~ FDG(pre)(0.93),p<0.001). Univariate mixture model fits of FDG(pre) improved R(2) from 0.17 to 0.52. Neither baseline FLT PET nor Cu-ATSM PET uptake contributed statistically significant multivariate regression coefficients.Spatially resolved regression analysis indicates that pre-treatment FDG PET uptake is most strongly associated with three-month post-treatment FDG PET uptake in this patient population, though associations are histopathology-dependent.
