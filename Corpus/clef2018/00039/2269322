Regional cerebral blood flow study with 99mTc-hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime single photon emission computed tomography in Alzheimer's and multi-infarct dementia. Thirty-four demented patients, 19 with Alzheimer's and 15 with multi-infarct dementia, were studied using single photon emission computed tomography, and 99mTc-hexamethyl-propylenemine oxime as a tracer of regional cerebral perfusion. Tracer activity ratios, determined in cortical and subcortical regions, were compared with those of 11 age-matched controls. In both groups of demented patients, most of the cortical regions showed significant declines in tracer uptake from control values, with the greatest reductions in the parietal cortex. Significantly lower parietal indexes were found in the Alzheimer's patient group as compared both to the control values and to the group of multi-infarct dementia patients. A positive correlation was found between the magnitude of the parietal deficits and the severity of dementia.
