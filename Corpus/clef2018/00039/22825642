Overexpression of hexokinase-2 in giant cell tumor of bone is associated with false positive in bone tumor on FDG-PET/CT. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the usefulness of maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) in 2-deoxy-2-F(18)-fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) for preoperative differential diagnosis between benign and malignant bone tumors.Seventy-nine patients with bone tumors were examined by FDG-PET prior to histopathological diagnosis. The SUV(max) was calculated and compared between benign and malignant lesions, and among different histopathological subgroups, to identify false-positive histological subtypes.There was a statistically significant difference in the SUV(max) of benign (3.7 ± 3.3 n = 17) and malignant (5.3 ± 3.3The poor accuracy of SUV(max) in 18F-FDG-PET/CT in distinguishing malignant from benign bone tumors was confirmed some benign bone tumors showed high FDG uptake. Giant cell tumor of bone was a major false-positive histopathological subtype of bone tumors, showing high FDG accumulation. HK-2 contributed significantly to FDG uptake, whereas GLUT-1 appeared to play no role in FDG uptake in giant cell tumor of bone.
