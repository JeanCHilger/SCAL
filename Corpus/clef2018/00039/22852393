Low-temperature processing method of preparing for transparent graphene oxide electrode film with better electrical properties. Graphene oxide films were prepared by a facile ball milling process. The milling time and the amount of the acryl type polymer dispersion agent were controlled to obtain well dispersed graphene oxide solution in ethanol. Consequently, the transparent and conducting graphene oxide film which had 69% transmittance and 1.5 x 10(6) ohm/sq surface resistance was produced by bar coating the solution on a PET substrate. The electrical property of the graphene oxide film could be further improved to 2.1 x 10(5) ohm/sq by hydrazine vapor reduction.
