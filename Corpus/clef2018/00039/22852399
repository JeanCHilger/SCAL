Influence of surface modification of polyethylene terephthalate film on inkjet printing of Pd(II) catalytic ink. To form the Cu circuit with electroless plating method on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film, the Pd catalyst layer was formed by printing and liquid phase reduction of the Pd(II) ink on surface modified polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film. The Pd(II) ink could be obtained by hydrolysis of PdCl2 and NH4Cl solution and added with a stabilizing agent. To investigate the optimal printing characteristics by surface modification, the PET film was immersed into the KOH solution. The contact angle on surface of PET film greatly depended on the temperature and the concentration of the KOH solution. The printing of Pd(II) ink and Cu electroless plating characteristics were most excellent when the surface modification was carried out for 60 min at 60 degrees C in the 5-10 M KOH solution.
