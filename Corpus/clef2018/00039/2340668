The value of oblique angle reorientation in SPECT bone scintigraphy of the hips. SPECT bone scintigraphy has been shown useful for detecting avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral heads. Because the femoral necks project in a 15-20 degree posterior angulation from the coronal plane, the femoral head is partially superimposed upon the acetabulum in standard coronal SPECT images. To avoid this problem, the authors now perform oblique angle reorientation of all hip SPECT studies. This new technique, which allows display of the hip in a more anatomic fashion and better definition of hip abnormalities, is described. No new data acquisition is needed, and only a small amount of extra time is required for reconstruction.
