A yeast nuclear gene, MRS1, involved in mitochondrial RNA splicing: nucleotide sequence and mutational analysis of two overlapping open reading frames on opposite strands. We have cloned a 1.6-kb fragment of yeast nuclear DNA, which complements pet- mutant MK3 (mrs1). This mutant was shown to be defective in mitochondrial RNA splicing: the excision of intron 3 from the mitochondrial COB pre-RNA is blocked. The DNA sequence of the nuclear DNA fragment revealed two open reading frames (ORF1 with 1092 bp ORF2 with 735 bp) on opposite strands, which overlap by 656 bp. As shown by in vitro mutagenesis, ORF1, but not ORF2, is responsible for complementation of the splice defect. Hence, ORF1 represents the nuclear MRS1 gene. Disruption of the gene (both ORFs) in the chromosomal DNA of the respiratory competent yeast strain DBY747 (long form COB gene) leads to a stable pet- phenotype and to the accumulation of the same mitochondrial RNA precursors as in strain MK3. The amino acid sequence of the putative ORF1 product does not exhibit any homology with other known proteins, except for a small region of homology with the gene product of another nuclear yeast gene involved in mitochondrial RNA splicing, CBP2. The function of the MRS1 (ORF1) gene in mitochondrial RNA splicing and the significance of the overlapping ORFs in this gene are discussed.
