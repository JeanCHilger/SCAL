Effect of adenosine on human cerebral blood flow as determined by positron emission tomography. The effect of intravenous infusion of adenosine on CBF was studied in seven patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformation. The patients were examined with positron emission tomography with controlled ventilation using [15O] water and [11C] fluoromethane as tracers. Total and regional CBF were determined before and during infusion of adenosine at rates producing a reduction of the MABP by approximately 10-40%. Six patients were normoventilated, and one was hyperventilated. Mean CBF in areas with normal brain tissue was 54 ml/100 g/min before adenosine infusion under normoventilation. Adenosine infusion increased mean CBF with 23-85%. Mean CVR was decreased with 43-65% and exceeded the percentage reduction of MABP in all normoventilated subjects. In the hyperventilated patient, the reduction of CVR was similar to the reduction of MABP, and CBF was unaffected, except for the 30% increase in the thalamus. It is concluded that intravenous administration of adenosine produces marked cerebral vasodilation in normoventilated subjects and that this response can be counteracted by hyperventilation.
