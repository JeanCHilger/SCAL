Cyclotron production of carrier-free 66Ga as a positron emitting label of albumin colloids for clinical use. A method for producing carrier free 66Ga (T1/2:9.4 h beta +) by 4He bombardment of natural copper targets is presented. 66Ga is formed by means of the 63Cu (4He, n) 66Ga reaction. Production yields are given in the 17.5 to 8 MeV 4He energy range. Chemical purification of 66Ga from the copper target is described. The only radionuclidic impurity found in the final product was 67Ga. Albumin colloids from commercially available kits designed for use with 99mTc could easily be labeled with 66Ga and employed for studies of the lymphatic system by positron emission tomography.
