The effect of acetazolamide on regional cerebral blood flow in normal human subjects as measured by single-photon emission computed tomography. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was evaluated in 15 normal, healthy volunteer control subjects before and after the administration of 1 g acetazolamide (ACZ) using a rotating four-detector single-photon emission computed tomograph (SPECT). ACZ, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is a cerebral vasodilator. RCBF values in mL/minute/100 g were derived within eight cortical regions of interest (ROI), and from the whole slice as an expression of whole brain blood flow (WBF). ROI/WBF ratios were established for each ROI in each of the 15 subjects for both pre-ACZ and post-ACZ studies. ACZ produced a 30% +/- 17% increase in WBF. Studies were done in random order, with nine subjects undergoing the post-ACZ study first, and six the pre-ACZ, or baseline, study first. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in any ROI that might be caused by sequence of test procedures. Ratios were then examined to determine whether rCBF elevation was proportionate in all ROI in all subjects. No significant difference was found in any ROI except for the left parietal, for which marginally significant change was identified. Subjects also were examined for possible age and sex differences in ACZ response, and no differences were found.
