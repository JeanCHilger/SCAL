The fluorodeoxyglucose 18F scan in Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia. Patients with Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia were studied with scans using fluorodeoxyglucose tagged with fluorine 18. The rates of glucose metabolism were calculated. Patients with Alzheimer's dementia showed decreased metabolism in all areas of the brain but with preferential sparing of the primary motor and sensory cortex. Patients with multi-infarct dementia also had global reductions in glucose metabolic rates when compared with normal control subjects, but the areas of hypometabolism were focal and asymmetric.
