Glucose utilization of cerebral gliomas measured by [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography was used to measure local cerebral glucose utilization by the 1-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose technique in 23 patients with cerebral gliomas. All 10 high-grade (III and IV) astrocytomas demonstrated a region of high activity with a glucose consumption of 7.4 +/- 3.5 (SD) mg/100 gm per minute. The 13 low-grade (I and II) gliomas had a glucose metabolic rate of 4.0 +/- 1.8 mg/100 gm per minute, with no distinctly visible hot spot. Thus, we found a correlation between rate of glycolysis and malignancy in primary cerebral tumors. Cerebral cortical glucose utilization was often depressed in areas adjacent to or neurally connected to the tumor site, and there was focal irregular delta wave EEG activity in these areas.
