Binding of d-threo-[11C]methylphenidate to the dopamine transporter in vivo: insensitivity to synaptic dopamine. The regional distribution of [11C]d-threo-methylphenidate in mouse brain was very similar to that of [3H]WIN 35,428 ((-)-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane), and the two radioligands were displaced from striatum similarly after administration of the potent cocaine analog RTI-55 ((-)-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane). However, while striatal [3H]WIN 35,428 increased between 5 and 30 min, striatal [11C]d-threo-methylphenidate halved. Thus [11C]d-threo-methylphenidate binds similarly to but more reversibly than [3H]WIN 35,428. The methyl ester of L-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine 200 mg/kg) plus benserazide plus clorgyline, which markedly elevates rat striatal extracellular dopamine (Wachtel and Abercrombie, 1994, J. Neurochem. 63, 108), decreased the mouse striatum-to-cerebellum ratio for [11C]d-threo-methylphenidate at 30 min by 13% (P < 0.05). In positron emission tomographic (PET) baboon studies [11C]d-threo-methylphenidate binding was insensitive to drugs expected to lower endogenous dopamine. These experiments suggest that normal synaptic dopamine does not compete for binding with [11C]d-threo-methylphenidate, and will not affect PET measures of dopamine transporter availability.
