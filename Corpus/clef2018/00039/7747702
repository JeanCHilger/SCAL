Comparison using dynamic vectorcardiography and MIBI SPECT of ST-segment changes and myocardial MIBI uptake during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The quantitative relation between ST-segment changes and the severity and extent of myocardial ischemia during coronary occlusion remains unclear. This study assesses whether ST-segment changes during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) correlate with the amount of myocardium at risk, measured with technetium-99m hexakis 2-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI also called sestamibi) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Quantitative continuous dynamic vectorcardiography was performed during PTCA of the left anterior descending coronary artery in 11 patients (mean age 64.3 years) without previous myocardial infarction. Change in the magnitude of the ST vector (STc-VM) was continuously recorded. A standardized protocol of balloon inflations was used and technetium-99m MIBI was injected intravenously at the onset of the third inflation. SPECT imaging was performed 60 minutes later and compared to a rest acquisition. SPECT was quantified by bull's-eye analysis using: (1) the change in the pathologic/normal area count ratio (delta P/N) as an index of the severity of ischemia
