Decreased benzodiazepine receptor binding in panic disorder measured by IOMAZENIL-SPECT. A preliminary report. Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) imaging of the central benzodiazepine receptor (BZr) became possible with the newly developed ligand 123I-IOMAZENIL. The BZr binding was investigated in ten patients with panic disorder (PP) compared to ten epileptic patients (EP). Panic patients had lower IOMAZENIL uptake rates in the frontal, occipital and temporal cortex than EP indicating the involvement of the BZr complex in panic disorder.
