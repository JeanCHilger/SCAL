Comparative study of regional cerebral blood flow values measured by Xe CT and Xe SPECT. The regional cerebral blood flow (rBCF) values measured by stable xenon-enhanced computed tomography (Xe XT) and by radioactive xenon-133 single photon emission computed tomography (Xe SPECT) were compared in 16 patients with cerebral infarct. On the non-lesion side Xe SPECT recorded 10.7% higher rCBF values than Xe CT in the anterior cerebral artery territory, while Xe CT recorded 9.6% higher values than Xe SPECT in the middle cerebral artery territory. These differences were not statistically significant. Although the rCBF values were almost the same, no correlation was found between the two methods in the posterior cerebral artery territory and the basal ganglia. Only hemispheric CBF on the non-lesion side showed the same value and a good correlation between the Xe CT and the Xe SPECT. There was a good correlation in the hemispheric CBF values on the lesion side, too. The difference of rCBF between the non-lesion side and the lesion side was expressed smaller in the Xe SPECT than in the Xe CT. This is in agreement with the previous reports that Xe SPECT overestimates the flow in the low flow areas. The higher rCBF values in the anterior cerebral artery territory measured by the Xe SPECT was ascribed to the artifact from the radioactivities in the inhalation mask and the air passages as reported previously. In conclusion, there is no good correlation between the rCBF values measured by the Xe CT and by the Xe SPECT. Only hemispheric CBF shows a good correlation between the two methods.
