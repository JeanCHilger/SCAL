Ga-67 scintigraphy in pediatric patients. Comparison of extended SPECT of the chest and abdomen with planar imaging. Ga-67 SPECT has been shown to be more sensitive than planar imaging in several pediatric and adult studies. With multidetector SPECT cameras, SPECT imaging of multiple sites and volumes rendered images are possible. This study was performed to determine if SPECT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis can be substituted for planar imaging of the same body regions. Fifty-one Ga-67 studies in 36 patients with lymphoma (29 patients) and inflammation (7 patients) were reviewed. Ga-67 SPECT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was compared with planar images of the same body regions. There were 52 abnormal sites on SPECT and 42 on planar imaging. Ten sites were positive only on SPECT five of these sites were seen on SPECT because of improved three-dimensional separation of sites of gallium uptake. In the limited number of cases in this study, duplicate planar and SPECT imaging of the same volume was unnecessary.
