Impact of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography on the clinical management of patients with glioma. The past decade has seen the identification of many clinical settings in the treatment of primary brain tumors in which information from fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) might be useful, if not essential, to therapeutic formulation. FDG-PET is currently used at referral centers in the management of primary brain tumors. The clinical pattern of FDG-PET use was assessed and its value compared to other information sources in clinical decision making. The clinical records of 75 glioma patients who were evaluated by FDG-PET were reviewed. The range of circumstances in which FDG-PET was employed included: pretherapeutic baseline studies for monitoring the effect of a therapy (1% of all cases), mapping of hypermetabolic regions before surgery or biopsy (2%), mapping of hypermetabolic regions before radiotherapy (2%), postsurgical evaluation for residual tumor (2%), assessment of the malignancy of a mass as a substitute for biopsy (11%), and distinguishing between radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor (87%). Other sources of information that contributed to the therapeutic management of patients included: gadolinium-enhanced MRI, contrast-CT, and clinical findings.
