Prospective evaluation of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyclucose positron emission tomography in breast cancer for staging of the axilla related to surgery and immunocytochemistry. The noninvasive staging of axillary lymph nodes for metastases is investigated in patients with breast cancer prior to surgery by positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (18F-FDG). In 124 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, whole-body PET was performed to determine the average differential uptake ratio (DUR) of 18F-FDG in the axillary lymph nodes. Results were correlated with the number of the dissected lymph nodes, size of the primary tumor, tumor type, tumor grade, estrogen and progesterone receptors, DNA ploidy, and the proportion of cells in the synthetic phase of the cell cycle (S-phase). In this prospective study of 124 patients with breast carcinoma, PET correctly categorized all 44 tumor-positive axillary lymph nodes, a sensitivity of 100%. Sixty tumor-negative axillary lymph nodes were negative by PET and 20 tumor-negative axillary lymph nodes were positive by PET. No false-negative PET findings were encountered. A weak correlation was found between DUR and tumor size as well as between DUR and the S-phase of the tumor. In patients with breast carcinoma, 18F-FDG PET can be of value in evaluating axillary lymph nodes for metastatic involvement prior to surgery. It is of particular importance that no false-negative PET findings were encountered, and axillary lymph node dissection might not be necessary in patients without axillary uptake by PET. The DUR of the positive axillary lymph nodes seems to bear a relationship with some of the purported prognostic parameters of the primary tumor.
