Comparison of parathyroid imaging with technetium-99m-pertechnetate/sestamibi subtraction, double-phase technetium-99m-sestamibi and technetium-99m-sestamibi SPECT. The ability of 99mTc-pertechnetate/sestamibi subtraction, double-phase 99mTc-sestamibi and 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT imaging to localize abnormal parathyroid tissue was compared.Fifty-five consecutive patients had parathyroid imaging before surgery for hyperparathyroidism. Imaging consisted of 99mTc-pertechnetate pinhole images of the neck followed by 99mTc-sestamibi pinhole images of the neck and parallel-hole images of the neck and chest (early images). Within 2.5-4.0 hr later pinhole images of the neck, parallel-hole and SPECT images of the neck and chest were obtained (late images). Nodular foci of increased sestamibi activity were considered abnormal.The sensitivity for abnormal parathyroid glands by visual comparison of early images and pertechnetate images was 72%-75%, late images and pertechnetate images was 73%-78% and double-phase (early and late) sestamibi images was 62%-65% computer subtraction of pertechnetate from early images was 71%-74%Late imaging, computer subtraction and SPECT may not be necessary since they provided only marginal improvements on visual comparison of early sestamibi with pertechnetate images. Double-phase sestamibi imaging was less sensitive, so baseline thyroid imaging with pertechnetate is recommended.
