Cortical processing mechanism for vocalization with auditory verbal feedback. To investigate the relationship between motor and sensory speech center, cortical activity was examined using PET while normal subjects perceived their own voice which sounded different to the articulated one. The results showed significant activation in the superior temporal gyri with absence of activity in the supplementary motor area (SMA). In a previous study we found significant activation in SMA with no activity in the superior temporal gyrus when normal subjects simply vocalized. Thus, two different cortical pathways for vocalization were delineated: programmed pathway in SMA, and pathway with auditory verbal feedback. The former is thought to be the mature system in the adult, and the latter may be related to speech acquisition.
