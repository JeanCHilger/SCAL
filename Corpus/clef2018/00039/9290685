Axillary lymphadenectomy: a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. Axillary dissection for primary operable cancer follows the basic tenants of surgical oncology and achieves the stated goals. Local control is excellent with failure rates in the 0-2% range. Long-term and disease-free survival is improved with axillary dissection. It is often stated that axillary dissection is not required for the smallest of lesions, but the 15% risk of axillary disease with the T1A lesion would suggest otherwise. Axillary sampling would not achieve the stated goals because of the high probability of retained, potentially resectable disease in the node positive group. Axillary recurrence is associated with an unacceptably high morbidity and mortality. Although the survival is similar in the three treatment groups of NSABP B-04, the inordinately high systemic failure rate with axillary recurrence would suggest that more aggressive local control could prevent many of these failures. After all, long-term survival free of disease is reported in many series even in patients with multiple involved nodes. Axillary dissection also generates the most accurate prognostic variable upon which further therapeutic interventions are predicated. At present there is no other diagnostic or therapeutic approach that achieves all of these goals. In summary the value of the axillary dissection is to provide accurate prognostic information as well as excellent local control and to improve the survival rate in the node positive group. It is hoped that in the future a diagnostic test such as PET scanning or sentinel node mapping may predict those patients with a clear axilla and therefore not require an axillary dissection. Finally, there has yet to be a primary operable carcinoma that benefits from preservation of potentially fully resectable disease.
