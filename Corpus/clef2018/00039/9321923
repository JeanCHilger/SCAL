Atrial natriuretic peptide in preeclampsia: metabolic clearance, sodium excretion and renal hemodynamics. To further elucidate the role of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in preeclampsia, its metabolic clearance (MCRANP) was determined concomitantly with its effects on sodium excretion (UNa), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF). Ten untreated preeclamptic primigravidae (PET) were studied at 29-37 wk gestation and again 4 mo postpartum (PP). Basal plasma concentration of ANP was significantly increased in PET compared with PP (14.8 +/- 1.9 vs. 4.1 +/- 0.5 pmol/l, respectively P < 0.0001). MCRANP in PET and PP was 5.0 +/- 0.8 and 4.9 +/- 0.5 l/min [not significant (NS)], respectively. In PET, infusion of ANP produced (basal vs. ANP) a natriuresis (UNa 0.14 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.28 +/- 0.04 mmol/min, P < 0.001) and an increase in GFR (97 +/- 7 vs. 106 +/- 8 ml/min, P < 0.05), with ERPF unchanged (609 +/- 24 vs. 634 +/- 29 ml/min, NS). In PP, ANP infusion also produced a natriuresis (UNa 0.20 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.02 mmol/min, P = 0.01), no significant change in GFR (109 +/- 7 vs. 102 +/- 4 ml/min), and a significant reduction in ERPF (514 +/- 22 vs. 409 +/- 18 ml/min, P < 0.0001). Analysis of variance demonstrated a greater natriuretic effect of ANP in PET compared with PP (P < 0.05), similarly a significant difference in the effect of ANP on ERPF (P < 0.01) and GFR (P < 0.05) was seen but not on filtration fraction (P = 0.35).
