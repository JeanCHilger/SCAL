123I-IBZM binding compared with long-term clinical follow up in patients with de novo parkinsonism. We performed a prospective clinical follow up (mean follow up, 36 months range, 24-56 months) of 65 patients with de novo parkinsonism in whom imaging of dopamine D2 receptors was performed before the initiation of dopaminomimetic therapy by means of 123I-iodobenzamide-single-photon-emission computed tomography (IBZM-SPECT). The results of IBZM-SPECT were compared with the long-term response to dopaminomimetic drugs, the development of motor fluctuations, and the development of clinical signs incompatible with Parkinson's disease (PD). A total of 55 patients had normal and 10 patients had reduced IBZM binding
