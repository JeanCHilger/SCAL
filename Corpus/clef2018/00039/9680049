The neurobiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. We provide a comprehensive review of the neurobiological basis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This summary was accomplished by a review of research in three areas: neuroimaging, genetics, and neurochemistry. Additionally, we also discuss a newer conceptualization of the disorder. Although none of the current findings present a unified picture of the pathophysiology of the disorder, the vast array of studies reviewed do highlight CNS abnormalities that, when taken together, present a convincing argument that the cause clearly resides within the realm of developing brain.
