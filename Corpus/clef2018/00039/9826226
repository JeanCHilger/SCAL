Imaging dopamine D4 receptors in the living primate brain: a positron emission tomography study using the novel D1/D4 antagonist [11C]SDZ GLC 756. The dopamine D4 receptor has lately attracted interest since it has been hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenesis and pharmacotherapy of neuropsychiatric diseases. The present study provides first in vivo evidence of dopamine D4 receptors in primate brain using a [11C]benzo[g]quinoline, the novel radioligand [11C]SDZ GLC 756 ([11C]GLC: in vitro dissociation constants at human receptor clones [nM]: 1.10 at D1 0.40 at D2
