Limited value of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET for the differential diagnosis of focal liver lesions in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The differentiation of HCC from liver metastasis or benign disorders by imaging studies based upon morphological aspects may be difficult.In order to evaluate the role of tumour metabolism, we performed FDG-PET (whole-body PET and transmission-corrected regional scans of the liver as well as the SUV determined 60 min after injection of FDG) in ten consecutive patients with HCV-associated focal liver lesions. Definite diagnosis was established after ultrasound-guided liver biopsy followed by histopathological examination. These results were compared with ultrasound, computed tomography, serum anti-p53, and p53 protein expression.The histologic examination revealed a HCC in five patients, regenerative nodules in three patients, and liver metastasis (primary malignancy: one adenocarcinoma and one neuroendocrine tumour) in the remaining two patients. Three of ten lesions were detectable by FDG-PET: two HCCs and one metastatic adenocarcinoma. Seven lesions were not distinguishable by FDG-PET (three HCCs, three regeneration nodules and one metastatic neuroendocrine tumour). In each patient hepatic lesions were visible either by ultrasound or CT. Both tumours (metastatic adenocarcinoma, moderately well-differentiated HCC) with the strongest expression of p53 also presented with highly increased FDG uptake.FDG-PET is not superior to ultrasound or CT and therefore does not allow the non-invasive differentiation of HCV-associated focal liver lesions. Tissue-diagnosis by means of liver-biopsy followed by histopathological examination remains the gold-standard for the differentiation of HCV-related liver lesions. The finding of the relationship of p53 protein overexpression with the SUV needs further confirmation.
