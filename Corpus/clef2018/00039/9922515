Cushing with transition from pituitary to adrenal origin. Study with SPECT scintigraphy of the adrenal cortex with norcholesterol-I 131 in a case. The case of a 49 yr old alcoholic women with clinical and laboratory findings that suggested a Cushing syndrome is presented. The functional tests showed cortisol suppression greater than 50% of the basal value with 8 mg of dexamethasone and no response in the combined dexamethasone/desmopressin test. Pituitary Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was negative, Abdominal Computed Axial Tomography suggested hyperplastic adrenal glands adrenal nodules were not found in the NMR. Pituitary or hipothalamic Cushing with secondary autonomous micronodular adrenal hyperplasia was suspected. Norcholesterol-I131 SPECT scintigraphy under dexamethasone suppression demonstrated a functional adrenal hyperplasia which was hystologically confirmed.
