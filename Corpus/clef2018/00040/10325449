Frontotemporal dementia: An attempt at clinical characteristics. The clinical recognition of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) depends on its differentiation from Alzheimer's disease (AD). From 212 patients primarily diagnosed as probable AD, 24 cases with mild dementia, absence of disturbances the presence of which would have prevented a full neuropsychological assessment, and brain CT with detailed visualization of hippocampus atrophy were chosen. On the basis of neuropsychological examination the patients were divided into two groups: 11 cases with predominant deficit in frontal system tasks (FTD group) and 13 cases with changes in cognitive functions typical of AD (AD group). Age at onset, duration, behavioral changes, psychotic symptoms, depression, speech disorders, neurologic deficit and hippocampal atrophy were analyzed in both groups. Statistically significant differences for behavioral disturbances and hippocampal atrophy were found. Early behavioral changes and lack of early hippocampal atrophy on CT may be useful features for differentiating between FTD and AD, especially when SPECT is not available.
