Assessment of the severity of coronary artery stenosis by the ratio of the regional washout rate determined by adenosine triphosphate stress Tl-201 SPECT. Adenosine triphosphate stress thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (ATP SPECT) is useful for diagnosis of coronary artery disease, but its usefulness for evaluating the severity of coronary artery stenosis has not been established.We performed region-of-interest analysis of short-axis images obtained by ATP SPECT in 31 patients with single-vessel disease (>50% stenosis of the luminal diameter). We selected the lowest and highest washout rates (WR) among the anterior, lateral, and inferior WRs and calculated the ratio of the lowest WR to the highest WR (WR ratio = 0.925+/-0.027 in 14 control subjects). ATP SPECT showed positive results in 29 (94%) of 31 patients. The severity of coronary artery stenosis was inversely correlated with the WR ratio (r = -0.703, P < .0001). The sensitivity and specificity of a WR ratio < or = 0.660 for the diagnosis of severe coronary stenosis (> or =80% stenosis) were 83% and 80%, respectively.Results suggest that ATP SPECT may be useful for assessment of the severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients with single-vessel disease.
