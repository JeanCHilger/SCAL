Amlodipine lowers blood pressure without affecting cerebral blood flow as measured by single photon emission computed tomography in elderly hypertensive subjects. To evaluate the effect of amlodipine on blood pressure and cerebral blood flow in elderly subjects with mild to moderate hypertension.A double-blind, parallel group study of 26 patients. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, amlodipine (5-10 mg) or matching placebo was given once daily for 8 weeks.Amlodipine significantly reduced blood pressure compared with baseline. Diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by amlodipine compared with placebo (P< 0.02 to P< 0.01). Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed that blood pressure control was sustained over the 24-h dosing interval. Relative regional cerebral blood flow, assessed using single photon emission computed tomography, was not significantly affected by amlodipine. Three placebo patients, but no amlodipine patients, withdrew because of adverse events.Amlodipine was a well-tolerated and effective antihypertensive agent, and did not reduce regional cerebral blood flow in elderly hypertensive patients.
