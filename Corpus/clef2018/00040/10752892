Comparison of FDG-PET with MIBI-SPECT in the detection of breast cancer and axillary lymph node metastasis. The purpose of this work was to compare [18F]2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) PET and 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) SPECT in the detection of breast cancer and axillary lymph node metastasis in the same patients.FDG-PET and MIBI-SPECT were performed within 3 days for 40 women (age range 25-86 years old) with suspected breast cancer, in whom biopsies and/or mastectomies were performed. Both images were visually assessed, and the count ratio between tumor and normal tissue (T/N ratio) was calculated.Thirty-eight patients had breast cancer, and the remaining two had benign breast lesions. The sensitivities of FDG-PET and MIBI-SPECT were 78.9 and 76.3% for breast cancer and 50.0 and 37.5% for axillary lymph node metastasis, respectively. The T/N ratio of breast cancer was significantly higher in FDG-PET (6.01 +/- 3.08 mean +/- SD) than that in MIBI-SPECT (3.48 +/- 1.21) (p = 0.01). Nonmalignant diffuse uptake of FDG in the breasts and the accumulation of MIBI in heart and liver occasionally obscured tumor uptake.These results indicate that MIBI-SPECT is comparable with FDG-PET in detecting breast cancer. Neither FDG-PET nor MIBI-SPECT is sufficiently sensitive to rule out axillary lymph node metastasis.
