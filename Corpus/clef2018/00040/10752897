Focal cortical dysplasia: comparison of MRI and FDG-PET. The purpose of this work was to compare the use of MRI and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in the diagnosis of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD).Nineteen patients with surgically proven FCD were analyzed retrospectively. MRI was performed in all patients, and FDG-PET was performed in 17 patients. We compared the MR and FDG-PET findings of FCD according to the histologic findings that were classified into three grades.Four cases were classified as Grade I, 4 cases as Grade II, and 11 cases as Grade III FCD. The lesions were detected on MRI in 9 (82%) of the 11 patients with Grade III FCD and in only 1 (13%) of the 8 patients with Grade I and II FCD. Cortical hypometabolism of the lesion was revealed on FDG-PET in 6 (86%) of the 7 patients with Grade I and II FCD and in 9 (90%) of the 10 patients with Grade III FCD. The extent of the cortical abnormality was larger on FDG-PET than on MRI in 11 (65%) of the 17 patients.FDG-PET is more useful in delineating the cortical abnormality in patients with mild degrees of FCD. The extent of the lesion was larger or similar on FDG-PET compared with that of the MRI.
