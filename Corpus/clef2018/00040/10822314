The accuracy of non-invasive methods for the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease in the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy. In the hypertensive patient with electrocardiographic and/or echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, exercise electrocardiography lacks sensitivity and specificity for the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease and should be avoided. In comparative studies both myocardial perfusion imaging and stress echocardiography are significantly more sensitive and specific for the detection of significant obstructive coronary artery disease, in the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and are the investigations of choice.
