In vivo olanzapine occupancy of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in patients with schizophrenia. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic with potent antimuscarinic properties in vitro (K(i) = 2-25 nM). We studied in vivo muscarinic receptor occupancy by olanzapine at both low dose (5 mg/dy) and high dose (20 mg/dy) in several regions of cortex, striatum, thalamus and pons by analyzing [I-123]IQNB SPECT images of seven schizophrenia patients. Both low-dose and high-dose olanzapine studies revealed significantly lower [I-123]IQNB binding than that of drug-free schizophrenia patients (N = 12) in all regions except striatum. [I-123]IQNB binding was significantly lower at high-dose than low-dose in the same regions. Muscarinic occupancy by olanzapine ranged from 13% to 57% at 5 mg/dy and 26% to 79% at 20 mg/dy with an anatomical pattern indicating M(2) subtype selectivity. The [I-123]IQNB data indicate that olanzapine is a potent and subtype-selective muscarinic antagonist in vivo, perhaps explaining its low extrapyramidal side effect profile and low incidence of anticholinergic side effects.
