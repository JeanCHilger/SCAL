Antimicrobial properties of copper-coated electroconductive polyester fibers. Three synthetic copper-coated EURO-static fibers (PET--polyester, PA--polyamide, and PAC--polyacrylamide) manufactured by EUROPA Corporation S.C., Poland, were tested as potential antimicrobial agents. The inhibitory properties of the fibers were examined using different microorganisms as follows: i. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25293, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 reference strains, ii. 8 strains of S. aureus (4 MRSA and 4 MSSA) and 5 strains of P. aeruginosa isolated from infected wounds, and iii. fungal pathogen Scopulariopsis sp. isolated from onychomycosis case. The results of experiments have evidenced that polyester (PET) copper-coated EURO-static fibers inhibit the growth of all the strains used.
