Two- and three-dimensional assessments of myocardial perfusion and function by using technetium-99m sestamibi gated SPECT with a combination of count- and image-based techniques. Although the myocardial gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) technique makes it possible to assess concurrent myocardial perfusion and function, quantitative methods for analyzing and displaying gated SPECT data in 2- and 3-dimensional presentations for regional and global cardiac assessment have not been established.We have developed an automated quantitative method for assessing perfusion and function by means of technetium-99m sestamibi gated SPECT with a computerized technique combining count-based and image-based methods. We have examined its validity in 91 patients by comparing its results with those of conventional techniques: contrast left ventriculography and radionuclide angiocardiography. In addition to color-scale displays of regional function, simultaneous 3-dimensional presentations of regional wall motion and perfusion have been produced. High reproducibility of gated SPECT analysis with this algorithm was demonstrated interoperator errors (%CV) were 2.6% to 5.5%, and good intraobserver reproducibility was confirmed by means of high correlation coefficients (0.954 to 0.989). Left ventricular volumes assessed by means of contrast left ventriculography and by means of the gated SPECT technique showed significant correlations (left ventricular end-diastolic volume, y = 1.01x - 9.7, r = 0.845, P<.001, standard errors of the estimate [SEE] = 14 mLIn comparison with conventional techniques, myocardial gated SPECT with automated quantitative analysis provides accurate and reproducible data for global and regional function. Quantitative concurrent assessment of myocardial perfusion and function by using 2-and 3-dimensional representations appears to be superior to other modalities and to contribute to nuclear cardiology practice.
