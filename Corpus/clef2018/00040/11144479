Improved detection of left main coronary artery disease with attenuation-corrected SPECT. Myocardial perfusion imaging has demonstrated a limited sensitivity as a means of accurately identifying left main (LM) coronary disease. Because regional quantitative perfusion biases are eliminated with attenuation corrected (AC) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), as compared with uncorrected (NC) SPECT, we hypothesized that AC SPECT would demonstrate increased diagnostic accuracy for the detection of significant LM coronary stenosis.We studied 28 patients (23 men, 5 women mean age, 66+/-9 years) with significant LM stenoses (> or =50%) and 34 control patients (27 men, 7 womenAC SPECT with the University of Michigan method in consecutive patients with LM stenoses and a select control population with severity matched multivessel coronary disease significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy of myocardial perfusion imaging for the identification of LM coronary disease, compared with uncorrected SPECT.
