Relation among dopamine D(2) receptor binding, obesity and personality in normal human subjects. Personality is a behavioral pattern, which differs among individuals. Kretschmer (Kretschmer, E., Physique and Character: an Investigation of the Nature of Constitution and the Theory of Temperament, New York, 1921) categorized personality variants according to the concept of fundamental body types. Recently, several lines of evidence suggest that the central dopamine system may underlie the regulation of weight and the personality trait. In this study, we examined the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) binding using positron emission tomography with [11C]FLB 457 [(s)-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl) methyl]-5-bromo-2,3-dimethyloxybenzamide] together with body mass index (BMI) and personality trait on the temperament and character inventory (TCI) in 16 normal subjects. Our data demonstrate that there was a significant relation among D2R binding in the amygdala, BMI and personality trait of harm avoidance. It can be assumed that variation of dopaminergic activity in the amygdala underlies the personality variants related to the concept of fundamental body type.
