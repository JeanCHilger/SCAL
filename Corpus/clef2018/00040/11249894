Impaired retention of technetium-99m tetrofosmin in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether myocardial imaging using technetium-99m tetrofosmin can noninvasively identify myocardial damage in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC). The study consisted of 10 patients with apical HC, 10 with asymmetric septal HC (ASH) group, 5 with dilated cardiomyopathy (DC)-like group, and 20 healthy subjects. With use of a bull's-eye map of single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging, the total defect score of tetrofosmin and the washout rate were assessed in 5 segments (septum, and anterior, lateral, and inferior walls, and apex) of the left ventricle. A localized increase in defect score and washout rate was observed in the hypertrophied region in the group with apical HC. An increased washout rate was observed in the ASH group regardless of hypertrophy, suggesting that tetrofosmin retention by the mitochondria was impaired in the entire left ventricular wall. The washout rate was further increased at all segments in the DC-like group versus the ASH group. Tetrofosmin retention by mitochondria was impaired in the entire left ventricular wall in the ASH group and was increased further in the DC-like group. The dysfunction of myocardial cells was limited to the hypertrophied region in the apical HC group.
