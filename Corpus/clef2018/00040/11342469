Assessment of myocardial perfusion in coronary artery disease by magnetic resonance: a comparison with positron emission tomography and coronary angiography. Monitoring contrast medium wash-in kinetics in hyperemic myocardium by magnetic resonance (MR) allows for the detection of stenosed coronary arteries. In this prospective study, the quality of a multislice MR approach with respect to the detection and sizing of compromised myocardium was determined and compared with positron emission tomography (PET) and quantitative coronary angiography.A total of 48 patients and healthy subjects were studied by MR using a multislice hybrid echo-planar pulse sequence for monitoring the myocardial first pass kinetics of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid bismethylamide (Omniscan 0.1 mmol/kg injected at 3 mL/s IV) during hyperemia (dipyridamole 0.56 mg/kg). Signal intensity upslope as a measure of myocardial perfusion was calculated in 32 sectors per heart from pixelwise parametric maps in the subendocardial layer and for full wall thickness. Before coronary angiography, coronary flow reserve (hyperemia induced by dipyridamole 0.56 mg/kg) was determined in corresponding sectors by (13)N-ammonia PET. Receiver-operator characteristic analysis of subendocardial upslope data revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 94%, respectively, for the detection of coronary artery disease as defined by PET (mean coronary flow reserve minus 2SD of controls) and a sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 85%, respectively, in comparison with quantitative coronary angiography (diameter stenosis >/=50%). The number of pathological sectors per patient on PET and MR studies correlated linearly (slope, 0.94The presented MR approach reliably identifies patients with coronary artery stenoses and provides information on the amount of compromised myocardium, even when perfusion abnormalities are confined to the subendocardial layer. This modality may qualify for its clinical application in the management of coronary artery disease.
