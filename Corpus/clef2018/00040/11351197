Estimation of regional cerebral blood flow levels in ischemia using [(15)O]water of [(11)C]flumazenil PET without arterial input function . Determination of residual flow within the ischemic brain may be important in patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy. Conventional cerebral blood flow (CBF) quantification often cannot be achieved in these cases because arterial blood sampling required for the input function is prohibited. Quantitative CBF was measured in 20 patients with ischemic stroke using [(15)O]water and [(11)C]flumazenil PET with arterial blood sampling and compared with normalized nonquantified data of the same patients. For both comparisons, percentiles were derived, allowing the determination of a normalized blood flow level corresponding to an absolute CBF value below which 95% of all pixels are located. These normograms can be used to derive absolute CBF levels in milliliters per 100 g per minute from normalized data without the need for measuring an arterial input function.
