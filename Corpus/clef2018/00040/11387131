Positron Emission Tomography in Grading Soft Tissue Sarcomas. Soft tissue sarcomas present with varied radiological appearances. Positron imaging with [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG PET) has recently made promising contributions to management of patients by providing a noninvasive means for evaluating tumor metabolism and providing important biological information about soft tissue malignant tumors. PET imaging not only gives quantitative data on metabolic rates of tumors but can also readily provide semiquantitative data of uptake of tumors by measuring uptake ratios. These values have been helpful for noninvasively grading tumors. This value is called the tumor standard uptake value (SUV). The tumor grades (low, intermediate, high) mean SUV values show a high level of significance in discrimination among tumor grade groups.
