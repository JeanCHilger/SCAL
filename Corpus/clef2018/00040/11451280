Effect of essential hypertension on cardiac autonomic function in type 2 diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of essential hypertension on cardiac autonomic function in type 2 diabetic patients.Hypertension is common in type 2 diabetic patients and is associated with a high mortality. However, the combined effects of type 2 diabetes and essential hypertension on cardiac autonomic function have not been fully elucidated.Thirty-three patients with type 2 diabetes were assigned to a hypertensive diabetic group (n = 15 age: 56 +/- 8 years, mean +/- SD) or an age-matched normotensive diabetic group (n = 18, 56 +/- 6 years). Cardiac autonomic function was assessed by baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), heart rate variability (HRV), plasma norepinephrine concentration and cardiac 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphic findings.Baroreflex sensitivity was lower in the hypertensive diabetic group than it was in the normotensive diabetic group (p < 0.05). The early and delayed myocardial uptake of 123I-MIBG was lower (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively), and the percent washout rate of 123I-MIBG was higher (p < 0.05) in the hypertensive diabetic group. However, the high frequency (HF) power and the ratio of low frequency (LF) power to HF power (LF/HF) of HRV and plasma norepinephrine concentration were not significantly different. The homeostasis model assessment index was higher in the hypertensive diabetic group than it was in the normotensive diabetic group (p < 0.01).Our results indicate that essential hypertension acts synergistically with type 2 diabetes to depress cardiac reflex vagal and sympathetic function, and the results also suggest that insulin resistance may play a pathogenic role in these processes.
