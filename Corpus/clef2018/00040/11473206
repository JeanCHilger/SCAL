Whole body PET for the evaluation of bony metastases in patients with breast cancer: comparison with 99Tcm-MDP bone scintigraphy. The purpose of this study was to determine the potential role of positron emission tomography (PET) using 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) for the evaluation of bony metastasis compared with 99Tcm-methylene diphosphonate (99Tcm-MDP) bone scintigraphy in patients with breast cancer. Fifty-one female patients with breast cancer who had PET together with a bone scan within 1 month between September 1994 and March 1997 were included in this study. The median age was 49 years (range 29-79 years). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the bone scan were 77.7%, 80.9% and 80.3%, respectively. On the other hand, for the detection of bone metastases PET had a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 77.7%, 97.6% and 94.1%, respectively. In the diagnosis of bony metastasis derived from breast cancer, FDG-PET was statistically superior to bone scintigraphy in its specificity. In conclusion, FDG-PET appears to be a powerful tool not only in the diagnosis of the primary lesion and soft tissue metastasis, but also in the diagnosis of bony metastasis among patients with breast cancer.
