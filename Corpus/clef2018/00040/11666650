Synthesis and Characterization of Four Consecutive Members of the Five-Member [Fe(6)S(8)(PEt(3))(6)](n)()(+) (n = 0-4) Cluster Electron Transfer Series. The clusters [Fe(6)S(8)(PEt(3))(6)](+,2+) have been shown by other investigators to be formed by the reaction of [Fe(OH(2))(6)](2+) and H(2)S, to contain face-capped octahedral Fe(6)S(8) cores, and to be components of the five-membered electron transfer series [Fe(6)S(8)(PEt(3))(6)](n)()(+) (n = 0-4) estalished electrochemically. We have prepared two additional series members. Reaction of [Fe(6)S(8)(PEt(3))(6)](2+) with iodine in dichloromethane affords [Fe(6)S(8)(PEt(3))(6)](3+), isolated as the perchlorate salt (48%). Reduction of [Fe(6)S(8)(PEt(3))(6)](2+) with Na(Ph(2)CO) in acetonitrile/THF produces the neutral cluster [Fe(6)S(8)(PEt(3))(6)] (65%). The structures of the four clusters with n = 0, 1+, 2+, 3+ were determined at 223 K. The compounds [Fe(6)S(8)(PEt(3))(6)](ClO(4))(3), [Fe(6)S(8)(PEt(3))(6)] crystallize in trigonal space group R&thremacrc with a = 21.691(4), 16.951(4) Å, c = 23.235(6), 19.369(4) Å, and Z = 6, 3. The compounds [Fe(6)S(8)(PEt(3))(6)](BF(4))(2), [Fe(6)S(8)(PEt(3))(6)](BF(4)).2MeCN were obtained in monoclinic space groups P2(1)/c, C2/c with a = 11.673(3), 16.371(4) Å, b = 20.810(5), 16.796(4) Å, c = 12.438(4), 23.617(7) Å, beta = 96.10(2), 97.98(2) degrees, and Z = 2, 4. [Fe(6)S(8)(PEt(3))(6)](BPh(4))(2) occurred in trigonal space group P&onemacr
