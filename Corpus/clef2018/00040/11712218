Stress-rest myocardial tomoscintigraphy with 99mTc-tetrofosmin in the diagnosis of ischemic disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of 1-day stress-rest technetium-99m tetrofosmin myocardial tomography in the identification of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), and in the detection of the individual occluded coronary vessels. A total of 42 patients with suspected CAD were studied. Significant coronary narrowing (> or = 50% luminal stenosis) was detected by angiography in 22 patients. All patients received two i.v. injections of 99mTc tetrofosmin, one at peak exercises (370 MBq) and the other (740 MBq) at rest 3 h after exercise (images 15-30 min after injections for both studies). At visual analysis, all patients with CAD (> or = 50% luminal stenosis) (n-22) had an abnormal 99mTc tetrofosmin tomogram. Nine out of 20 patients without significant coronary narrowing (but with tortuosis, atheromathosis, with microvascular diseases) showed abnormal findings. Overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy in the identification of CAD was 100%, 55%, and 79%, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy in the identification of individuals with occluded coronary vessels were 100%, 76% and 85%, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that 1-day exercise-rest 99mTc tetrofosmin single-photon emission tomographic imaging (SPET) is a suitable and accurate technique to identify patients with CAD and for detection of individual occluded coronary vessels.
