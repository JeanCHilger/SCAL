A lipophilic thioflavin-T derivative for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid in brain. The synthesis of a new lipophilic thioflavin-T analogue (2-[4' -(methylamino)phenyl]benzothiazole, 6) with high affinity for amyloid is reported. Intravenous injection of [(11)C]-labeled 6 in control mice resulted in high brain uptake. Amyloid deposits were imaged with multiphoton microscopy in the brains of living transgenic mice following the systemic injection of unlabeled 6. [(11)C]6 is a promising amyloid imaging agent for Alzheimer's disease.
