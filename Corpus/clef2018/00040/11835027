Effect of intravenous testosterone on myocardial ischemia in men with coronary artery disease. Studies on the effect of estrogen on atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) risk in women have produced conflicting results. Similar confusion, but fewer data, exists on the effect of testosterone on CAD risk in men.We used 99mTc sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging to examine the acute effect of intravenous testosterone in 32 men (mean age, 69.1 +/- 6.4 years) with provocable myocardial ischemia on standard medical therapy. Patients performed 3 exercise (n = 18) or adenosine (n = 16) stress tests during the infusion of placebo or 2 doses of testosterone designed to increase testosterone 2 or 6 times baseline.Serum testosterone increased 137 +/- 58% and 488 +/- 113%, and estradiol levels increased 27 +/- 46% and 76 +/- 57%, (P <.001 for all) during the 2 testosterone infusions. There were no differences among the placebo or testosterone groups in peak heart rate, systolic blood pressure, maximal rate pressure product, perfusion imaging scores, or the onset of ST-segment depression.Acute testosterone infusion has neither a beneficial nor a deleterious effect on the onset and magnitude of stress-induced myocardial ischemia in men with stable CAD.
