Significance of 99mTc-labeled perfusion agents in the simultaneous assessment of myocardial perfusion and cardiac function. Simultaneous assessment of left ventricular myocardial perfusion and systolic function was accomplished by utilizing ECG-gated myocardial perfusion SPECT. This development in nuclear cardiology will be attributed to the recent advances in new 99mTc-labeled perfusion agents, multi-detector SPECT system and software for automatic edge-detection of the left ventricle. In this article, we described about the clinical utilities of this method in detecting "hibernating myocardium," severe coronary artery disease patients with exercise-induced LV dysfunction, in predicting functional recovery after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction patients and in diagnosing patients with right heart diseases.
