The value of stress thallium-201 single photon emission CT imaging as a predictor of outcome and long-term prognosis after CABG. This study examined the capability of rest-redistribution 201Tl single photon emission CT imaging (TSPECT) done shortly after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to predict outcome and long- term prognosis. Results of TSPECT at 5.5+/-0.7 (range 4 - 8) months postoperatively were correlated during a 4-year follow-up period wit mortality, major surgical and nonsurgical cardiac events and cardiac event-free survival in 170 patients who underwent CABG. Ten (5.8%) patients died during follow-up: 4 had a documented cardiac death (all of them with large or moderate reversible filling defects). In the survivors, there were 10 nonfatal myocardial infarctions and 11 revascularization interventions. Patients who eventually required and underwent revascularization procedures demonstrated large or moderate reversible filing defects, in contrast with those who had no need for an additional procedure (15.7% versus 2.5%, p < 0.001). Postoperative TSPECT carried out soon after CABG had definite prognostic value and should be performed routinely to help decide treatment protocol.
