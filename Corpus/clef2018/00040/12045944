Orbital fibrous histiocytomas. Orbital fibrous histiocytomas can be difficult to diagnose and manage. These tumors, especially those with intermediate histologic features, often recur. Historically, non-invasive tests to differentiate scars from recurrent disease have a high error rate. We present a case of recurrent orbital fibrous histiocytoma in which the diagnosis was established with poitron emission tomography (PET) scans. This technique may be helpful in difficult cases to differentiate scars from a recurrent mesenchymal tumor.
