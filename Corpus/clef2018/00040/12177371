Brain function and cognition in a community sample of elderly Latinos. Previous studies using PET to measure cerebral glucose metabolism in AD have found metabolic reductions in the temporoparietal and posterior cingulate cortices in individuals with dementia and those at risk of developing it. This study was designed to extend this finding to individuals selected from a population-based cohort of Mexican Americans with a wide spectrum of cognitive ability.A group of 93 individuals was selected from the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging, and subjects were categorized into four groups of increasing levels of cognitive impairment: normal, memory impaired, cognitively impaired but not demented (CIND), and demented. PET was performed with the tracer [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose, and data were analyzed with both statistical parametric mapping and an atrophy-corrected volume of interest approach.Individuals with dementia had metabolic reductions that were most robust in the posterior cingulate cortex, whereas CIND subjects had less statistically robust reductions in the posterior cingulate cortex. Cingulate hypometabolism increased the risk of dementia and was a significant risk factor for dementia in logistic regression models that also incorporated MR measures of hippocampal volume and white matter hyperintensities.Posterior cingulate cortical hypometabolism is clearly detected in individuals with dementia who are selected from a population with lower education and a high prevalence of cerebrovascular risk factors, supporting the generalizability of this finding. These metabolic reductions occur prior to the onset of dementia but only in those persons with relatively advanced symptoms.
