Brain glucose hypometabolism after perirhinal lesions in baboons: implications for Alzheimer disease and aging. The authors previously reported that excitotoxic lesions of both the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices in baboons induce remote neocortical and hippocampal hypometabolism reminiscent of that observed in Alzheimer disease (AD), suggesting that disconnection may play a role in AD. Because the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMR ) was preferentially correlated with perirhinal damage, the area first affected by neurofibrillary tangles in both AD and normal aging, the present series of experiments aimed at assessing the specific metabolic effects of perirhinal lesions. Using PET, CMR was measured before surgery and sequentially over the ensuing 10 months. Compared with sham-operated baboons, perirhinal lesions induced significant-albeit late and transient-CMR decreases in several brain regions, which significantly correlated with histologic damage for some of these regions. Among them, the temporal and hippocampal regions are metabolically affected after extensive rhinal lesions, in early AD, and aging, while the prefrontal region is affected in aging only. Furthermore, in contrast to AD and rhinal lesions, the posterior cingulate cortex was spared. Both the progressive but significant metabolic effects and specific hypometabolic pattern after perirhinal lesions were confirmed by direct comparisons with previous data obtained after combined lesions of both rhinal areas. Thus, although perirhinal damage appears in itself insufficient to induce sustained CMR decreases, it may contribute to the hypometabolic profile of both AD and normal aging, most likely with a stronger contribution in the latter.
