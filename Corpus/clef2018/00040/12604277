Comparison of thallium-201 uptake and retention indices for evaluation of brain lesions with SPECT. Thallium-201 chloride single photon emission computed tomography ((201)TlCl SPECT) has been applied extensively for studies of human tumors. To assess which indices for (201)TlCl SPECT are most useful for diagnosing brain lesions, a total of 82 patients (98 images) with intracranial abnormalities were investigated. Seventy-six cases with abnormal (201)Tl uptake were evaluated in terms of six different (201)Tl uptake and retention indices: (1) average early (201)Tl uptake = Av.Le/Av.Be (2) maximum early (201)Tl uptake = Mx.Le/Av.Be
