Effect of restoration of coronary blood flow on dynamics of myocardial perfusion and function in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Data of gated technetium-99m-sestamibi SPECT. Effects of coronary blood flow restoration on dynamics of myocardial perfusion and function were studied in 50 patients with acute myocardial infarction during 6-month follow-up. Gated SPECT with 99mTc-MIBI (G-SPECT) was performed before onset of reperfusion procedures, in 24 hours, 10 days, 1 and 6 months. In patients with successful reperfusion (n=36) perfusion defect (PD) size decreased by 6.78+/-0.97% (p<0.001) and its severity by 221.3+/-85 std (p<0.001) in 24 hours. In 10 days PD size decreased by 3.9+/-0.88% (r<0.05) and severity by 149+/-39 std (p<0.05), whereas in 1 month PD size decreased by 2,18+/-1,4% (p<0.05), PD severity by 146.3+/-67 std (p<0.05). Successful reperfusion was associated with improvement of contractility: left ventricular ejection fraction increased by 3% (p<0.05) on day 10 of the disease. In patients with failed reperfusion PD size and severity decreased in 10 days by 4.8+/-4.2%, p<0.05, and 276+/-75 std, p<0.05, respectively, in 6 months PD size decreased by 3.1+/-0.9%, p<0.05, left ventricular ejection fraction did not change during follow-up. We conclude that successful reperfusion therapy promotes restoration of myocardial perfusion and improvement of its contractility.
