Noncardiac findings on dual-isotope myocardial perfusion SPECT. This study examined the frequency of reporting noncardiac findings (NCFs), such as malignancies from inspection of raw projection images with dual-isotope single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion imaging, which could potentially be of greater clinical importance than myocardial perfusion imaging alone. Dual-isotope (ie, rest thallium 201 and stress technetium 99m sestamibi [MIBI] or Tc-99m tetrofosmin [TET]) SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging combines multipotential tracers for noncardiac purposes (Tl-201 for renal or splenic imaging, inflammation, or lymphoma and MIBI or TET for hepatobiliary imaging and detecting increased mitochondrial number or activity in neoplastic processes). These images are optimally interpreted with cinematic inspection of the raw projection data, but this may not be practiced uniformly in every laboratory.We reviewed 12,526 computer-generated text reports of dual-isotope perfusion SPECT studies from a 6-year period for NCFs. NCFs were categorized by organ and by probability of malignancy: high (eg, focal breast or lung uptake of MIBI or TET), intermediate (eg, lymph node uptake or thyroid abnormalities), or low (eg, filling defects in liver, kidney, spleen, or gall bladder ascitesIn patients referred for evaluation of myocardial perfusion, NCFs are unusual and require systematic and careful inspection of projection images for their detection. With Tl-201, TET, MIBI, or dual-isotope imaging, detecting and reporting NCFs may occasionally result in life-saving early cancer identification.
