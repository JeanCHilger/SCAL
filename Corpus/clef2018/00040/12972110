Reliability of pressure-derived myocardial fractional flow reserve in assessing coronary artery stenosis in patients with previous myocardial infarction. In 167 patients with suspected coronary artery disease, 74 of whom had myocardial infarction (MI), measurement of myocardial fractional flow reserve (FFR) in previous infarction territories, using a cut-off point of 0.75, showed a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 79% for myocardial ischemia as demonstrated by thallium-201 myocardial imaging. This sensitivity and specificity were similar to a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 72% observed in territories not related to MI. In addition, a receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the best predictability of FFR for myocardial ischemia was between 0.74 and 0.76, regardless of the presence or absence of MI.
