Relation between QT dispersion and myocardial viability in ischemic cardiomyopathy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between QT dispersion and myocardial viability as assessed by single-photon emission computed tomography. The study population included 97 consecutive patients with severely impaired left ventricular function secondary to chronic coronary artery disease. Patients with a low QT dispersion had a substantial amount of viable myocardium, whereas patients with a high QT dispersion had predominantly nonviable scar tissue.
