Topography and temporal evolution of hypoxic viable tissue identified by 18F-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography in humans after ischemic stroke. We sought to characterize the spatial and temporal evolution of human cerebral infarction. Using a novel method of quantitatively mapping the distribution of hypoxic viable tissue identified by 18F-fluoromisonidazole (18F-FMISO) PET relative to the final infarct, we determined its evolution and spatial topography in human stroke.Patients with acute middle cerebral artery territory stroke were imaged with 18F-FMISO PET (n=19 <6 hours, 4Higher HV was observed in the central region of the infarct in patients studied within 6 hours of onset (analysis of covariance [ANCOVA] P<0.05) compared with those studied later, in whom the HV was mainly in the periphery or external to the infarct. HV was maximal in the superior, mesial, and posterior regions of the infarct (ANCOVAThese observations suggest that infarct expansion occurs at the expense of hypoxic tissue from the center to the periphery of the ischemic region in humans, similar to that seen in experimental animal models. These findings have important pathophysiological and therapeutic implications.
