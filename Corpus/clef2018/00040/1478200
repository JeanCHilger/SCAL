Interictal HM-PAO SPECT: a routine investigation in patients with medically intractable complex partial seizures? Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is increasingly being used as an adjunctive technique in the localisation of epileptogenic foci prior to surgery. As yet, few studies have been undertaken to establish the clinical associations of areas of reduced cerebral perfusion. Sixty-three consecutive patients (15 male, 48 female median age 30 years, range 14-57 years) with medically intractable complex partial seizures (median/month 8, range 1-36) were investigated as outpatients. All had normal high resolution computerised X-ray tomography (CT) of brain. Twenty-seven (47%) exhibited significant perfusion defects on SPECT scanning with a rotating gamma camera system using Tc-99 HM-PAO. There were no significant differences between patients with normal and abnormal scans in terms of age at scanning or at onset of epilepsy or number of seizures. Patients with perfusion defects did, however, have longer median histories of epilepsy than those with normal scans (normal: 10 years, abnormal: 22 years
