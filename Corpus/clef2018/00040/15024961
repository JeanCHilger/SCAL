Imaging the pathology of Alzheimer's disease: amyloid-imaging with positron emission tomography. The steep rise in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has further added to the considerable public health burden caused by aging of the United States population. Among the most characteristic pathologic hallmarks of AD are neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The capability to use positron emission tomography and selective markers for amyloid protein deposition promises to substantially alter the way we diagnosis and manage patients who have AD.
