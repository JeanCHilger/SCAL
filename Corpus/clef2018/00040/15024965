Neuroimaging and mechanisms of drug abuse: interface of molecular imaging and molecular genetics. Whereas ligand studies can inform the end-products of dysregulation of genetic expression, reporter gene imaging can provide the means to understand the genetic origin of these end-products. As with radioligand studies, in vivo direct measurement of gene expression will allow genetic processes to be monitored over time in the same subject, use of a subject as his/her own control in intervention studies (i.e., measurement before and after an intervention), and monitoring the spatial distribution of molecular events in the whole brain. Furthermore, reporter gene imaging, by advancing knowledge of the biologic mechanisms of disease states, has important clinical implications, particularly in the development and monitoring of treatments. We expect PET to play a prominent role in the elucidation of substance abuse mechanisms and contribute significantly to the development of innovative treatment strategies.
