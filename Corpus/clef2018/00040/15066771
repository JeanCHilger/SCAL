A close keeper-nonhuman animal distance does not reduce undesirable behavior in contact yard goats and sheep. This study investigated the relation between zookeeper-nonhuman animal distance and the undesirable behavior goats and sheep exhibited toward visitors of Zoo Atlanta's contact yard. It hypothesized that a close distance between keeper and animal would be associated with a lower rate of undesirable behavior than would a distant keeper-animal distance. The study recorded rate of undesirable behavior exhibited, number of visitors in the yard, and number of times visitors touched an animal under near and distant keeper-animal distances. Seven African pygmy goats (Capra hircus) and 4 Romanov sheep (Ovis aries) were the subjects. The study used linear regression methods to analyze approximately 48 hr of behavioral data collected using a focal sampling technique. Findings indicated a familiar animal keeper nearby was not associated with lower rates of undesirable behavior toward visitors. Higher rates of undesirable behavior occurred when keepers were nearby than when they were distant. The study also found that undesirable behavior increased as visitors' touching of the animals increased. Applying the study's findings may improve human-animal interactions and increase animal well-being in a contact yard through animal management techniques.
