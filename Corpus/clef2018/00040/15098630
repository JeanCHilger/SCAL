Clinical applications of positron emission tomography in cardiology: a review. Myocardial viability assessment is of utmost importance in the assessment of patients with poor left ventricular function undergoing revascularisation therapies or cardiac transplantation. Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) is widely regarded as a "gold" standard in myocardial viability assessment. We review the current data on this subject with respect to tracers and techniques, and prognostic information. The newer cardiac PET techniques in perfusion, hypoxia and neuronal imaging are also discussed, with mention of possible new applications of cardiac PET.
