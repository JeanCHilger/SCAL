Pharmacogenetic insights to monoaminergic dysfunction in alcohol dependence. Alcohol dependence is characterized by the development of tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and craving for alcohol. Chronic alcohol consumption causes neuroadaptive changes in the central dopaminergic and serotonergic system, which are partially reversible after detoxification. The severity and time-course of recovery of these neuroadaptive changes may depend on the genetic constitution of monoamine transporters and receptors and contribute to the relapse risk of alcoholics.To assess the interaction between the genetic constitution and the in vivo availability of dopamine and serotonin transporters and receptors, chronic alcohol intake, alcohol craving and withdrawal.Review of brain imaging studies that assess the genotype and availability of dopamine and serotonin transporters in detoxified alcoholics and healthy control subjects.Chronic alcohol intake induced neuroadaptive reductions in striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability, which were reversible during early abstinence. A polymorphism of the DAT gene (SLC6A3) was associated with the in vivo transporter availability and with the severity of alcohol withdrawal. Neurotoxic reductions in 5-HTT protein expression were limited to homozygous carriers of the long allele in the 5-HTT gene (SCL6A4) regulatory region and correlated with negative mood states.Genetic constitution interacts with the in vivo availability of central dopamine and serotonin transporters during alcohol detoxification and may affect the severity of alcohol withdrawal and clinical depression.
