Non-esterified fatty acids impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver. We investigated the effect of elevated circulating NEFA on insulin-mediated hepatic glucose uptake (HGU) and whole-body glucose disposal (M) in eight healthy male subjects.Studies were performed using positron emission tomography (PET) and [(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) during euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia (0-120 min) and an Intralipid/heparin infusion (IL/Hep -90-120 min). On a different day, similar measurements were taken during euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia and saline infusion (SAL). Graphical and compartmental analyses were used to model liver data.Circulating NEFA increased approximately three-fold during IL/Hep, and declined by 81+/-7% in the SAL study ( p</=0.01). Both M (-28+/-7%) and HGU (-25+/-9%) were significantly lowered by NEFA elevation ( p=0.004 and p=0.035 respectively). In the whole data set, the decreases in M and HGU were positively correlated ( r=0.78, p=0.038). No evidence of [(18)F]FDG outflow was detected during the scanning time. HGU was correlated with the phosphorylation rate parameter ( r=0.71, p=0.003) as derived by compartmental modelling.In healthy men, NEFA impair insulin-mediated HGU and whole-body glucose uptake to a similar extent. Our data suggest that multiple intracellular NEFA targets may concur to down-regulate glucose uptake by the liver.
