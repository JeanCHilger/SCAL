Impact on estrogen receptor binding and target tissue uptake of [18F]fluorine substitution at the 16alpha-position of fulvestrant (faslodex ICI 182,780). Fulvestrant (Faslodex ICI 182,780) is a pure estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist recently approved for the treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer in post-menopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy. Fulvestrant strongly binds to the ER and its mode of action consists of inhibition of ER dimerization leading to a down regulation of ER protein cellular levels. With the aim to develop a probe for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging capable of predicting the potential therapeutic efficacy of selective ER modulators (SERM), we prepared three new 16alpha-[18F]fluoro-fulvestrant derivatives. These new radiopharmaceuticals were evaluated for their binding affinity to the human ERalpha and for their target tissue uptake in immature female rats. Substitution of one of the side-chain F-atoms of fulvestrant for 18F would have led to a product of low specific activity
