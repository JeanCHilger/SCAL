Proton magnetic resonance neurospectroscopy and EEG cartography in corticobasal degeneration: correlations with neuropsychological signs. To document the asymmetrical functional brain lesions in corticobasal degeneration (CBD) using proton magnetic resonance neurospectroscopy (MRS) and EEG cartography (EEGq).Eight patients with probable CBD were included in the study after full neurological examination and extensive neuropsychological testing, single photon emission computed tomography, anatomical x ray tomodensitometry (TDM), magnetic resonance imaging, and MRS examination.MR spectra were abnormal in all seven patients in whom the examination could be completed. The EEG was also always modified in the CBD patients, and the abnormalities were enhanced by activation procedures. There was a good correlation between MRS anomalies and clinical presentation, between EEG modifications and neuropsychological patterns, and between metabolic (MRS) impairment and electrophysiological (EEG) slowing.These results confirm the asymmetrical features of CBD. Combined EEGq/MRS examinations at disease onset and during its subsequent course could provide strong diagnostic evidence of CBD.
