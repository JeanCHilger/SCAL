The additive value of combined assessment of myocardial perfusion and ventricular function studies. In addition to providing quantitative ventricular function information, gated SPECT and radionuclide angiocardiographic studies can evaluate regional wall motion and ventricular volumes. This review focuses on the combined assessment of myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function. Two clear roles for nuclear imaging in clinical practice include the diagnosis of coronary artery disease and assessment of prognosis in patients with known coronary artery disease. Ventricular function information can help differentiate an attenuation artifact from an infarct and is helpful in diagnosing 3-vessel coronary disease. Additionally, several studies have highlighted the prognostic benefit to combined assessment of myocardial perfusion and ventricular function. Several new modalities have recently been reported that promise to continue to solidify the place of nuclear imaging in the diagnosis and prognosis of coronary artery disease.
