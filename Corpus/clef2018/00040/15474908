Dopamine transporter density in schizophrenic subjects with and without tardive dyskinesia. Striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding potential (BP) was compared between schizophrenic subjects with and without tardive dyskinesia and controls. Although the groups were not statistically different in striatal BP, tardive subjects had apparently lower DAT density than non-tardive schizophrenic subjects. Significant and trend-level inverse correlations were found between DAT BP in the striatum, and especially the severity of negative symptom scores, but also cognitive, and depression/anxiety scores on the PANSS.
