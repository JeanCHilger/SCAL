Rat-PET study without anesthesia: anesthetics modify the dopamine D1 receptor binding in rat brain. Positron emission tomography (PET) measurements in 6-month-old F344/N rats were performed in the conscious state and the influence of chloral hydrate, ketamine, and pentobarbital anesthesia on dopamine D(1) (DA-D(1)) receptor binding was evaluated using [(11)C]SCH23390, a selective DA-D(1) receptor ligand. To perform the PET study in conscious rats, an original fixation apparatus was developed and the animals were trained to acclimate to the scanning atmosphere for 3 h. This training was carried out twice a day for 2 weeks. PET measurements in conscious rats were successful, since the trained rats scarcely moved during the scanning (as monitored by video camera) and since highly reproducible measurements of binding potential (BP) were derived from their scanning. Chloral hydrate and ketamine anesthesia significantly increased the striatal BP of DA-D(1) receptors by 36% and 46%, respectively, compared to that observed in the conscious state. In contrast, pentobarbital markedly decreased the BP by 41%. These BP values of DA-D(1) receptors were calculated using a curve-fitting method. Our results indicate that PET studies in rats should be performed in the conscious state since the anesthetics dramatically modified ligand-receptor bindings, such as DA-D(1) receptor binding, in rat brain.
