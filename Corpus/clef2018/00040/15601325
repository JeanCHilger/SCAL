Scintigraphic findings in synovial sarcoma with structural correlation. Synovial sarcoma is a relatively rare malignant soft tissue tumour. It is highly aggressive, tends to occur in young adults and has a poor prognosis. The scintigraphic findings in 10 patients with histopathologically proven synovial sarcoma were reviewed. Most of the lesions occurred in the extremities and intense uptake of thallium was observed on 30-min and 4-h imaging in almost all cases. Thallium has an important role in the detection of possible metastatic disease and in monitoring response to therapy. The scintigraphic features of synovial sarcoma are presented and correlated with the radiographic findings.
