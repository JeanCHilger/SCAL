Metastatic bone disease. Diagnosis and treatment. The high incidence of bone metastasis secondary to carcinomas and its serious functional repercussion are motives for constant study and advance in the methods of evaluation, diagnosis and treatment. Pain is the most frequently shown symptom, although at times the start is a pathological fracture. The classic tests of detection and evaluation of the spread of the metastatic disease, simple radiology and gammagraphy, are today complemented by others such as computerised tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR), improving the information on the characteristics of the lesion both inside and outside the bone. On the other hand, positron emission tomography (PET) is showing a far higher sensitivity than gammagraphy and will probably be the test of the future for the early detection of metastasis and of silent primary tumours. The possibilities of treatment of bone metastasis are based on the use of bone regenerators, radiotherapy and surgery. The former two are indicated in lesions already detected in radiography, whether symptomatic or not, if there is no foreseeable risk of fracture. Surgery is indicated in situations of poor or null response to those treatments, when the risk of fracture is high or a pathological fracture has been produced. Before any therapeutic planning, a detailed evaluation of the patient must be carried out, both at a local level (size, site, extension of the metastasis) and general (type of primary tumour, phase of treatment and response, estimated survival).
