Development of a fusion toxin IL15M-PEdelta293 based on a receptor-specific IL-15 antagonist. IL-15 and IL-15 receptors (IL-15R) play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), multiple myeloma and inflammatory autoimmune diseases. To develop a novel therapeutic agent capable of eliminating IL-15R-over-expressing abnormal cells, the gene coding for human IL-15 antagonist (IL-15M) was fused with a DNA fragment coding for the mutated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin, PEdelta293. The resulting gene fusion was cloned into pET16b under the control of T7 promoter, giving rise to the expression plasmid pET-IL15M-PEdelta293. Using Ni2+ -NTA affinity chromatography, IL15M-PEdelta293 was purified from E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS transformed with pET-IL15M-PEdelta293. The fusion toxin showed cytotoxicity to IL-15R-bearing myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 and K562-derived multidrug resistant cell line K562/AO2. However, IL-15R negative cell line Jurkat was insensitive to IL15M-PEdelta293. In addition, the toxic effect of IL15M-PEdelta293 on K562 was completely blocked by excessive amount of recombinant human IL-15. These results demonstrated that the selective cytotoxicity of IL15M-PEdelta293 correlated with the appropriate IL-15R expression on target cells. The present data suggest that the chimeric toxin constructed in this report may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of diseases associated with abnormal expression of IL-15/IL-15R, even in the treatment of chemotherapy refractory tumors.
