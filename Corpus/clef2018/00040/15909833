Transmyocardial laser revascularization of the myocardium. The paper presents the results of a 5-year follow-up after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) combined with transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMLR). The study revealed high efficiency and safety of the combined surgery in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) associated with diffuse lesions of coronary arteries. The procedure improved the myocardial perfusion and contractile function, thus significantly increasing the patients' life quality. Combined CABG + TMLR noticeably improved stenocardia functional class, increased physical exercise tolerance and led to a significant reduction in nitrate agent consumption in patients with CHD.
