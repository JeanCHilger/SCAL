ECG-gated single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTC-tetraphosmin in diagnostics of short-term myocardium stunning under the condition of stress-induced ischemia in CHD patients with multivascular lesions of coronary vessels. The authors analyzed the efficiency of ECG-gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-tetraphosmin in diagnostics of short-term myocardium stunning in CAD patients with transient ischemia. The technique was applied to 16 CAD patients. Combined evaluation of perfusion was based on the analysis of radiotracer uptake level in left ventricle (LV) myocardium. In order to evaluate myocardium function the authors measured LV systolic thickening index, using 20-segment pattern. 8 out of 16 patients (50%) displayed the phenomenon of stress-induced stunning. The volume of stunned myocardium in individual patients was 2 to 7 LV segments. In general, up to 37% (29/78) of reversible perfusion defects are subjected to short-term stunning under the condition of transient ischemia. After surgical treatment, 84% of segments with signs of stunning normalized their functioning both under stress and at rest.
