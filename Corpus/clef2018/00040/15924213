Metabolite analysis in positron emission tomography studies: examples from food sciences. Substances of various chemical structures can be labelled with appropriate positron emitting isotopes and applied as tracer compounds in PET examinations. Using dynamic data acquisition protocols, time-activity curves of radioactivity uptake in organs can be derived and the measurements of tissue tracer concentrations can be translated into quantitative values of tissue function. However, analysis of metabolites of these tracers regarding their nature and distribution in the living organism is an essential need for the quantitative analysis of PET measurements. In addition, metabolite analysis contributes to the interpretation of the images obtained as well as to the identification of pathological changes in metabolic pathways. This paper reports on representative examples of radiolabelled compounds which might be of importance in food science (e.g., amino acids, polyphenols, and model compounds for advanced glycation end products (AGEs)). Typical procedures of analysis (radio-HPLC, radio-TLC) including pre-analytical sample preparation are described. Specific challenges of the method, e.g., trace amounts of radiolabelled compounds and the influence of the often very short half-lives of positron-emitting nuclides used are highlighted. Representative results of analyses of plasma, urine, and tissue samples are presented and discussed in terms of the metabolic fate of the tracers.
