The role of gastric distention in differentiating recurrent tumor from physiologic uptake in the remnant stomach on 18F-FDG PET. Physiologic (18)F-FDG uptake in the stomach can often cause false-positive results and lowers the usefulness of (18)F-FDG PET in evaluating the remnant stomach. We assessed the role of gastric distension to see whether it is beneficial for the differentiation of recurrent tumors from physiologic (18)F-FDG uptake in the remnant stomach.Thirty patients (22 men and 8 women age range, 27-80 yVisual analysis of whole-body images produced 9 true-negative, 4 false-positive, 16 true-positive, and 1 false-negative results. Use of additional spot images produced 12 true-negative, 1 false-positive, 15 true-positive, and 2 false-negative results. When an SUV cutoff of 2 was applied for malignancy before water ingestion, all 17 patients with local recurrence were correctly identified, but 11 of the 13 patients without local recurrence were falsely considered to have a recurrent tumor in the remnant stomach. To reduce the false-positive results, we used the second SUV criterion after water ingestion. Use of that criterion produced 4 false-negative results although it correctly identified the 11 false-positive results as true negative.Gastric distension by having patients drink a glass of water seems to be a simple, cost-effective way of improving the diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET in patients with suspected recurrence in the remnant stomach. Visual analysis with special attention to the configuration of (18)F-FDG activity after water ingestion seems to be more useful than the change in SUV in evaluating the remnant stomach.
