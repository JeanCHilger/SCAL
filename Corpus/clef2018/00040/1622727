Quantitative phase analysis of myocardial wall thickening by technetium-99m 2-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile SPECT. Regional wall thickening was assessed by ECG-gated SPECT using technetium-99m 2-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (99mTc-MIBI). For myocardial segments with an optimal short axis, regional count changes from end-diastole to end-systole were used to calculate the regional wall thickening. Functional images displaying amplitude, % wall thickening (% WT), and phase were generated by a fundamental Fourier analysis. In the control subjects, % WT analysis showed heterogeneous contraction among the left ventricular wall segments. The amplitude values showed a similar pattern to the %WT values. Phase images demonstrated that the timing of ventricular contraction was almost homogenous between the various wall segments. In the CAD patients, regional decreases in amplitude and %WT corresponding to zones of reduced perfusion were shown in the ischemic segments. Phase images also indicated asynchronous contraction in these segments. Phase analysis of regional wall thickening in 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy seems to be useful for understanding regional myocardial function in combination with perfusion scanning.
