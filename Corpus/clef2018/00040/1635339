The peritoneal equilibration test in children. The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) has been recommended in adults as a standardized means of estimating solute transport. Based on results of the PET, adult peritoneal permeability has been classified as high, high average, low average, and low. We performed a PET on 32 children aged 0.8 to 17.8 years (mean 9.3) using a dwell volume of 32 +/- 5 ml/kg of 2.5% dialysate. Dialysate to plasma (D/P) ratios for creatinine, urea, and sodium were calculated at two and four hours as were the ratios of dialysate glucose at two and four hours to the dialysate glucose at time 0 (D/Do). Stepwise logistic regression identified only the patients' age and D/Do glucose values at two hours as significant predictors of ultrafiltration. Net ultrafiltration after a four hour dwell could be predicted for 75% of children above 9.3 years, or whose D/Do glucose value at two hours was greater than 0.45. The mean and standard deviation values for D/Do glucose and D/P creatinine at four hours were 0.31 +/- 0.17 and 0.71 +/- 0.12, respectively. When children are characterized according to adult standards, at least 70% fall into the high or high average permeability categories.
