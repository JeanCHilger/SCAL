Pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder and obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders. This article reviews new developments of pharmacotherapy in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and OC spectrum disorders of the past five years. New developments primarily involved the ex-tension of evidence of efficacy of serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SRIs), the use of atypical antipsychotics in addition to SRIs for treatment refractory patients, the combination of pharmacotherapy with behavior therapy, and studies assessing predictors of response. Today, frontline pharmacological treatment of OCD still consists of drugs with potent serotonin reuptake inhibition proper-ties. In case of non-response, treatment options comprise adding another drug, increasing the dose, switching drugs, or changing the mode of delivery.
