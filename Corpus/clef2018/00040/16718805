Gastric accommodation assessed by ultrasonography. Gastric accommodation is important for the understanding of the pathophysiology in functional dyspepsia and is also relevant for symptom generation in other disorders. The term gastric accommodation has at least three different meanings: The accommodation process, the accommodation reflex, and the accommodation response. The gastric accommodation process is a complex phenomenon that describes how the size of the gastric compartment changes in response to a meal. The electronic barostat is considered the gold standard in assessing gastric accommodation. Imaging methods, including MRI, SPECT, and ultrasonography may also be used, particularly in patients who are stress-responsive, e.g. functional dyspepsia patients, as a non-invasive and less stress-inducing method is favourable. Ultrasonography satisfies these criteria as it does not by itself distort the physiological response in stress-responsive individuals.
