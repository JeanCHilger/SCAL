Intramyocardial Implantation of bone marrow-derived stem cells enhances perfusion in chronic myocardial infarction: dependency on initial perfusion depth and follow-up assessed by gated pinhole SPECT. Cell therapy-induced changes in the perfusion of areas of myocardial infarction (MI) remain unclear. This study investigated whether an original pinhole SPECT technique could be applied to a rat MI model to analyze local improvement in myocardial perfusion relating to engraftment sites of bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs).Four-month-old MI rats were either untreated (n = 8) or treated (n = 10) by intramyocardial injection of (111)In-labeled BMSCs. Early distribution of (111)In-BMSCs within the MI target was evidenced by dual (111)In/(99m)Tc pinhole SPECT 48 h later. Myocardial perfusion was serially monitored by (99m)Tc-sestamibi pinhole gated SPECT up to 3 mo after transplantation.Forty-eight hours after transplantation, (111)In-BMSCs were observed in all treated rats and in 18 of their 32 underperfused MI segments (<70% sestamibi uptake before transplantation). During the subsequent 3-mo follow-up, the perfusion of MI segments worsened in untreated rats (absolute change in sestamibi uptake, -3% +/- 3% P < 0.05) but improved in treated rats (+4% +/- 7%When BMSCs are injected within chronic MI, perfusion enhancement predominates in the MI areas showing a high enough residual perfusion before treatment but not in those of the initial cell engraftment, giving evidence of dependency on the perfusion and metabolic environment at implantation sites.
