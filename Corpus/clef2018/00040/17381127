Antioxidant content of and migration from commercial polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride packages. Antioxidants commonly used in polyolefins were studied in commercial food packages made of low- and high-density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinylchloride (PVC), and polyethylene terephtalate (PET) and in a LDPE film extruded at the laboratory. The phenolic antioxidants BHA, BHT, AO 2246, AO 425, Ethanox 330, Irganox 1010, and Irganox 1076 were studied together with the phosphite Irgafos 168 and their two degradation products, phosphate and DBP. Antioxidants were extracted from polyolefins using microwave energy and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the antioxidant content in the diverse commercial films. Irganox 1010 and Irganox 1076 were found in the majority of the samples generally together with the phosphite Irgafos 168 and its oxidized product (phosphate). Specific migration levels of each antioxidant were determined by HPLC after pretreatment with solid-phase extraction (SPE) in aqueous food simulants and after their dilution with tetrahydrofuran (THF) in fatty food simulant. These levels were much lower than limits allowed by legislation.
