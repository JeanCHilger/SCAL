Iterative image reconstruction using inverse Fourier rebinning for fully 3-D PET. We describe a fast forward and back projector pair based on inverse Fourier rebinning for use in iterative image reconstruction for fully 3-D positron emission tomography (PET). The projector pair is used as part of a factored system matrix that takes into account detector-pair response by using shift-variant sinogram blur kernels, thereby combining the computational advantages of Fourier rebinning with iterative reconstruction using accurate system models. The forward projector consists of a 2-D projector, which maps 3-D images into 2-D direct sinograms, followed by exact inverse rebinning which maps the 2-D into fully 3-D sinograms. The back projector is implemented as the transpose of the forward projector and differs from the true exact rebinning operator in the sense that it does not require reprojection to compute missing lines of response (LORs). We compensate for two types of inaccuracies that arise in a cylindrical PET scanner when using inverse Fourier rebinning: 1) nonuniform radial sampling and 2) nonconstant oblique angles in the radial direction in a single oblique sinogram. We examine the effects of these corrections on sinogram accuracy and reconstructed image quality. We evaluate performance of the new projector pair for maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction of simulated and in vivo data. The new projector results in only a small loss in resolution towards the edge of the field-of-view when compared to the fully 3-D geometric projector and requires an order of magnitude less computation.
