Automated breath-hold perfusion SPECT/CT fusion images of the lungs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical applicability and feasibility of deep-inspiratory breath-hold (DIBrH) perfusion SPECT for improving adverse respiratory motion effects and for accuracy of SPECT/CT image fusion.Eighty-seven consecutive patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 43), acute pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) (n = 26), and interstitial lung disease (ILD), (n = 18), underwent respiratory-monitored DIBrH SPECT with a dual-headed SPECT system. Two COPD and four acute PTE patients were excluded because of inappropriate scanning due to DIBrH difficulty. DIBrH SPECT was automatically fused with DIBrH CT. Perfusion defect clarity and heterogeneity and SPECT/CT matching were compared between DIBrH SPECT and non-breath-hold SPECT.Compared with non-breath-hold SPECT, DIBrH SPECT significantly enhanced defect clarity in acute PTE (p < 0.0001) and perfusion heterogeneity (coefficient of variations [CV] of pixel counts) in COPD and ILD (p < 0.0001). CV in COPD was also better correlated with lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (p < 0.05). DIBrH SPECT also significantly improved SPECT/CT matching (p < 0.0001), with excellent matching of CT lung internal landmarks and pathology with corresponding defects. Fusion images confirmed wedge-shaped defects extending along specific pulmonary arterial branches in acute PTE and heterogeneous defects associated with airway or lung parenchymal abnormalities in COPD and ILD, with perfusion distribution consistent with lung CT attenuation changes.DIBrH SPECT is acceptable for routine application to improve respiratory motion effects and accuracy of SPECT/CT image fusion. Confirmative perfusion-morphologic correlation with reliable fusion images appears useful for clarifying the cause of perfusion defects and abnormal lung CT attenuation.
