The emerging role of molecular imaging and targeted therapeutics in peritoneal carcinomatosis. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a common and often fatal late-stage complication of many gastrointestinal and gynecologic malignancies. This review discusses the ongoing evolution of diagnostic and treatment strategies for peritoneal carcinomatosis and the role that molecular imaging and radioimmunotherapy may play in improving patient survival. An overview of recent developments in targeted imaging and therapeutics for peritoneal carcinomatosis, as well as the authors' opinions as to future developments in this field is also provided.
