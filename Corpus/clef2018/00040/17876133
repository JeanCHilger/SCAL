Recent progress in diagnostic radiology for urinary system malignant tumors. The clinical effectiveness and utility of diagnostic radiology with various new technologies and examination methods under development are under investigation. In diagnostic radiology of urinary system malignant tumors, trans-abdominal echography is accepted for screening in terms of ease and safety. But there is a problem in spatial resolution, and contrasting echography and doppler echography are awaited. In diagnostic radiology of a kidney and upper urinary tract system, MDCT (Multidetector-row CT) is the most used,because MDCT provides high time advantages, spatial resolution and widespread availability. However, the method of choice with MRI is under review given the problem of contrast media. MDCT effectiveness is reported in diagnostic radiology of the bladder, but MRI is used for invasion depth diagnosis by means of high tissue contrast. In diagnostic radiology of prostate cancer, the utility of DWI (diffusion-weighted image) and MRS (MR spectroscopy) is reported. As for 18 F-FDG-PET (positron emission tomography)/CT, evaluation of primary lesions is insufficient, since incides are excreted by the urinary tract,but it is effective for a metastatic diagnosis. It is thought that an image diagnostic procedure changes more in future by the direction for uses of contrast media, the newly technical use, a contrasting echography and new isotope PET/CT.
