One-lung ventilation induces hyperperfusion and alveolar damage in the ventilated lung: an experimental study. One-lung ventilation (OLV) increases mechanical stress in the lung and affects ventilation and perfusion (V, Q). There are no data on the effects of OLV on postoperative V/Q matching. Thus, this controlled study evaluates the influence of OLV on V/Q distribution in a pig model using a gamma camera technique [single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)] and relates these findings to lung histopathology after OLV.Eleven anaesthetized and ventilated pigs (V(T)=10 ml kg(-1), Fio2=0.40, PEEP=5 cm H2O) were studied. After lung separation, OLV and thoracotomy were performed in seven pigs (OLV group). During OLV and in a two-lung ventilation (TLV), control group (n=4) ventilation settings remained unchanged. SPECT with (81m)Kr (ventilation) and (99m)Tc-labelled macro-aggregated albumin (perfusion) was performed before, during, and 90 min after OLV/TLV. Finally, lung tissue samples were harvested and examined for alveolar damage.OLV affected ventilation and haemodynamic variables, but there were no differences between the OLV group and the control group before and after OLV/TLV. SPECT revealed an increase of perfusion in the dependent lung compared with baseline (49-56%), and a corresponding reduction of perfusion (51-44%) in non-dependent lungs after OLV. No perfusion changes were observed in the control group. This resulted in increased low V/Q regions and a shift of V/Q areas to 0.3-0.5 (10(-0.5)-10(-0.3)) in dependent lungs of OLV pigs and was associated with an increased diffuse alveolar damage score.OLV in pigs results in a substantial V/Q mismatch, hyperperfusion, and alveolar damage in the dependent lung and may thus contribute to gas exchange impairment after thoracic surgery.
