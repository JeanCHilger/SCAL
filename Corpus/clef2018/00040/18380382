The value of positron emission tomography in the diagnosis and treatment of oesophageal cancer. Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a noninvasive imaging technique that applies the glucose metabolism to visualise the metabolic activity ofa tumour. FDG-PET might improve the selection of potentially curable patients with oesophageal cancer in addition to state-of-the-art conventional work-up (e.g. endoscopic ultrasonography and spiral CT). The additional value however is only 4% for all patients, and 7% in patients with stage III-IV disease. Moreover, the additional costs of FDG-PET are not compensated by the cost reduction ofprevented surgery. To improve the outcome of patients with oesophageal cancer the value ofneoadjuvant chemo- and/or radiotherapy is being investigated. FDG-PET seems to be a promising tool for the early assessment of response to neoadjuvant therapy. In case of non-response the ineffective neoadjuvant therapy can be stopped without further delaying appropriate surgery. FDG-PET might be able to improve the prediction of prognosis, in addition to commonly used histopathological factors.
