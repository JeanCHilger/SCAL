Expression and purification of soluble B lymphocyte stimulator from recombinant Escherichia coli. In this work, the expression conditions of fusion protein thioredoxin (Trx)-soluble B lymphocyte stimulator (sBLyS) in shake flask and bioreactor from the recombinant Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) with a pET system encoding the fusion protein gene of Trx-sBLyS and the purification method of the sBLyS were optimized to effectively obtain the bioactive protein sBLyS with a high purity. A yield of about 250 mg Trx-sBLyS/g DWC (1686 mg Trx-sBLyS/L) and expression level of about 38.5% in soluble Trx-sBLyS were obtained in a 30 1 bioreactor after optimization of the fermentation conditions. After the completion of the optimized purification procedure in order of affinity chromatography, enzymatic cleavage with enterokinase and DEAE ion exchange chromatography, about 200 mg sBLyS per liter fermentation broth was obtained with a purity of about 95% and a yield of near 30%, respectively. Furthermore, the molecular weight (MW) and the isoelectric point (pI) of the purified sBLyS were determined by 2-D gel electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE analysis and estimated to be over 16 kDa and about pH 4.15, respectively. In addition, the bioactivities of the soluble Trx-sBLyS in fermentation broth and the purified sBLyS were tested by two kinds of analytical methods of bioactivity. The good fermentation yield and the satisfied, purified sBLyS product with high purity, yield and bioactivity demonstrated the sBLyS production procedure was promising in industry.
