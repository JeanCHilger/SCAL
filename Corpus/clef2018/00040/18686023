Baseline myocardial perfusion predicts response to cardiac resynchronization therapy: a prospective observational study. We prospectively determined whether preimplant myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) predicts outcome with biventricular pacing (BiVP).Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) MPI, left ventricular (LV) volumes, ejection fraction (EF), 6-min hall walk (6MW) were assessed at baseline and at 4 months in 19 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing BiVP. Clinical and hemodynamic responses were correlated with MPI.Lower global myocardial scar burden predicted hemodynamic response to BiVP, while higher burden was associated with poor response. Clinical improvement with BiVP occurred in 12 (63%) of the patients. Clinical BiVP responders had lower rest/stress MPI score difference. There was a close negative correlation between MPI reversibility and increased 6MW distance.Baseline MPI is associated with clinical and hemodynamic response to BiVP: greater myocardial scar burden is predictive of poor hemodynamic response, while higher ischemic burden is predictive of poor clinical response. There is a differential response to BiVP by clinical and hemodynamic criteria.
