Advances in neuroimaging in patients with epilepsy. Intractable seizures can have a devastating effect on the development of a child. In children with intractable epilepsy that is refractory to medication, surgical treatment may be needed. Magnetic resonance imaging is an essential neuroimaging tool to assist in the identification of an epileptogenic substrate. The interpretation of MR images should be done in the context of clinical knowledge of the seizure symptomatology and electroencephalographic findings. Quantitative processing of structural MR data and advanced MR imaging such as diffusion tensor imaging and MR spectroscopy have the potential to identify subtle lesions that may otherwise have been missed. In addition to lesion localization, identification of eloquent cortex and white matter tracts are also an essential component of epilepsy surgery workup. Functional MR imaging maps the sensorimotor cortex and also lateralizes language. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography can be used to map the corticospinal tracts and the optic radiations. In addition to MR imaging, magnetoencephalography and nuclear medicine studies such as PET and SPECT scanning may be used to lateralize seizure focus when clinical, electrophysiological, and structural MR imaging findings are discordant.
