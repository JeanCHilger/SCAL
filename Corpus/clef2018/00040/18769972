Endothelial dysfunction in recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients evaluated by PET. To demonstrate the presence of endothelial dysfunction (ED) in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) by using (13)N-ammonia-positron emission tomography (PET). PET can identify ED by quantifying myocardial blood flow (MBF) during rest, cold pressor test (CPT), and pharmacologic stress. The endothelial-dependent vasodilation index (EDVI), myocardial flow reserve (MFR), and the percentage of the change between rest and CPT (%DeltaMBF) are markers of endothelial function.Thirty-nine subjects were studied (19 women and 20 men) 22 recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients and 17 healthy controls (HC). A three-phase (13)N-ammonia-PET was performed.Mean EDVI was 1.208 +/- 0.34 vs. 1.55 +/- 0.37 (diabetic vs. HC group, respectively) (p = 0.002), MFR was 2.803 +/- 1.39 vs. 3.27 +/- 0.72 (p = NS), and the %DeltaMBF was 20 +/- 34% vs. 55 +/- 37% (p = 0.002). Rest MBF and CPT MBF were normalized to the rate pressure product (RPP). EDVI' and %DeltaMBF' were calculated using the corrected values for the RPP. Mean EDVI' was (0.864 +/- 0.250 vs. 1.110 +/- 0.238, p = 0.004) and mean %DeltaMBF' was (-8.2 +/- 14.7% vs. 4.5 +/- 12.1%, p = 0.005).Asymptomatic, recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients present ED that can be quantified by (13)N-ammonia-PET.
