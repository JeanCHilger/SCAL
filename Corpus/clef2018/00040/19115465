Gastroparesis: current diagnostic challenges and management considerations. Gastroparesis refers to abnormal gastric motility characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. The most common etiologies include diabetes, post-surgical and idiopathic. The most common symptoms are nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain. Gastroparesis is estimated to affect 4% of the population and symptomatology may range from little effect on daily activity to severe disability and frequent hospitalizations. The gold standard of diagnosis is solid meal gastric scintigraphy. Treatment is multimodal and includes dietary modification, prokinetic and anti-emetic medications, and surgical interventions. New advances in drug therapy, and gastric electrical stimulation techniques have been introduced and might provide new hope to patients with refractory gastroparesis. In this comprehensive review, we discuss gastroparesis with emphasis on the latest developments from the perspective of the practicing clinician.
