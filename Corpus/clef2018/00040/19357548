Nitrate-augmented myocardial perfusion imaging for assessment of myocardial viability: recent advances. Nitrate-augmented myocardial perfusion imaging has been demonstrated to improve the detection of myocardial viability and accurately predicts recovery of left ventricular (LV) function in patients with severe coronary artery disease and LV dysfunction. Recently, several studies showed the prognostic utility of nitrate imaging in evaluation of event-free survival in ischemic LV dysfunction. Furthermore, the diagnostic power of nitrate imaging compared with positron emission tomography or MRI, as well as the mechanism of nitrate-enhanced imaging, were also studied. We describe recent studies using nitrate-augmented myocardial perfusion imaging for the assessment of myocardial viability.
