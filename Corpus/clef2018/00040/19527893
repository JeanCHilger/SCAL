Evaluating global and regional left ventricular function in patients with reperfused acute myocardial infarction by 64-slice multidetector CT: a comparison to magnetic resonance imaging. A number of studies have compared 64-slice multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for left ventricular (LV) function however, none were performed in patients with reperfused acute myocardial infarction.We compared global and regional LV function assessment by 64-slice CT (MDCT) with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) after reperfused ST elevation myocardial infarction.Twenty-one patients were scanned after reperfusion with contrast-enhanced CMR and MDCT. Reconstructed short axis images were used to assess global (quantitative assessment of LF end-diastolic volume [LVEDV], end-systolic volume [LVESV], stroke volume [LVSV], ejection fraction [LVEF], and mass, by Simpson's method) and regional cardiac function (qualitative assessment on a 4-point scale [4=normal, 3=hypokinesia, 2=dyskinesia, 1=akinesia]) in a standard 17-segment myocardial model.We scanned 21 persons (age, 60+/-10 years 19 men) with CMR and MDCT. Good correlation was observed for all global parameters between MDCT and CMR (LVEF, r=0.90MDCT provides an accurate and reproducible measurement of regional and global LV function in patients with reperfused acute myocardial infarction.
