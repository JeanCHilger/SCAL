Dual-isotope single-photon emission computed tomography for dopamine and serotonin transporters in normal and Parkinsonian monkey brains. Parkinson's disease (PD) affects both dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. In this study, we simultaneously evaluated dopamine and serotonin transporters in primates using dual-isotope single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and compared the results with traditional single-isotope imaging.Four healthy and one 6-OHDA-induced PD monkeys were used for this study. SPECT was performed over 4 h after individual or simultaneous injection of [(99m)Tc]TRODAT-1 (a dopamine transporter imaging agent) and [(123)I]ADAM (a serotonin transporter imaging agent).The results showed that the image quality and uptake ratios in different brain regions were comparable between single- and dual-isotope studies. The striatal [(99m)Tc]TRODAT-1 uptake in the PD monkey was markedly lower than that in normal monkeys. The uptake of [(123)I]ADAM in the midbrain of the PD monkey was comparable to that in the normal monkeys, but there were decreased uptakes in the thalamus and striatum of the PD monkey.Our results suggest that dual-isotope SPECT using [(99m)Tc]TRODAT-1 and [(123)I]ADAM can simultaneously evaluate changes in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in a PD model.
