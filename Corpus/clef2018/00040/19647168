Multipoint analysis of reduced (125)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine uptake and norepinephrine turnover in the hearts of mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydroxypyridine-induced parkinsonism. (125)I-Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) cardiac uptake is reduced in mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydroxypyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism, although the cause of disturbance of norepinephrine (NE) turnover is unclear.C57BL6 mice (15 weeks old) were divided into six groups (n=14 each) according to the timing of MPTP injection (40 mg/kg) before (125)I-MIBG: Group A, control (no MPTP injection) Group B, 1 dayThe %ID/g of B, C, D, E and F mice were significantly lower than in A those of C, D and E were significantly higher than in BThus, MPTP causes rapid reductions in cardiac (125)I-MIBG uptake and B(max) of NET, followed by partial recovery of (125)I-MIBG uptake. Changes in cardiac (125)I-MIBG uptake and NE turnover were closely related in postganglionic cardiac sympathetic nerve terminals in mice with MPTP-induced parkinsonism.
