Estimation of cerebral perfusion among patients with eating disorders, neurotic and depressive disorders. Assessment of the cerebral blood perfusion among patients with eating (ED), anxiety (AD) and depressive disorders (DD), diagnosed according to ICD-10.57 females and 22 males, aged 17-50 were examined using the Single Photon Emission Computer Tomography (SPECT) and the neuropsychological tests, Benton and Bender. We also used the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Spielberger Self-Evaluation Questionnaire. Electroencephalography was also performed.In ED, hypoperfusion occurred in 84.21%, and impairment of the central nervous system (CNS), was found in 27.77%, abnormalities in the electroencephalography--in 33.33% of the patients. In AD, hypoperfusion occurred in 72.72%, impairment of CNS--in 40%, abnormalities in EEG--in 48% of patients. In DD, hypoperfusion occurred in 81.48%, impairment of CNS--in 34.61%, abnormalities in EEG--in 38.46% of patients.Hypoperfusion was observed mostly among patients with ED, mainly in the frontal, temporal areas, and in the thalamus, on the left hand side, similar to DD group. Among patients with AD, hypoperfusion at the left hand side occurred almost three times more frequently than among patients with DD (Chi2 = 6.54, p < .025) and was significant. Anxiety as a trait was the highest in ED, but not significant. Among patients with AD, anxiety as a trait and as a state were almost at the same level.
