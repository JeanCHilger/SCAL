Multislice SPECT/CT in benign and malignant bone disease: when the ordinary turns into the extraordinary. Nuclear medicine has entered a new era of multimodality imaging. Dedicated multislice single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) cameras are relatively new additions to the diagnostic armamentarium in nuclear medicine. The integration of SPECT and CT provides precise anatomical localization and may enable characterization of abnormalities identified on planar or SPECT imaging by providing structural information by CT. The evidence in support of SPECT/CT is rapidly amounting but still relatively limited. To date, studies have suggested improved diagnostic confidence and specificity in the diagnosis of bone pathology. The combination of functional information and anatomical localization has the potential to influence medical practice with newer imaging algorithms. This review presents the current evidence and potential indications of SPECT/CT bone imaging in the assessment of benign and malignant conditions.
