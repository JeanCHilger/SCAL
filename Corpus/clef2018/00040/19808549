Multimodality cardiovascular molecular imaging, part I. In Part I of this consensus article, the imaging methodology, evolving imaging technology, and development of novel targeted molecular probes relevant to the developing field of cardiovascular molecular imaging were reviewed. Novel reporter gene and reporter probe imaging approaches for tracking of cardiac transgene expression were also discussed and have important future implications for evaluation of gene- and cell-based therapies for the failing heart. The current role of metabolic and receptor imaging was also briefly reviewed, as these represent the beginning of our clinical application of molecular imaging within the cardiovascular system. Part II will summarize the available targeted imaging probes as well as specific future applications of molecular imaging for identification and evaluation of critical pathophysiological processes of the cardiovascular system.
