Amyloid PET in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease with BF-227: comparison to FDG-PET. We recently developed a novel PET tracer, (11)C-labeled 2-(2-[2-dimethylaminothiazol-5-yl]ethenyl)-6-(2-[fluoro]ethoxy)benzoxazole ([(11)C]BF-227), and had success with in vivo detection of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains (Kudo et al. in J Nucl Med 8:553-561, 2007). We applied this tracer to subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD in order to elucidate the status of amyloid plaque deposition in MCI and compared the diagnostic performance of BF-227-PET with that of FDG-PET in AD cases. We studied 12 aged normal (AN) subjects, 15 MCIs and 15 ADs with PET using [(11)C]BF-227. PET images were obtained after administration of BF-227 and the regional standardized uptake value (SUV) and the ratio of regional to cerebellar SUV were calculated as an index of BF-227 binding. AD patients showed increased uptake of [(11)C]BF-227 in the neocortical areas and striatum as well as decreased glucose metabolism in temporoparietal, posterior cingulate and medial temporal areas. MCI subjects showed a significant increase in BF-227 uptake in the neocortical areas similar to AD, and the most significant difference of BF-227 retention was observed in the parietal lobe if its retentions for MCI were compared to those for AD and AN. On the other hand, glucose hypometabolism in MCI was confined to cingulate and medial temporal cortices. Neocortical BF-227 uptake negatively correlated with glucose metabolism. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated higher specificity and sensitivity with BF-227-PET than those with FDG-PET for differential diagnosis between AD and normal control. We conclude that [(11)C]BF-227-PET has a possibility to be a useful technology for early detection of AD pathology and also even in the MCI stage.
