Bis(thiosemicarbazonato) Cu-64 complexes for positron emission tomography imaging of Alzheimer's disease. A bis (thiosemicarbazonato) complex radiolabeled with positron emitting Cu-64 can be used for a new and alternative method for the non-invasive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using positron emission tomography (PET). Most imaging agents being investigated for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease target amyloid-beta plaque burden but our new approach highlights altered copper homeostasis. This approach has the potential to offer complementary information to other diagnostic procedures that elucidate plaque burden.
