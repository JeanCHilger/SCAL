Myocardial perfusion abnormality and chest pain in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To investigate the role of myocardial ischemia in the development of chest pain in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), exercise stress (Ex) redistribution myocardial single photon emission CT's (SPECT's) with thallium-201 (Tl) were obtained in 27 patients with HCM. In all patients, coronary arteries were normal arteriographically. Patients were classified into NYHA Class I, II and III according to the frequency and severity of the chest pain during daily life. In these 3 groups, age, sex and intraventricular septal thickness measured by echocardiography were not different. Types of myocardial perfusion obtained by myocardial SPECT's were divided into 5: 1) normal perfusion, 2) no perfusion defect with abnormal myocardial Tl washout rate (WOR) during 3 hours (less than 30%) [Def(-)/WORabn], 3) reversible perfusion defect (RD), 4) fixed defect with abnormal WOR (FD/WORabn), 5) fixed defect with normal WOR (FD/WORnl). In 14 patients with Class I, 9 patients (64%) showed normal perfusion but the rest showed perfusion abnormality (def(-)/WORabn in 3 and RD in 2). In Class II and III, all patients showed perfusion abnormalities of RD, FD/WORabn or FD/WORnl. As the functional class progressed from Class II to III, the ratio of fixed defect (both WORnl and WORabn) to RD increased, but it was not statistically significant. In 2 patients in whom Ex SPECT's were repeated because of the progression of the chest pain, the severity of the perfusion abnormality also progressed. Perfusion abnormalities were observed most frequently in anterior (35%), then inferior/posterior (20%) and septal wall (18%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
