Effects of anesthetic protocol on normal canine brain uptake of 18F-FDG assessed by PET/CT. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of four anesthetic protocols on normal canine brain uptake of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Five clinically normal beagle dogs were anesthetized with (1) propofol/isoflurane, (2) medetomidine/pentobarbital, (3) xylazine/ketamine, and (4) medetomidine/tiletamine-zolazepam in a randomized cross-over design. The standard uptake value (SUV) of FDG was obtained in the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes, cerebellum, brainstem and whole brain, and compared within and between anesthetic protocols using the Friedman test with significance set at P < 0.05. Significant differences in SUVs were observed in various part of the brain associated with each anesthetic protocol. The SUV for the frontal and occipital lobes was significantly higher than in the brainstem in all dogs. Dogs receiving medetomidine/tiletamine-zolazepam also had significantly higher whole brain SUVs than the propofol/isoflurane group. We concluded that each anesthetic protocol exerted a different regional brain glucose uptake pattern. As a result, when comparing brain glucose uptake using PET/CT, one should consider the effects of anesthetic protocols on different regions of the glucose uptake in the dog's brain.
