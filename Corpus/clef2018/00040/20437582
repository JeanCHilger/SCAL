Antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase define a form of limbic encephalitis. Antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) have been described in a few patients with temporal lobe epilepsies consistent with limbic encephalitis (LE). We studied a cohort of patients with recent-onset temporal lobe epilepsy caused by LE to test for GAD antibody positivity and response to immunotherapies.Over a period of 3.75 years, 138 patients aged >or=18 years investigated at the Department of Epileptology, University of Bonn, for recent-onset epilepsy were prospectively collected and studied for cliniconeuroradiological features of LE, autoantibodies, and treatment responses.Fifty-three adult patients fulfilled the criteria for LE: (1) limbic signs and symptoms for <or=5 years and (2) brain MRI revealing mediotemporal encephalitis (T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity without atrophy). Nine had high-titer GAD antibodies 10 had voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) antibodies. Patients with GAD antibodies were younger (median age, 23 yearsHigh-titer GAD antibodies define a form of nonparaneoplastic LE. This is a chronic, nonremitting disorder and should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with TLE and mediotemporal encephalitis. Therapeutic trials of other immunotherapies should be undertaken.
