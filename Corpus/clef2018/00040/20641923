 Invasive procedures are often necessary to treat internal bone injuries or disorders. Therefore it is important for individuals providing treatment to accurately diagnose the disorder to provide the most suitable therapy before subjecting the patient to any invasive procedures. Bone injuries are often investigated either by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans using radionuclides (1). The SPECT technique is based on imaging of radionuclides and the fact that certain elements or compounds concentrate selectively in specific tissue. Compared to other imaging techniques, e.g., planar scintigraphy, SPECT provides detailed information about the anatomy and physiological state of the bone (1, 2). Bone SPECT has been used to detect early osteonecrosis of the femoral head in renal transplant patients (3), to investigate internal derangement and stress fractures of the knee (4, 5) and also to monitor bone metastasis in breast (6), gastric (7), and prostate (8) cancers.
