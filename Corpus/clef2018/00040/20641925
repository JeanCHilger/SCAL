 In a variety of solid tumors, hypoxia has been found to lead to tumor progression and to resistance of tumors to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (1-3). Tumor oxygenation is heterogeneously distributed within human tumors (4). Hypoxia in malignant tumors is thought to be a major factor limiting the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It would be beneficial to assess tumor oxygenation before and after therapy to provide an evaluation of tumor response to treatment as well as insight into new therapeutic treatments (5). The current gold standard for the measurement of tumor oxygenation is the invasive use of computerized, polarographic, oxygen-sensitive electrodes (6). Functional, non-invasive imaging of intra-tumoral hypoxia has been demonstrated to be a reliable feasible measurement of tumor oxygenation (7). This has led to the search and development of non-invasive, hypoxia-targeted markers of tumor hypoxia. Hypoxic regions of malignant solid tumors have lower extracellular pH than the pH in normal tissues because of the abnormal metabolism within the tumor environment (8). PAP-1, a polypeptide (ELLLELELLELELLLE), has been found to transform from a hydrophilic form into a lipophilic form in acidic pH conditions in the milieu surrounding the tumor cells with a transition pH (pT) of 6.4, which allows PAP-1 to bind to the plasma membrane of tumor cells (9).
