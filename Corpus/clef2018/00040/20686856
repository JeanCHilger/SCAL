Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and nuclear imaging studies of 111In-labeled rGel/BLyS fusion toxin in SCID mice bearing B cell lymphoma. We examined the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of (111)In-labeled rGel/BLyS, a gelonin toxin (rGel)-B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) fusion protein.rGel/BLyS was labeled with In-111 through DTPA with a labeling efficiency >95%. Biodistribution/imaging studies were obtained in severe-combined immunodeficiency mice bearing diffuse large B cell lymphoma OCI-Ly10. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed in BALB/c mice.In vitro, DTPA-conjugated rGel/BLyS displayed selective cytotoxicity against OCI-Ly10 cells and mantle cell lymphoma JeKo cells. In vivo, rGel/BLyS exhibited a tri-exponential disposition with a rapid initial mean distribution followed by an extensive mean distribution and a long terminal elimination phase. At 48 h after injection, uptake of the radiotracer in tumors was 1.25â€‰%ID/g, with a tumor-to-blood ratio of 13. Tumors were clearly visualized at 24-72 h post-injection. Micro-SPECT-CT images and ex vivo analyses confirmed the accumulation of rGel/BLyS in OCI-Ly10 tumors.(111)In-DTPA-rGel/BLyS are distributed to B cell tumors and induce apoptosis in tumors. Preclinical antitumor studies using rGel/BLyS should use a twice-per-week treatment schedule.
