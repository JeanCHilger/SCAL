A comparison of the brain uptake of N-(cyclopropyl[11C]methyl)norbuprenorphine ([11C]buprenorphine) and N-(cyclopropyl[11C]methyl)nordiprenorphine ([11C]diprenorphine) in baboon using PET. Buprenorphine and diprenorphine were radiolabeled with 11C and their distributions in the baboon brain were studied using positron emission tomography (PET). Specific binding was demonstrated in the striatum (but not in the cerebellum) by pretreating the baboon with (-)naloxone. The absolute striatal uptakes and time courses were similar for these two radioligands but the ratio of radioactivity in the striatum to cerebellum in the baboon was higher for [11C]diprenorphine than for [11C]buprenorphine. Analysis of baboon plasma indicated that both [11C]diprenorphine and [11C]buprenorphine are rapidly metabolized. Analysis of radioactivity in mouse brain indicated that these two radioligands are stable to metabolic transformation. At 30 min after injection, 86-90% of extracted radioactivity was due to unchanged 11C-labeled radioligands. These results suggest that both [11C]diprenorphine and [11C]buprenorphine may be useful radioligands for studying opioid receptors in humans, although [11C]diprenorphine may be a better radioligand than [11C]buprenorphine for this purpose because of its more rapid clearance from the cerebellum.
