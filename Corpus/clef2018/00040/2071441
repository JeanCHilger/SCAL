TMPHPG: a lipophilic derivative of EHPG for iron, gallium-68 and indium-111 hepatobiliary clearance. TMPHPG (N,N'-trimethylenebis[2-(2-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)glycine]) is a derivative of the ligand EHPG (ethylenebis[2-(o-hydroxyphenyl)glycine]) but is more lipophilic and had been synthesized to increase hepatobiliary clearance. 59Fe(III), 68Ga(III) and 111In(III) complexes of this ligand have been investigated as potential imaging agents for MRI, PET and SPECT, respectively. Metal-dependent differences in blood and liver clearance in mature rats have been evaluated.
