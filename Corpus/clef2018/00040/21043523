Azine-based receptor for recognition of Hg2+ ion: crystallographic evidence and imaging application in live cells. A newly synthesized azine-based receptor (L) is found to show remarkable specificity toward the Hg(2+) ion in aqueous media over other metal ions. Coordination of L to Hg(2+) induces a detectable change in color and a turn-on fluorescence response. Restricted C=N isomerization of the azine moieties in the excited state as well as the Photoinduced Electron Transfer (PET) involving the lone pair of electrons of N(1)/N(2) on coordination of L to the Hg(2+) ion account for the turn-on fluorescence response. This reagent could be used for imaging the accumulation of Hg(2+) ions in Epithelial cell line KB 31 cells.
