Dopamine and serotonin transporter availability in chronic heroin users: a [¹²³I]β-CIT SPECT imaging study. Dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) transporter availability in heroin users and healthy controls was measured using [¹²³I]β-CIT and SPECT imaging. Heroin users had statistically similar striatal DA and brainstem and diencephalon 5-HT transporter availability compared with controls. No associations between transporter availability and heroin use characteristics were found.
