A novel program to accurately quantify infarction volume by (99m)Tc MIBI SPECT, and its application for re-analyzing the effect of erythropoietin administration in patients with acute myocardial infarction. This study aimed to apply a software to calculate myocardial infarction (MI) volume by single-photon emission computed tomography.The cardioVol software has been developed to reconstruct 3D figures from sequential short axis images. We re-analyzed the data from the EPO/AMI-I Study. The MI volume at baseline correlated with maximum creatine kinase. The MI volume significantly decreased during the 6-month follow up in the erythropoietin (EPO) group, but not in the control group. The decrements of MI volume in the EPO group were significantly larger than those in the control group.The efficacy of EPO was further confirmed by the software.
