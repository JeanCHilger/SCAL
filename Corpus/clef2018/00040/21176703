Outlines of interdisciplinary addiction research given by the example of medical imaging with PET, SPECT and fMRI regarding effects of psychotropic substances. The addiction phenomenon provides a fertile ground for the application of the tools of medical imaging which contribute to the development of scientific conceptualization of the effect of psychotropic substances. Medical imaging as for instance PET (Positron Emission Tomography), SPECT (Single Photon Emission Tomography) or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) are well established for the examination of functional activity in the living brain. Medical imaging permits the development of functional activation maps during perceptual, cognitive or emotional efforts with a high temporal and spatial resolution. Medical imaging devices have therefore also been used to help our understanding of many aspects of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of abused drugs. Because Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol and cocaine continue to be the most commonly used illicit drugs, their effects on the brain function are of major interest. The cannabinoid CB(1) receptor agonist Delta(9)-THC as for instance has also been suggested for treatment of Tourette syndrome (TS). This article provides an overview of present applications of medical imaging with PET, SPECT, and fMRI and its results regarding addiction-related research on Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol and cocaine.
