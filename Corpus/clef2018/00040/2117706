The metabolic anatomy of Parkinson's disease: complementary [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose and [18F]fluorodopa positron emission tomographic studies. We studied the metabolic anatomy of typical Parkinson's disease (PD) using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and [18F]fluorodopa (FDOPA) and positron emission tomography (PET). Fourteen PD patients (mean age 49 years) had FDG/PET scans, of which 11 were scanned with both FDOPA and FDG. After the injection of FDOPA, brain uptake and arterial plasma radioactivity were monitored for 2 h. Striatal FDOPA uptake was analyzed with regard to a two-compartment model, and target-to-background ratios (TBRs) and TBR-versus-time slopes were also calculated. Regional patterns of metabolic covariation were extracted from FDG/PET data using the Scaled Subprofile Model (SSM). SSM pattern weights, FDOPA uptake constants (Ki), TBRs, and TBR slopes were correlated with clinical measures for bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, gait disturbance, left-right asymmetry, dementia, and overall disease severity. In PD patients, rate constants for FDOPA uptake correlated with individual measures of bradykinesia (p = 0.001) and gait disability (p less than 0.05). SSM analysis revealed a distinct pattern of regional metabolic asymmetries, which correlated with motor asymmetries (p less than 0.001) and left-right differences in Ki (p less than 0.01). Our data suggest that in PD patients, FDG/PET and FDOPA/PET may provide unique and complementary information about underlying disease processes.
