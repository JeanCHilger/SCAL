Development of a new head and neck location frame for PET and CT cross-modality medical image fusion in radiotherapy. A new head and neck location frame for positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) cross-modality medical image fusion in radiotherapy was developed. The solid mark bars of N form in the old designed CT location frame were replaced by closed hollow pipes which could be filled with different developer solutions before CT or PET scan, respectively. Nine points of external marker used for registration and fusion were obtained in CT images and PET images, respectively. The locations of the two sets of nine points showed the method of registration to be effective and accurate in achieving the PET and CT image fusion. This method, based on its characteristics of simple structure and easy-to-use, can be of wide application in clinical setting.
