Newer applications of nuclear cardiology in systolic heart failure: detecting coronary artery disease and guiding device therapy. Radionuclide-based imaging techniques can be applied to the heart failure population to derive clinically useful information. This review discusses the specific role of myocardial perfusion imaging for determining heart failure etiology, and the potential application of radionuclide-based imaging techniques for the optimal selection of patients with heart failure for device therapy.
