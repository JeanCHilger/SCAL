Serotonergic neurotransmission in the living human brain: a positron emission tomography study using [¹¹C]dasb and [¹¹C]WAY100635 in young healthy men. The central serotonergic (5-HT) system is closely involved in regulating various mental functions such as mood and emotion. In this system, the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and the 5-HT(1A) receptor play important roles in the pathophysiology and treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. However, only a few integrated databases have considered the intraindividual relationship between pre- and postsynaptic serotonergic transmission. In the present study, we constructed a database of 5-HTT and 5-HT(1A) receptors using positron emission tomography (PET) with [¹¹C]DASB and [¹¹C]WAY100635, respectively. Seventeen healthy young men participated in this study. After anatomic standardization of original images, BP(ND) was calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis using reference tissue methods. The highest binding to 5-HTT was observed in the dorsal raphe nucleus, striatum, and thalamus moderate binding, in the insula and cingulate cortex
