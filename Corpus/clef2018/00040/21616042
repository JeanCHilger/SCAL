Molecular imaging using positron emission tomography in colorectal cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET) is one of the most important recent advances in cancer imaging. Molecular imaging using PET is now an integral part of multidisciplinary cancer care. In this review, the role of PET in colorectal cancer (CRC) is discussed, including its well established role in the assessment of recurrent disease and emerging applications such as initial staging, monitoring therapy efficacy, and radiotherapy planning. The development of new hybrid devices such as PET-magnetic resonance imaging along with the use of novel molecular probes in targeting specific pathways in oncogenesis will further improve patient management.
