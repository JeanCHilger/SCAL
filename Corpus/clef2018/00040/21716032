Incidental detection of unsuspected pulmonary embolism on oncologic FDG PET/CT imaging. Incidental findings are not infrequent on integrated FDG PET/CT scans by the virtue of obtaining images from skull base to mid thigh. These can be on the FDG PET portion or the CT portion of the study and can be clinically significant. We report a case of FDG PET/CT imaging performed for staging of head and neck cancer that led to the detection of unsuspected pulmonary embolism. Our case reinforces the importance of careful interpretation of incidental findings on FDG PET/CT imaging as they can have a significant effect on patient management.
