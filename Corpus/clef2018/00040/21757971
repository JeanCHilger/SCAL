Branch-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: an update. Branch-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BT-IPMNs) are a subset of non-inflammatory mucinous lesions of the pancreas. Selected BT-IPMNs can be managed conservatively by surveillance because of their lower malignant potential. This review aims to update the reader on advances in our knowledge of BT-IPMNs since the consensus guidelines published in 2006.A Pubmed search for BT-IPMNs was undertaken and relevant papers were reviewed.Due to the relative scarcity of this condition, still little is known about the natural history, the best method of surveillance or the surgical and non-surgical options.A national database of BT-IPMNs would enable a large enough cohort of patients to be followed up and valid conclusions drawn regarding the best method of treatment or surveillance. and IAP.
