Evaluation of the sentinel lymph node combining SPECT/CT with the planar image and its importance for the surgical act. The sentinel node biopsy procedure is based on the hypothesis of the existence of an orderly and predictable pattern of lymphatic drainage to a regional lymph node basin. This results in the consideration of all lymph nodes with direct drainage from the primary tumor as sentinel nodes. The sentinel node is not necessarily the hottest or the most nearby node, although this is often the case. Lymphoscintigraphy has been an essential component for preoperative sentinel node identification. With the new generation of multimodality gamma cameras, SPECT/CT has been incorporated into the sentinel node procedure. The resulting SPECT/CT fused images depict sentinel nodes in an anatomical landscape providing a helpful roadmap for surgeons. Therefore, it is necessary to define the role of SPECT/CT in relation to the classical planar lymphoscintigraphy for the identification of sentinel nodes. To understand the combined use of lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT, the criteria for sentinel node identification on preoperative images must be specified. The authors, based on their experience in this field, present tentative criteria to identify lymph nodes as sentinel nodes both in planar and SPECT/CT images and classify them into different categories. The use of these scintigraphic categories to characterize radioactive lymph nodes is also helpful for surgical decision making.
