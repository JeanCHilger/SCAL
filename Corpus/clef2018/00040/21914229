Combining CT and scintigraphy: SPECT-CT and PET-CT. In recent years tomographic hybrid scanners have been quickly introduced in nuclear medicine: single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-CT and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT.- Both SPECT-CT and PET-CT techniques provide a higher diagnostic accuracy than conventional (non-tomographic, non-hybrid) bone scintigraphy (bone scan).- Differences between 99mTc hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (HDP) SPECT-CT or 99mTc methylene diphosphonate (MDP) SPECT-CT and 18F-fluoride PET-CT bone scanning relate to image quality, technique, availability, quantification possibilities, radiation dosimetry and financial cost.- Indications for these techniques will especially lie in the field of more accurate detection of skeletal metastases than with bone scans, patients with unexplained musculoskeletal pain, the diagnostic stage after conventional X-ray and/or MRI, and quantification of bone metabolism.
