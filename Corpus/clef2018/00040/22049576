 Tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 (TAG-72) is a high molecular weight mucigenous protein that is found mainly in the extracellular matrix of neoplastic tumors (1). This glycoprotein is usually not expressed in normal tissues, but it is overexpressed in the tumors of several cancers, such as those of the colon and rectum (colorectal cancer), stomach, pancreas, ovaries, prostate, lung, breast, etc. Therefore, TAG-72 is considered to have a great deal of theranostic value (useful for the diagnosis and/or therapy of a disease) because it can be used for antigen-directed surgical resection of cancerous tumors with radiolabeled anti-TAG-72 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (1). In addition, the detection or absence of TAG-72 expression in colorectal cancer tumors has been shown to have a prognostic value because individuals who had complete removal of tumors with surgery guided by mouse anti-TAG-72 mAb were shown to have a long-term survival advantage compared to patients who had incomplete removal of the lesions (2). In an effort to develop diagnostic agents that can be used for the rapid detection of tumors that overexpress TAG-72, investigators developed a
