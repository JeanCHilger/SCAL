1,2-Distanna-closo-dodecaborate--a rare example of a 1,2-distannylene ligand in transition metal chemistry. The coordination chemistry of the novel bidentate tin ligand 1,2-distanna-closo-dodecaborate is illustrated for the first time by reactions with molybdenum, platinum and gold metal complexes. Up to three clusters coordinate two metal centers in close proximity. For all these metal complexes the typical Î¼-bridging coordination mode was observed exclusively. Furthermore, two cluster anions react with dichloromethane via substitution of the chloride ions. The carbon functionalized tin cluster [Et(4)N](2)[CH(2)(Sn(2)B(10)H(10))(2)] and the coordination complexes [Et(3)NMe](6)[Mo(2)(CO)(6)(Sn(2)B(10)H(10))(3)], [Et(3)NMe](2)[{HPt(PEt(3))(2)(Sn(2)B(10)H(10))}(2)], [Et(4)N](2)[{HPt(PPh(3))(2)(Sn(2)B(10)H(10))}(2)] and [{(TP)Au}(2)(Sn(2)B(10)H(10))] (TP = PhP(o-Ph(2)PC(6)H(4))(2)) are fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analyses and crystal structure analyses.
