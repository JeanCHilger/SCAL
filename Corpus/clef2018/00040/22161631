Computer assistance to improve therapy planning for head neck oncology. The ongoing development in therapies of head and neck malignomas has led to a further differentiation of treatment options. Complex surgical procedures, a wide variety of multi modal therapy options, changing radiation technologies (IMRT - Intensity-modulated radiation therapy) and numerous "targeted therapies" emphasize the need for a precise treatment plan. Beside this, imaging has seen significant improvements beyond the technical ones, e.â€‰g. with the implementation of PET/CT scanners. This increase in pre-therapeutic data volume, together with a diversification of treatment options calls for a further discussion of the basics of therapeutic decisions. Planning relevant data processing by computer assisted systems can aid in these decisions. This work describes the current status of relevant computer assisted systems undergoing first testing for head and neck cancer therapy planning. Here, the integration of 3-dimensional patient data plays a central role. This planning tool forms the integrated base for a further development in the areas of radiation planning, documentation and study management.
