A randomized study comparing yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) and high-dose BEAM chemotherapy versus BEAM alone as the conditioning regimen before autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with aggressive lymphoma. High-dose chemotherapy combined with autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard therapy for refractory/relapsed aggressive lymphoma. In the era of rituximab-containing frontline regimens, it is becoming more challenging to salvage patients in this setting, and novel approaches are required. This is a randomized study evaluating the safety and efficacy of standard-dose ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) combined with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy (Z-BEAM) and ASCT in refractory/relapsed aggressive lymphoma.Forty-three patients with CD20(+) -aggressive lymphoma were randomized to a treatment arm (Z-BEAM, n = 22) or control arm (BEAM alone, n = 21). Ibritumomab tiuxetan was given at 0.4 mCi/kg on day -14 before ASCT.Patient characteristics, engraftment kinetics, and toxicity profile were similar between the 2 groups. Two-year progression-free survival (PFS) for all patients was 48% (95% confidence interval, 32%-64%): 59% and 37% after Z-BEAM and BEAM alone, respectively (P = .2). Multivariate analysis identified advanced age (hazard ratio [HR], 8.3 P = .001), high-risk disease (relapse within 12 months of diagnosis and/or secondary International Prognostic Index >2Standard-dose ibritumomab tiuxetan combined with BEAM high-dose chemotherapy is safe and possibly more effective than BEAM alone as a conditioning regimen for ASCT in the era of rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimens.
