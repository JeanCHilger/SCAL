Influence of myocardial ischemia on outcomes in patients with systolic versus non-systolic heart failure. Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of adult hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. We evaluated the influence of myocardial ischemia and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on outcomes in patients who were hospitalized with new onset HF.We prospectively recruited 201 consecutive patients hospitalized for a first episode of HF from 17 medical centers across Europe and North America. All patients received gated single-photon emission computed tomographic testing with standardized study interpretations by trained core laboratory investigators. Predefined data from routine care were collected and aggregated. Computerized scoring was performed at the core laboratory and participants with a summed difference score ≥4 were defined as having myocardial ischemia. Participants were categorized as having systolic heart failure (SHF) (LVEF<40%) or nonsystolic heart failure (NS-HF) (LVEF≥40%). A proportional hazards model was used to assess the impact of clinical predictors on the outcomes of mortality, cardiac rehospitalization and a combined outcome within 2 years of study enrollment.180 patients (mean age was 65.5 ± 14.6 years and 57.2% male) fulfilled study criteria and were included. Myocardial ischemia was present in 45 (41.2%) patients with SHF and 19 (27.5%) patients with NS-HF (p <0.01). During the follow-up period, 11.1% (n=20) died and 42.2% (n=76) experienced a recurrent hospitalization. Patients with NS-HF and ischemia had the highest (73.7%) event rate compared with the other cohorts (multivariate OR=3.29, 95% CI 1.69-6.42, p=0.001).In new-onset HF, those with NS-HF and myocardial ischemia are at the highest risk for poor outcomes.
