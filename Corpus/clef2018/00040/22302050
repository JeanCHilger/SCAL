Experimental model of naturally occurring post-radiation sarcoma: interest of positron emission tomography (PET) for early detection. Radiotherapy is an integral part of overall cancer therapy. One of the most serious adverse effects of irradiation concern, for long-term survivors, the development of post-radiation sarcoma (PRS) in healthy tissues located within the irradiated area. PRS have bad prognosis and are often detected at a late stage. Therefore, it is obvious that the early detection PRS is a key-point and the development of preclinical models is worthy to evaluate innovative diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The aim of this study was to develop a spontaneous rodent model of PRS and to evaluate the potency of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for early detection. Fifteen Wistars rats were irradiated unilateraly on the hindlimb with a single dose of 30 Gy. Sequential analysis was based on observational staging recordings, Computerized Tomography (CT) scanning and PET. Tumors were removed and, histopathological and immunochemistry analyses were performed. Among the irradiated rats, 12 sarcomas (80%) were detected. All tumors occurred naturallty within the irradiated hindlimb and were highly aggressive since most tumors (75%) were successfully transplanted and maintained by serial transplantation into nude mice. Upon serial staging recordings, using PET, was found to enable the detection of PRS earlier after irradiation than with the other methods (i.e. 11.9 ± 1.8 vs 12.9 ± 2.6 months). These results confirmed the interest of experimental models of PRS for the preclinical evaluation of innovative diagnostic strategies and confirmed the potency of PET for early detection of PRS. This preclinical model of PRS can also be proposed for the evaluation of therapeutic strategies.
