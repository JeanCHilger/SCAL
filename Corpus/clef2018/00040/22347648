Increased B-type natriuretic Peptide concentration is associated with reduced coronary vasoreactivity in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy but not in healthy young subjects. Background/Aims. Natriuretic peptides are associated with the cardiovascular disease risk under a range of different circumstances. However, less is known about whether this association is found also in young healthy subjects. Methods. 9 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 26 healthy young subjects were studied. The myocardial blood flow measurements were performed basally and during adenosine infusion using PET. Results. S-proBNP concentrations were significantly higher (2153 ± 1964 versus 28 ± 17 ng/L, P = .000002) and adenosine-stimulated flow lower (1.6 ± 0.8 versus 3.6 ± 1.1 mL·g(-1)·min(-1), P = .00001) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy when compared to healthy subjects. S-proBNP concentration was inversely associated with adenosine stimulated flow in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (r = -0.75, P = .019) but not in healthy subjects (r = -0.06, P = .84). Conclusions. Natriuretic peptides are inversely associated with coronary vasoreactivity in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy but not in healthy young subjects. Since reduced coronary vasoreactivity seems to be one of the earliest abnormalities in the development of coronary artery disease, this might indicate that natriuretic peptides are not predictor of cardiovascular disease risk in healthy young subjects.
