A contribution to classification of hallucinations. Proceeding from the hypothesis that auditory hallucinations in psychotic patients have another biological basis than hallucinations provoked by hypnotic suggestion in healthy persons, we performed a symptom-comparative study by means of 99mTc-HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography. The results confirm the importance of pathogenesis in symptom-oriented psychiatric research.
