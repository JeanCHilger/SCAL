Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: investigation of intratumoral heterogeneity with FDG PET/CT. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the role of intratumoral heterogeneity of (18)F-FDG uptake in characterizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).Forty consecutively registered patients with newly diagnosed NPC underwent PET/CT. The heterogeneity factor, defined as the derivative of a volume threshold function, was computed for each tumor. The relations between heterogeneity factor and maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)), tumor volume, and TNM category were determined by two-tailed Spearman correlation. Factors that potentially affect outcome determined by disease-free survival were studied by Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test for univariate analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model for multivariate analysis.The heterogeneity factor ranged from -1.80 to -0.13 (mean, -0.40 [SD, 0.40]) and significantly correlated with SUV(max) (r = -0.372 p = 0.018), tumor volume (r = -0.983The intratumoral heterogeneity of FDG uptake varies across NPC tumors, significantly correlates with tumor aggressiveness, and is predictive of patient outcome. These findings may be useful for characterizing NPC, predicting survival, and improving patient care.
