Evaluation of polyethylene terephthalate cyclic trimer migration from microwave food packaging using temperature-time profiles. The polymer polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is widely used for packaging food that will be heated or cooked in the PET container. A procedure was developed to predict the potential of PET to migrate from the container into the food. Migration experiments using crystallized polyethylene terephthalate (CPET) and corn oil were performed at 115, 146 and 176 degrees C. From these experiments diffusion coefficients were calculated for the cyclic trimer in PET. By using an Arrhenius plot to obtain the diffusion coefficient and a temperature versus time plot of a microwave susceptor-heated CPET tray, it was possible to predict migration of the cyclic trimer into corn oil under microwave conditions. Predicted values were in good agreement with measured results.
