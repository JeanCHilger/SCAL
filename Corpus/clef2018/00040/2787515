Increased frontal and reduced parietal glucose metabolism in acute untreated schizophrenia. Frontal and parietal lobe metabolism was measured by [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in 8 never-medicated DSM-III schizophrenic patients and in 10 control subjects. Patients were in a psychotic episode at the time of this scan. Seven of eight had been ill less than 2 years and had only mild neurocognitive impairment. Frontal lobe glucose metabolism was significantly greater in schizophrenic patients than in controls. This finding differs from that of hypofrontality reported in chronic patients previously treated with neuroleptics. Relative glucose metabolism in the interior parietal lobe was significantly lower in schizophrenic patients than in controls. The frontal/parietal ratios were significantly greater in patients than in controls.
