Single photon emission computed tomography and transmission computed tomography in the evaluation of liver disease. To assess the relative strengths of hepatic SPECT and transmission computed tomography (TCT), a comparison of these methods was made in 88 patients during a 20-month period. The scans were classified into four categories: normal, solitary focal, multifocal, or diffuse hepatocellular patterns. The final disease category was determined by histologic evaluation-biopsy/autopsy, surgery, or a combination of ultrasound, laboratory, and clinical follow-up for a minimum of 6 months. Both SPECT and TCT were normal in the 47 patients classified as normal. Of the 16 patients with diffuse hepatocellular disease, SPECT correctly identified 16 and TCT identified two patients. Eleven patients had solitary focal disease 11 were detected by SPECT and 10 by TCT. Fourteen patients were in the multifocal disease group
