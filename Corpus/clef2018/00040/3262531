DC-potential shifts and regional cerebral blood flow reveal frontal cortex involvement in human visuomotor learning. In the present study, two different physiological parameters were measured to describe brain activity related to visuomotor learning: performance-related DC-potential shifts and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography). Visuomotor learning was required in a conflicting situation: a visual target moved on a screen and had to be tracked by moving the right hand in an inverted fashion (IT), e.g. movements of the target to the right side required hand movement to the left and vice versa. Compared to a normal, non-inverted control task (T), IT required the development of a novel motor program and the prevention of returning to routine direct pursuit. These additional demands in IT caused a relative hyperperfusion in regions including the middle frontal gyri, frontomedial cortex (including the supplementary motor area, SMA), right basal ganglia (caudate-putamen) and left cerebellum. Correlations of rCBF values between the middle frontal gyrus and basal ganglia may indicate a functional relation between these two brain structures. Visuomotor performance was accompanied by slow negative DC-potential shifts. In frontal and to a lesser degree in central recordings, amplitudes of DC-negativity were larger in IT than they were in T. This additional frontal negativity covaried with the success of learning. Results substantiate, now using a dual approach, previous suggestions that the frontal lobe plays an important role in visuomotor learning.
