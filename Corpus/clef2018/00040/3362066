Fluorine-19 NMR imaging of glucose metabolism. Metabolic imaging reflecting glucose metabolism in the glycolytic and aldose reductase sorbitol (ARS) pathways was performed noninvasively in rat using fluorinated glucose analogs, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-FDG) or 3-fluoro-3-deoxy-D-glucose (3-FDG), and fluorine-19 (19F) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging. 19F images of 2-FDG-6-phosphate, a main metabolite of 2-FDG in the glycolytic pathway, showed high glucose utilization in the brain, spinal cord, and heart. Images of 3-fluoro-3-deoxy-D-sorbitol (3-FDSL), a main metabolite of 3-FDG in the ARS pathway, demonstrated the heterogeneous nature of the spatial distribution of aldose reductase activities, being highest in the brain and lens. The extremely low toxicity of 3-FDG indicates promise for clinical application of 3-FDG NMR imaging.
