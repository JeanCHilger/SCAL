Simplified enzymatic synthesis and biodistribution of 11C-S-adenosyl-L-methionine. 11C-S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (11C-SAM) was synthesized enzymatically from 11C-L-methionine using rat-liver extract [40%-50% saturated (NH4)2SO4 fraction] as the enzyme source. In biodistribution studies in rats, the highest uptake of 11C-SAM was found in the kidneys. 11C-SAM was also accumulated in the small intestine, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver, and spleen. The uptake of 11C-SAM in the brain increased with time, but remained low. At 30 min after injection, about 50%-60% of the 11C radioactivity was present in the acid-insoluble fraction of the kidneys and liver. When a high loading dose of 11C-SAM was administered, the kidney uptake was enhanced, but the proportion of the radioactivity present in the acid-insoluble fraction was lower. In a study of one rabbit, the kidney uptake was of 11-SAM clearly visualized using positron-emission tomography.
