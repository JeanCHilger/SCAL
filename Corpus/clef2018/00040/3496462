Metabolic and ultrastructural abnormalities during ischemia in canine myocardium: noninvasive assessment by positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography allows the noninvasive assessment of regional myocardial blood flow and metabolism. The purpose of this study was to correlate N-13 ammonia uptake as a measure of regional blood flow and C-11 palmitate kinetics as a marker for fatty acid metabolism in ischemic canine myocardium using positron emission tomography. Furthermore, the metabolic results were compared with ultrastructural findings obtained in the same animal model. Regional ischemia was induced by balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending artery in a closed chest dog model. The three myocardial sites studied were the center and "border" of the ischemic segment as well as the control myocardium. C-11 palmitate uptake closely correlated with blood flow (r = 0.88). In the center of ischemia uptake of C-11 palmitate was decreased and clearance of C-11 activity significantly prolonged. In the "border" of the ischemic segment with only mild reduction of flow and C-11 palmitate uptake (approximately 20%) clearance halftime and residual activity were significantly different from control. The residual activity normalized for initial uptake of C-11 palmitate was highest in the "border" regions consistent with increased deposition of C-11 palmitate in lipid pools. The electron microscopic studies showed in 8 of 11 dogs lipid droplets as the only abnormality in corresponding segments with only mild reduction in microsphere blood flow. Thus, these data indicate the potential of metabolic imaging to characterize ischemia on a cellular level. Positron emission tomography provides a sensitive means to detect mild ischemia and to define extent and severity. Metabolic imaging may prove clinically useful to identify not only necrosis, but also myocardium at risk.
