Constrained deconvolution of SPECT liver tomograms by direct digital image restoration. Several techniques for performing digital image restoration are reviewed and the problems associated with evaluating image processing are discussed. An application of constrained deconvulution to images of the liver produced by single-photon emission computed tomography is presented. Specific evaluation criteria are suggested and based on these, the choice of conditions best suited for processing liver images is proposed. Typically cold tumor contrast can be improved by a factor of greater than 2 whilst image mottle increases negligibly.
