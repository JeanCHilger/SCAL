Reactivation of latent feline leukaemia virus infection. In most cats exposed to the contagious feline leukemia virus (FeLV), viral replication is contained in target haematopoietic tissues and elicits humoral immunity to FeLV and to the feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA). Recently, we and others have considered that these ostensibly self-limiting infections might be persistent nonproductive (latent) infections in certain haematopoietic cells. This hypothesis could account for the relapsing viraemias, protracted incubation periods, persistently high titres of antiviral and anti-FOCMA antibodies, appearance of FeLV p27 antigen in serum of otherwise non-viraemic animals and occurrence of FeLV-negative but FOCMA-positive leukaemias in naturally infected pet cats. Here we describe the reactivation of latent FeLV from myelomonocytic and lymphoid cells of cats immune to FeLV, cats bearing FeLV-negative tumours, and kittens congenitally exposed to FeLV. Furthermore, the reappearance of FeLV infection is suppressed by the Host's immune system but his can be altered by adrenal corticosteroid hormones in vivo and in vitro.
