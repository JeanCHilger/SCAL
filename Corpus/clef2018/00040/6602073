Regional cerebral glucose metabolism of newborn infants measured by positron emission tomography. The new diagnostic technique, positron emission tomography with 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG), was used to measure regional cerebral glucose metabolism in five newborn infants with demonstrated structural abnormalities of the brain. 18FDG was synthesized, diluted in normal saline and injected intravenously. After one hour, tomographic slices of the brain were obtained, the level of the slices being defined relative to the cerebral ventricles. Glucose metabolism of grey- and white-matter structures in the brain could be differentiated clearly. Decreased glucose metabolism was identified in regions of the brain shown by computerized axial tomography to be structurally abnormal. Positron emission tomography is a promising new diagnostic tool for the study of newborn infants with suspected abnormalities of brain function.
