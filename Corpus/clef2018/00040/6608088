Epilepsy in childhood. The pediatrician has a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of children with epilepsy. Accurate classification of the seizure type according to the international terminology is an important step toward the selection of the most effective antiepileptic medication. Technologic advances such as CT scan, video-EEG monitoring, prolonged ambulatory EEG monitoring, and eventual clinical application of positron emission tomography have enhanced the diagnostic capabilities of both the pediatrician and neurologic specialist. Blood level monitoring of antiepileptic medication and use of basic pharmacokinetic principles have added a measure of scientific validity to the art of administration of antiepileptic medication, resulting in more effective seizure control and lessened toxicity of these drugs. The monotherapy approach to treatment has also enhanced the management of seizure disorders.
