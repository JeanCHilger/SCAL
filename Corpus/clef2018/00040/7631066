Visualization of dopamine nerve terminals in monkey by positron emission tomography using 4-[18F]fluoro-L-m-tyrosine. 4-[18F]Fluoro-L-m-tyrosine (FMT) is an L-Dopa analog that essentially follows the L-Dopa metabolic pathway, but without 3-O-methylation or extensive peripheral metabolism. As such, FMT may serve as a useful probe of striatal dopaminergic function with positron emission tomography (PET). FMT was synthesized, as previously described by Perlmutter et al. [Appl Radiat Isot 199041:801-807]. Scanning was undertaken with the SHR2000 positron tomograph (image spatial resolution, 3.5 x 4.5 x 6.5 mm). Two Macaca monkeys were anesthetized with ketamine (10 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (20 mg/kg). FMT was administered intravenously (5-6 mCi
