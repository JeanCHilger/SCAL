Rapid incorporation of carbon-11-labeled diacylglycerol as a probe of signal transduction in glioma. We have synthesized and characterized a positron-emitting carbon-11-labeled 1,2-diacylglycerol to study phosphoinositide turnover in tumor cells. Rapid incorporation of the 1,2-diacylglycerol was observed in the C6 glioma cell line. The incorporated lipid fraction consisted chiefly of phosphoinositide pool and another phospholipid pool in the proliferative state. When the state was inhibited by (-)-3D-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-myo-inositol, incorporation into the phosphoinositide pool decreased selectively. This suggested that phosphoinositide turnover is the leading regulator of tumor proliferation potential. On the basis of the concept of carbon-11-labeled 1,2-diacylglycerol as a specific probe for visualizing the tumor signal transduction in vivo, we obtained proliferating images of implanted C6 glioma cells in the rat brain by autoradiography and visualized the proliferation signal in human glioma by positron emission tomography.
