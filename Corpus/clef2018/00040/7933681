Quantitative analysis of 123I-BMIPP imaging in relation to exercise-redistribution 201Tl in patients with old myocardial infarction. Myocardial kinetics of 123I-labeled 15-(p-iodophenyl)3R,S-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) was evaluated with BMIPP imaging in conjunction with stress-201Tl. We studied 20 patients with old myocardial infarction. BMIPP SPECT was obtained at 20 min and 3 h after injection. On a separate day, exercise stress-201Tl SPECT was performed at 10 min and 3 h after injection. Then, left ventricular myocardium was divided into 20 segments. For quantitative analysis, in each SPECT data, the maximum value (average counts per pixel) of all 20 myocardial segments was taken as 100% the other values were calculated as a percentage of this maximum (Relative regional uptake, RRU). On the basis of stress-201Tl pattern, the myocardial segments were classified into 4 groups
