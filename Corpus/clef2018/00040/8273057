Are the results of thallium scintigraphy and coronary angiography equivalent? An evaluation of thallium scintigraphies performed at Vestfold Central Hospital. The value of exercise-redistribution thallium-201 perfusion scintigraphy (SPECT single photon emission computed tomography) in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease was evaluated in 23 patients (one patient tested twice) who were subsequently submitted to coronary angiography. Reversible perfusion defects indicating myocardial ischemia were found in 22 patients, of whom 18 had angiographically significant coronary artery stenoses. Two patients had negative thallium scans, one had a normal angiogram and one had single vessel disease. Thus 18 of 19 patients with angiographically verified coronary heart disease had a positive thallium scan. The majority of patients with left main stenosis and triple vessel disease had scintigraphic evidence of double or triple vessel disease. The scintigraphic method identified the correct anatomical localization in 73% of the angiographically verified coronary artery stenoses. In conclusion, a positive exercise-redistribution thallium scan had a high predictive value in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, whereas its value in estimating the number and localization of stenoses was more limited.
