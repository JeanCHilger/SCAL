Evaluation of the peritoneal equilibration test in children on chronic peritoneal dialysis. The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) is routinely performed in adults treated with chronic peritoneal dialysis to assess the peritoneal transport rate and to optimize treatment prescription. Only a few and not well-standardized studies on the PET have been reported in children. Twenty-six PET's were performed in 16 children, mean age 10.9 +/- 4.9 years, mean body weight (BW) 26.8 +/- 11.9 kg, treated with nightly intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD). The PET was performed according to Twardowski. Forty mL/kg BW of 2.27% glucose solution were infused at a rate of 10 mL/kg BW every 2 minutes. In the simplified test, dialysate samples were taken at dwell times 0, 2 and 4 hours for glucose and creatinine. A blood sample was taken after a 2-hour dwell time for the same parameters. The standard PET (8 patients) consisted of dialysate samples at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes and blood samples at 0 and 240 minutes. Mean D/P ratio for corrected creatinine and D/D0 ratio for glucose at 2 hours were 51.6 +/- 11.6 and 50.4 +/- 9, respectively at 4 hours 69.6 +/- 12 and 34.4 +/- 9.8, respectively. There was good correlation between D/P creatinine and D/D0 glucose at 4 hours (p < 0.0001). Patients were classified as high (3 cases), high-average (5), low-average (6), and low (2) transporters. A statistically significant difference was found between the curves obtained by the simplified PET and those of the standard PET in the first hour (r = 0.66
