Wheeze in preschool children: who is followed-up, who is treated and who is hospitalized? This study determined the proportions of children < or = 5 yrs of age with reported wheeze who were undergoing medical follow-up, receiving anti-asthma medication, or admitted to hospital and investigated factors important in determining which children would receive these treatments. The symptomatic children represented a wheeze prevalence of 16% of the study sample of 1,422 children. The cumulative incidence of treatment and hospitalization and point prevalence of current medical follow-up were determined using a parent-answered postal questionnaire study of a population-based random sample of 222 children. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for wheeze severity, environmental, social, familial and demographic factors found to affect the likelihood of these treatment end-points. Among 222 children with wheeze, 99 (35%) were under current medical review, 165 (75%) had received medication, and 48 (22%) reported being hospitalized. Current follow-up was more likely in girls (OR 2.22
