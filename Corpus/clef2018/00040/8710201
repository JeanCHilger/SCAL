Neuromodulation of frontal and temporal cortex by intravenous d-fenfluramine: an [15O]H2O PET study in humans. This study assessed the modulatory effect of a serotonergic agonist, d-fenfluramine, on localized neuronal firing as indexed by changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Previously, we reported the effect of oral d, l-fenfluramine on neuronal activity as measured by change in [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake. Improvements in the current study include: a more specific serotonin agonist, d-fenfluramine a more reliable administration route, intravenous
