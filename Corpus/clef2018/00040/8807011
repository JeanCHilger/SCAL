Silicate and metal dust in lungs of Greyhounds. To determine whether the amount of opaque dust in lung specimens increases with age, the composition of that dust, and whether the composition is similar for Greyhounds and pet dogs.Quantification of lung particulate dust burdens.192 Greyhounds and 5 pet dogs.Lung specimens of 192 Greyhounds and 5 pet dogs were examined for dust accumulation, using light microscopy. Lung specimens from Greyhounds and the 5 pet dogs were analyzed, using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy to quantify the lung burden of inorganic particles.Lung dust burden increased linearly with age. Pulmonary dust was composed of aluminum silicates, silica, and 18 metals. Silicate and metal particulate burdens were higher in Greyhounds than in the pet dogs. The 3 most common metals were iron, titanium, and chromium.Amount of opaque dust increased with age. The higher pulmonary dust burden in Greyhounds than in pet dogs suggests that environmental exposure is important.
