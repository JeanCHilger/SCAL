Fatty acid metabolic disorder detected by 123I-BMIPP SPECT shortly after elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Decreased or unchanged BMIPP uptake is often observed in the repeated SPECT imaging soon after successful angioplasty, although coronary flow remarkably recovers. To evaluate clinical significance of this phenomenon, 23 patients underwent BMIPP SPECT before elective PTCA (BM-1), soon after PTCA (72 hours, BM-2), and 3 months later (BM-3). SPECT imagings were divided into 7 segments and were semiquantitatively evaluated by 2 cardiologists in the blinded fashion. Decreased uptake at BM-2 compared with BM-1 was evaluated by comparing with stress Thallium-201 SPECT performed in the same schedule but on the different date (TI-1, 2, 3), ischemic manifestation at PTCA, and wall motion change of LVG. Patients with restenosis were excluded from this study.BM-2 showed decreased uptake in 14 (61%), unchanged in 2 (9%), and increased in 7 (30%) patients, while stress TI showed increased perfusion in all patients. Among 91 myocardial segments correspondent to PTCA vessels, 30 (33%) showed overt uptake reduction, and only 13 (14%) segments showed increased uptake. BM-2 uptake reduction was significantly associated with the absence of collateral artery (odds ratio, OR = 3.1, p <0.01), multi vessel disease (OR = 2.0, p = 0.01), total balloon inflating time (p <0.05), ST elevation on ECG (OR = 3.6, p = 0.01), chest pain during PTCA (OR = 3.1, p <0.1), while pre-dilatation by using small size balloon catheter prevented BM-2 uptake reduction (OR = 6.0, p = 0.01). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that chest pain, balloon inflating time and pre-dilatation were independently associated with BM-2 uptake reduction. Three months after PTCA. the segments with BM-2 reduction had stress TI uptake similar to the segments without BM-2 reduction, however, they showed poorer recovery of BM-3 uptake and LV wall motion.BMIPP uptake reduction shortly after angioplasty was associated with ischemic manifestation and poor LV motion recovery, thus, it may be a sensitive representation of the stunned myocardium.
