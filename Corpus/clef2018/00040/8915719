Simultaneous dobutamine stress echocardiography and dobutamine scintigraphy (99mTc-MIBI-SPET) for assessment of coronary artery disease. Simultaneous dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and 99Tc-MIBI-SPET (DMS) for the evaluation of the presence and the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) were assessed for a head to head comparison regarding the diagnostic acuracy of the two rests.Forty-five consecutive patients (33 males and 12 females: 53 +/- 6.8 yr.) underwent exercise electrocardiography and simultaneous dobutamine stress echocardiography and MIBI-SPET imaging. Coronary angiography was performed in all patients (significant coronary stenosis > 50%). On the basis of the results of exercise electrocardiogram the pre-test probability for coronary artery disease (Diamond's algorithm) was low (45.6 +/- 12.7%). The overall specificity, sensitivity and predictive accuracy of Echo-dobutamine stress test for diagnosis of the presence or absence of CAD were: specificity 82%, sensitivity 76%, diagnostic accuracy 80%, positive predictive value 90%, negative predictive value 40%. The overall specificity, sensitivity and predictive accuracy of MIBI-SPET-dobutamine test for diagnosis of the presence or absence of CAD were: specificity 86%, sensitivity 87%, diagnostic accuracy 84%, positive predictive value 97%, negative predictive value 54%. MIBI-SPET-dobutamine test showed a significantly higher sensitivity in comparison with ECHO-dobutamine test (P < 0.05).Both noninvasive methods for the detection of CAD showed a good diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless the SPET model showed a higher sensitivity in comparison with DSE model, essentially in the presence of a lower extent of CAD and during submaximal test.
