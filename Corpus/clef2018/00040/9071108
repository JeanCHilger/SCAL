The effect of sevoflurane on regional cerebral metabolism and cerebral blood flow in rhesus monkeys. The effects of sevoflurane on cerebral metabolism and hemodynamics were studied in rhesus monkeys. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMR O2) as well as their regional changes were measured by means of positron emission tomography technique. After the measurement of regional CBFs and CMR O2s at 1.5% sevoflurane as control, the measurement was repeated at 3.0% sevoflurane and at the same sevoflurane concentration with the infusion of angiotensin II to restore mean arterial pressure. Regional CBFs and CMR O2s were compared among three different conditions. At 3.0% sevoflurane, regional CBFs increased significantly in response to the increase in the mean arterial pressure, suggesting the inhibition of autoregulation of CBF. However, regional CBF/CMR O2 ratio was not significantly different among the cerebral regions with each condition. It could be concluded that CBF during sevoflurane anesthesia up to 3.0% might become dependent on the cerebral perfusion pressure and the changes in regional CBFs varied among the regions. On the other hand, the ratio of oxygen consumption and delivery was well maintained throughout the brain regions.
