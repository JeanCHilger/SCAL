Contributions of pulmonary perfusion and ventilation to heterogeneity in V(A)/Q measured by PET. To estimate the contributions of the heterogeneity in regional perfusion (Q) and alveolar ventilation (V A) to that of ventilation-perfusion ratio (V A/Q), we have refined positron emission tomography (PET) techniques to image local distributions of Q and V A per unit of gas volume content (sQ and sV A, respectively) and V A/Q in dogs. sV A was assessed in two ways: 1) the washout of 13NN tracer after equilibration by rebreathing (sV A(i)), and 2) the ratio of an apneic image after a bolus intravenous infusion of 13NN-saline solution to an image collected during a steady-state intravenous infusion of the same solution (sV A(p)). SV A(p) was systematically higher than sV A(i) in all animals, and there was a high spatial correlation between sQ and sV A(p) in both body positions (mean correlation was 0.69 prone and 0.81 supine) suggesting that ventilation to well-perfused units was higher than to those poorly perfused. In the prone position, the spatial distributions of sQ, sV A(p), and V A/Q were fairly uniform with no significant gravitational gradients however, in the supine position, these variables were significantly more heterogeneous, mostly because of significant gravitational gradients (15, 5.5, and -10%/cm, respectively) accounting for 73, 33, and 66% of the corresponding coefficient of variation (CV)2 values. We conclude that, in the prone position, gravitational forces in blood and lung tissues are largely balanced out by dorsoventral differences in lung structure. In the supine position, effects of gravity and structure become additive, resulting in substantial gravitational gradients in sQ and sV A(p), with the higher heterogeneity in V A/Q caused by a gravitational gradient in sQ, only partially compensated by that in sV A.
