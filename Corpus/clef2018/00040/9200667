Metabolic alterations in muscle of thermally injured rabbits, measured by positron emission tomography. The hypermetabolic inflammatory state that occurs after major trauma has been extensively studied at the whole body level, however, there is only limited information on metabolic changes in individual tissues. In this study, the effect of thermal injury on metabolic function of uninjured hind limb muscle of rabbits was measured noninvasively by positron emission tomography (PET). Rabbits were subjected to full thickness burn on 25% of their body surface area. Two to three weeks after injury, PET and arterial blood sampling was performed during inhalation of 15O2, C15O2 and 11CO and after injection of 18FDG. The tissue and blood data were analyzed by standard kinetic models for blood flow, oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), oxygen utilization and glucose metabolism. A total of seven injured and five sham animals were studied. Total body oxygen consumption was measured by indirect calorimetry and plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin and IGF-1 were measured with standard assays. Compared to sham rabbits, blood flow to muscle of injured animals was unchanged. However, OEF, oxygen utilization and glucose metabolism were significantly reduced (p<0.01) in uninjured muscle of burned rabbits. These data demonstrate that thermal injury is associated with alterations in muscle metabolism, which are not related to change in blood flow.
