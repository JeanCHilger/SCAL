The role of positron emission tomography in pharmacokinetic analysis. The physiological and biochemical measurements that can be performed noninvasively in humans with modern imaging techniques offer great promise for defining the precise state of a patient's disease and its response to therapy. In general, there are two critical points in drug development when PET measurements are likely to be particularly useful: (1) In preclinical studies, a new drug can be precisely compared to standard therapies or a series of analogs can be screened for further development on the basis of performance in appropriate animal models. (2) In phase I-II human studies, classic pharmacokinetic measurements can be coupled with imaging measurements (a) to define optimal dosing schedule (b) to define the potential utility of interventions in particular clinical situations
