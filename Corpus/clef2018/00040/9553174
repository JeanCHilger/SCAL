Value of thallium-201 scintigraphy for primary tumour detection in patients with malignant neck masses. The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of thallium-201 scintigraphy to primary tumour detection in patients with malignant neck masses and to evaluate its sensitivity and specificity. A total of 30 patients with histopathologically proven malignant tumours were included in the study. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 201Tl scintigraphy were found to be 54%, 75% and 57% respectively. These results suggest that 201Tl scintigraphy has a limited value in the detection of the primary tumour in patients with malignant masses of the neck.
