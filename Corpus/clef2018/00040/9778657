Brain serotonin synthesis rates in rhesus monkeys determined by [11C]alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan and positron emission tomography compared to CSF 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid concentrations. Twelve male, fasted, anesthetized rhesus monkeys were studied with positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha MTP) to determine serotonin synthesis rates as described by Diksic et al. (1991). It was expected that the serotonin synthesis rates determined for the whole brain would be correlated with CSF 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid concentrations, a measure of central serotonin turnover, because both measures were obtained at steady state. However, no significant correlation was found. During data analysis, it was noticed that the calculated serotonin synthesis rates were significantly correlated to free plasma tryptophan (TP) concentrations (r = 0.88, p < .001). From repeat scans conducted in six monkeys, it was determined that day-to-day variability in free plasma TP and the percentage of protein binding (average percent difference was 48 and 37%, respectively) produced most of the variability in the calculated serotonin synthesis rates (50%) repeat K images, obtained from the PET data alone, differed by only 11%. Calculated serotonin synthesis rates reported for [11C]alpha MTP PET studies of humans (Nishizawa et al. 1997) and dogs (Diksic et al. 1991) were also highly correlated to reported differences in plasma free TP concentrations. It seems that the [11C]alpha MTP model for the computation of serotonin synthesis rates is very dependent on plasma free TP concentration and that it may not accurately determine actual serotonin synthesis rates.
