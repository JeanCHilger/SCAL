201T1C1 accumulation dynamics in glioma with different grades of malignancy: an investigation using dynamic SPECT. Dynamic SPECT was performed using 201TICI in a total of 21 gliomas, 14 cases of glioblastoma multiforme (GM) and 7 cases of anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), to investigate the relationship between test results and malignancy. The accumulation of isotope (counts/pixel) in the tumor was measured every 3 minutes with dynamic SPECT. The initial 3-minute value was reduced from subsequent accumulations (counts/minute) to obtain the time-activity curve (TAC). Thallium index (TL index), the ratio of 15-minute accumulation in the tumor to that in the same region of the contralateral normal brain, was also calculated. TL index was significantly higher (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test) in GM (6.25 +/- 1.97) than in AA (4.10 +/- 1.66), although no clear differential value could be determined between the two. TAC in the GM group showed that compared with the initial 3-minute value, accumulation increased significantly (p < 0.05) at every measurement point after isotope injection: 6 minutes, 0.660 +/- 0.671 9 minutes, 1.322 +/- 1.319
