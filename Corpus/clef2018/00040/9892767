Transmyocardial revascularization with holmium laser. Sixteen patients with angina refractory to medical therapy who were not considered suitable for standard revascularization underwent transmyocardial revascularization with holmium laser. The average age of the patients was 63.2 +/- 10.5 years. All of them had angina class 3 or 4, and 9 (56%) had previously undergone an aortocoronary bypass grafting. Four patients died during the 6-month follow-up period (25%). Among the survivors, anginal class decreased to class 2 or 1 at the 6th month (p = 0.002). Ejection fraction did not change. The ischemic burden by Holter decreased from 85.3 +/- 656 to 5.5 +/- 9.7 min (p = 0.046). Myocardial perfusion with 201Tl single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images at rest and after dipyridamole showed a significant improvement among the ischemic treated segments (p = 0.015). Baseline ejection fraction was somehow lower in nonresponsive than in responsive patients (33 +/- 13 vs. 49 +/- 10, p = 0.052). We conclude that transmyocardial laser revascularization with holmium laser is effective in treatment in ischemic patients not amenable to surgery or percutaneous procedures, as previously reported with CO2 laser. Further investigation is needed to determine which clinical profiles identify the patients for whom this therapy is suitable.
