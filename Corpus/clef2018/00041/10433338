Technetium-99m labeled myocardial perfusion imaging agents. 99mTc labeled myocardial perfusion tracers have significantly advanced the field of noninvasive diagnostic evaluation and risk stratification of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease by providing comprehensive information about myocardial perfusion and function from a single study. Of various currently available invasive and noninvasive test modalities, myocardial perfusion imaging provides the most powerful prognostic information that is incremental to the information obtained from invasive evaluation. Future research should focus on the development of perfusion tracers that linearly track myocardial blood flow over a wide range and have minimal splanchnic uptake. Availability of an effective attenuation and scatter correction program would further eliminate some of the current limitations of this technique.
