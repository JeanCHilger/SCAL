FDG-PET in oncology. Methodological principles and clinical applications. Clinical PET is now primarily used in oncological indications. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) shows a high uptake in a variety of malignancies and accounts for approximately 95% of the oncological PET studies. The first part of this review deals with theoretical and methodological aspects of FDG-PET. Possible sources of errors for the method are discussed briefly. Oncological indications for FDG-PET are highlighted according to the results of consensus meetings of experts from nuclear medicine and oncology, organized by the German Society of Nuclear Medicine. FDG-PET is mainly used in staging and restaging, demonstrating of tumour recurrence and therapy control. Main benefits of the method are functional imaging, better spatial resolution than conventional scintigraphy and the possibility to perform whole-body imaging easily. A brief outlook on future prospects for the application of PET in oncology is given.
