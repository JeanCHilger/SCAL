Kinetic modeling of N-[11C]methylpiperidin-4-yl propionate: alternatives for analysis of an irreversible positron emission tomography trace for measurement of acetylcholinesterase activity in human brain. N-[11C]Methylpiperidin-4-yl propionate ([11C]PMP) is a substrate for hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase (AChE). This work evaluates kinetic analysis alternatives for estimation of relative AChE activity using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies of [11C]PMP. The PET studies were performed on three groups of subjects: (1) 12 normal volunteer subjects, aged 20 to 45 years, who received a single intravenous injection of 16 to 32 mCi of [11C]PMP (2) six subjects, aged 21 to 44 years, who received two 16-mCi injections of [11C]PMP (baseline and visual stimulation, respectively)
