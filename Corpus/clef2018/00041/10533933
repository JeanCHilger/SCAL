Implementation and quantitative evaluation of analytical methods for attenuation correction in SPECT: a phantom study. Three differing exact methods of inverting the two-dimensional (2D) exponential Radon transform were implemented and evaluated quantitatively with a phantom study. The phantom had the shape of a pie-chart divided into six cavities, each 480 ml in volume and 10 cm in height, that were symmetrically positioned in a cylinder that was 20 cm in diameter and 10 cm in height. This phantom tests for linearity between true activity concentration and measured activity concentration, and it is denoted as a linearity phantom in the present study. Each cavity contained a different concentration of a homogeneous solution of 99mTc (74, 148, 222, 296, 370 and 444 kBq ml(-1)). Data acquisition was performed with two energy windows: a 20% photopeak energy window set symmetrically over the 140 keV of 99mTc and a secondary 5% energy window set over the 122 keV peak. We optimized a triple-energy window scatter correction method for a gamma camera-collimator system to obtain accurate scatter-corrected projections. A circular ROI 3 cm in diameter was identified over each cavity region, and count density (counts per pixel) was calculated. This value was converted to activity concentration (kBq ml(-1)) using a cross-calibration coefficient between SPECT counts and the gamma well counter. The relation between true activity (x) and measured activity concentration (y) was fitted to a line using the least-squares method. Regression lines were y = 0.63 + 1.0255x (R2 = 0.9987), y = -2.62 + 1.0278x (R2 = 0.9995), and y = 0.092 + 1.0241x (R2 = 0.9989) for the Bellini, Inouye and Metz-Pan methods respectively. In another phantom study using two different types of phantoms, contrast of a cold region in the two was 96% and 101% for all three methods. Combined optimized scatter correction and analytical attenuation correction methods achieve good accuracy in quantification of activity distribution with a uniform attenuating medium.
