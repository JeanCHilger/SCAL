55Cobalt (Co) as a PET-tracer in stroke, compared with blood flow, oxygen metabolism, blood volume and gadolinium-MRI. Several studies have shown the feasibility of divalent cobalt (Co)-isotopes (55Co and 57Co) in imaging of neuronal damage in stroke, multiple sclerosis, cerebral tumors and traumatic brain injury. Little is known how regional Co uptake relates to other pathophysiological changes after stroke. Therefore, we compared 55Co-PET with functional parameters such as regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using C(15)O(2), regional oxygen metabolism (rCMRO(2)) using 15O(2), regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and post-gadolinium (Gd) T(1)w-MRI to assess the permeability of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Sixteen patients (10 female six male) aged 43 to 84 (mean 69) years with first ever stroke, as shown by CT or MRI, were examined with 55Co-PET and C(15)O(2)-, 15O(2)- and C(15)O-PET in one single session, in a period varying from 0 to 30 days after stroke-onset. Regions of infarction on C(15)O(2)- and 15O(2)-PET (defined by rCMRO(2)<65% or rCBF<45% of the contralateral value) were subsequently superimposed on the 55Co-PET scan. Clinical status was established using the Orgogozo stroke scale, which was assessed both at day 1 and at discharge (at least 6 weeks after day 1). Accumulation of 55Co was seen in eight out of 16 patients, occurring in areas showing a diminished oxygen metabolism, was only partially related to blood flow, and was located mainly outside the extent of the infarction or luxury perfusion as seen on post-Gd T(1)w-MRI. Statistical analysis showed a negative correlation between the Orgogozo score at discharge and the uptake of radioactive cobalt.
