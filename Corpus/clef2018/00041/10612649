MHC-restricted protection of cats against FIV infection by adoptive transfer of immune cells from FIV-vaccinated donors. The role of cellular immunity in vaccine protection against FIV infection was evaluated using adoptive cell transfer studies. Specific-pathogen-free cats received two adoptive transfers of washed blood cells from either vaccinated or unvaccinated donors with varying MHC compatibility at 1-week intervals, and a homologous FIV(Pet) challenge 1 day after the first adoptive transfer. FIV-specific CTL, IFN-gamma production, and proliferation responses were detected in the PBMC from the vaccinated donors. Seven of eleven (64%) recipients of cells from half-matched/vaccinated donors remained negative for FIV-antibodies after FIV challenge and four of those were completely protected. Two of two recipients of cells from MHC-identical/vaccinated donors were completely protected. All recipients of cells from unrelated/vaccinated, half-matched/unvaccinated, or unrelated/unvaccinated donors were unprotected. Thus, protection mediated by adoptive transfer of immunocytes from vaccinated cats was MHC-restricted, occurred in the absence of antiviral humoral immunity, and correlated with the transfer of cells with FIV-specific CTL and T-helper activities.
