Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy affects myocardial fatty acid metabolism after acute myocardial infarction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy has an early mortality benefit in unselected patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the effects of ACE inhibition on myocardial fatty acid metabolism in this patient population have not been studied. We tested the hypothesis that ACE inhibitor therapy improves myocardial fatty acid metabolism and decreases mortality rate in patients after AMI.Forty-two patients after first anterior AMI and primary angioplasty were randomly assigned to titrated oral enalapril (n = 24) or placebo therapy (n = 18). Iodine 123-labeled 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) single photon emission computed tomography imaging was performed an average of 4.8 days after AMI and 1 month after AMI. BMIPP abnormalities were quantified as a severity index by a polar map.There were no significant changes in baseline characteristics, cardiac function, and angiographic findings between patients in the enalapril group and patients in the placebo group. However, BMIPP severity index from acute phase to chronic phase was significantly decreased in the enalapril-treated group (118+/-48 to 82+/-36, P<.05), but not in the placebo group (123+/-65 to 115+/-58, P not significant).ACE inhibition therapy improved myocardial fatty acid metabolism and regional left ventricular function in patients after anterior AMI. BMIPP single photon emission computed tomography findings imply that this better outcome may be attributable to an improvement of cellular function with ACE inhibitors.
