Hemodynamic changes around cerebral arteriovenous malformation before and after embolization measured with PET. To estimate the changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) around cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) before and after embolization, 6 patients with AVM were sequentially examined with positron emission tomography (PET). PET depicted the remodeling of rCBF in the ipsilateral hemisphere of AVM after embolization. Decrease of rCBF in the ipsilateral hemisphere was also detected in patients with focal symptoms before embolization, and improvement of clinical symptoms after embolization corresponded to disappearance of rCBF decrease. PET can detect hemodynamic changes after embolization, and has a possibility to estimate the effect of embolization in patients with AVM.
