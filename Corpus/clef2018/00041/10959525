Fear conditioning and brain activity: a positron emission tomography study in humans. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured with H2 (15)O positron emission tomography in 8 healthy women before and after fear conditioning (i.e., paired shocks) and unpaired shocks to videotape cues. Conditioning was supported by enhanced peripheral nervous system recordings and subjective ratings. Fear conditioning increased rCBF in the central gray of the midbrain bilaterally in the hypothalamus, the thalamus, and the left striatum
