Regional cerebral blood flow changes in drug-resistant depressed patients following treatment with transcranial magnetic stimulation: a statistical parametric mapping analysis. Changes of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in five drug-resistant depressed patients were examined by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) before and after treatment with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The SPECT images were analysed with the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) package. TMS administered in the region of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of the depressed patients was associated with an increase of rCBF at a focal region some distance from the stimulation site. No change was observed at any other remote region.
