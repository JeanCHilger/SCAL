PET imaging using gamma cameras. This paper will review the recent advances and future developments in the field of coincidence imaging of positron emitters with a conventional Anger-type gamma camera. FDG imaging has shown high clinical importance in cardiology, neurology and especially oncology. Since access to full ring PET is mainly limited to university hospitals, there have been new developments allowing PET imaging on the standard Anger gamma camera. First the principles of coincidence imaging on a gamma camera will be reviewed. We will discuss the limitations of this technique, and the techniques used to partly overcome these limitations. The different configurations of the gamma camera operating in coincidence mode are pointed out. Different corrections for image degrading effects and reconstruction methods are evaluated in the final part.
