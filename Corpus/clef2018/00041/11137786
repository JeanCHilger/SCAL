Iterative reconstruction algorithms in nuclear medicine. Iterative reconstruction algorithms produce accurate images without streak artifacts as in filtered backprojection. They allow improved incorporation of important corrections for image degrading effects, such as attenuation, scatter and depth-dependent resolution. Only some corrections, which are important for accurate reconstruction in positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography, can be applied to the data before filtered backprojection. The main limitation for introducing iterative algorithms in nuclear medicine has been computation time, which is much longer for iterative techniques than for filtered backprojection. Modern algorithms make use of acceleration techniques to speed up the reconstruction. These acceleration techniques and the development in computer processors have introduced iterative reconstruction in daily nuclear medicine routine. We give an overview of the most important iterative techniques and discuss the different corrections that can be incorporated to improve the image quality.
