Image-correction techniques in SPECT. This overview takes a look at different correction techniques for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). We discuss the influence of the detection system followed by the scatter and attenuation caused by the object of investigation. When possible we describe how the correction methods for the different physical effects can be incorporated in the reconstruction method, being either filtered backprojection or iterative reconstruction.
