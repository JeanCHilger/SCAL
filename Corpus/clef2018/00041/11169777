Assessment of muscarinic receptor concentrations in aging and Alzheimer disease with [11C]NMPB and PET. Cerebral cholinergic deficits have been described in Alzheimer disease (AD) and as a result of normal aging. At the present time, there are very limited options for the quantification of cholinergic receptors with in vivo imaging techniques such as PET. In the present study, we examined the feasibility of utilizing [11C]N-methyl-4-piperidyl benzilate (NMPB), a nonselective muscarinic receptor ligand, in the study of aging and neurodegenerative processes associated with cholinergic dysfunction. Based on prior data describing the accuracy of various kinetic methods, we examined the concentration of muscarinic receptors with [11C]NMPB and PET using two- and three-compartment kinetic models. Eighteen healthy subjects and six patients diagnosed with probable AD were studied. Pixel-by-pixel two-compartment model fits showed acceptable precision in the study of normal aging, with comparable results to those obtained with a more complex and less precise three-compartment model. Normal aging was associated with a reduction in muscarinic receptor binding in neocortical regions and thalamus. In AD patients, the three-compartment model appeared capable of dissociating changes in tracer transport from changes in receptor binding, but suffered from statistical uncertainty, requiring normalization to a reference region, and therefore limiting its potential use in the study of neurodegenerative processes. After normalization, no regional changes in muscarinic receptor concentrations were observed in AD.
