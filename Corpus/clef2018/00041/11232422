DNA vaccines for veterinary medicine. DNA vaccination represents one of the most recent novel approaches to vaccine development. Experimentally, DNA vaccines induce a broad range of long lasting immune responses including humoral and cell-mediated immunity against infectious diseases in humans and animals. Furthermore, DNA vaccines are potentially useful for the treatment of autoimmune diseases or cancer. However, most information on the efficacy of DNA vaccines has been generated in mice and studies in larger animals are limited. In this review, the potential application of DNA vaccines in livestock and pet animals are discussed. The principle of this new technology, its potency and future perspectives for use in veterinary medicine will be outlined.
