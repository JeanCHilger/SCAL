F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography as a presurgical evaluation modality for I-131 scan-negative thyroid carcinoma patients with local recurrence in cervical lymph nodes. F-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has a supplementary role in localizing recurrent sites of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. We evaluated whether FDG-PET is feasible as a presurgical evaluation modality for I-131 scan-negative thyroid carcinoma patients.Preoperative FDG-PET results were compared with the pathologic findings of lymph nodes specimens of 22 papillary thyroid patients. All patients had thyroidectomy and I-131 ablation therapy beforehand and showed negative I-131 scans on follow-up studies.In 85 cervical lymph node groups dissected, 56 lymph node groups revealed metastasis. The sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET for metastasis were 80% (45 of 56) and 83% (24 of 29), respectively. Among the pathologically positive 33 lymph nodes with normal size(< or =1 cm), FDG-PET detected 23 nodes. Serum thyroglobulin levels were elevated in 12 patients (sensitivity, 55%).FDG-PET accurately detected the recurred cervical lymph nodes of differentiated thyroid carcinoma patients who showed negative I-131 scan. FDG-PET is suitable for the presurgical evaluation of these patients.
