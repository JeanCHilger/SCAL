Assessment of regional myocardial wall motion and thickening by gated 99Tcm-tetrofosmin SPECT: a comparison with magnetic resonance imaging. Gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging allows the simultaneous assessment of both perfusion and function by using one single study. The assessment of regional wall motion and thickening pattern with gated SPECT allows viability studies to be performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is well validated for the assessment of myocardial wall motion and thickening in patients with normal and impaired ventricular function. The aim of the study was to analyse the concordance between wall motion and thickening scores derived by gated SPECT and MRI imaging. Furthermore, the agreement for myocardial wall motion and thickening according to myocardial perfusion was analysed with both techniques. We studied a group of 21 patients, including 13 with a previous myocardial infarction (all more than 4 months before the study), using both gated SPECT 99Tcm-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion imaging and MRI. A 13-segment model was used for both gated SPECT and MRI and each segment was visually scored using a scale of 1-3 for wall motion and thickening. There was a high agreement between gated SPECT and MRI for both wall motion (229/273, 84% k = 0.72, P<0.001) and wall thickening (236/273, 86%
