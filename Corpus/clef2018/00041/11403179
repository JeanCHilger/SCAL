Radiopeptide transmitted internal irradiation of non-iodophil thyroid cancer and conventionally untreatable medullary thyroid cancer using. Differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTC) and medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC) overexpress somatostatin receptor subtypes (sstr). The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the tumour response of thyroid carcinomas to targeted irradiation with the radiolabelled somatostatin analogue [90Y]-1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecan-4,7,10-tricarboxy-methyl-1-yl-acetyl-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide ([90Y]-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide, or 90Y-DOTATOC) which has a high affinity to subtype 2 and a low affinity to subtype 5. It shows no affinity to sstr1, sstr3 and sstr4.Twenty patients (mean age 58 years 50% female, 50% male) with thyroid cancer were included (medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), 12 patientsThe overall antitumour effect (objective response and stable disease) was 35% in MTC 42%, in DTC 29%, and in AC 0%. The objective overall response rate was 0%. A stable disease was achieved in 35% (7/20), and progressive disease was found in 65% (13/20). The median time to progression was 8 months, with a median follow-up of 15 months. The treatment was very well tolerated. There were no grade III/IV haematological or renal toxicities.Targeted radiotherapy using 90Y-DOTATOC is able to stop tumour progression in a small number of patients and therefore may be an alternative treatment option for resistant disease. More significant tumour responses in thyroid and medullary thyroid cancer may be obtained by using radiopeptides with pan-somatostatin characteristics.
