Ventilation-perfusion lung scan for the detection of pulmonary involvement in Takayasu's arteritis. The aim of study was to analyse ventilation and perfusion (V/Q) lung scan findings in a series of Italian patients with Takayasu's arteritis. Eighteen consecutive patients underwent V/Q lung planar scintigraphy and single-photon emission tomography (SPET). Before perfusion scan acquisition was started, a first-pass study with (99m)Tc-macroaggregates of albumin was performed to assess the right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF). All patients had normal chest X-rays and were symptom free at the time of the investigation. They also underwent echocardiography to evaluate pulmonary artery pressure and in 13 patients respiratory function tests were performed. In four patients, perfusion lung scan was repeated after 1 year. In 10/18 patients (55.5%), 43 unmatched lobar, segmental or subsegmental perfusion defects were found on planar images ventilation scintigraphy was normal in all cases. On SPET images, 55 defects were found
