Early detection of myocardial ischaemia in the emergency department by rest or exercise (99m)Tc tracer myocardial SPET in patients with chest pain and non-diagnostic ECG. Chest pain (CP) represents a frequent reason for presentation at the emergency department (ED). A large proportion of patients have non-diagnostic ECG on presentation, and in many cases several hours have elapsed since onset of symptoms. Acute rest myocardial scintigraphy (rest SPET) has been shown to have a relevant role in the detection of patients at risk for coronary events, but its sensitivity and negative predictive value are optimal only within the first 3 h following onset of symptoms. In those with delayed presentation, exercise SPET alone, as a screening approach, appears more promising, but its feasibility and diagnostic role in the ED are still unresolved. A total of 231 consecutive patients with a recent-onset (<24 h) first episode of CP had a negative first-line work-up including ECG, troponins, creatine kinase-MB and echocardiography. These patients were considered at low risk for short-term coronary events. Patients were studied with rest SPET if they presented <3 h after onset of CP and exercise SPET if they presented after > or =3 h. The end-points of the study were detection of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) by angiography and major coronary events or cardiac death at 6 months. Eighty patients (35%) underwent rest SPET, while 151 (65%) underwent exercise SPET. Two of the 159 patients with negative SPET had evidence of critical CAD at 6-month follow-up (one patient in the rest SPET group and one in the exercise SPET group P=NS). Of the 72 patients (31%) with a positive scan, 34 (15%) had documented CAD (16 patients in the rest SPET group and 18 in the exercise SPET group
