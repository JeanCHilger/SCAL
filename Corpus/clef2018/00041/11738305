Association of mitral annulus calcification, aortic valve sclerosis and aortic root calcification with abnormal myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography in subjects age < or =65 years old. We examined the hypothesis that mitral annulus calcification (MAC), aortic valve sclerosis (AVS) and aortic root calcification (ARC) are associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in subjects age < or =65 years.Mitral annulus calcification, AVS and ARC frequently coexist and are associated with coronary risk factors and CAD in the elderly.We studied 338 subjects age < or =65 years who underwent evaluation of chest pain with myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and a two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram for other indications. The association of MAC, AVS and ARC with abnormal SPECT was evaluated by using chi-square analyses and logistic regression analyses.Compared with no or one calcium deposit and no or one coronary risk factor other than diabetes, multiple (> or =2) calcium (or sclerosis) deposits with diabetes or multiple (> or =2) coronary risk factors were significantly associated with abnormal SPECT in women age < or =55 years old (odds ratio [OR], 20.00), in women age >55 years old (OR, 10.00) and in men age < or =55 years old (OR, 5.55). Multivariate analyses identified multiple calcium deposits as a significant predictor for an abnormal SPECT in women (p < 0.001), younger subjects age < or =55 years (p < 0.05) and the total group of subjects (p < 0.01).When coronary risk factors are also taken into consideration, the presence of multiple calcium deposits in the mitral annulus, aortic valve or aortic root appears to be a marker of CAD in men < or =55 years old and women.
