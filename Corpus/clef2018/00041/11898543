Advances in neuroimaging: non-substrate-directed partial epilepsy. Contemporary neuroimaging studies using structural and functional techniques are critical in the evaluation of patients with localization-related epilepsy. Imaging procedures may be used to localize the epileptic brain tissue or determine the likely pathologic findings underlying the epileptogenic zone, or both. The diagnostic yield of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been demonstrated in patients with partial epilepsy. The identification of an MRI epileptogenic lesion is almost invariably a reliable indicator of the site of seizure onset. Peri-ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) may be of particular benefit in patients with normal MRI studies. The use of neuroimaging in the care and management of patients with partial epilepsy is discussed here.
