Dyskinesias following neural transplantation in Parkinson's disease. Severe dyskinesias during the 'off' phases (periods of increased Parkinson's disease (PD) disability) have been observed following intrastriatal transplantation of human embryonic mesencephalic tissue. Here we retrospectively analyzed 14 patients who were followed for up to 11 years after grafting, and found that dyskinesias (abnormal involuntary movements and postures) increased during postoperative off phases, but were generally of mild to moderate severity. Dyskinesia severity was not related to the magnitude of graft-derived dopaminergic re-innervation, as judged by (18)F-labeled 6-L-fluorodopa (FD) positron emission tomography (PET), indicating that off-phase dyskinesias probably did not result from excessive growth of grafted dopaminergic neurons.
