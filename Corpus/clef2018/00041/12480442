Dopamine agonist monotherapy in Parkinson's disease. Levodopa is the gold-standard therapy for Parkinson's disease. However, long-term treatment leads to involuntary movements and response fluctuations which add to the complexities of later disease-management. In addition, preclinical evidence suggests that levodopa is toxic to dopaminergic neurons. These problems have led to a move away from levodopa towards initial monotherapy with a dopamine agonist.Positron-emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) tracers have been developed which may be considered surrogate markers for remaining dopaminergic neurons. In a randomised controlled trial in patients with early Parkinson's disease, the Parkinson Study Group used 123I-beta-CIT SPECT (JAMA 2002 287: 1653-61). Those patients given pramipexole had significantly reduced loss of striatal uptake at 46 months compared with those given levodopa (16.0% vs 25.5%). In a similar trial, Alan Whone and colleagues used 18F-DOPA PET (Neurology 2002
