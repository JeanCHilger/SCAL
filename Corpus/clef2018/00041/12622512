Molecular and functional imaging technology for the development of efficient treatment strategies for gliomas. Gliomas are the most common types of brain tumors, which invariably lead to death over months or years. Before new and potentially more effective treatment strategies, such as gene therapy, can be effectively introduced into clinical application the following goals must be reached: (1) the determination of localization, extent and metabolic activity of the glioma (2) the assessment of functional changes within the surrounding brain tissue
