Evaluation of construction and expression shiga toxin2 A-luteinizing hormone releasing hormone recombinant toxin. The purpose is to construct shiga toxin2A-luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (Stx2A-LHRH) recombinant toxin which can kill cancer cells specifically and try to get a new target-binding drug.The fragment of Stx2A-LHRH DNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were cloned into plasmid pET-20b(+) vector. The recombinant plasmid pET-Stx2A-LHRH was constructed successfully and identified by endonucleases digestion and sequencing analysis then it was transformed to Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and expressed under the induction of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside.The result of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel thin layer scanning proved a special band of a molecular weight of about 38,000, accounting for 10.32% of total amount of the supernatant protein. Stx2A-LHRH recombinant toxin can kill HeLa cells clearly.Stx2A-LHRH recombinant toxin may become a choice of target-binding drug in the future.
