Frequent impact of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography on the staging and management of patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is useful in staging aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). However, its role in indolent NHL has not been established. This retrospective study assessed the sensitivity and clinical impact of PET findings in patients with indolent NHL. Patients with indolent NHL who underwent FDG-PET scanning between May 1997 and August 2001 were identified. Case records were reviewed for FDG-PET and conventional staging/restaging results and compared for concordance. Forty-seven patients were identified. Twelve staging FDG-PET scans and 37 restaging FDG-PET scans were obtained. The FDG-PET case sensitivity rate was 98%. Forty-two percent of staging FDG-PET scans were concordant with conventional staging, with the remaining patients exhibiting more extensive disease on PET. At progression, FDG-PET and conventional assessments were discordant in 46% of cases. Positron emission tomography findings downstaged disease in 30% of these patients and upstaged disease in 16%. Computed tomography (CT) and FDG-PET identified 150 and 146 individual sites of disease, respectively. Among "definite" sites on structural imaging, 74% were also seen on PET. For equivocal lesions, only 19% were seen on both modalities. Clinical management was changed in 34% of patients as a result of FDG-PET findings. Of 22 discordant lesions in which true disease status could be evaluated, the PET findings were confirmed to be correct in 21 (95% P < 0.0001). These findings demonstrate that FDG-PET has a high sensitivity for indolent NHL and often leads to alteration of disease staging and management. This high accuracy of FDG-PET in assessing discordant lesions suggests a greater diagnostic utility compared with CT.
