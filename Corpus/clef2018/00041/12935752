PCR-based genetic evidence for occurrence of Helicobacter pylori and novel Helicobacter species in the canine gastric mucosa. The canine gastric mucosa is known to be a habitat for various Helicobacter species. So far, five Helicobacter species have been described from the canine gastric mucosa, but histological studies have demonstrated a greater variety. In order to gain more information on diversity of canine gastric mucosa colonising helicobacters, biopsy samples of four pet dogs were examined by DNA-based techniques. PCR with a primer pair binding specifically to the 16S rDNA of the species of the genus Helicobacter and generating a fragment of approximately 400 bp indicated the presence of Helicobacter strains in the stomachs of the four dogs. PCR products were cloned into Escherichia coli DH10B and PCR-re-amplified 16S rDNA fragments were subjected to amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) employing restriction enzyme HhaI. Restriction profiles indicated the presence of at least two different Helicobacter species in two dogs. Partial sequences of 16S rDNA of six clones were compared with sequences available in the EMBL data bank. Two sequences obtained from different dogs were identical with the corresponding sequences of Helicobacter pylori strains. Three sequences showed highest but moderate similarity values to H. pylori (96.6-98.0%) and one sequence to Helicobacter salomonis (97.3%). In contrast to previous reports our data implicate that the gastric mucosa of dogs may be colonised by strains of H. pylori or a very closely related species but they also confirm indications for the presence of so far uncultivated species of Helicobacter.
