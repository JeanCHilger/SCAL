MicroPET imaging of Cre-loxP-mediated conditional activation of a herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase reporter gene. Site-specific recombination tools such as the Cre-loxP system are used to create animal models where conditional gene deletion/activation studies are required. In the current proof of principle study, we have demonstrated that a PET reporter gene (PRG), the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk), can be made to remain silent and can be activated by Cre-loxP-mediated recombination in cell culture and in living mice. An adenovirus carrying a silent HSV1-tk was tail-vein injected (1 x 10(9) PFU) in six transgenic mice that express Cre recombinase in their liver (Cre+) and in four control mice (Cre-). The liver-specific expression of the PRG in Cre+ mice was detected in the microPET following injection of the reporter probe, 9-[4-fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butyl]guanine ([(18)F]-FHBG). The [(18)F]-FHBG accumulation in the liver in terms of percent-injected dose per gram of tissue was 7.72+/-1.13 for the Cre+ mice and 0.10+/-0.02 for the Cre- mice (P<0.05) 48 h after adenoviral injection. These results were further validated by quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting and by in vitro assays for herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase enzyme activity. Thus by using the Cre-loxP system it is possible to modulate a PRG and noninvasively monitor the extent of Cre-loxP-mediated gene activation by imaging in a microPET scanner.
