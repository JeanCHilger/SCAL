Cerebrovascular complications in metabolic syndrome: possible approaches to decrease risk. To compare brain perfusion in hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) or metabolic (MS) syndrome and hypertensive patients without clinicobiochemical signs of DM2 or MS to study enoxaparin effects on brain perfusion in DM2 and arterial hypertension (AH).Seventy patients included in the study were divided into three groups: 30 patients with DM2 and AH (group 1), 30 patients with MS and AH (group 2) and 10 AH patients without manifestations of MS or DM2 (group 3). All the patients have undergone single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were examined.Deterioration of brain perfusion was more prominent in DM2 and MS patients with AH than in hypertensive patients with normal metabolism. Stress test with acetasolamide revealed defective autoregulation of cerebral blood flow in hypertensive patients with DM2. A 6-week therapy with enoxaparin significantly improved brain perfusion in hypertensive patients with DM2.Enoxaparin treatment of hypertensive DM2 and MS patients with abnormal perfusion of the brain can be used for prevention of cerebrovascular complications.
