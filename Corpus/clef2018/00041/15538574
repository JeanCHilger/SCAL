Ankylosing spondylitis and bone mineral density--what is the ideal tool for measurement? Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is characterised by chronic inflammation and partial ossification, yet vertebral fractures due to osteoporosis, although common, are frequently unrecognised. The aim of this study was to (1) show the frequency of changes in the progress of osteopenia/osteoporosis in AS depending on duration and stage of the disease and (2) assess the ranking of two different methods of bone density measurement in this clinical pattern. We measured bone density in 84 male and female patients with both dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and single energy quantitative computed tomography (SE-QCT). In the initial and advanced stages of the disease, a high decrease in axial bone density could be verified (DXA: osteopenia in 5% and osteoporosis in 9.2% SE-QCT: osteopenia in 11.8% and osteoporosis in 30.3%). Peripheral bone density decrease as in osteopenia could be proven in 17.6% by DXA measurement. With SE-QCT, a decrease in vertebral trabecular bone density could already be observed in the initial stage and continued steadily during the course of the disease
