Syntheses of 11C- and 18F-labeled carboxylic esters within a hydrodynamically-driven micro-reactor. Carboxylic esters were successfully labeled with one of two short-lived positron-emitters, carbon-11 or fluorine-18, within a hydrodynamically-driven micro-reactor. The non-radioactive methyl ester was obtained at room temperature its yield increased with higher substrate concentration and with reduced infusion rate. Radioactive methyl ester was obtained from the reaction of (10 mM) with in 56% decay-corrected radiochemical yield (RCY) at an infusion rate of 10 microL min(-1), and when the infusion rate was reduced to 1 microL min(-1), the RCY increased to 88%. The synthesis of the non-radioactive fluoroethyl ester from and required heating of the micro-reactor on a heating block at 80 degrees C (14-17% RCY), whilst the corresponding radioactive from and was obtained in 10% RCY. The radioactive 'peripheral' benzodiazepine receptor ligand was obtained from the reaction of acid with labeling agent in 45% RCY at an infusion rate of 10 microL min(-1). When the infusion rate was reduced to 1 microL min(-1), the RCY increased to 65%. The results exemplify a new methodology for producing radiotracers for imaging with positron emission tomography that has many potential advantages, including a requirement for small quantities of substrates, enhanced reaction, rapid reaction optimisation and easy product purification.
