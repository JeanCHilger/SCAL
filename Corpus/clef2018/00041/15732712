Cerebral microcirculation and structural changes in the brain in essential hypertension. The purpose of the study was to examine cerebral microcirculatory and structural changes in 32 patients (20 males and 12 females whose age varied from 37 to 63 years) with moderate arterial hypertension (AH). All the patients underwent single-photon emission computed tomography of the brain, using (99m)Tc-hexamethylpropyleneaminoxylfor the evaluation of perfusion, as well as magnetic resonance imaging for the examination of cerebral structures. Cerebral structural changes and perfusion impairments were detected in patients with AH, even if they had no clinical signs of cerebrovascular insufficiency. Inadequate blood flow most frequently occurred in the parietal and temporal regions of the brain. There was a reduction in the cerebrovascular reserve in the frontal lobes in AH.
