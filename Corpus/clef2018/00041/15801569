Human functional neuroimaging in nicotine and tobacco research: basics, background, and beyond. Modern functional neuroimaging techniques allow nicotine and tobacco researchers to investigate the neurobiological basis of addiction in humans. We introduce the methods and measures of the following neuroimaging techniques: Electroencephalography and event-related cortical potentials, positron emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. We outline strengths and limitations across modalities and describe new and emerging technologies. We provide summaries of recent neuroimaging findings in the field of nicotine and tobacco research for neurochemistry, smoking and nicotine administration, craving and cue-reactivity, cognitive and affective information processing, and tobacco withdrawal. We address limitations of studies to date and identify opportunities for future research.
