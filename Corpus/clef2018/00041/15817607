Non-invasive assessment of myocardial ischaemia using new real-time three-dimensional dobutamine stress echocardiography: comparison with conventional two-dimensional methods. Although two-dimensional-dobutamine stress echocardiography (2D-DSE) is useful for the diagnosis of myocardial ischaemia, it requires the acquisition of multiple cross-sections at each stage. The introduction of new real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE) offers rapid acquisition and 3D display of the entire left ventricle (LV). The purpose was to evaluate real-time three-dimensional-dobutamine stress echocardiography (RT3D-DSE) for the diagnosis of ischaemia using exercise (201)Tl single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as the reference standard, in comparison with 2D-DSE.We performed DSE in 56 consecutive patients who had undergone SPECT because of suspected ischaemia. 3D images by RT3DE were acquired from the apical window after the acquisition of cross-sectional images at every stage of 2D-DSE. Wall motion analysis in RT3DE was performed from anatomical images by cropping the acquired full volume data sets. Mean scanning time for adequate image acquisition at peak stress by RT3D-DSE was shorter than that by 2D-DSE (29+/-4 vs. 68+/-6 s, P<0.0001). RT3DE provided adequate images at success rate of 92% at rest and 89% at peak stress, whereas two-dimensional echocardiography did at 94 and 90%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of RT3D-DSE for the detection of coronary artery disease are 86, 80, and 82%, respectively. Those of 2D-DSE are 86, 83, and 84%, respectively. There were no significant differences in the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy between these two methods (P=1.000).RT3D-DSE offers rapid and simple acquisition of the entire LV wall motion and provides feasible and accurate assessment of myocardial ischaemia.
