Increased fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake in childhood CNS tumors is correlated with malignancy grade: a study with FDG positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging coregistration and image fusion. PURPOSE Positron emission tomography (PET) has been used in grading of CNS tumors in adults, whereas studies of children have been limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS Nineteen boys and 19 girls (median age, 8 years) with primary CNS tumors were studied prospectively by fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET with (n = 16) or without (n = 22) H(2)(15)O-PET before therapy. Image processing included coregistration to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in all patients. The FDG uptake in tumors was semiquantitatively calculated by a region-of-interest-based tumor hotspot/brain index. Eight tumors without histologic confirmation were classified as WHO grade 1 based on location, MRI, and clinical course (22 to 42 months). Results Four grade 4 tumors had a mean index of 4.27 +/- 0.5, four grade 3 tumors had a mean index of 2.47 +/- 1.07, 10 grade 2 tumors had a mean index of 1.34 +/- 0.73, and eight of 12 grade 1 tumors had a mean index of -0.31 +/- 0.59. Eight patients with no histologic confirmation had a mean index of 1.04. For these 34 tumors, FDG uptake was positively correlated with malignancy grading (n = 34 r = 0.72
