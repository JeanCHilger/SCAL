131-I-metaiodobenzylguanidine treatment in patients with refractory advanced neuroblastoma. Fourteen patients with refractory advanced neuroblastoma were treated with 131-I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131-I-MIBG) all had evidence of progressive disease or recurrent disease following combination chemotherapy. One patient without gross evidence of disease, following surgical resection of recurrent neuroblastoma before therapy with 131-I-MIBG, remains healthy without regrowth of tumor 3.5 years later. Two other patients had minor responses, and one had a mixed response. Two patients remain alive 1,212 and 1,926 days following the initial 131-I-MIBG treatment
