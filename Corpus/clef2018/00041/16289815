A novel nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist radioligand for PET studies. Using positron emission tomography (PET) with a specific and selective radioligand targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) would allow us to better understand various nAChR related CNS disorders. The use of radiolabeled nAChR antagonists would provide a much safer pharmacological profile, avoiding most peripheral side effects that might be generated from radiolabeled nAChR agonists even at the tracer level thus, PET imaging with nAChR antagonists would facilitate clinical application. A potent and selective nAChR antagonist was labeled and characterized with PET in non-human primates. Its high brain uptake, high signal-to-noise ratio, and high specific binding strongly suggest a great potential to carry out imaging studies in humans. In addition, the use of a C-11 radiotracer would allow us to perform multiple PET studies in the same individual within a short time frame. The presence of an iodine atom in the molecule also allows the possibility to label with radioiodine for SPECT studies.
