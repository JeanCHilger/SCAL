Serotonin 1A receptors in the living brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. 4-[F-18]fluoro-N-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl}-N-(2-pyridinyl)benzamide, a selective serotonin 1A (5-HT(1A)) molecular imaging probe, was used in conjunction with positron emission tomography (PET) for quantification of 5-HT(1A) receptor densities in the living brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (ADs) (n = 8), subjects with mild cognitive impairment (n = 6), and controls (n = 5). ADs had receptor densities significantly decreased in both hippocampi (binding potential: controls 1.62 +/- 0.07 ADs 1.18 +/- 0.26) and also in raphe nuclei (controls 0.63 +/- 0.09
