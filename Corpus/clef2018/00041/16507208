Value of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography in managing patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. An increased glucose metabolic rate is observed with various degrees of intensity in different subtypes of aggressive lymphomas. [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET FDG-PET) allows functional imaging of this phenomenon through 3-dimensional tomographic slices, which are now easily fused with computed tomography (CT) images. [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET staging appears superior to conventional staging modalities for detecting nodal and extranodal lymphoma. When performed after first-line chemotherapy, FDG-PET is more efficient than CT and conventional diagnostic methods to predict the disease outcome. Some studies have reported that the relapse rate is 100% in patients with positive PET findings after treatment and 17% in patients with negative PET findings. This imaging modality can also assess early response after 1-2 cycles of chemotherapy, thus identifying responders from patients whose cancer will fail to respond to first-line therapy or will relapse shortly after having exhibited a partial or complete remission. [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET also seems useful for an accurate selection of patients who will benefit from highly intensive treatment.
