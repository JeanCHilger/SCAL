Swallowing lateralization: the effects of modified dual-task interference. A modified dual-task paradigm was designed to learn whether swallowing functions are selectively mediated by the left or right hemisphere. Healthy right-handed men (N = 38) were studied using videofluoroscopy to examine continuous straw drinking at baseline and with three interference conditions (silent word repetition, line orientation, finger tapping). Results indicate that activation of both right and left hemispheres can interfere with some swallowing behaviors. Findings suggest possibly different roles of the two hemispheres in the mediation of swallowing and support the notion that specific components of swallowing may be preferentially mediated by the left versus the right hemisphere.
