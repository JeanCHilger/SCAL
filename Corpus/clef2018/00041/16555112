The method of surface PEGylation influences leukocyte adhesion and activation. The influence of different surface modifications with poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) layers on the adsorption of fibrinogen and the adhesion and activation of macrophage-like human leukocytes was investigated. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) was modified using pulsed AC plasma polymerization with two types of starting monomers to generate: 1) a reactive acid surface using maleic anhydride (MAH) as monomer, and 2) a PEG-like surface using diethyleneglycol methyl vinyl ether (DEGVE) as monomer. The MAH surface was used as a reactive platform to graft linear chains of non-fouling mPEG via an intermediate layer of poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) under lower critical solution temperature (LCST) conditions of the mPEG. The DEGVE monomer is used to create PEG-like layers by use of low power plasma conditions. The ability of the surfaces to resist protein adsorption was investigated quantitatively using (125)I-radiolabeled human fibrinogen, and the conformation of the adsorbed protein was tested using an anti-fibrinogen monoclonal antibody in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that PEGylated surfaces adsorbed significantly less (up to 90% less) fibrinogen, and that unfolding of adsorbed fibrinogen was more pronounced on the linear mPEG layers than on the PEG-like plasma polymer surfaces. Adhesion of in-vitro differentiated macrophage-like U937 cells was reduced on both the PEG-like plasma polymer surfaces and the linear mPEG layers compared to the unmodified PET surface, but cells adhering to the PEG-like plasma polymer surfaces secreted less tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) than cells adhering to the linear mPEG layers. In conclusion, the method for preparing non-fouling surfaces for long-term implanted devices influence surface-induced cellular responses of the host.
