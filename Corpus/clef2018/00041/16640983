Centralised diagnostic. Diagnostic examinations with complicated and expensive equipment should be centralised in departments of radiology, clinical physiology and nuclear medicine, clinical biochemistry etc. For the future reorganisation of hospitals in Denmark, focus on centralisation in larger university hospitals is recommended with close collaboration between diagnostic specialities and clinical specialities, and with research and advanced competence as main assets.
