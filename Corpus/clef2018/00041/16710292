The role of ischaemia and pain in the blood pressure response to exercise stress testing in patients with coronary heart disease. Silent myocardial ischaemia is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary heart disease. However, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms of silent ischaemia. One potential pathway that may contribute to this absence of pain is increased blood pressure. The main aim of the current study was to assess the associations among blood pressure, pain and ischaemia in patients undergoing a standard exercise stress test. We hypothesized that patients who experienced chest pain during exercise would have lower baseline and peak blood pressures compared to those who did not experience chest pain. A total of 1,355 patients (418 women) who underwent a single-photon emission computed tomography treadmill exercise stress test and had not experienced a cardiac event in the past 2 weeks participated in the current study. Myocardial perfusion defects were assessed at rest and during the stress challenge. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, heart rate (HR) and rate pressure product (RPP) were assessed during rest and at peak exercise. There were no main effects of either pain or ischaemia on the baseline cardiovascular variables. Peak exercise data revealed main effects of pain on SBP, RPP and HR, and main effects of ischaemia on SBP and RPP, controlling for age, sex, baseline level, medication status and cardiac history. These findings suggest that acute rather than chronic increases in blood pressure may be one mechanism to explain the phenomena of silent myocardial ischaemia in cardiac patients, and may potentially provide a target for future treatment strategies.
