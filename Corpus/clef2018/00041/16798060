Imaging of oral cavity cancer. Despite many advances in surgical techniques, technology, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, survival rates for head and neck cancer (HNCa) have not improved significantly in decades, with many patients being diagnosed at advanced disease stages. Adequate assessment of oral cavity malignancies is critical for appropriate planning of surgical, radiation, and chemotherapy treatment. Imaging modalities used to evaluate the oral cavity include plain radiography (panoramic radiography and intraoral radiography), nuclear medicine scintigraphy, ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). This review describes these imaging techniques and their utility, primarily CT and MRI.
