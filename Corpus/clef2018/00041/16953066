Technetium-99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography findings correlated with P-glycoprotein expression in pituitary adenoma. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the technetium-99m sestamibi ((99m)Tc-MIBI) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) characteristics of pituitary adenomas might be correlated with cavernous sinus invasion, proliferative potential or the multidrug-resistance (MDR-1) gene product P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression in pituitary adenomas. Fifteen patients with pituitary adenomas, including 10 nonfunctioning adenomas, two prolactinomas, two GH producing adenomas, and one ACTH producing adenomas was investigated for this study. SPECT images with (99m)Tc-MIBI were acquired 15 minutes (early) and 3 hours (delayed) after injection. The tumor-to-normal brain ratio was calculated both early (ER) and delayed (DR) images. Retention index (RI) was calculated using the following formula: (DR-ER)/ERx100%. The pituitary adenomas specimens were examined by immunohistochemistry using anti-Pgp and MIB-1 monoclonal antibodies.(99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT findings were not related to MIB-1 labeling index or cavernous sinus invasion. (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT RI (-38.55+/-20.77) of the Pgp-positive group was significantly lower than that (-15.78+/-19.40) of Pgp-negative group (p=0.0494). No significant difference was observed in the ER and DR of (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT between Pgp-positive and negative groups. Our study suggests that although (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT is not useful to evaluate the proliferative potential or cavernous sinus invasion of pituitary adenomas. (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT could predict anti-cancer drug resistance related to the expression of Pgp in pituitary adenomas.
