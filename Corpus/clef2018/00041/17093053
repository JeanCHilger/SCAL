Global mapping of c-Myc binding sites and target gene networks in human B cells. The protooncogene MYC encodes the c-Myc transcription factor that regulates cell growth, cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Although deregulation of MYC contributes to tumorigenesis, it is still unclear what direct Myc-induced transcriptomes promote cell transformation. Here we provide a snapshot of genome-wide, unbiased characterization of direct Myc binding targets in a model of human B lymphoid tumor using ChIP coupled with pair-end ditag sequencing analysis (ChIP-PET). Myc potentially occupies > 4,000 genomic loci with the majority near proximal promoter regions associated frequently with CpG islands. Using gene expression profiles with ChIP-PET, we identified 668 direct Myc-regulated gene targets, including 48 transcription factors, indicating that Myc is a central transcriptional hub in growth and proliferation control. This first global genomic view of Myc binding sites yields insights of transcriptional circuitries and cis regulatory modules involving Myc and provides a substantial framework for our understanding of mechanisms of Myc-induced tumorigenesis.
