Cooperative activity of cytotoxic chemotherapy with antiangiogenic thrombospondin-I peptides, ABT-526 in pet dogs with relapsed lymphoma. Thrombospondin-I (TSP-I) is a natural antiangiogenic protein that enhances apoptosis of activated endothelial cells. A modified nonapeptide from TSP-I, ABT-526, has been found to be active in mouse cancer models and in dogs with naturally occurring cancers. To further assist in the development of ABT-526, we report herein on its evaluation in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in pet dogs with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).Ninety-four pet dogs with naturally occurring first-relapse NHL were entered into a prospective randomized placebo controlled double-blinded trial of ABT-526 plus CeeNu (Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY) versus CeeNu alone. Endpoints included response rate, duration of response, time to progression, and incidence of toxicoses.No significant ABT-526-specific toxicities were seen. CeeNu-associated toxicities, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, gastroenteritis, and elevated alanine transaminase, were similar. No significant difference in objective response rate was seen (ABT-526 + CeeNu versus placebo + CeeNu, 23/49 versus 23/37 P > 0.25). Cooperative activity between ABT-526 and CeeNu chemotherapy was evident based on a significant increase in the median response duration of dogs receiving ABT-526 plus CeeNu compared with placebo plus CeeNu (35 versus 15 daysResults of this preclinical trial suggest that the activity of ABT-526 is sustained when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy furthermore, the activity seems to be associated with the maintenance of CeeNu-induced treatment responses. Further studies of TSP-I peptide antiangiogenic therapy in pet dogs and humans with NHL are warranted.
