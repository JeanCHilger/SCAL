Diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography for detection of myocardial necrosis early after acute myocardial infarction. This study sought to evaluate the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for detection of myocardial necrosis after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).Single-photon emission computed tomography is widely accepted in the clinical setting for detection and estimation of myocardial infarction. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging offers technical advantages and is therefore a promising new method for identification of infarcted tissue.Seventy-eight patients with AMI were examined by CMR and SPECT 7 days after percutaneous coronary intervention. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and SPECT images were scored for presence and location of infarction using a 17-segment model. Results were compared with the peak troponin T level, electrocardiographic, and angiographic findings.Acute myocardial infarction was detected significantly more often by CMR than SPECT (overall sensitivity: 97% vs. 87% p = 0.008). Sensitivity of CMR was superior to SPECT in detecting small infarction as assessed by the peak troponin T level <3.0 ng/ml (92 vs. 69%Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is superior to SPECT in detecting myocardial necrosis after reperfused AMI because CMR detects small infarcts that were missed by SPECT independent of the infarct location. Thus, CMR is attractive for accurate detection and assessment of the myocardial infarct region in patients early after AMI.
