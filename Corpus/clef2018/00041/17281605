Model-Based receptor quantization analysis for PET parametric imaging. Dynamic PET (positron emission tomography) imaging technique allows image-wide quantification of physiologic and biochemical parameters. Compartment modeling is the most popular approach for receptor binding studies. However, current compartment-model based methods often either require the accurate arterial blood measurements as the input function or assume the existence of a reference region. To obviate the need for the input function or a reference region, in this paper, we propose to estimate the input function and the kinetic parameters simultaneously. The initial estimate of the input functions is obtained by the analysis of space intersections. Then both the input function and the receptor parameters, thus the underlying distribution volume (DV) parametric image, are estimated iteratively. The performance of the proposed scheme is examined by both simulations and real brain PET data in obtaining the underlying parametric images.
