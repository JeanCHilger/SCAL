Current value of positron emission tomography for prostate cancer follow-up. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a non-invasive nuclear medicine technology which uses radiotracers and cameras slightly different from the ones used in other nuclear medicine tests. Most current indications are for oncological diseases in nephrology-urology its use has been reduced because of the characteristics of the most commonly used radiotracer, 18F-fluor deoxiglucose (18F-FDG, a glucose analogue), which is excreted by the kidney, limiting the interpretation of the study in urologic malignancies. Currently, 18F-choline is a promising radiotracer for both staging and restaging, especially if hybrid PET/CT scan devices are used. New radiotracers will be needed in the evolution of PET to obtain information about more specific aspects of prostate carcinoma that will modify therapy and follow-up.
