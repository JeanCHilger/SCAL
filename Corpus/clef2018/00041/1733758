High signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI correlates with hypoperfusion in temporal lobe epilepsy. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and [99mTc]HMPAO were used to assess the functional significance of nonspecific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities observed in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and no focal lesion on CT scan. We studied 18 patients whose MRI was normal or showed high signal intensity on T2-weighted images (T2WIs) at the site of the EEG focus in 11 and 7 cases, respectively. EEG was monitored during regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) study. Lateralized hypoperfusion was present in 7 of 17 interictal (41%) and in one postictal cases it was located in the temporal lobe on the side of the EEG focus in all, and was significantly more frequent in patients with high signal intensity on T2WI (86%) than in patients with a normal MRI (18%). The degree of temporal perfusion asymmetry measured in each individual was higher in patients whose MRI was abnormal.
