The National Oncologic PET Registry: expanded medicare coverage for PET under coverage with evidence development. The purpose of this article is to review the recent expansion of Medicare coverage for 18F-FDG PET for certain cancer indications under the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' new Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) policy and to describe the specific operational mechanics of the National Oncologic PET Registry (NOPR).The NOPR will make possible a more accurate assessment of the actual influence of PET on patient management across a wide spectrum of cancer indications. By linking access to PET for virtually all Medicare beneficiaries to the collection of clinically valuable evidence, the NOPR represents the cutting edge of the CED approach.
