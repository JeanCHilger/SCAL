Serum VEGF as a significant marker of treatment response in hodgkin lymphoma. This pilot study aimed at determining serum VEGF levels (S-VEGF) at diagnosis and at restaging in children with Hodgkin lymphoma, and investigating whether this parameter provides prognostic information for remission after 2 courses of chemotherapy. PET-CT fusion was performed to assess response to treatment. Changes in S-VEGF levels were found to correlate with response to treatment for most of the children. This provides a rationale for exploring clinical interest in S-VEGF measurements in a larger group of children with Hodgkin lymphoma, and using the test for clinical trials of anti-angiogenic therapies.
