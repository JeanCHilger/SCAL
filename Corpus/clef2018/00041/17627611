Assessment of 11C-labeled-4-N-(3-bromoanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline as a positron emission tomography agent to monitor epidermal growth factor receptor expression. The aim of the present study was to investigate the biodistribution of (11)C-labeled-4-N-(3-bromoanilino), 6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline ((11)C-PD153035) and the relationship between accumulation of the tracer and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression levels. Biodistribution studies of (11)C-PD153035 were performed in tumor-bearing nude mice. The amount of radioactivity in the lungs was small while concentrations were highest in the liver and intestine. From in vitro studies, the level of (11)C-PD153035 accumulation was detected in MDA-MB-468, A549, and MDA-MB-231 cells. The uptake of (11)C-PD153035 in cells was closely correlated with the EGFR expression level of cells (r(2) = 0.85 P < 0.001), and the results obtained in excised tumors were also significantly correlated (r(2) = 0.63
