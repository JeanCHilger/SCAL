Parrot psychology and behavior problems. Behavior modification training, like veterinary medicine, is an exacting science, requiring a knowledge of not only wild avian behavior, but of child and adult human behavior as well. It is important to note that absolutely any changes in a bird's or its owner's environment may trigger a vast assortment undesirable behaviors. Some behavior problems are simple, but most have multiple causes and each of those causes must be determined and corrected before a high rate of success is evident. As in veterinary medicine, some birds respond to general "shotgun" techniques however, parrots are intelligent and complex creatures. They consider themselves an integral part of their human "flock" and respond as such. Most commonly seen negative behaviors can be altered, at least to some extent, and, in most cases, they can be alleviated completely. Yelling at the bird, striking it, or any other type of confrontational behavior modification technique is virtually useless and can actually worsen most situations. A high percentage of success involves extensive history taking, an understanding of human and wild animal flock behavior, and the time to create a complete program for each individual and its owner.
