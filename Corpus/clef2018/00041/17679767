Effectiveness of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin for assessment of heart functions in micropigs. This study examined the suitability of a nuclear imaging technique using (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin as an agent to assess the heart functions of healthy micropigs. The mean age of the pigs was 360 days (male), and the mean body weight was 35.3 kg ranging from 34.5-36 kg. There were no significant perfusion defects in any of the reconstructed images. Gated single-photon emission computed tomography imaging can be used to calculate the ventricular volume and ejection fraction (EF). In this case, an EF of 79% was calculated from the ventricular volume of the end-systolic image (10 ml) subtracted from that of the end-diastolic volume (49 ml). A perfusion defect (particularly the apex, lateral wall) is unlikely because of the presence of a preserved wall motion in a segment with a defect. It is concluded that quantitative cardiac scintigraphy, using (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin is an adequate technique for estimating the heart functions of healthy micropigs.
