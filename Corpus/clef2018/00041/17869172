RGD peptides grafting onto poly(ethylene terephthalate) with well controlled densities. The aim of this study was to graft RGD peptides with well controlled densities onto poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film surfaces. Biomimetic modifications were performed by means of a four-step reaction procedure: surface modification in order to create -COOH groups onto polymer surface, coupling agent grafting and finally immobilization of peptides. The originality of this work is to evaluate several grafted densities peptides. Toluidine blue and high-resolution mu-imager (using [(3)H]-Lys) were used to evaluate densities. Moreover, mu-imager has exhibited the stability of peptides grafted onto the surface when treated under harsh conditions. Benefits of the as-proposed method were related to the different concentrations of peptides grafted onto the surface as well as the capacity of RGD peptide to interact with integrin receptors.
