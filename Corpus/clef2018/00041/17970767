Evaluation and proposal for optimization of neurophysiological tests in migraine: part 2--neuroimaging and the nitroglycerin test. Neuroimaging methods have been widely used in headache and migraine research. They have provided invaluable information on brain perfusion, metabolism and structure during and outside of migraine attacks, contributing to an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder. Human models of migraine attacks are indispensable tools in pathophysiological and therapeutic research. This review of neuroimaging methods and the attack-provoking nitroglycerin test is part an initiative by a task force within the EUROHEAD project (EU Strep LSHM-CT-2004-5044837-Workpackage 9) with the objective of critically evaluating neurophysiological tests used in migraine. The first part, presented in a companion paper, is devoted to electrophysiological methods, this second part to neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and voxel-based morphometry, as well as the nitroglycerin test. For each of these methods, we summarize the results, analyse the methodological limitations and propose recommendations for improved methodology and standardization of research protocols.
