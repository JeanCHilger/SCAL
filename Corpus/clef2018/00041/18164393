F-18 FDG PET in detecting uterine leiomyoma. Uterine leiomyoma, benign tumors of the human uterus, are clinically apparent in about 25% of women and the most common solid pelvic tumors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the F-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake in the uterine leiomyoma and assess the correlation between the intensity of FDG uptake in the uterine leiomyomas and menstrual cycle.A total of 589 charts of healthy females examined by whole body FDG positron emission tomography (PET) for health screening examination were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-two of them were suspected gynacecological tumors and referred to the department of gynacecology to ascertain the nature of the causes. Final diagnosis as uterine leiomyomas were made based on uterine sonography, pelvic computed tomography, or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging scans. We defined FDG uptake as Grade I when FDG uptake was less than liver uptake, Grade II when FDG uptake was equal to liver uptake, and Grade III when FDG uptake was greater than liver uptake. The menstrual cycle was recorded on the day of performing FDG PET in premenopausal women.The FDG uptake in the uterine region is Grade I in three of these 22 females (13.65%), Grade II in 16 (72.7%), and Grade III in 3 (13.65%).There is no significant correlation between the intensity of FDG uptake in the uterine leiomyomas and menstrual cycle (P=.914).
