A unified analysis of exact methods of inverting the 2-D exponential radon transform, with implications for noise control in SPECT. Exact methods of inverting the two-dimensional (2-D) exponential Radon transform have been proposed by Bellini et al. (1979) and by Inouye et al. (1989), both of whom worked in the spatial-frequency domain to estimate the 2-D Fourier transform of the unattenuated sinogram by Hawkins et al. (1988), who worked with circularly harmonic Bessel transforms
