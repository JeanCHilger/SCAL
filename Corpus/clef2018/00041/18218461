Bayesian reconstruction of functional images using anatomical information as priors. Proposes a Bayesian method whereby maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of functional (PET and SPECT) images may be reconstructed with the aid of prior information derived from registered anatomical MR images of the same slice. The prior information consists of significant anatomical boundaries that are likely to correspond to discontinuities in an otherwise spatially smooth radionuclide distribution. The authors' algorithm, like others proposed recently, seeks smooth solutions with occasional discontinuities the contribution here is the inclusion of a coupling term that influences the creation of discontinuities in the vicinity of the significant anatomical boundaries. Simulations on anatomically derived mathematical phantoms are presented. Although computationally intense in its current implication, the reconstructions are improved (ROI-RMS error) relative to filtered backprojection and EM-ML reconstructions. The simulations show that the inclusion of position-dependent anatomical prior Information leads to further improvement relative to Bayesian reconstructions without the anatomical prior. The algorithm exhibits a certain degree of robustness with respect to errors in the location of anatomical boundaries.
