A comparison of deconvolution and windowed subtraction techniques for scatter compensation in SPECT. Three procedures for the removal of Compton-scattered data in SPECT by constrained deconvolution are presented. The first is a deconvolution of a 2-D measured PSRF containing scatter from a single reconstructed transaxial image the second is a deconvolution of a 2-D measured point-source response function (PSRF) from each frame of projection data prior to reconstruction
