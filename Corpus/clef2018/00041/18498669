Developing new treatments for Alzheimer's disease: the who, what, when, and how of biomarker-guided therapies. This synthetic review presents an approach to the use of biomarkers for the development of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). After reviewing the process of translation as applied to AD, the paper provides a general update on what is known about the biology of the disease, and highlights currently available treatments. This is followed by a discussion of future drug development for AD emphasizing the roles that biomarkers are likely to play in this process: (1) define patients who are going to progress rapidly for the purpose of trial enrichment (2) differentiate disease and therapeutically relevant AD subtypes
