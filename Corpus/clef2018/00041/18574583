The new EANM paediatric dosage card: additional notes with respect to F-18. The previously published European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) paediatric dosage card recommends 70 MBq F-18 or F-18 Fluoro-2-Deoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) as the "minimum recommended activity".Two recent publications demonstrate that when utilising F-18-labelled radiopharmaceuticals the administration of lower activities for small children is possible without losing image quality.In the light of these findings the EANM dosimetry and paediatrics committee have decided to reduce the value for the "minimum recommended activity" for both F-18 and F-18-FDG to 26 MBq for 2D- and 14 MBq for 3D-acquisitions.
