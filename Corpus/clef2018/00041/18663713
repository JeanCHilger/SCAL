Intrachain electron and energy transfer in conjugated organometallic oligomers and polymers. The synthesis of polymers of the type (-Cz-C[triple chemical bond]C-PtL(2)-C[triple chemical bond]C-Cz-X-)(n) along with the corresponding model compounds (Ph-PtL'(2)-C[triple chemical bond]C-Cz)(2)-X-, where Cz=3,3'-carbazole, X=nothing, Cz, or F (2,2'-fluorene), L=PBu(3), and L'=PEt(3) are reported. The electronic spectra (absorption, excitation, emission, and ns-transient spectra) and the photophysics of these species in 2-methyltetrahyrofuran (2MeTHF) at 298 and 77 K are presented. Evidence for singlet electron and triplet energy transfer from the Cz chromophore to the F moiety are provided and discussed in detail. The rate for electron transfer is very fast (>4 x 10(11) s(-1)), whereas that for triplet-triplet energy transfer is much slower (approximately 10(3) s(-1)). This work represents a very rare example of studies that address electronic communication in the backbone of a conjugated organometallic polymer.
