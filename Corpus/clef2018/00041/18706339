Development of a group selective molecularly imprinted polymers based solid phase extraction of malachite green from fish water and fish feed samples. A group selective molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction (MISPE) for malachite green (MG) from fish water and fish feed samples was developed. Using MG as template molecule, methacrylic acid as functional monomer, ethylene glycoldimethacrylate as linking agent and bulk polymerization as synthetic method, the molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were synthesized and characterized with rebinding experiment. The Scatchard polt's analysis revealed that the template-polymer system showed the two-site binding behavior with dissociation constants of 0.3194 micromol L(-1) and 15.70 micromol L(-1), respectively. MG and two structurally related compounds, leucomalachite green (LMG) and crystal violet (CV) were employed for selectivity test. The MIPs exhibited the highest selective rebinding to MG, but also displayed 83.0% and 87.5% of cross-reactivity with LMG and CV, demonstrating that MIPs could be used as group recognition sorbents in solid phase extraction. The extraction conditions of MISPE column for MG were optimized. Tap water samples spiked with MG at concentration of 0.5-10 ng mL(-1) were extracted by MISPE column and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. The recoveries of MISPE column for MG extraction were found to be 76.8-93.7% with the relative standard deviations of 2.12-10.09%, indicating the feasibility of the prepared MIPs for MG extraction. No detectable MG was observed in one fish farming water sample and two fish feed samples while the MG concentrations in two pet fishpond water samples were found at 1.50 ng mL(-1) and 0.67 ng mL(-1), respectively.
