Comparison of pinhole and SPECT 99mTc-MIBI imaging in primary hyperparathyroidism. This study aims to compare dual tracer, dual phase pinhole technetium-99m labelled 2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (Tc-MIBI) imaging (including oblique imaging), with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and dual phase planar Tc-MIBI images, and combined SPECT, dual phase planar Tc-MIBI images and anterior pinhole thyroid images for the localization of parathyroid adenomas in the neck in primary hyperparathyroidism.Sixty-two patients underwent Tc-MIBI dual phase, anterior and anterior oblique pinhole images of the neck, anterior planar images of the neck and chest and early phase neck/chest SPECT followed by [Tc] pertechnetate anterior and anterior oblique pinhole thyroid images. Images were reviewed by consensus in three combinations - dual phase anterior and anterior oblique pinhole Tc-MIBI images and pinhole thyroid images SPECT and dual phase planar Tc-MIBI images and combined SPECT, dual phase planar Tc-MIBI images and anterior pinhole thyroid images.For 52 parathyroid adenomas in 50 patients, the sensitivity of dual phase anterior and anterior oblique pinhole Tc-images and pinhole thyroid images was 81%. Significantly lower sensitivities were observed with SPECT and dual phase planar Tc-MIBI images (54%, P=0.0005) and combined SPECT, dual phase planar Tc-MIBI images and anterior pinhole thyroid images (65%, P=0.0209). The positive predictive value for all imaging combinations was 88-92%.Dual phase anterior and anterior oblique pinhole Tc-MIBI images and pinhole thyroid images are significantly more sensitive than imaging combinations that included SPECT and remains the optimal imaging protocol for the localization of parathyroid adenomas in the neck in primary hyperparathyroidism.
