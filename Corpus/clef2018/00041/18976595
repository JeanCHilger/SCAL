PET/CT for diagnosis of infections. Radiolabelled white blood cells are widely used for scintigraphic evaluation of infection. However, this technique is time-consuming and provides rather limited anatomical details. Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluordeoxyglucose is gaining ground in clinical settings and the added value of combined metabolic and anatomical imaging achieved by combining PET with computed tomography (CT) to PET/CT seems particularly promising. We present the current status for the use of PET/CT in selected infectious diseases based on the limited literature available.
