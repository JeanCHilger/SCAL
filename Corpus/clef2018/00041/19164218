Imaging surrogates of tumor response to therapy: anatomic and functional biomarkers. This article addresses the current status of quantitative imaging as a surrogate biomarker for the assessment of tumor response to therapy with non-small cell lung cancer as an example. In addition, the article discusses the limitations of conventional response criteria in the new era of molecular-targeted agents for cancer treatment the increasing need for more accurate and early response-assessment methods, particularly for volumetric CT
