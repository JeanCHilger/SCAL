Multiple mechanisms for hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. The mechanisms of cell killing by oxidative stress, in particular by hydrogen peroxide, are not yet well clarified. Here, we show that during recovery after H(2)O(2) treatment, apoptosis occurs in two different waves, peaking at 8 h (early) and 18 h (late) of recovery from oxidative stress. The two peaks are differentially modulated by a set of inhibitors of metabolic processes, which suggests that the first peak depends on DNA break formation, whereas the second may be correlated with H(2)O(2)-induced mitochondrial alterations.
