Challenges in the surgical treatment of epilepsy patients with cortical dysplasia. Cortical dysplasia (CD) is the most common malformation of cortical development in epilepsy surgery patients. Patients with mild Palmini type I CD represent about 50% of the surgical cases, and these lesions tend to occur most often in the temporal lobe, often associated with hippocampal sclerosis. By comparison, patients with severe type II CD present at younger ages, often with multilobar extratemporal lesions, and more aggressive seizures. The presurgical evaluation in CD patients can be challenging, as no single test is 100% accurate. Based on retrospective cohort studies, the accuracy of investigations are: interictal scalp electroencephalography (EEG), 50% ictal scalp EEG, 65%
