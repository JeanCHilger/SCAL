Prognostic value of myocardial metabolic imaging with BMIPP in the spectrum of coronary artery disease: a systematic review. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the current literature on the prognostic value of BMIPP imaging, fatty-acid metabolic imaging, for the prediction of cardiovascular events in coronary artery disease.Electronic databases (including Japanese medical literature search engines) were searched by a Japanese investigator using a predefined search strategy. Eleven studies, all conducted in Japan, were included in the meta-analysis. In three studies involving 541 patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome who were excluded for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), an abnormal finding on BMIPP imaging was significantly associated with future hard events (cardiac death or non-fatal myocardial infarction). The negative predictive value of BMIPP imaging for future hard events was 98.9% (96.8-99.7%) over 3.5 years. In six studies involving 542 patients with AMI, a larger defect on BMIPP imaging was significantly associated with future hard events. The prognostic value of perfusion-metabolism mismatch compared with myocardial perfusion imaging was dependent upon the relative timing of BMIPP imaging, revascularization, and myocardial perfusion damage.BMIPP imaging is useful for the risk stratification of patients with coronary artery disease, particularly patients with acute chest pain.
