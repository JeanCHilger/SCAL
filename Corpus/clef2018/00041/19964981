Detrended Fluctuation Analysis of EEG in detecting cross-modal plasticity in brain for blind. Cross-modality is the development of cross link between the modalities in the brain following sensory deprivation in the early stage. Cross modality analysis was previously done with fMRI, MEG and PET images for studying the changes in cerebral activities. Instead of these imaging techniques, this work involves in deriving self similarity parameter using Detrended Fluctuation Analysis of EEG from blind and blind folded normal individuals. This paper presents a novel technique of nonlinear spectral analysis to extract the information from electro encephalograms of humans for the detection of cross- modality existence in blind subjects.
