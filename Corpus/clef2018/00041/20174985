Therapeutic impact of [(18)F]fluoride positron-emission tomography/computed tomography on patients with unclear foot pain. To evaluate the therapeutic impact of [(18)F]fluoride positron-emission tomography/computed tomography ([(18)F]fluoride PET/CT) imaging on patients with unclear foot pain.Twenty-eight patients were prospectively included in this study. Therapeutic management was defined by two experienced dedicated foot surgeons before and after [(18)F]fluoride PET/CT imaging. Twenty-six patients underwent cross-sectional imaging [CT, magnetic resonance (MR)] prior to PET/CT. A retrospective analysis of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnoses was performed when a therapy change occurred after PET/CT imaging.In 13/28 (46%) patients therapeutic management was changed due to PET/CT results. Management changes occurred in patients with the following diagnoses: os trigonum syndrome sinus tarsi syndrome[(18)F]fluoride PET/CT has a substantial therapeutic impact on management in patients with unclear foot pain.
