The correlation factor about respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis and post-bronchiolitis wheezing in infant. To observe the correlation factor about early-life RSV bronchiolitis and sequential recurrent wheezing for two years.Follow up the RSV bronchiolitis patients for two years in order to analyze the occurrence of wheezing post-bronchiolitis. Single and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to determined the risk factors such as individual atopy history and familial atopy history, pet feeding, breast milk, secondhand smoke for RSV bronchiolitis and subsequent wheezing.(1) Not breast feeding, exposure to cigarette smoke and the deficiency of VitA, D were the significant risk factors contributed to the RSV branchiolitis. (2) Exposure to cigarette smoke, the deficiency of VitA, D, the personal history of atopy and the family history of atopy were the significant risk factors contributed to the post-bronchiolitis wheezing in children. (3) Those patients who eosinophilia, high serum IgE, RANTES and decreased TH1 to TH2 Ratio were more likely to have wheezing after RSV bronchiolitis.(1) Not breast feeding, exposure to cigarette smoke and the deficiency of VitA, D were the significant risk factors contributed to the RSV bronchiolitis. (2) Exposure to cigarette smoke, the deficiency of VitA, D, the personal history of atopy and the family history of atopy were the significant risk factors contributed to the post-bronchiolitis wheezing in children.
