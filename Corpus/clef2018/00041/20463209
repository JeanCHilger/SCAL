Myocardial structural, perfusion, and metabolic correlates of left bundle branch block mechanical derangement in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy: a tagged cardiac magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography study. Left bundle branch block (LBBB) influences on regional left ventricular (LV) structure, perfusion, and metabolism have not yet been thoroughly investigated in dilated cardiomyopathy patients.Eleven dilated cardiomyopathy patients with LBBB (mean+/-SD age, 62+/-11 years LV ejection fraction, 35+/-8%) and 7 dilated cardiomyopathy patients without LBBB (mean+/-SD age, 58+/-9 yearsIn dilated cardiomyopathy patients, the extensive LV contraction abnormalities induced by LBBB cause regional myocardial metabolic and structural remodeling, without consistent changes in blood flow.
