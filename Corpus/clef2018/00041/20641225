AOI987 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disease associated with an irreversible decline of mental functions and with cognitive impairment (1,  2). It is characterized by the presence, in the brain, of senile plaques of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides with intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of filaments containing the hyperphosphorylated protein tau (3,  4). Accelerated deposition of Aβ deposits seems to be a key risk factor associated with AD, and although the mechanisms of the disease are still not fully understood, reducing the deposition of amyloid plaques seems to benefit patients. Today, the clinical diagnosis of AD relies on mental and cognitive assessments of patients and the confirmation of the disease is so far obtained by postmortem examination of tissues. Major effort is being undertaken to find means of evaluating in vivo, at an early stage, the growth of the Aβ plaques for better assessment and possibly treatment. Several radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET), such as [
