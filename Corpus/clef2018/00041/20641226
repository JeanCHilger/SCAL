 Neuroendocrine tumors (NTs) are slow growing, can develop in almost any organ of the body (1), and are characterized by the overexpression of somatostatin receptors (sstr designated 1â€“5) (2). Because the different sstrs may be expressed individually or simultaneously by the NT, these receptors are targeted with radiolabeled compounds for the imaging detection or the treatment of this ailment (3). Due to a very short plasma half-life (~3 min), somatostatin itself is not the preferred sstr ligand for radiolabeling, and several of its analogs, such as octreotide (OC), vapreotide, etc., have been developed for the imaging and therapy of NTs (4). OCs show a high affinity for sstr2 and sstr5, but they bind varyingly to the sstr3 and sstr4 receptors. The OCs are coupled with chelators like diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA) or 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-
