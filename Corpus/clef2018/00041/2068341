Three-dimensional photon radiotherapy planning for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers. 2. Conformation treatment planning using a multileaf collimator. Three-dimension dose distributions have been computed for 15 MV X-ray radiation therapy (MEVATRON 77, Siemens) of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers using isocentric rotational technique with multileaf collimator. Using a new concave contour tracing algorithm, satisfactory dose delivery to the target volume and efficient protection of the normal tissues can be achieved.
