New aspects of MRI for diagnostics of large vessel vasculitis and primary angiitis of the central nervous system. Vasculitis is a rare disease and clinical symptoms are often unspecific. Accurate and early diagnosis is mandatory in order to prevent complications, such as loss of vision or stroke. Imaging techniques can contribute to establishing a definite diagnosis and to evaluate disease activity and the extent of the disease in various vascular regions. Conventional imaging methods, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, as well as digital subtraction angiography allow the vessel lumen but not the vessel wall to be depicted. However, vasculitis is a disease which primarily affects the vessel wall, therefore conventional imaging modalities often fail to make a definite diagnosis. Recently black-blood high resolution MR in vivo imaging has been used to visualize cervical and intracranial vasculitis. This review article presents imaging protocols for intracranial and cervical black-blood MR imaging and clinical cases with large vessel vasculitis and vasculitis of the central nervous system. Furthermore the current literature, examples of the most common differential diagnoses of cervical and cranial arteriopathy and the potential of other imaging modalities, such as PET/CT and ultrasound will be discussed.
