Isolated Hemiataxia and Cerebellar Diaschisis after a Small Dorsolateral Medullary Infarct. Isolated hemiataxia after a medullary infarct is rare. We describe a case of isolated hemiataxia after a small infarct localized at the ipsilateral dorsolateral medulla. An 83-year-old man developed acute onset of ataxia in the left arm and in both legs. Speech and extraocular movement were normal, and he did not have any other neurological manifestations. Brain MRI showed a small infarct localized at the left dorsolateral medulla, which involved the inferior cerebellar peduncle. (123)ECD-SPECT showed hypoperfusion in the left cerebellar hemisphere without clear vascular territory. Neuroimaging findings for our patient suggested the involvement of the inferior cerebellar peduncle that projects to the cerebellum in our patient.
