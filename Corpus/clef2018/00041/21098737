Organ-specific dietary fatty acid uptake in humans using positron emission tomography coupled to computed tomography. A noninvasive method to determine postprandial fatty acid tissue partition may elucidate the link between excess dietary fat and type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that the positron-emitting fatty acid analog 14(R,S)-[(18)F]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid ((18)FTHA) administered orally during a meal would be incorporated into chylomicron triglycerides, allowing determination of interorgan dietary fatty acid uptake. We administered (18)FTHA orally at the beginning of a standard liquid meal ingested in nine healthy men. There was no significant (18)FTHA uptake in the portal vein and the liver during the 1st hour. Whole body PET/CT acquisition revealed early appearance of (18)FTHA in the distal thoracic duct, reaching a peak at time 240 min. (18)FTHA mean standard uptake value increased progressively in the liver, heart, quadriceps, and subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues between time 60 and 240 min. Most circulating (18)F activity between time 0 and 360 min was recovered into chylomicron triglycerides. Using Triton WR-1339 treatment in rats that received (18)FTHA by gavage, we confirmed that >90% of this tracer reached the circulation as triglycerides. This novel noninvasive method to determine tissue dietary fatty acid distribution in humans should prove useful in the study of the mechanisms leading to lipotoxicity.
