Fatal hemorrhage induced by subtilase cytotoxin from Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli. Subtilase cytotoxin (SubAB) is an AB(5) type toxin produced by a subset of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli. The A subunit is a subtilase-like serine protease and cleaves an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP. The B subunit binds to a receptor on the cell surface. Although SubAB is lethal for mice, the cause of death is not clear. In this study, we demonstrate in mice that SubAB induced small bowel hemorrhage and a coagulopathy characterized by thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. SubAB also induced inflammatory changes in the small intestine as detected by ¹⁸F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography imaging and histochemical analysis. Using RT-PCR and ELISA, SubAB was shown to increase interleukin-6 in a time-dependent manner. Thus, our results indicate that death in SubAB-treated mice may be associated with severe inflammatory response and hemorrhage of the small intestine, accompanied by coagulopathy and IL6 production.
