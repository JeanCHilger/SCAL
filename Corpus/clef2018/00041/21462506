Efficient soluble expression and purification of influenza A nucleoprotein in Escherichia coli. To efficiently express nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza A virus A/Jingke/30/95 (H3N2) in E. coli for further immunogenicity study, three forms of NP gene, NP(His) (NP fused with 6 x His tag), NPwt (wild type NP, non-fused NP with native codon) and NP(O) (codon optimized, non-fused NP) were cloned by the technologies of restriction enzyme digestion, PCR, codon optimization and gene synthesis. Three recombinant plasmids were subsequently constructed based on the prokaryotic vector pET-30a, respectively. The comparative studies with these plasmids were carried out on the gene expression efficiency, induction temperature and time, purification process and immune reactivity. It was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing analysis that the three NP genes were inserted into the expression plasmid pET-30a correctly. SDS-PAGE showed that all three forms of NP gene could be efficiently ex pressed in E. coli, among which NP(O) was expressed with the highest expression level. The lower temperature fermentation (T=25 degrees C) and longer time induction (t=10 h) were necessary for high-level expression of protein in soluble form. The purity of tag-free NP was up to 90% through the two-step purification process with anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. It was indicated by Western blot that purified NP reacted well with the serum from mice immunized with PR8 virus. These results suggest that the codon-optimized influenza A virus NP gene can be efficiently expressed in E. coli and the expressed NP protein with specific immune reactivity could be purified from the supernatant of bacterial lysate.
