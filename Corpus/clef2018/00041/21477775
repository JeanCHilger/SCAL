Correlative anatomy for the mediastinum. Diseases of the mediastinum comprise a wide spectrum of benign and malignant entities that share the same anatomic site within the chest. Correct management often requires a multidisciplinary approach. Diagnostic imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography, and positron emission tomography play a major role in the diagnosis of mediastinal diseases and in guiding minimally invasive diagnostic procedures, minimizing the risk of imaging-guided biopsies. This article describes the mediastinal anatomy, correlating the findings of plain radiography, CT, and MRI.
