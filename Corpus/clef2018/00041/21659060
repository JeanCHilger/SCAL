Professional practice and accessibility to equipment in thoracic oncology. Results of a survey in Rhônes-Alpes region (France). This survey, conducted in region Rhône-Alpes (France), aims to assess some data in thoracic oncology practice including availability of specialized equipments. This study is based on a questionnaire mailed to oncologists and pulmonologists in the region. Of 401 questionnaires, the response rate was 56%. Responses of 71 (20%) physicians practicing thoracic oncology are presented in this article. Eighty percent of physicians routinely screen occupational exposure in case of lung cancer. The oncologists are less likely than pulmonologists to screen it (50% vs. 12%, p = 0.0015). Sixty-one percent of practitioners do not routinely propose smoking cessation in stage IV. Sixty-nine percent of practitioners' reports obtain an appointment for PET-scanner within 15 days and 72% indicate that this equipment is located within 50 km of their place of practice. Sixty-two percent reports using a surgical team specialized in chest disease, which is located in their city in 77% of cases. Sixty-one percent say that the period between the decision of an emergency radiotherapy and the start of it is less than one week. In 73% radiotherapy department is located in their city of practice. Forty-one percent of practitioners say they have a centralized and specialized preparation unit for cancer drugs. It seems that specialized equipment in Rhône-Alpes is adapted to practice with the exception of units dedicated to the preparation of cytotoxic drugs.
