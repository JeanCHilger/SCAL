. Choline is an important component of phospholipids in cell membranes. Increased metabolism in tissues will lead to an increased uptake of choline. Choline is phosphorylated by choline kinases (CHK) to phosphorylcholine within cells and, after several biosynthetic processes, is finally integrated into phospholipids (1). Because tumor cells have a high metabolic rate, choline uptake is high in order to keep up with the demands of the synthesis of phospholipids in their cellular membranes (2).
