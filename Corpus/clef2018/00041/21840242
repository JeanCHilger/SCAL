Differentiating Parkinson's disease from multiple system atrophy by [123I] meta-iodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy and olfactory test. We aimed to study whether either [(123)l] myocardial meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy or the odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J) is effective in differentiating Parkinson's disease (PD) from multiple system atrophy (MSA). We compared the MIBG accumulation and olfactory score between 42 PD and 42 MSA (19 MSA-P and 23 MSA-C) patients in the early stages. [(123)l] MIBG myocardial scintigraphy showed higher sensitivity and the olfactory test higher specificity in differentiating PD from MSA. There were significant differences between PD and MSA-C (p = 0.0019) instead of MSA-P (p > 0.05) in the MIBG accumulation, while there were significant differences between PD and MSA-P (p = 0.0003) or MSA-C (p = 0.0003) in the OSIT-J score. Our data suggest that the olfactory test can be useful as a clinical tool with its higher specificity in differentiating PD from MSA in the early stages and, moreover, support the discrimination of PD from MSA-P.
