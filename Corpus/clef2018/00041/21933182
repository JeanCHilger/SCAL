Metabolic evidence for episodic memory plasticity in the nonepileptic temporal lobe of patients with mesial temporal epilepsy. Metabolic changes have been described in the nonepileptic temporal lobe of patients with unilateral mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). To better understand the functional correlate of this metabolic finding, we have sought to characterize brain regions in patients with MTLE that show correlation between unilateral episodic memory performances, as assessed by intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT), and interictal regional cerebral metabolism measured by [(18) F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET).Resting FDG-PET was performed interictally in 26 patients with unilateral MTLE caused by HS (16 female, mean age: 36 years 16 left HS). Using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8), we performed a group comparison analysis comparing brain metabolism in the patients and in 54 adult controls (27 female, mean age: 32 years), with FDG-PET data of right HS patients being flipped. IAT scores of nonepileptic hemisphere functions (amobarbital injection ipsilateral to HS) were used as covariates of interest in a correlation analysis with regional brain metabolism.The group comparison analysis revealed significant hypometabolic areas in a widespread temporofrontal network ipsilateral to HS. In addition, a significant increase in metabolism was found in mesial and lateral temporal regions contralateral to HS. Significant positive correlations were found between IAT scores of nonepileptic hemisphere functions and mesial temporal metabolism in this hemisphere.This study demonstrates the existence of significant increase in relative regional cerebral glucose metabolism in mesial and lateral temporal regions contralateral to the epileptic focus in patients with unilateral MTLE associated with HS. The positive correlation in these brain regions between IAT scores and metabolism supports the role of disease-induced plasticity mechanisms contralateral to HS in the preservation of episodic memory processes.
