PET imaging using 64Cu-labeled sulfophthalocyanines: synthesis and biodistribution. Sulfonated metallo phthalocyanines (MPcS(n)) are second generation photosensitizers advanced for photodynamic therapy of various medical applications. A series of ZnPcS(n) was demetallated and subsequently converted to the corresponding [(64)Cu]CuPcS(n) in 40-50% isolated yields and >98% radiochemical purities. Tumor-bearing mice were injected with the (64)Cu-labeled products and subjected to 3-h dynamic PET imaging studies. Biodistribution patterns showed characteristic differences between the various derivatives. Tumor uptake was detected only for the amphiphilic derivatives [(64)Cu]CuPcS(2) and [(64)Cu]CuPcS(3)C(6) (1-1.5%ID/g). The biological data suggest that PET imaging with [(64)Cu]CuPc can be used to establish structure-PDT efficacy relationships for Pc-based photosensitizers.
