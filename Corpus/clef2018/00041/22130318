Cardiac iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) scintigraphy parameter predicts cardiac and cerebrovascular events in type 2 diabetic patients without structural heart disease. Cardiac iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) scintigraphy is an established method of assessment of cardiovascular sympathetic function. The aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term cardiovascular predictive value of cardiac (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy parameters in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients without structural heart disease.Cardiac (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy in 108 patients with type 2 diabetes who did not have structural heart disease, was evaluated. The washout rate (WR) was considered enhanced if it was ≥40%. Accurate follow-up information for 4.6 years was obtained in 54 enhanced WR patients (27 male mean age, 61 ± 11 years) and in 54 sex- and age-matched preserved WR patients (27 maleAbnormal WR of cardiac (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy at baseline has long-term cardiovascular predictive value in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes without structural heart disease.
