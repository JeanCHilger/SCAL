Synthesis and evaluation of ¹⁸F-labeled styryltriazole and resveratrol derivatives for β-amyloid plaque imaging. In the present study, a styryltriazole and four resveratrol derivatives were synthesized as candidates for β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque imaging. On the basis of their binding affinities to Aβ(1-42) aggregates, the styryltriazole (1, K(i) = 12.8 nM) and one resveratrol derivative (5, K(i) = 0.49 nM) were labeled with (18)F. In normal mice, tissue distribution of [(18)F]5 showed good initial brain uptake (3.26% ID/g at 2 min) but slow wash-out from brains (2-to-60 min uptake ratio: 2.9). Furthermore, it underwent in vivo metabolic defluorination (1.88% ID/g at 2 min and 9.73% ID/g at 60 min). In contrast, [(18)F]1 displayed high initial brain uptake (5.38% ID/g at 2 min) with rapid wash-out from brains (0.52% ID/g at 60 min 2-to-60 min uptake ratio: 10.3). These results indicate that [(18)F]1 has in vivo kinetics comparable to PET radiopharmaceuticals currently under commercial development, demonstrating that [(18)F]1 is a desirable PET radioligand for Aβ plaque imaging.
