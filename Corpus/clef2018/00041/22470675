CT and 111In-pentetreotide SPECT of hilar ACTH-producing neuroendocrine tumor associated with Cushing's syndrome and massive bilateral adrenal gland hyperplasia. We present the clinical, laboratory, computed tomography (CT), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and histopathological findings of a patient with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) dependent Cushing's syndrome with massive bilateral adrenal gland hyperplasia due to a hilar ACTH-producing well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.
