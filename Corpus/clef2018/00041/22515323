Dual-mode control of PET process in a ferrocene-functionalized [2]rotaxane with high-contrast fluorescence output. The shuttling motion of the ferrocene-functionalized macrocycle between the dibenzylammonium and the N-methyltriazolium recognition sites in a bistable [2]rotaxane, as well as the photoinduced electron transfer process occurring between ferrocene units and the morpholin-naphthalimide fluorescent stopper, can be adjusted not only by acid-base stimuli but also addition-removal of the fluoride anion, along with remarkable, high-contrast fluorescent intensity changes.
