A new high-yield synthetic route to PET CB1 radioligands [11C]OMAR and its analogs. OMAR analogs reference standards and their corresponding desmethylated precursors were synthesized from substituted anilines either in 4 and 5 steps with 27-32% and 24-31% yield, or in 3 and 4 steps with 21-30% and 19-28% yield, respectively. [(11)C]OMAR and its analog radioligands were prepared from their desmethylated precursors with [(11)C]CH(3)OTf through O-[(11)C]methylation and isolated by HPLC combined with solid-phase extraction (SPE) in 50-65% radiochemical yields based on [(11)C]CO(2) and decay corrected to end of bombardment (EOB), with 370-740 GBq/Î¼mol specific activity at EOB.
