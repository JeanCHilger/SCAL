Stability in brain glucose metabolism following brown adipose tissue inactivation in chinese adults. The thermogenesis of BAT is believed to be controlled through some pathways initiated in the brain, though the changes in brain activity among different states of BAT-positive subjects are still unclear. We hypothesized that some significant differences of regional cerebral metabolism between various groups were related to the BAT activities regardless of temperature changes.Relative regional cerebral glucose metabolism was compared between 15 healthy subjects with activated BAT and 30 healthy controls without activated BAT by using a brain FDG-PET scan. A follow-up PET scan was performed to assess metabolic changes of the brain when BAT activity was eliminated by heat exposure.Compared with controls, BAT-positive subjects exhibited lower activity in the inferior parietal lobule, limbic system, and frontal lobe and higher activity in the precuneus before heat exposure. Compared with the BAT elimination status, subjects with activated BAT showed a decreased metabolism in the parietal lobe, frontal lobe, culmen, cingulate gyrus, and sublobar region. Compared with controls, BAT-positive subjects after BAT inactivation had significant hypometabolic areas in the temporal lobe and limbic lobe and hypermetabolic areas in the parietal lobe.Our findings illustrate that changes of regional cerebral metabolism are related to BAT activities regardless of temperature changes. This before-after controlled study supports the finding that the brain responses appear to be active in modulating the metabolic function of BAT activity.
