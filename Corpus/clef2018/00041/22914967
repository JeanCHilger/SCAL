Role of 18F-fluoride PET/CT in the assessment of multiple myeloma: initial experience. The aim of this study was to report our early experience with (18)F-fluoride PET/CT for detecting lesions and evaluate the usefulness of this modality in the assessment of multiple myeloma (MM).(18)F-fluoride PET/CT and (99m)Tc-MDP bone scintigraphy (BS) studies from 7 myeloma patients (4 male and 3 female, mean age 55 years) diagnosed according to standard criteria were reviewed retrospectively. Two reviewers visually and quantitatively analyzed the images and recorded their findings after reaching a consensus. Diagnostic certainty regarding the presence or absence of myeloma lesions was evaluated according to the reference standard consisting of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging and whole-body X-ray.A total of 93 affected areas were definite according to the reference standard. Of these, 83 affected areas (89 %) were identified on (18)F-fluoride PET/CT, whereas 54 affected areas (58 %) were found on BS. Mean SUVmax in the affected areas was 9.8 Â± 3.2 (standard deviation) ranging from 5.0 to 21.2. A total of s17 lesions with bone fracture were also detected by (18)F-fluoride PET/CT and 2 lesions (12 %) were negative on BS.Our result showed that (18)F-fluoride PET was a possible modality to detect areas of lesions in patients with MM.
