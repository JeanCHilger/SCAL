Status epilepticus induced by pentylenetetrazole modulates in vivo [11C]Ro 15-1788 binding to benzodiazepine receptors. Effects of ligands acting at the supramolecular receptor complex. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to investigate, in the living baboon, the in vivo modulation of [11C]Ro 15-1788 binding to benzodiazepine receptors in brain and the changes with ligands acting at the supramolecular complex during status epilepticus induced by pentylenetetrazole. The central type benzodiazepine receptors were labelled in vivo by intravenous injection of [11C]Ro 15-1788. Simultaneous positron emission tomography and electroencephalographic activity recording evidenced a modulation of the brain binding of [11C]Ro 15-1788 during pentylenetetrazole-induced status epilepticus. We investigated the changes in the modulation of radioligand kinetics and in seizure activity after intravenous administration of a benzodiazepine agonist (diazepam, 1.5 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine antagonist (Ro 15-1788, 2 mg/kg), a GABA agonist (progabide, 50 mg/kg) and a ligand of the picrotoxin/barbiturate binding sites (LY81067, 3.5 mg/kg). The results showed that there is an in vivo competitive interaction of pentylenetetrazole with the benzodiazepine receptors, as reflected by the low displacement of [11C]Ro 15-1788 in the first 10 min of the status epilepticus. However, in contrast to diazepam, progabide and LY81067, a dose (2 mg/kg) of Ro 15-1788 that saturates the benzodiazepine receptors was unable to block the seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole. This indicates that the benzodiazepine receptors play only a minor role in the status epilepticus induced by pentylenetetrazole. The contribution of other binding sites within the supramolecular complex is assessed.
