Brain distribution and kinetics of 11C-chlorpromazine in schizophrenics: positron emission tomography studies. The positron emitter 11C (20 minutes half-life) permits the labeling of chlorpromazine (CPZ) and the study of its distribution in humans by external counting. Trace amounts of 11C-CPZ were injected intravenously into 22 schizophrenic patients all untreated for several months with neuroleptics. The brain uptake was 6.04 +/- 1.6% of the injected dose 15 minutes after the injection, and it remained constant for 45 minutes. By positron emission tomography, the drug distribution was shown to be in the gray matter, and such structures as the cortex, caudate nucleus, thalamus and putamen could be identified. This new methodology will be helpful in studying specific receptors in humans in a noninvasive way.
