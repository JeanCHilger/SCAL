Digital subtraction angiography and iodine 123 amphetamine scintigraphy (IMP-SPECT) in the diagnosis of acute and chronic inner-ear hearing loss. Vascular lesions may play a role in the genesis of acute and chronic hearing loss. After exclusion of other causes the vascular status of 33 patients was examined using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for the supra-aortic vessels, and the N-isopropyl-(I-123)p-iodoamphetamine (IMP-SPECT) technique to investigate cerebral blood flow. Not a single case of stenosis affecting the hemodynamics, of a vascular anomaly or of a cerebrovascular perfusion disorder was found.
