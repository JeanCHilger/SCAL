Enteric pathogens in tropical aquaria. A total of 100 tropical aquaria from six pet shops were sampled for the presence of Salmonella, Campylobacter and Aeromonas species. Eight fish tanks contained unusual serotypes of salmonella. None had been used to house terrapins. One hundred and three isolates of Aeromonas species were obtained from 98 tanks. One tank contained Plesiomonas shigelloides. No Campylobacter species were isolated. It is suggested that a tropical aquarium may constitute an infection hazard.
