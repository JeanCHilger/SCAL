High resolution SPECT using divergent geometry. A special-purpose collimator with holes which converge in the plane of rotation has been used together with an IGE 400A gamma camera and STAR computer system in order to achieve high-resolution single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The variation in width and shape of the reconstructed line-spread function with position in the field of view was quantified. A comparison with parallel-geometry SPECT showed an improved resolution and sensitivity.
