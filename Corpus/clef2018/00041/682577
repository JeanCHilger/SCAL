Dentostomella translucida in the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus). Dentostomella translucida, an oxyurid, was found in the small intestine of 39 out of 43 Mongolian gerbils from a research colony and in five pet gerbils in Columbia, Missouri. This discovery established a new host record and a new georgraphic locality for the parasite. Diagnosis of parasitism was best made by direct observation of the nematodes in the host's intestine af necropsy. The average length of males was 10.3 mm, and that of females was 20.3 mm. Parasite numbers in infected animals ranged from to 11, with an average of four. No clinical manifestations of disease were associated with the parasitisms. The prepatent period of infection was determined to be determined to be between 25 and 29 days.
