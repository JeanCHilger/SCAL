Electrophilic 18F from a Siemens 11 MeV proton-only cyclotron. Because more and more PET centres are using small proton cyclotrons there is a renewed interest in methods for the production of electrophilic 18F by proton irradiation of [18O]O2. A method for the routine production of clinically useful quantities of [18F]F2 having a specific activity of 35 Ci/mmol has been developed and implemented using an 11 MeV proton cyclotron and [18O]O2. Based on the yield, purity, reproducibility, and specific activity of [18F]F2 this is the most efficient method reported thus far.
