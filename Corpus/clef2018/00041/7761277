Uptake of DL-3-123I-iodo-alpha-methyltyrosine in recurrent brain tumors. DL-3-123I-iodo-alpha-methyltyrosine (123I-IMT) is a radiopharmacon which concentrates in brain tumors and can be employed in SPECT. We performed 20 studies in 16 patients after neurosurgery for malignant brain tumors (localization of the primary tumor by CT/MRI). Tumor/non-tumor ratios (T/NT) were calculated in ROI-technique. In 17 cases there was a recurrence or tumor remnant. 14/17 were detectable by increased uptake (T/NT 1.43-2.25). The scans were correlated with CT/MRI studies and validated by biopsy (6/14) or follow-up. All 3 patients without recurrence (neuroradiological follow-up over 6-24 months) had a negative scan. 123I-IMT scintigraphy provides complementary information to CT and MRI. In equivocal neuroradiological or clinical cases it may be valuable in the detection of tumor recurrences and allows an earlier onset of therapy.
