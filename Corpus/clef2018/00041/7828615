Evaluation of single-photon emission tomography imaging of supratentorial brain gliomas with technetium-99m sestamibi. Single-photon emission tomography (SPET) with technetium-99m sestamibi (MIBI) was carried out in 61 adult patients with supratentorial expanding brain lesions. Thirty-one patients had pathologically proven malignant glioma. Ten patients had pathologically proven low-grade glioma, while another 12 patients had a clinical diagnosis of low-grade glioma. The other eight patients had a variety of lesions including radiation necrosis (3), abscess (2), ischaemic stroke (2) and primary brain lymphoma (1). SPET was performed 15 min after administration of 740-930 MBq MIBI and transverse, sagittal and coronal views were reconstructed. Using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging guidance, a MIBI uptake index was computed as the ratio of counts in the lesion to counts in the contralateral homologous region. In high-grade gliomas, the MIBI index ranged from 1.9 to 6.6 (mean 3.6 +/- 1.4) whereas it ranged from 0.8 to 1.7 (1.1 +/- 0.2) in the pathologically proven low-grade group (P < 0.01). No significant difference was found between the two low-grade groups (1.1 +/- 0.2 vs 1.1 +/- 0.2). No overlap was found between high-grade and low-grade glioma index values. Patients with suspected radiation necrosis, cerebral abscess or ischaemic stroke did not demonstrate high MIBI uptake (0.9-2.2), whereas one patient with brain lymphoma did (3.9). This study suggests that MIBI SPET imaging is of value in distinguishing low-from high-grade supratentorial gliomas in adults.
