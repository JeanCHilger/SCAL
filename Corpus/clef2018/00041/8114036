Evidence for genetic involvement in feline dilated cardiomyopathy. Quantitative genetic evaluation of clinical dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) was conducted in a large cattery with known history. Data showed that clinically affected cats were significantly more interrelated than randomly chosen case-control populations from the same colony. The results of this study suggest that quantitative inheritance, either interactive with or independent of nutrition or presently unknown factors, is involved in feline dilated cardiomyopathy.
