Fluorodeoxyglucose PET of abdominal and pelvic neoplasms: potential role in oncologic imaging. Fluorine-18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) was used to image 38 patients with known or suspected malignant processes involving the abdomen or pelvis (including primary [n = 2] and secondary [n = 19] liver tumors, recurrent colon carcinoma [n = 1], lymphoma [n = 15], and cavernous hemangioma [n = 1]). PET results were compared with those from concurrent computed tomographic (CT) studies. Conspicuity of metastatic liver lesions on PET images often exceeded that of lesions on CT scans. Two well-differentiated primary liver tumors failed to show increased FDG uptake. Thirteen of the 15 patients with lymphoma had active disease, as determined with CT or clinical findings 12 of 13 had increased FDG uptake on PET images. The false-negative result occurred in a patient with a low-grade lymphoma. The recurrent colorectal lesion was well demonstrated by PET, but further study is needed to determine whether it can be used to distinguish recurrent disease from radiation-induced changes. PET may be useful in determining the response to oncologic therapy, but PET does not reliably allow exclusion of low-grade lymphoma or well-differentiated hepatic lesions. Clinical correlation is always required in evaluating the significance of PET findings, as inflammatory conditions can also result in increased FDG uptake.
