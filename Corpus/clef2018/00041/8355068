Rapid back to back adenosine stress/rest technetium-99m teboroxime myocardial perfusion SPECT using a triple-detector camera. Technetium-99m-teboroxime is characterized by a high extraction fraction over a wide range of blood flow rates, rapid myocardial clearance and avid hepatic uptake. This study determined the imaging parameters and examined the clinical efficacy of a rapid back to back adenosine stress/rest teboroxime myocardial perfusion SPECT protocol using a triple-detector camera. Acquisition parameters were determined using cardiac phantom studies which were then applied in SPECT studies of 51 catheterized patients (22 with prior myocardial infarction) and 20 patients with a "low" (7.9% +/- 4.3%) likelihood of coronary artery disease. Technetium-99m-teboroxime (20-25 mCi) was injected at the third minute of adenosine infusion. Teboroxime (20-25 mCi) was also injected at rest, 15 min later. Stress followed by rest SPECT were completed within 25 min using a triple-detector camera and sequential, 1-min continuous rotations in alternating directions. Summed raw data from the first to second (1-2 min), second to third (2-3 min) and second to fifth (2-5 min) minutes of imaging following stress teboroxime injection were reconstructed and compared for image quality, degree of liver interference, and accuracy for diagnostic efficacy. In a subgroup of 30 patients, 2-8-min summed images were also reconstructed to compare this more conventional imaging protocol with our rapid acquisition. Image quality was fair to good in 75% of the 1-2-min, 84% of the 2-3-min and 2-5-min studies and 53% of the 2-8-min scans. The frequency of severe liver interference appeared to increase with the duration of imaging time (1-2 min: 3% 2-3 min: 7%
