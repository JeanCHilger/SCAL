Metabolism in non-ischemic myocardium during coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. Blood flow and metabolism in non-ischemic myocardium were studied at baseline and during occlusion and reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in closed chest dogs using positron emission tomography. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) and oxygen consumption (MVO2) in non-ischemic tissue were each increased by 28% relative to the rate pressure product during occlusion, consistent with increased work to compensate for the dyskinetic segment. MVO2 in non-ischemic sectors remained elevated relative to the rate pressure product early (1-2 h) post-reperfusion, 21% above baseline, but subsequently normalized. When sectors with normal blood flow during occlusion were divided into sectors adjacent to and remote from the risk zone, MBF in the 2 sector groups was similar at all times, but metabolic differences were found. MVO2 was depressed by 15% in adjacent relative to remote sectors 1 day post-reperfusion, with a concomitant 62% increase in glucose metabolic rate relative increases in glucose metabolism were found only when glucose metabolism was low in remote myocardium, suggesting a decreased suppressibility of glucose metabolism in adjacent myocardium. The kinetics of (1-11C] palmitate were also altered in adjacent sectors, consistent with a small increase in esterification relative to oxidation of long chain fatty acids. Thus, sectors adjacent to ischemic segments show metabolic changes similar to those seen in reversibly injured post-ischemic tissue, despite normal blood flow during occlusion.
