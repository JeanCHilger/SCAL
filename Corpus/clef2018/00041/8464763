The "white hole" phenomenon--a potential functional parameter in non-gated 201Tl-myocardial scintigraphy. In 50 patients with a "white hole" in their scintigram--among them 44 patients with a history of myocardial infarction--the relation between its relative volume and the ventriculographically determined ejection fraction was studied retrospectively. A relative volume of the "white hole" larger than 13.7% showed a specificity of 93% and a sensitivity of 45% for a decreased ejection fraction and had a significant correlation of r = -0.54 (alpha = 0.01) with the ejection fraction. Thus the relative volume of the "white hole" derived automatically from 201Tl-SPECT is an easy-to-determine additional parameter which allows an at least semiquantitative statement about the function of the left ventricle.
