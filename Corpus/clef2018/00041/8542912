Remote cortical dysfunction as a possible cause of subcortical neglect? A regional cerebral blood flow study. Cortical remote effects of right deep-seated lesions were studied with two cerebral blood flow measurement methods (two-dimensional xenon-133 inhalation and 99mTc HMPAO SPECT) in a population of 13 right-handed stroke patients. A neuropsychological battery of tests suitable for assessment of possible visual neglect was performed. Neglect was present in 7 cases. A regional cortical hypoperfusion was observed in all patients. However, in neglect patients it was more extended and involved the right inferior parietal region suggesting a causal relationship between cortical dysfunction and neuropsychological deficit. This finding supports the model attributing neglect to a unilateral attention-arousal defect in a cortico-limbic-reticular loop.
