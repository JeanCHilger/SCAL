Adenosine technetium-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion SPECT in women: diagnostic efficacy in detection of coronary artery disease. This study sought to assess the diagnostic efficacy of adenosine technetium-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in a consecutive series of female patients.The utility of adenosine myocardial perfusion SPECT for the detection of coronary artery disease is not well defined in women because most studies have described a predominantly male population with a high prevalence of coronary artery disease.Of the 201 consecutive female patients in the study group who had undergone adenosine Tc-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion SPECT, 130 had coronary angiography within 2 months of the nuclear test, and the other 71 had a low likelihood (<10%, mean [+/-SD] 5 +/- 3%) of coronary artery disease. The SPECT protocol used separate acquisition of rest thallium-201 and adenosine Tc-99m sestamibi and was visually analyzed in 20 segments with a semiquantitative five-point scoring system (0=normal 4=absent uptake).The normalcy rate in patients with a low likelihood of coronary artery disease was 93% (66 of 71). Among the catheterized group, the overall sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of adenosine sestamibi SPECT for detecting coronary artery disease (> or = to 50% diameter stenosis) were 93% (87 of 94), 78% (28 of 36) and 88% (115 of 130), respectively. In the 103 patients without a prior myocardial infarction, the sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy were 91% (61 of 67), 78% (28 of 36) and 86% (89 of 103), respectively, for detecting > or = to 50% diameter stenosis. Of particular interest, the sensitivity and specificity were as high in patients with nonanginal symptoms (93% and 69%, respectively) as in patients with angina (92% and 83%, respectively, p=NS). The sensitivity and specificity among patients with a relatively low (<25%), intermediate (between 25% and 75%) or high prescan likelihood of coronary artery disease (>75%) were similar: 82% and 82%, 93% and 73%, and 95% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting individual diseased vessels (> or = to 50% diameter stenosis) were, respectively, 76% and 81% for the left anterior descending coronary artery, 44% and 90% for the left circumflex coronary artery and 75% and 77% for the right coronary artery.Adenosine Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT is an efficient protocol with high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of coronary artery disease in women irrespective of presenting symptoms or pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease and a high normalcy rate. These findings are of particular clinical relevance because chest pain, anginal or otherwise, has been shown to be a frequent but a less specific marker for coronary artery disease among female patients.
