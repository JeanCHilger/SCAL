Comparison of chloral hydrate and midazolam for sedation of neonates for neuroimaging studies. In a crossover study of seven term neonates who had neuroimaging studies, chloral hydrate (75 mg/kg administered orally) was more efficacious (p<0.05) but similar with regard to toxic effects than midazolam (0.2 mg/kg administered intravenously). Thus newer drugs are not necessarily better, and monitoring is essential even after a single oral sedative dose.
