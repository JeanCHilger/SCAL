A new method for measurement of both regional cerebral blood flow and distribution volume using N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) and SPECT. We developed a new method (functional IMP SPECT) to quantitate both regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and distribution volume (Vd) using 123I-IMP and SPECT based on a 2- compartment model (influx K1 =rCBF and outflux
