201Tl myocardial SPECT. First experiences with a simultaneous transmission-emission acquisition protocol for patient-specific attenuated correction. In this study our first clinical experiences with simultaneous transmission and emission acquisition in 201 TI myocardial SPECT (T/E-SPECT) are discussed.The non-uniform attenuation (AK) was carried out with a triple-head camera (PRISM 3000, Picker Inc.) correction equipped with fanbeam collimators. A line source of 750 MBq 99mTc was used to construct the transmission profile. Prior to investigation patients got 80-120 MBq 201TI-chloride intravenously injected.The study comprises the evaluation of 40 patients, derived from the clinical routine. The investigation followed an usual one day protocol. Our results using T/E-SPECT reveal an almost equilibrated activity distribution between anterior and posterior myocardial wall.For this reason it is to be expected that T/E-SPECT provides more reliable information about the posterior myocardial wall, than the usual SPECT technique without attenuation correction.
