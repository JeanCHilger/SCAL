Planning and spatial working memory: a positron emission tomography study in humans. Previous work with both neurosurgical and neurodegenerative patient groups has suggested that high level planning is mediated by neural circuitry which includes both the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. In this study, the functional anatomy of cognitive planning was investigated further, using positron emission tomography (PET). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in 12 normal volunteers while performing easy and difficult versions of (i) a modified Tower of London planning task (ii) a mnemonic variant of this task that required short-term retention and reproduction of problem solutions
