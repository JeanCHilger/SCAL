Echo-planar MR determination of relative cerebral blood volume in human brain tumors: T1 versus T2 weighting. Maps related to relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were generated with the use of the T1 effects produced by a low-dose bolus passage of gadopentetate dimeglumine. The T1 maps were evaluated in a tumor population and compared with rCBV maps obtained with T2-weighted measurements.Imaging was performed in 19 patients with suspected intraaxial brain tumors. For the T1 rCBV maps, a low-dose bolus of contrast material was given during T1-weighted interleaved spin-echo echo-planar MR imaging. This was followed by a second injection during serial T2-weighted imaging for generation of the T2 rCBV maps.Among patients with low-grade lesions (n = 9), T1-based and T2-based rCBV maps showed comparably low rCBV in 7 subjects. In the other 2 patients, with confirmed tumor dedifferentiation, elevation of rCBV values was seen on maps obtained with both techniques. Among patients with high-grade tumors (n = 10), 4 had no evidence of recurrence and 6 did have tumor recurrence (confirmed by follow-up and positron emission tomography). In patients with the high-grade lesions exhibiting conventional contrast enhancement, lesions tended to have higher estimated values on T1 rCBV maps than on the T2 rCBV maps.Although the T1 rCBV maps showed less contrast as compared with the T2 rCBV maps, they provided diagnostic information that was comparable to the T2 rCBV maps in our series of 19 patients with primary brain tumors.
