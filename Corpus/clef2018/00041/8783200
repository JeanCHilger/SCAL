In vivo striatal binding of the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 is not modified by changes in dopaminergic transmission. The in vivo striatal binding of [3H]SCH 23390, an antagonist of the D1 dopamine receptors, was investigated in mice submitted to pretreatment to either decrease (gammabutyrolactone 750 mg/kg, i.p.) or, increase (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) 200 mg/kg i.p. plus dexamphetamine 4 mg/kg, s.c.) dopaminergic transmission. Such conditions failed to modify [3H]SCH 23390 binding. However, we observed that dopamine (at concentrations > or = 1 microM), reduced the in vitro binding of [3H]SCH 23390 in membrane fractions. These results suggest that modifications in dopamine neurotransmission do not alter the in vivo quantification of D1 receptors with [3H]SCH 23390, for example, in studies that use positron emission tomography.
