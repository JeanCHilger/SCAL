Tetrofosmin: a new compound labeled with 99mTc for the study of myocardial perfusion. Correlations with coronary anatomy in patients with suspected ischemic cardiopathy. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of quantitative one-day exercise-rest 99mTc tetrofosmin tomography in the identification of patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) and in the detection of single stenosed coronary vessels. Sixty-one patients with suspected CAD and submitted to coronary angiography were examined. All patients were given 2 i.v. injections of 99mTc tetrofosmin, one at peak exercise (370 MBq) and the other (1110 MBq) at rest 3 hours after exercise (images 15-30 min after injection for both studies). All patients with CAD (> or = 50% luminal stenosis) (n = 50) had abnormal 99mTc tetrofosmin tomogram (100% sensitivity). Only one patient without CAD had abnormal 99mTc tetrofosmin tomogram (91% specificity). Overall sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy in the detection of single stenosed vessels were 77%, 93% and 85%, respectively. No significant differences among single vascular areas were observed. Sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy in the identification of single stenosed coronary vessels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the patients with single-vessel disease (n = 21) than in those with multivessel disease (n = 29). Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy in detecting single diseased vessels were similar in the patients without (n = 26) and in those with previous myocardial infarction (n = 35). The results of this study demonstrate that quantitative one-day exercise-rest 99mTc tetrofosmin SPECT imaging is a suitable and accurate technique to identify patients with suspected CAD and to detect single stenosed coronary vessels.
