Trabecular bone architecture in female renal allograft recipients--assessed by computed tomography. Osteopenia with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) is a frequent finding in renal allograft recipients. Data concerning the bone architecture in these patients do not exist, however.We compared the bone architecture of 33 randomly assigned women (age 49 +/- 12 years), who had received renal allografts 5.6 +/- 5.3 years before the investigation, with 74 women (age 50 +/- 14 years) who were admitted for osteodensitometry. All patients underwent single-energy computed tomography (SEQCT) and a midvertebral high-resolution tomography with computer-assisted analysis of the trabecular vertebral body architecture.Progressive alteration of bone architecture was associated with increasing vertebral height loss of the vertebral body. Height reduction of a vertebral body of more than 15% was associated with a significantly lower BMD (-2.3 +/- 0.8 versus -1.1 +/- 1.1 standard deviations below normal BMD), a lower trabecular bone area (13 +/- 8% versus 42 +/- 22%) and a lower trabecular diameter (1.4 +/- 0.5 mm versus 2.2 +/- 0.8 mm) compared to recipients without height reduction. In comparison to a matched group of patients with similarly reduced BMD (1.1 +/- 1.2 versus 1.2 +/- 1.1 SD below normal BMD), renal allograft recipients showed a lower number of trabecular plates (5.6 +/- 3.1 versus 7.0 +/- 3.7) and a smaller intertrabecular surface (54 +/- 116 mm versus 75 +/- 138 mm).Alterations of bone architecture in renal allograft recipients were associated with progressive vertebral height loss. Despite similar bone mineral density, differences of bone architecture could be observed between renal allograft recipients and patients with osteoporosis.
