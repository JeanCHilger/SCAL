A method for the quantification of benzodiazepine receptors by using 123I-iomazenil and SPECT with one scan and one blood sampling. Iodine-123-iomazenil (Iomazenil) is a ligand of central type benzodiazepine receptors for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Previously we reported a simple, table look-up method for quantification of its binding potential (BP) by using two SPECT scans and calibrated standard input function with one blood sampling. This method is based on a two-compartment model (K1: influx rate constant k2: efflux rate constant
