Regional methionine and glucose uptake in high-grade gliomas: a comparative study on PET-guided stereotactic biopsy. Gliomas are regionally heterogeneous tumors. The local relationship between histologic features and radiotracer uptake evaluated by PET should therefore influence analysis and interpretation of PET results on gliomas. This study explored this local relationship as a result of PET guidance of stereotactic biopsies.Local histology was confronted to the regional uptake of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) and 11C-methionine (11C-MET) in 14 patients with high-grade glioma diagnosed during a procedure of PET-guided stereotactic biopsies. We analyzed the uptake of both tracers in regions of interest centered on the stereotactic coordinates of 93 biopsy samples.A semiquantitative analysis revealed a significant regional correlation between 11C-MET and 18F-FDG uptakes. Uptake of both tracers was significantly higher on the site of tumor samples showing anaplastic changes than in the rest of the tumor. Presence of necrosis in anaplastic areas of the tumor significantly reduced the uptake of 11C-MET.PET with 11C-MET and 18F-FDG may help to evaluate, in vivo, the metabolic heterogeneity of human gliomas. Anaplasia is a factor of increased uptake of both tracers, but microscopic necrosis in anaplastic areas influences their uptake differently. This finding probably relates to the differences in tracer uptake by non-neoplastic components of necrotic tumors. These results underline the complementary role of 18F-FDG and 11C-MET for the study of brain tumors and favors their use for stereotactic PET guidance of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.
