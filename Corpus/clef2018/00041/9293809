Acetazolamide challenge and technetium-99m-ECD versus iodine-123-IMP SPECT in chronic occlusive cerebrovascular disease. We compared the acetazolamide challenge test using 99mTc-ECD SPECT and 123I-IMP SPECT images in patients with chronic occlusive cerebrovascular disease. We also evaluated the usefulness of linearization correction for acetazolamide challenge test of 99mTc-ECD SPECT.Twenty patients with unilateral chronic occlusive cerebrovascular disease (10 patients had middle cerebral arterial lesion and 10 had internal carotid lesion) were included in the study. Split-dose (a dose fractioning was 1:2), and sequential SPECT technique was used for 99mTc-ECD SPECT studies while only acetazolamide challenge test studies for 123I-IMP SPECT were performed. Permeability surface area product model (PS model) and back-diffusion model (Lassen's correction) were used for linearization correction of acetazolamide challenge with 99mTc-ECD SPECT.Six of 16 patients with reduced vasodilatory capacity in 123I-IMP SPECT were underestimated by 99mTc-ECD SPECT acetazolamide challenge test. Relative ECD uptake normalized by cerebellar uptake compared with IMP uptake showed a nonlinear relationship, indicating relatively less uptake in high flow range. The underestimations of limited vasodilatory capacity observed in 99mTc-ECD SPECT without linearization correction was modified by linearization algorithm. However, the effect of correction based on PS model was superior than that of Lassen's correction. The corrected 99mTc-ECD uptake ratio, based on PS model, and IMP uptake ratio demonstrated a better linear relationship than that of Lassen's correction.Technetium-99m ECD SPECT corrected based on the PS model is a better method of linearization for evaluating cerebrovascular reserve using acetazolamide challenge.
