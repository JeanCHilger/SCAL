Effects of insulin on blood flow and volume in skeletal muscle of patients with IDDM: studies using [15O]H2O, [15O]CO, and positron emission tomography. Exaggerated vasoconstriction and blunted vasodilation of peripheral resistance arteries to various vasoactive agents characterize patients with IDDM. We characterized the hemodynamic effects of insulin in skeletal muscle in patients with IDDM. Muscle blood flow and blood volume were measured basally and during a high-dose insulin infusion (5 mU x kg(-1) x min[-1]) in seven normotensive patients with IDDM (age, 30 +/- 6 years BMI, 24.5 +/- 2.0 kg/m2
