Reduction in accumulation of plaque, stain, and calculus in dogs by dietary means. We conducted 215 evaluations for plaque, stain, and calculus in 120 dogs at two research sites. Dogs were balanced in groups of five according to baseline plaque index scores groups were randomly assigned to treatment or control dietary regimens. Dental cleanings were done on Day 0. Dogs in the treatment group were fed a food formulated to reduce accumulation of plaque, stain, and calculus. Control group dogs were fed a commercially available dry dog food. No other foods, treats, or snacks were given to either group. We graded 22 teeth for plaque accumulation on Day 7 and for stain and calculus accumulation on Day 21. Six trials were conducted and the results reported as a combined mean for all treatment and control groups. Dogs fed the treatment food had significantly less plaque, stain, and calculus accumulation (p = 0.001) than dogs fed the control food. Plaque, stain, and calculus accumulation can be reduced by dietary means.
