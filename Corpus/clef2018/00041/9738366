Value of (F18)-2-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scanning in staging mouth cavity carcinoma. Comparative evaluation of PET findings before and after preoperative radiochemotherapy with histological and computerized tomography findings. The lack of sensitivity and specificity of conventional imaging techniques based on morphological critera is responsible for considerable limitations in the staging and surveillance of oral cancer. Therefore, this study investigates the contribution of [F18]-2-fluordesoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) to tumor management with special regard to lymphnode involvement and therapeutic monitoring after radiotherapy.Prospective observational study.Twenty-one patients with advanced oral cancer, predominantly T3/T4.FDG-PET scans before and after preoperative radio(chemo)therapy. Standardized uptake values (SUV) were determined for the tumor site and lymphnode areas. PET scans were correlated to histological findings after ablative tumor surgery.FDG-PET yielded superior sensitivity and specificity for tumor and lymphnode assessment. The effect of radiotherapy was reflected by the metabolic activity of the tumor, which shows a close correlation between the decrease of FDG uptake and histologic tumor regression. PET detected distant metastases and simultaneous tumors.FDG-PET is a challenging imaging technique with the potential to improve staging procedures for oral cancer. In the monitoring of metabolic activity of the tumor in the course of radio(chemo)therapy, FDG-PET allows objective measurement of the treatment response.
