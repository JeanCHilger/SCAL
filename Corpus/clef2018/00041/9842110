Regulatory aspects of diets, supplements, and nutraceuticals. The number of pet foods commercially available for veterinary use, both complete diets and dietary supplements, has been rapidly expanding in recent years. Veterinarians use and recommend nutritional products in their daily practice, and this use should meet the ethical constraints of veterinary medical practice and be based on scientifically sound premises. However, it is also important to be aware that nutritional products intended to treat or prevent disease or to affect the structure or function of the body in a manner apart from what is normally ascribed for food are considered "drugs" under the law. Most of the "veterinary medical foods" and "nutraceuticals" on the market bear claims on the labels or in promotional literature that would establish intent as drugs, but under the current regulatory conditions, they have done so without meeting the criteria needed for most drugs. Thus, the lack of government oversight of therapeutic claims places the burden onto the veterinarian to carefully scrutinize products for safety and efficacy.
