L-Arginine normalizes coronary vasomotion in long-term smokers. Noninvasive measurements of myocardial blood flow (MBF) with PET revealed an abnormal coronary vasomotor response to cold pressor test in healthy long-term smokers. If coronary endothelial dysfunction accounted for this abnormality, we hypothesized that it could be reversed by L-arginine as the substrate for NO synthase.MBF was quantified with 13N-labeled ammonia and PET in 11 healthy smokers (age, 45+/-10 years 27+/-10 years of smoking) and in 12 age-matched nonsmokers on 2 separate days. On day 1, MBF was measured at rest and, after intravenous L-arginine, during cold pressor test. On day 2, MBF was measured during cold pressor test and then at rest during L-arginine. Baseline rate-pressure product (RPP) (6559+/-1590 versus 7144+/-1157 bpmxmm Hg) and MBF (0.65+/-0.14 versus 0.73+/-0.13 mL x g-1 x min-1) were similar in nonsmokers and smokers. Cold pressor test increased RPP similarly in both groups (53+/-26% versus 46+/-26%), whereas MBF increased in nonsmokers (to 0.93+/-0.25 mL x g-1 x min-1Our findings implicate the coronary endothelium as the major site of the abnormal vasomotor response in long-term smokers. Cold pressor test combined with PET imaging may allow the noninvasive identification of coronary endothelial dysfunction in humans.
