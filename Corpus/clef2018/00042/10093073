Prone SPET scintimammography. Prone single photon emission tomography (SPET) was performed in 24 patients with suspected primary or recurrent breast cancer to determine if this technique offers more accurate imaging than that obtained from planar scintimammography. All patients were imaged on a specially designed couch with two cushion inserts. The first insert was lined with lead and was used to perform prone lateral planar scintimammography 5 min after the injection of 740 MBq 99Tcm-MIBI. The second insert did not contain lead and was used to perform a prone SPET acquisition for 30 min immediately after planar imaging. The results of both studies were read independently and there was agreement between the two techniques in 23 cases (96%). All cases of cancer proven on histology were found on planar imaging, but a 4-mm ductal cancer was missed on prone SPET. This was thought to be due to activity from this medial cancer being obscured by the star artefact produced by back-projection reconstruction from activity in the heart. There were two false-positive studies with both techniques. However, prone SPET enabled better localization and characterization of breast cancers than planar imaging. Prone SPET imaging of the breast produces results similar to prone lateral imaging and may be used instead of planar imaging if a reduced total acquisition time is desirable. Care must be taken when reading scans in the presence of small tumours near the heart when back-projection reconstruction techniques are used.
