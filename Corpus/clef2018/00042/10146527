Update in nuclear cardiology. Imaging techniques for the noninvasive detection and evaluation of coronary artery disease continue to develop.  New techniques for the quantification of myocardial blood flow by positron-emission tomography, new approaches to metabolic imaging, and new gamma camera technology have the potential to expand the scope of cardiac nuclear medicine in many facilities.  Determination of the best and most cost-effective method of assessing myocardial viability in patients with advanced coronary artery disease remains of key interest with research directed at alternative  201Tl imaging protocols, fatty acid metabolism, and viability assessment with the new 99mTc-based myocardial perfusion radiopharmaceuticals.  The assessment of endothelial function and determination of coronary flow reserve with  13N-ammonia positron-emission tomography may aid in the identification of preclinical atherosclerosis, and in monitoring disease progression and response to therapy.  New information in radionuclide perfusion imaging in young and elderly patients and in those with interventricular conduction disturbances may allow for more accurate identification of coronary artery disease.  The role of radionuclide imaging in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy continues to evolve with the development of radiolabeled chemicals of the adrenergic nervous system and their analogues, which will be helpful in the stratification of disease severity.  These new imaging techniques promise to increase the accuracy of nuclear cardiology for detection of disease, assessment of function, and prognosis.
