Analysis of the peritoneal equilibration test in Mexico and factors influencing the peritoneal transport rate. To validate the peritoneal equilibration test (PET), establish reference values in the Mexican population, compare our results with those reported by Twardowski et al., and analyze the influence of some factors on the peritoneal transport rate (PTR).Retrospective, cross-sectional study.Eighty-six PETs were performed in 45 female and 41 male patients 35 of the patients were diabetics. Creatinine D/P and glucose D/D0 ratios were calculated and compared with those from Twardowski et al. In a multivariate analysis, age, gender, diabetes mellitus (DM), time on dialysis, and peritonitis rate were considered as independent factors influencing the PTR.Creatinine D/P and glucose D/D0 ratios at 4 hours were not significantly different from those reported by Twardowski et al. Creatinine D/P at 4 hours was not different between DM and non-DM patients when the rate of peritonitis and time on dialysis were not taken into account. Multivariate analysis did not result in any significant model predicting the creatinine D/P at 4 hours.PET validation is reported for the first time in a Latin American population. The PET results of this study are similar to those in the literature. We found that DM, peritonitis rate, time on dialysis, age, and gender did not clearly influence the PTR.
