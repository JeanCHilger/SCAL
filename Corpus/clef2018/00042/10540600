The role of quantitative ictal SPECT analysis in the evaluation of nonepileptic seizures. Nonepileptic seizures may represent difficult diagnostic problems. Identifying their presence and frequency is critical for determining appropriate treatment. The authors investigated the value of quantitative perfusion changes as measured by ictal single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) difference images in differentiating nonepileptic from epileptic seizures. Eleven patients with a clinical suspicion of nonepileptic events had ictal and interictal technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine SPECT scans during continuous audiovisual surface electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. The authors analyzed perfusion difference images based on registration, normalization, and subtraction of ictal and interictal SPECT images. The difference images were registered to each patient's magnetic resonance imaging scan to anatomically localize ictal perfusion changes. Three of 11 patients also carried the diagnosis of epilepsy and were taking antiepileptic medication. Five patients were taking antiepileptic drugs, but the diagnosis of epilepsy was not confirmed. In all patients, continuous video EEG monitoring revealed no ictal EEG findings. In nine of these patients, visual interpretation of ictal SPECT was suggestive of localized increased (n = 6) or decreased perfusion (n = 3). In all patients, however, no blood flow changes were noted on quantitative SPECT analysis with injections performed during the seizure-like event, suggesting the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. The authors' results suggest that quantitative ictal SPECT analysis is a useful tool in the diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures.
