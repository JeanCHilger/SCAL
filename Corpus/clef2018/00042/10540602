Single-photon emission computed tomography of the dopamine transporter in parkinsonism. The known dopaminergic abnormalities in Parkinson's disease have facilitated the development of radiolabeled biomarkers for diagnostic and research applications in humans. Presynaptic, intrasynaptic, and postsynaptic imaging now is possible using single-photon emission computed tomography. In particular, the development of new radiotracers that target the dopamine transporter located on degenerating dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease and related disorders is directly relevant to improved clinical diagnosis, disease monitoring, and assessment of putative neuroprotective strategies in patients. In addition, the ability to characterize in vivo neuronal degeneration in these disorders provides a powerful research tool to better understand the natural course of these disorders and could provide clues to etiology.
