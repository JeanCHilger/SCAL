Transmyocardial revascularization with CO2 laser in patients with refractory angina pectoris. Clinical results from the Norwegian randomized trial. The purpose of the study was to evaluate clinical effects, exercise performance and effect on maximal oxygen consumption (MVO2) of transmyocardial revascularization with CO2-laser (TMR) in patients with refractory angina pectoris.Transmyocardial laser revascularization is a new method to treat patients with refractory angina pectoris not eligible for conventional revascularization. Few randomized studies comparing TMR with conventional treatment have been published.One hundred patients with refractory angina not eligible for conventional revascularization were block-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive continued optimal medical treatment (MT) or TMR in addition to MT. The patients were evaluated at baseline and at three and 12 months with end points to symptoms, exercise capacity and MVO2.Transmyocardial laser revascularization resulted in significant relief in angina symptoms after three and 12 months compared to baseline. Time to chest pain during exercise increased from baseline by 78 s after three months (p = NS) and 66 s (p < 0.01) after 12 months in the TMR group, whereas total exercise time and MVO2 were unchanged. No significant changes were observed in the MT group. Perioperative mortality was 4%. One year mortality was 12% in the TMR group and 8% in the MT group (p = NS.)Transmyocardial laser revascularization was performed with low perioperative mortality and caused significant symptomatic improvement, but no improvement in exercise capacity.
