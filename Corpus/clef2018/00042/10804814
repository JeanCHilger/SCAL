A role of nuclear medicine in diagnosing cardiac disease--clinical use of 123I-BMIPP and 123I-MIBG. There are many new nuclear methods in diagnosing cardiovascular disease. We present about 2 nuclear diagnosing methods. One is about 123I-BMIPP and the other 123I-MIBG. 123I-beta-methyl iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid(123I-BMIPP) is the tracer to evaluate the metabolism of a fatty acid of the heart. A combination of perfusion and fatty acid imagings indicates the recovery of cardiac wall motion can be expected in acute myocardial infarction in zones where 123I-BMIPP decreased uptake is greater than 201T1 perfusion defect. In angina pectoris, especially in unstable angina, 123I-BMIPP may be available to detect myocardial ischemia. 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine(123I-MIBG) is the trace that be able to assess the heart with sympathetic innervation. 123I-MIBG scintigraphy is a useful noninvasive method for the assessment of not only myocardial ischemia but also the degree of congestive heart failure. Also, it is a useful in assessment of beta-blocker therapy.
