Design and development of a radioactive gas monitoring system in the positron emission tomography center. This paper presents experiences in developing a simple, inexpensive radioactive gas monitoring system that proved to be practical and useful at a clinical and research Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Center. The system is described from four key aspects: (1) design of radiation detectors and calibrations (2) use of an existing PC-based hospital-wide facility management network
