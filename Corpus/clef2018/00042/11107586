Brain functional imaging using magnetoencephalography. Neuromagnetism, the study of neural function by the measurement of magnetic fields, is a new, quickly developing branch of science. Magnetoencephalography is the measurement of weak magnetic fields generated by neuronal activity in the human brain. By measuring the magnetic field evoked around the head, a map of the functional organisation of the brain can be deduced with a sub-centimetre spatial resolution and a millisecond temporal resolution. Although MEG has been used since the early 1970 s it is only recently that large multi channel facilities have been combined with sophisticated analysis techniques and Magnetic Resonance Imaging to provide a tool for fundamental study of the brain. The author presents 9 the other functional imaging tools such as Positron Emission Tomography /PET/, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging /fMRI/ et Encephalography /EEG/.
