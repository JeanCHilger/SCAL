Correlation between results of transcranial doppler ultrasonography and SPECT in the brain of patients with ischemic cerebral stroke. Single photon emission computerized tomography /SPECT/ and positron emission tomography /PET/ are used presently for the study of the cerebral blood flow /CBF/. The cost of these procedures limits the possibility of their use and makes them available mainly in large and rich clinical centres. Transcranial Doppler USG has no such drawbacks. The purpose of the present study was analysis of a possible correlation between marker cumulation /in SPECT/ in the vascularization area of the middle cerebral artery /MCA/ and the parameters Vs, Vm, Vd, PI, RI, R of the PUSG-G examination of these arteries in 50 patients aged 48-79 years treated for ischaemic cerebral episodes. Brain SPECT examination was done with Apex-SP-6-HR gamma camera assessing the distribution of 99mTc HMPAO marker in the vascularization area of both MCA. PUSG-D examination was done with Tc-2-64 unit. In both MCA the systolic Vs, the mean velocity Vm, the diastolic velocity Vd, the Gosling pulsation index PI, the Purcelot resistance index RI and the velocity amplitude R were measured. The following conclusions have been reached: 1/ in patients with ischaemic cerebral episodes a significant correlation was found between cerebral SPECT findings and the PUSG-D parameters 2/ reduced perfusion of the cerebral tissue was correlated with lower values of Vs, Vm, Vd, and R and with higher values of PI and RI
