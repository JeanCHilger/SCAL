Brain SPECT in neurology and psychiatry. Structural and functional images of the brain play an important role as powerful adjuncts in the management of an increasing number of neurologic and psychiatric diseases. Brain SPECT, in particular, with perfusion agents or with neuroreceptor imaging radiopharmaceuticals, is rapidly becoming a clinical tool in many places. For many neurologic and psychiatric conditions, this imaging modality has been used in diagnosis, prognosis assessment, evaluation of response to therapy, risk stratification, detection of benign or malignant viable tissue, and choice of medical or surgical therapy. The importance of this technique in nuclear medicine today should not be overlooked, particularly in cerebrovascular diseases, dementias, epilepsy, head injury, malignant brain tumors, movement disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome, schizophrenia, depression, panic disorder, and drug abuse.
