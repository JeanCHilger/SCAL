Tumor uptake of copper-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone): effect of changes in tissue oxygenation. We showed previously that, in vitro, copper-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) (Cu-ATSM) uptake is dependent on the oxygen concentration (pO2). We also showed that, in vivo, Cu-ATSM uptake is heterogeneous in animal tumors known to contain hypoxic fractions. This study was undertaken to confirm the pO2 dependence of this selective uptake in vivo by correlating Cu-ATSM uptake with measured tumor pO2.Experiments were performed with the 9L gliosarcoma rat model using a needle oxygen electrode to measure tissue pO2. Using PET and electronic autoradiography, Cu-ATSM uptake was measured in tumor tissue under various pO2 levels. The oxygen concentration within implanted tumors was manipulated by chemical means or by altering the inhaled oxygen content.A good correlation between low pO2 and high Cu-ATSM accumulation was observed. Hydralazine administration in animals caused a decrease in the average tumor pO2 from 28.61 +/- 8.74 mm Hg to 20.81 +/- 7.54 mm Hg in untreated control animals breathing atmospheric oxygen. It also caused the tumor uptake of Cu-ATSM to increase by 35%. Conversely, in animals breathing 100% oxygen, the average tumor pO2 increased to 45.88 +/-15.9 mm Hg, and the tumor uptake of Cu-ATSM decreased to 48% of that of the control animals. PET of animals treated in a similar fashion yielded time-activity curves showing significantly higher retention of the tracer in hypoxic tissues than in oxygenated tissues.These data confirm that Cu-ATSM uptake in tissues in vivo is dependent on the tissue pO2, and that significantly greater uptake and retention occur in hypoxic tumor tissue. Therefore, the possible use of Cu-ATSM PET as a prognostic indicator in the management of cancer is further validated.
