Electron paramagnetic resonance for small animal imaging applications. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides high-resolution morphological images useful in diagnostic radiology to differentiate between normal and abnormal/pathological states in tissues. More recently, emerging developments in MRI have added a functional/physiological dimension to anatomical images. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), a magnetic resonance technique similar to nuclear magnetic resonance, detects paramagnetic species such as free radicals. Like MRI, EPR can be implemented as an imaging technique for small animals and potentially human applications. Because of the low abundance of naturally occurring paramagnetic species, exogenous paramagnetic species are needed for in vivo EPR imaging (EPRI). The image data from EPRI contain both spatial distribution of paramagnetic species and spectral information. Hence, spatially encoded functional information such as tissue oxygen status and redox status can be extracted and coregistered with the spatial distribution of the spin probe, to the anatomy, or both by suitable means. Ultimately, the images obtained from EPRI may be used to overlay the functional information (containing spatial tissue physiology information) onto detailed anatomical maps. With its ability to enable whole animal imaging in mice, EPRI will be a useful imaging technique that complements other techniques such as MRI and positron emission tomography in obtaining valuable functional/physiological images.
