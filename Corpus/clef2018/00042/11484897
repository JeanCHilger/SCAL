Anatomical distribution and sclerotic activity of bone metastases from thyroid cancer assessed with F-18 sodium fluoride positron emission tomography. Currently, bone scintigraphy (BS) is considered to lack sensitivity in detecting bone metastases (BM) from thyroid cancer. We evaluated the anatomical distribution and metabolic behavior of BM as well as the accuracy of BS with and without combination of whole-body iodine scintigraphy (WBI) in detecting metastatic bone disease in thyroid carcinoma. F-18 positron emission tomography (PET), x-ray, BS, and WBI were performed in 35 patients with known or suspected bone metastases from papillary (9 patients) or follicular (26 patients) thyroid carcinoma. Twenty-two metastases were previously known in 14 patients. The indication was staging in 21 patients with high risk for BM, elevated thyroglobulin (Tg)-levels or evaluation of exact extent of BM (14 patients). In addition, results of WBI (35 patients), X-ray (35 patients) F-18 PET (35 patients), MRI of the spine (13 patients), and FDG-PET (15 patients) as well as the clinical course (1.5-4 years) were correlated. BM were detected in 18 patients. Solitary, bifocal, or multiple lesions were present in 9, 2, and 7 patients, respectively. The anatomical distribution of BM (n = 43) was as follows: spine, 42% skull, 2%
