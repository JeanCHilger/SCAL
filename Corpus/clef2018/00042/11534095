Simultaneous assessment of myocardial perfusion and ventricular function using thallium-201 at rest/Tc-99m tetrofosmin at effort with single-photon emission computerized tomography, synchronized with electrocardiogram (synchronized SPECT). Initial experience in Latin America. Gated SPECT is a useful technique to evaluate myocardial perfusion, wall motion abnormalities and wall thickening. There is not published experience in Latin-America using dual isotope rest Thallium-201/stress Tc-99m Tetrofosmin Gated SPECT.We studied 27 patients with coronary artery disease. Coronary angiography was performed in all the patients. We used an injection at rest of 3 mCi of Thallium-201 followed by stress and the administration of 15 mCi of Tetrofosmin and Gated SPECT acquisition. Five days after, the patients were injected with 20 mCi of Sestamibi at stress, with a second Gated SPECT acquisition. Perfusion data were analyzed using 20 SPECT segment analysis. To study the wall motion, we divided the heart in 29 segments and every segment was scored using a 4 points scale (3 = normal, 2 = mild hipokinesia, 1 = severe hipokinesia, 0 = akinesia).The perfusion and wall motion segmental score agreement between stress Tc-99m tetrofosmin and stress Tc-99m sestamibi were 97% and 84% respectively.Rest Thailium-201/stress Tc-99m Tetrofosmin Dual isotope Gated SPECT technique is a good protocol to assess simultaneous myocardial perfusion and wall motion. There is a good agreement of the results with the use of rest Thallium-201/stress Tc-99m Sestamibi Dual isotope Gated SPECT study.
