Results of coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function. The purpose of this study was to examine the early and late results of CABG in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) lower than 40%. This study comprised 128 patients (114 male and 14 female) at age from 41 to 75 years (mean 58.3 +/- 7.9). Before operation 115 patients (89.8%) were in CCS class III or IV. Before operation in all patients coronary arteriography with left-sided ventriculography were performed. In 12 patients myocardial perfusion in SPECT with Tc-99m-MIBI was assessed. Perioperative mortality in whole group was 12.5% (16 patients). The lowest (9.2%) was in subgroup with LVEF from 0.31 to 0.4 and the highest (27.3%) in patients with LVEF below 0.2. In 8 patients death was caused by low cardiac output, in 4 by ventricular fibrillation, in the others by renal failure or cerebral stroke (2 patients in each). In 45 patients (35.2%) postoperative low cardiac output was observed. In 41 patients was treated with the use of intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP). Twenty seven (65.9%) patients with IABP survived. During follow-up died 5 pts. 24-months probability of survival calculated from Kaplan-Meier method was 82.4%. In follow-up 80.9% of patients were in CCS class I and II. In SPECT, four months after CABG significantly more segments of left ventricle with normal perfusion (45% vs 53% p < 0.05) were observed. Patients with LVEF < 40% are at higher operative risk because of often postoperative low output syndrome. Low output syndrome can by successfully treated with IABP. CABG significantly improves circulatory sufficiency in patients with LVEF < 40%.
