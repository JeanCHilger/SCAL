Adoptive T-cell therapy for the treatment of solid tumours. Solid tumours can be eradicated by infusion of large amounts of tumour-specific T-cells in animal models. The successes seen in preclinical models, however, have not been adequately translated to human disease due, in part, to the inability to expand tumour antigen-specific T-cells ex vivo. Polyclonality and retention of antigen-specificity are two important properties of infused T-cells that are necessary for successful eradication of tumours. Investigators are beginning to evaluate the impact of attempting to reconstitute full T-cell immunity representing both major T-cell subsets, cytolytic T-cells and T-helper (Th) cells. One of the more important and often overlooked steps of successful adoptive T-cell therapy is the ex vivo expansion conditions, which can dramatically alter the phenotype of the T-cell. A number of cytokines and other soluble activation factors that have been characterised over the last decade are now available to supplement in vitro antigen presentation and IL-2. Newer molecular techniques have been developed and are aimed at genetically altering the characteristics of T-cells including their antigen-specificity and growth in vivo. In addition, advanced imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET), are being implemented in order to better define the in vivo function of ex vivo expanded tumour-specific T-cells.
