Efficacy of probiotic feed additives: guidelines for the evaluation of the efficiency of microorganisms in dogs, cats, and horses. Probiotic microorganisms are frequently in use as feed additives for farm and pet animals. For admission for the common market products have to be tested according to the feed additive directive 70/524/EC. The dossier for admission has to comprise data of efficiency as laid down in the directive 87/153/EC. During the last years it became obvious after the evaluation of several dossiers, that no definitive criteria for the assessment of efficacy were available for dogs, cats and horses (84/153/EC). Aspects like the promotion of animal production are not relevant in this context. Therefore, the European commission launched the directive for the evaluation of efficacy of microorganisms for dogs, cats and horses, that supports the evaluation of microbial feed additives and which is described in this paper.
