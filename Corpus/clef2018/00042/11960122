A comparison of nurses' needs/concerns and hospital disaster plans following Florida's Hurricane Floyd. The idea for this study was inspired by the response to Hurricane Floyd. Nurses are relied upon and expected to fulfill responsible roles during disaster situations, but little is known about the needs or concerns that nurses experience when they meet expectations and function as disaster responders.Official copies of disaster protocols from 4 area hospitals were reviewed, and 4 focus groups consisting of ED nurses from respective hospitals provided information about nurses' concerns or needs in response to Hurricane Floyd.Of primary importance to nurses was family safety, pet care, and personal safety while at work. Secondary concerns were basic needs such as food, water, sleep, shelter, and rest. Group commitment levels to providing care during disaster situations varied greatly. Participants requested that hospital policy revisions address work assignments, pay/financial compensation, flexibility for extenuating circumstances, pet care, family sheltering, and provision of basic needs.It is not sufficient for a few key officials and planners to know their roles and responsibilities during a disaster the roles of everyone involved must be clearly understood. Many participants described their conflict as family commitment versus professional obligation. We identified several areas of concerns in our interviews, and those areas have been clearly defined in the revised protocols. Other areas have yet to be addressed.
