Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. This paper summarizes the author's thoughts about the use of cytoreductive surgery combined with intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy (CS-IPHC) for treatment of peritoneal malignant mesothelioma. Pleural malignant mesotheliomas are by far more common (about ten- to thirty-fold) than the peritoneal variants (2.2 cases per 1 million in the US). Other locations (pericardium, tunica vaginalis) are very rare. It is well known that chemotherapy for mesothelioma is largely unsatisfactory, and measurement of treatment responses can be difficult. Single agent responses are all less than 20% with currently available agents for systemically administered drugs. Multiple drug combinations are typically more toxic, and have yielded little consistent demonstrable benefit with major studies reporting median survivals consistently under a year. There is currently more attention being paid to the response category of "stable" or absence of disease progression in concert with quality of life measurements all regimens show poor durability. With peritoneal malignant mesothelioma, malignant ascites is a common presentation and a major factor in disease-related morbidity and mortality. Interperitoneal administration of agents is attractive, but drug distribution is an issue, as are response rates and durability. Multiple treatments are required
