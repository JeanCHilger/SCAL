Oestrogen receptor gene variation is a determinant of coronary reactivity in healthy young men. Oxidised low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) is a determinant of impaired coronary function and oestrogens inhibit its formation probably throughout genetically-variable oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) in artery wall. We hypothesized that the ESR1 polymorphism might influence coronary function and reactivity as measured by positron emission tomography (PET), which allows the detection of coronary dysfunction before appearance of angiographic lesions.Fifty-one healthy young men (aged 35 +/- 4 years), with normal or slightly-elevated serum cholesterol, underwent PET with intravenous adenosine. ESR1 PvuII genotypes P/P, P/p, and p/p in addition to the plasma autoantibody titre against ox-LDL, a marker of in vivo oxidation, were determined.The ESR1 genotype persisted as the only significant predictor of adenosine stimulated coronary flow (P = 0.035) after adjustment for other coronary risk factors. Subjects with P/P genotype had 33.4 and 41.8% lower adenosine-stimulated flow values than subjects with P/p and p/p genotypes (P = 0.030). Furthermore, plasma levels of ox-LDL titre were on average 59 and 77% higher in subjects with P/P genotype than in subjects with P/p or p/p genotypes (P = 0.049).These tentative findings from our pilot study provide evidence that genetic variation in ESR1 may modify coronary reactivity and LDL oxidation and reflect differences in the early pathogenesis of coronary dysfunction in these healthy young men.
