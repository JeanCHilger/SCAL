Epimerization study on [18f]FDG produced by an alkaline hydrolysis on solid support under stringent conditions. Since 1998, routine [18F]FDG syntheses are being carried out by alkaline hydrolysis on a solid support, i.e. the labeled intermediate is trapped on a tC18 solid phase extraction cartridge, purified and finally hydrolyzed within the cartridge, at room temperature, using sodium hydroxide. The present study demonstrated that no epimerization of [18F]FDG to [18F]FDM occurs even when 12 N NaOH is used and when the hydrolysis time is extended up to 1 h. The alkaline hydrolysis on solid support appears to be a simple method leading to [18F]FDG with high purity.
