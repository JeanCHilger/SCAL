Simultaneous PET and NMR. There is currently great interest in combining data from different imaging modalities, either by image registration methods that are performed after the data has been acquired or using new devices that can acquire data from two modalities simultaneously, or near simultaneously. In this paper a small prototype NMR-compatible PET scanner capable of acquiring PET images simultaneously with either NMR images or NMR spectra is described. In an associated paper [1], Pamela Garlick describes some investigations of cardiac metabolism that have been made using this system. One of the main challenges in constructing an NMR-compatible PET scanner is that photomultiplier tubes, which are an essential element of nearly all current PET systems, will not function in a high magnetic field. In collaboration with Simon Cherry and the Crump Institute of Biomedical Imaging at UCLA Medical School, a small (5.4 cm diameter) NMR-compatible PET scanner that will operate within the bore of an NMR magnet has been developed. Long optical fibres are used to transport light from the scintillation crystals that form the detector head to photomultiplier tubes situated in a low magnetic field region several metres from the magnet. This system has been used to perform simultaneous PET and NMR spectroscopy measurements with a 9.4T spectroscopy system, and has also been used to obtain simultaneous PET and MR images in several MRI scanners including a 4.7T small bore animal imaging system. Current efforts in the development of this technology are directed at experimental studies on small animals, both because this is less demanding technically and because it is in this area that applications are likely to appear first. However, there is no reason in principle why human PET-MR would not be feasible. Below, work with the prototype system and the next stage in its development are described, and some of the future possibilities and challenges are discussed.
