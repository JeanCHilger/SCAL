Cerebral uptake and regional distribution of [11C]-vinpocetin after intravenous administration to healthy men: a PET study. Vinpocetine is a compound widely used in the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. The exact mechanism of action of the drug is still not known. The objective of the present investigation was to determine the global uptake and regional distribution of radiolabelled vinpocetine in the human brain. Three healthy persons were examined with positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]-vinpocetine.The uptake of [11C]-vinpocetine in brain was rapid and on average as a maximum 3.7% of the total radioactivity injected was in the brain 2 minutes after radioligand administration. The uptake was heterogeneously distributed among brain regions. When compared with the cerebellum, an a priori reference region, the highest regional uptake was in the thalamus, the upper brain stem, the striatum and the cortex.The brain regions showing increased uptake in the human brain correspond to those in which vinpocetine has previously been shown to induce elevated metabolism and blood flow by PET clinical studies in patients with chronic ischaemic post-stroke condition.
