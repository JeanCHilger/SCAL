Evaluation of 99mTc(V)-DMSA imaging in patients with pharyngolaryngeal carcinoma. To evaluate the value of tumor-seeking agent 99mTc(V)-DMSA in patients with pharyngolaryngeal carcinoma and its biodistribution in human being.Planar and SPECT scintigraphy with 99mTc(V)-DMSA were performed in 12 patients with histologically confirmed pharyngolaryngeal carcinoma. The dynamic distribution in patients was also analyzed.9 cases (11 lesions) showed increased uptake by planar imaging and 11 cases (19 lesions) were clearly demonstrated by SPECT images. Furthermore, distant metastatic lesions were showed in 5 patients. Biodistribution in patients showed the accumulation of 99mTc(V)-DMSA in kidney was significantly greater than other organs.These results could suggested the clinical utility of 99mTc(V)-DMSA, specially with SPECT, for detecting primary pharyngolaryngealcarcinoma and their metastatic lesions (both local and distant). 99mTc(V)-DMSA Tumor-seeking agent Pharyngolaryngeal carcinoma.
