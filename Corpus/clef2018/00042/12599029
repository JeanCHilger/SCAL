PET examination of metastases of somatic carcinomas via the lymphatic system (thyroid gland and breast). We previously showed that advanced visceral cancers (58 rectum cancers) are confined in their pattern of lymphatic spread to one caudocranial regional pathway and never appear in another one, even in cases of local recurrence. We have now investigated PET scan series of 94 somatic cancers (44 thyroid and 50 breast cancers). They too are confined in their pattern of lymphatic spread to paratracheal or ipsi-cervical or axillary pathways. Only when the main pathways are removed or blocked do they then force their way into mediastinal or collar regions. They never affect visceral regions.
