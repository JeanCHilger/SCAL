Clinical outcome and return to sport after the surgical treatment of spondylolysis in young athletes. We studied prospectively 22 young athletes who had undergone surgical treatment for lumbar spondylolysis. There were 15 men and seven women with a mean age of 20.2 years (15 to 34). Of these, 13 were professional footballers, four professional cricketers, three hockey players, one a tennis player and one a golfer. Preoperative assessment included plain radiography, single positron-emission CT, planar bone scanning and reverse-gantry CT. In all patients the Oswestry disability index (ODI) and in 19 the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) scores were determined preoperatively, and both were measured again after two years in all patients. Three patients had a Scott's fusion and 19 a Buck's fusion. The mean duration of back pain before surgery was 9.4 months (6 to 36). The mean size of the defect as determined by CT was 3.5 mm (1 to 8) and the mean preoperative and postoperative ODIs were 39.5 (SD 8.7) and 10.7 (SD 12.9), respectively. The mean scores for the physical component of the SF-36 improved from 27.1 (SD 5.1) to 47.8 (SD 7.7). The mean scores for the mental health component of the SF-36 improved from 39.0 (SD 3.9) to 55.4 (SD 6.3) with p < 0.001. After rehabilitation for a mean of seven months (4 to 10) 18 patients (82%) returned to their previous sporting activity.
