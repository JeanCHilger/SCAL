Three-phase capillary entry conditions in pores of noncircular cross-section. In this work we challenge the assumption that the capillary entry pressures for displacements in three-phase flow are the same as those in two-phase flow. Using an energy balance, as derived by R.P. Mayer and R.A. Stowe (J. Colloid Interface Sci. 20 (1965) 893-911) and H.M. Princen (J. Colloid Interface Sci. 30 (1969) 69-75 30 (1969) 359-371
