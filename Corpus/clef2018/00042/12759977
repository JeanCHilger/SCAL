Efficient expression of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) capsid proteins L1 and L2 in E. coli. To study the expression of HPV16 capsid proteins L1 and L2 in E. coli.The plasmids pET-30a-L1 and pET-30a-L2 were constructed from the pET-30a vector, and transducted into the BL21. The fusion proteins 6 x His-L1 and 6 x His-L2 were expressed when induced by adding of IPTG. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses were used to detect the expressed proteins.Fusion proteins 6 x His-L1 and 6 x His-L2 were expressed efficiently in E. coli, the Mr were about 60,000 and 97,000 respectively, 6 x His-L1 degraded more than 6 x His-L2.L1 and L2 proteins were expressed at a high level in prokaryotic expression system, and 12 protein were more stable than L1 protein.
