Ischemic myocardial injury evaluated using positron emission tomography in children with coronary artery disease: comparison with thallium-201 SPECT. Regional myocardial perfusion and glucose metabolism were evaluated by positron emission tomography (PET) in children with coronary artery disease. Also, PET findings were compared with those of thallium-201 myocardial single photon computed tomography (SPECT). The study patients consisted of 11 children ranging in age from 3 to 14 years. Ten patients had significantly stenotic coronary arterial lesions due to Kawasaki disease, and one patient had a left coronary artery with an anomalous origin from the pulmonary artery. Evaluation was made before and after surgical revascularization in 3 patients. Regional myocardial perfusion was assessed at rest using 13N-ammonia, and regional myocardial glucose metabolism was assessed at rest under fasting conditions using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG). SPECT was performed after dipyridamole infusion. Initial and delayed images were obtained 7 min and 3 hrs after dipyridamole infusion, respectively. Left ventricular myocardial images were categorized as the septal, anterior, lateral, apical, and inferior segments, and evaluation was made for each segment. A total of 70 myocardial segments in 11 patients were classified into 4 groups according to the PET findings: 1) segments with normal perfusion and without enhanced 18FDG uptake (normal segments n = 55), 2) normal perfusion with enhanced 18FDG uptake (metabolically abnormal segments
