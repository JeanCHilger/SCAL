Temporal correlation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate with Tc-99m WBC uptake on children with inflammatory bowel diseases. The goal of this study was to evaluate the temporal correlation of Tc-99m WBC studies with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a commonly used index of intensity of inflammation, in a large population of children with inflammatory bowel diseases. Over a 6-year period, 313 Tc-99m WBC studies were performed and the hospital charts of these consecutive children were reviewed. In each set of scans (0.5-1 hour and 2-3 hours) from the 313 patients, the bowel was divided into 8 segments resulting in 5008 bowel segments for scoring. The intensity of uptake on the planar images was graded on a scale of 0 to 6 and compared with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate obtained within 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year of the Tc-99m WBC scan, when available. A dataset of 508 erythrocyte sedimentation rates was available for computation. In children with Crohn's disease, when erythrocyte sedimentation rate is obtained within 3 days of the Tc-99m WBC scan, the correlation coefficient is R=0.314 (P<0.005), within 1 week R=0.358 (P<0.05), within 2 weeks R=0.254 (P=0.129), within 1 month R=-0.029 (P=0.84), within 3 months R=-0.002 (P=0.989), within 6 months R=0.241 (P=0.145), and within 1 year R=0.068 (P=0.759). In children with Crohn's disease, the uptake of Tc-99m WBC correlates well with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate during the flare of inflammation, and the correlation progressively subsides after a few weeks. No such correlation was noted in children with ulcerative colitis.
