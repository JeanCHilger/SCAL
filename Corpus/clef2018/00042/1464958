A method for measurement of regional cerebral blood flow using N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) SPECT two scans with one point blood sampling technique. We have developed a new method to quantitate regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) using 123I-IMP and SPECT. This technique requires two SPECT scans and one blood sampling. Based on the 2 compartment model (influx k1 and outflux
