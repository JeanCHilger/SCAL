Prevalence of canine cataract: preliminary results of a cross-sectional study. In this study 2000 dogs were examined ophthalmoscopically to determine presence of cataract.The dogs examined were predominantly from veterinary hospital populations but also from the Waltham Center For Pet Nutrition, rehoming charities and breeding kennels. Prevalence of cataract was thus determined for different age groups (year cohorts). The age at which prevalence of cataract was 50% (C50) was determined indirectly from a fitted prevalence curve.The mean +/- standard deviation of C50 for all dogs in the study was 9.4 +/- 3.3 years. All dogs over 13.5 years were affected by some degree of lens opacity. C50 was determined for animals of different genders and different breeds. For dogs of six breeds sufficient data were available for calculation of breed-specific C50. In these dogs C50 was positively correlated with longevity with a least squares correlation coefficient of 0.74.The study yields novel findings regarding the prevalence and incidence of cataract in the dog and forms the basis for considerable further work on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of age-related cataract in the dog.
