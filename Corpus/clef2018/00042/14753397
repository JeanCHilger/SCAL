Non-invasive imaging methods for the characterization of the pathophysiology of brain ischemia. Non-invasive imaging methods are increasingly used to study the evolution and therapy of brain diseases under both clinical and experimental conditions. In the animal experiment, these methods can be supplemented by invasive tissue assays to allow precise characterization of the underlying pathophysiology. Based on such an approach, this review evaluates the importance of in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and positron emission tomography (PET) for the understanding of the pathophysiology of brain ischemia.
