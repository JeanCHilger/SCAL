Dopamine transporter imaging with novel, selective cocaine analogs. RTI-121 and RTI-122 are 3 beta-substituted phenyltropane analogs of cocaine that have high, selective binding affinity for dopamine transporters. [123I]RTI-121 and [123I]RTI-122 bind to dopamine transporters in vivo after intravenous administration and permit imaging of the transporters.
