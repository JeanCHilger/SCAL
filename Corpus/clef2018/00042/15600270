A rapid screening technique for feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions. The feline odontoclastic resorptive lesion (FORL) status (presence or absence of odontoclastic resorptive lesions) of 423 clinically healthy cats was determined based on radiographic findings in a series of full mouth radiographs (eight views). This status was compared with the FORL status based on evaluation of only two views, namely the right and left mandibular premolar and molar views. Using the FORL status of the right and left third mandibular premolars (307 and 407) alone correctly predicted overall FORL status in 93.4 per cent of cats. The sensitivity of the new technique (FORL cases correctly diagnosed as positive by the test) was 78.5 per cent, while the negative predictive value (negative FORL cases correctly diagnosed by the test) was 91.3 per cent. Overall FORL status can therefore be confidently diagnosed in nine out of 10 cats by assessing FORL status in just two teeth (307 and 407) using two films, which has benefits for the cat (less anaesthetic time and reduced exposure to radiation) and the owner (reduced cost of screening).
