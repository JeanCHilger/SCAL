Cerebral single-photon emission-computed tomography. A semiquantitative analysis of vascular areas in patients with cerebrovascular pathology. Brain SPECT perfusion studies in patients with cerebral stroke may be useful to evaluate distant perfusion abnormalities.99mTc-HMPAO brain SPECT studies were performed in 17 patients with ischemic lesions in the basal ganglia and/or internal capsule demonstrated by NMR. Regions of interest were adjusted in representative transverse slices to the vascular territories of the anterior, middle, posterior and communicating cerebral arteries.Patients with ischemic lesions in the right basal ganglia showed increased cerebral perfusion in the left middle artery territory (0.95 +/- 0.13 versus 0.80 +/- 0.06 p = 0.0365). Patients with ischemic lesions in the left basal ganglia showed increased perfusion in the right anterior artery territory (0.93 +/- 0.09 versus 0.82 +/- 0.09These results show the presence of delayed luxury perfusion phenomena in regions distant from the ischemic site.
