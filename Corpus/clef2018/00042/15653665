The promise of immuno-PET in radioimmunotherapy. Immuno-PET as a quantitative imaging procedure before or concomitant with radioimmunotherapy is an attractive option to improve confirmation of tumor targeting and especially assessment of radiation dose delivery to both tumor and normal tissues. General information about PET, PET systems, and quantification is provided in this review. The requirements for an appropriate positron emitter and characteristics of the most attractive candidate emitters for immuno-PET are discussed. An overview of preclinical and clinical immuno-PET studies reported in the literature is provided.
