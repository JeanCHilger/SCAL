Assessment of ejection fraction by cardiovascular magnetic resonance in comparison with 99mTc gated SPECT. Impaired left ventricular (LV) function with decreased ejection fraction (EF) is a frequent finding in patients with ischaemic heart disease. As a non-invasive method, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become an important diagnostic method in cardiology within the past decade, especially for assessing myocardial function.The purpose of this study is to compare EF estimated with 99mTc gated SPECT (GSPECT) and with CMR.The study was performed in a group of 35 patients (11 F, 24 M mean age 57 SD 10) after myocardial infarction. EF in CMR procedure was calculated using cine gradient echo sequences. GSPECT measured EF was estimated by Tc 99.The mean value of EF measured with scintigraphy was 50.5 +/- 17%, and measured with CMR 48.3 +/- 15%. The difference in mean values of EF was not statistically significant.1. EF in CMR was highly concordant with GSPECT. 2. The mean value of EF measured with CMR in 75% of study patients was smaller than in the scintigraphy group, but the difference was not statistically significant. 3. CMR is a simple, precise and reproducible diagnostic method for monitoring left ventricle systolic function, and which is an additional non-invasive imaging technique in cardiac diagnosis.
