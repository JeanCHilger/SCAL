The magnetic resonance Matas test: Feasibility and comparison with the conventional intraarterial balloon test occlusion with SPECT perfusion imaging. To evaluate a new MR Matas test that uses a form of contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA) with temporary manual occlusion of the common carotid artery whose internal carotid artery (ICA) is to be permanently sacrificed.The MR Matas test was performed on eight patients using an open type MR imager (Signa Profile 0.2 Tesla ver. 7.5, GE-YMS, Tokyo, Japan). Conventional balloon occlusion Matas test and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain were performed in all cases within a week before or after the MR Matas test.The MR Matas test was successful in all eight patients without any complications. The image quality of the MR Matas test was generally sufficient to confirm cross-flow from the patent side to the occluded side in comparison with selective intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (IADSA) except in one case.Brain perfusion information using MR Matas test is comparable to brain SPECT.
