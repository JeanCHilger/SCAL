Comparison between PET-CT and MRI in diagnosing nodal metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Nodal metastasis pattern of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) influences treatment planning. This study was to compare the diagnostic value of integrated positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) with that of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting nodal metastasis of NPC, and explore the regulation of nodal metastasis of NPC.Clinical data of 105 NPC patients, treated in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University from Jun. 2003 to May 2004, were analyzed. All patients underwent PET-CT and MRI. Findings of PET-CT and MRI were evaluated with the results of follow-up. Distribution of metastatic nodes in different nodal groups was assessed.Among the 105 patients, nodal metastasis patterns shown on PET-CT and MRI were diverse in 35 patients. Thirty cervical nodes were positive on PET-CT, but negative on MRI 25 of them were later confirmed positive by follow-up. Thirty-seven cervical nodes were negative on PET-CT, but positive on MRIThe diagnostic accuracy of PET-CT in detecting nodal metastases of NPC is better than that of MRI. The nodal metastases of NPC reveal a decreasing frequency along the jugular chain. Both retropharyngeal and level II nodes are the first-echelon nodes of NPC.
