Detection of hibernate myocardium by 99mTc sestamibi gated SPECT during low-dose dobutamine infusion plus nitrate in patients with first acute myocardial infarction. To investigate the role of Tc-MIBI gated SPECT imaging following the administration of low-dose dobutamine plus nitrate (LDD+nitrate) in the assessment of left ventricular function and the perfusion of hibernate myocardial tissue.The study group comprised 29 patients diagnosed as having acute myocardial infarction. In the first month post-infarction, Tc-MIBI gated SPECT imaging was performed in all patients at rest-dobutamine stress and LDD+nitrate. Ejection fraction, end diastolic volume (EDV), end systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume, volume, extent score, and reversibility score values were calculated.The findings of Tc-MIBI gated SPECT imaging following the administration of LDD+nitrate and the rest Tc-MIBI gated SPECT findings revealed that while the levels of ejection fraction (P=0.004) and reversibility score (P=0.000) increased significantly, there was a significant decrease in EDV (P=0.001), ESV (P=0.001), volume (P=0.017), stroke volume (P=0.257) and extent score (P=0.039) values.The use of Tc-MIBI gated SPECT concomitantly with the administration of LDD+nitrate is useful in the determination of myocardial hibernation in patients with left ventricular failure following acute myocardial infarction.
