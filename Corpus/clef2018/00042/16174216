Positron emission tomography application for gynecologic tumors. Positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG), which originated as a research tool to evaluate glucose metabolism in cancer tissues, has now become an essential imaging modality for determining the appropriate therapeutic management of various cancer patients. The clinical role of FDG-PET for gynecologic tumors has not been established yet, but FDG-PET has come to be considered one of the important imaging modalities for evaluating patients with gynecological cancers. The objective was to review the literature regarding the utility of FDG-PET in the clinical setting of gynecological malignancies. Many articles reported that FDG-PET could be used for staging and restaging in patients with uterine cervical cancer. Although there is limited data about the feasibility of FDG-PET for endometrial cancer, preliminary results for detecting recurrence were promising. Furthermore, FDG-PET has been reported as a useful imaging modality, especially for restaging, in ovarian cancer, although the prognostic value needs to be fully investigated. Currently, a combined PET/computed tomography scanner is available, and its clinical application has begun. It is expected that this modality will contribute to the management of gynecological cancers, as has been reported recently for other malignancies.
