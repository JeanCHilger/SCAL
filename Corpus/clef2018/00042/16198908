Detection of a mesenchymal tumor responsible for hypophosphatemic osteomalacia using FDG-PET. We report a case of oncogenic osteomalacia (OO) in a 71-year-old man. The tumor, which was localized in the left lower mandible, was not found by CT, MRI, or 111-indium octreotide scintigraphy but was easily detected by FDG-PET. The use of this technique in OO has never been reported.
