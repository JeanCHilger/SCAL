Positron emission tomography in oncourology. The authors present the results of the examination of 61 patients with genitourinary space-occupying lesions, using 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) in whole body mode. In all cases the diagnosis was verified morphologically. The results demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy of PET, including possibility to determine the extent of oncourological cancer. However, the method displays poor efficacy in cases of hypernephroid cancer due to low level of glycolysis in this type of tumor.
