Positron emission tomography of monoaminergic vesicular binding in aging and Parkinson disease. The type-2 vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) might serve as an objective biomarker of Parkinson disease (PD) severity. Thirty-one subjects with early-stage PD and 75 normal subjects underwent continuous intravenous infusion of (+)-[(11)C]dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to estimate the striatal VMAT2 binding site density with equilibrium tracer modeling. Parkinson disease patients were evaluated clinically in the practically defined 'off' state with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HY), and the Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale (SE). In normal subjects there was age-related decline in striatal DTBZ binding, approximating 0.5% per year. In PD subjects, specific DTBZ binding was reduced in the caudate nucleus (CD -44%), anterior putamen (-68%), and posterior putamen (PP
