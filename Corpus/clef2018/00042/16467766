Long term outcome of birth asphyxiated infants. Fifty eight neonates who survived birth asphyxia were prospectively studied in the department of Paediatrics, Dhaka Medical College Hospital, to see the incidence of long term neurodevelopmental sequelae among them and also to identify possible risk factors. All of them had been admitted in the Neonatal Unit of this hospital and were born between July 1997 & December 1999. After discharge from the hospital, the study infants were followed up at the Child Neurology Clinic of this hospital. They were seen at 6 weeks. at 3 months & then every 3 months upto 2 years of age for evaluation of growth and development (age corrected for prematurity for preterm babies) 69% of them were boys and 31% were girls. 74% of the babies were inborn in the same hospital & the rest were out born. Prolonged labour (24%) and PET (18.96%) were the most common obstetric factors & respiratory distress (38%) and neonatal convulsion (35%) were the important neonatal complications. Of the 58 enlisted study cases, 30 (51.7%) responded to complete 2 years follow up and the rest were lost. Normal growth and developments were observed in 12 (40%) cases, 7 (23.33%) had mild handicap, 6 (20%) moderate & 5 (16.6%) were left with severe neurodevelopmental handicaps at 2 years of age. 61% of the handicapped children had suffered from neonatal seizure for varying periods. It may be concluded that the response to follow up unsatisfactory, the number of severe handicap was alarmingly high and post asphyxiated seizure was associated with poor outcome. So prevention of perinatal asphyxia should be targeted. Further long term follow up study is required.
