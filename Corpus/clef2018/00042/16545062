Expression of Chlamydia trachomatis inclusion membrane protein genes IncB and IncC in Escherichia coli. In this study, we have cloned the Chlamydia trachomatis genes incB and incC into the expression plasmid vectors from pET series for the subsequent isolation of recombinant proteins. As a result, we have obtained the first full-length recombinant C. trachomatis proteins IncB and IncC, which can be used for following antibody production and for study of their protein-protein interaction.
