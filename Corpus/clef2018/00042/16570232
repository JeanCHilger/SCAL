Adrenocortical carcinoma -- improving patient care by establishing new structures. Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare and highly malignant tumour with a poor prognosis. Patients present with signs of steroid hormone excess (e.g., Cushing's syndrome) or symptoms due to an abdominal mass.In case of an adrenal mass, hormonal workup before surgery is required for differential diagnosis, perioperative management, and for follow-up. The imaging of choice is CT or MRI with MRI being of additional use when invasion of big vessels is suspected. Apart from that, the use of 18-FDG-PET is becoming increasingly established.Surgical resection is the therapeutic option of choice in stages 1 - 3. In stage 4, the adrenolytic compound mitotane is part of the first-line treatment, but often needs to be combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Most patients will eventually have a recurrence, so adjuvant treatment (mitotane/tumour bed radiation) has to be considered in high risk patients, even if randomized controlled trials on adjuvant treatment are still lacking. STRUCTURAL PROGRESS: Several national and European structures have recently been established in order to increase our knowledge of ACC, improve therapeutic options and diagnostic procedures, and promote research. GANIMED, as a Germany-wide network of experts on adrenal diseases, has been founded allowing for improved gathering of data and joint studies. ENSAT (European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumours) has been brought to life, aiming at European standards for therapy, diagnosis and tumour banking. Since 2003, patients can be enrolled in the German ACC Registry. France and Italy have also developed a central registry to collect nationwide data from patients with ACC. For the first time, patients with metastatic/unresectable ACC can participate in a prospective controlled randomized trial comparing two different cytotoxic chemotherapy regimes (FIRM-ACT).
