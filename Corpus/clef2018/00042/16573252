Introduction to working with Animal Assisted Crisis Response animal handler teams. Animal Assisted Crisis Response (AACR) is a discipline closely related to Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT), which gives crisis intervention teams, counselors, clergy, and other trained professionals an additional means with which to help people affected by crisis. AACR is a relatively new field, but can be effective when utilized as part of an overall incident response program. AACR teams can be used, for example, to establish rapport, build therapeutic bridges, normalize the experience, and act as a calming agent or as a catalyst for physical movement. Effective AACR requires a common language between the AACR teams and crisis counselors. The training requirements, versatility, limitations, and establishment of AACR teams are also addressed.
