A meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphic scoring system increases accuracy in the diagnostic management of pheochromocytoma. As observed by other authors, normal adrenal medullary tissue frequently gives an apparently positive meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan in cases studied using 123I-MIBG and less frequently 131I-MIBG. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of a scoring system, based on different uptakes of the radiopharmaceutical, to improve the accuracy of 123I-MIBG scintigraphy in patients with either adrenal or extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. Charts from 67 consecutive patients (29 males and 38 females, median age 48 years, range 14-80 years) with suspected pheochromocytoma (either sporadic or familial: multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2a, MEN2b, Von Hippel-Lindau, neurofibromatosis type 1) who underwent 123I-MIBG scintigraphy (scans acquired 4-24 h after injection) from 1991 to 2004, were independently reviewed by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians using liver uptake as a reference (scores: 1, uptake absent or less than the liver 2, equal to the liver
