Simultaneous assessment of cardiac perfusion and function using 5-dimensional imaging with Tc-99m teboroxime. Dynamic single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) acquisition and reconstruction of early poststress technetium 99m teboroxime washout images has been shown to be useful in the detection of coronary disease. Assessment of poststress regional wall motion may offer additional use in assessing coronary disease. Our goal was to investigate the feasibility of simultaneously imaging myocardial ischemia and transient poststress akinesis using gated-dynamic SPECT.A gated-dynamic mathematical cardiac torso (MCAT) phantom was developed to model both teboroxime kinetics and cardiac regional wall motion. A lesion was simulated as having delayed poststress teboroxime washout together with a transient poststress wall motion abnormality. Gated projection data were created to represent a 3-headed SPECT system undergoing a total rotation of 480 degrees . The dynamic expectation-maximization reconstruction algorithm with postsmoothing across gating intervals by Wiener filtering, and the ordered-subset expectation maximization reconstruction algorithm with 3-point smoothing across gating intervals were compared. Compared with the ordered-subset expectation maximization with 3-point smoothing, the dynamic expectation-maximization algorithm with Wiener filtering was able to produce visually higher-quality images and more accurate left ventricular ejection fraction estimates.From simulations, we conclude that changing cardiac function and tracer localization possibly can be assessed by using a gated-dynamic acquisition protocol combined with a 5-dimensional reconstruction strategy.
