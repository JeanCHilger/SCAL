Workplace exposure to bioaerosols in pet shops, pet clinics, and flower gardens. The present study evaluated exposure to bioaerosols at three different types of facilities (pet shops, pet clinics, and flower gardens) by measuring the bacterial, fungal and/or PM(10) concentrations in indoor and outdoor air. Regardless of the season, the total bacteria and total fungi were detected for all samples, whereas the fungal genera were not. The bioaerosol concentrations measured in the flower gardens were significantly higher than those of the pet shops and pet clinics. The mean microbial concentrations at the three types of facilities were close to or exceeded the Korean indoor bioaerosol guidelines (800 CFU m(-3)), thus suggesting the need for remedial action regarding indoor microorganisms, in order to reduce the exposure at the surveyed facilities. Another suggestion was that contrary to the airborne microbes, flower gardens are not an important microenvironment for PM(10) (particulate matter 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter) exposure. Two temporal characteristics (seasonal variation and the summer survey period) were important regarding exposure to airborne microbes, depending upon the type of facility surveyed, microbial or sample types, whereas the sampling time of the day was not. The microbial concentration ratio of indoor air to outdoor air depended upon the facility and season.
