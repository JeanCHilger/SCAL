Intraoperative visualization for resection of gliomas: the role of functional neuronavigation and intraoperative 1.5 T MRI. To investigate how functional neuronavigation and intraoperative high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) influence glioma resection.One hundred and thirty-seven patients [World Health Organization (WHO) grade I: 20 II: 19Intraoperative MRI showed primary complete resection in 27% of all patients (I: 50% II: 53%The combination of intraoperative MRI and functional navigation allows safe extended resections in glioma surgery. However, despite extended resections, still in the majority of the grade III and IV gliomas no gross total resection could be achieved owing to the extension of the tumor into eloquent brain areas. Intraoperative MRI data can be used to localize the tumor remnants reliably and compensate for the effects of brain shift.
