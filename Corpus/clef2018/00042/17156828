The positron emission tomography with F18 17beta-estradiol has the potential to benefit diagnosis and treatment of endometrial cancer. The positron emission tomography (PET) with F18 17beta-estradiol (FES) has good imaging for assessment of estrogen receptor in breast cancer.We report on a 30-year-old woman who desired to preserve her fertility with well-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma. Before hormone treatment was started, FES-PET showed increased uptake of endometrium, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed thickness and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET showed increased uptake. FES-PET after 3 months showed remaining FES uptake, but there were no abnormal findings on MRI and FDG-PET. Hysteroscopy showed remaining adenocarcinoma. After additional treatment, FES-PET showed a therapeutic response, and hysteroscopy showed no abnormal finding.To our knowledge, this is the first report that FES-PET has the potential to provide more useful information than did FDG-PET about the hormone therapy.
