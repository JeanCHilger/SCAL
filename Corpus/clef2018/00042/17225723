Association between alcohol consumption and skin prick test reactivity to aeroallergens. A few studies have indicated a positive association between consumption of alcohol and allergic sensitization in age and socioeconomically heterogeneous populations.To investigate the association between consumption of alcohol and allergic sensitization in a young homogenous population of high social class (a group with a suspected high prevalence of sensitization).A total of 1,668 students aged 18 to 35 years recruited from universities in Copenhagen, Denmark, underwent skin prick testing (SPT) in October or November 2002 and completed a questionnaire about respiratory disease and lifestyle habits, including alcohol consumption. SPT positivity was defined as a positive reaction (> or =3 mm) against at least 1 of 10 common inhalant allergens.Before and after adjustment for sex, age, smoking, atopic predisposition, and pet keeping, no significant association was found between alcohol consumption (including type of beverage) and SPT positivity. Increasing alcohol consumption was significantly negatively associated with asthma symptoms and hay fever symptoms.Alcohol consumption does not favor SPT positivity, but cumulated effects were not addressed in the present study. Individuals with asthma or hay fever symptoms seem to reduce alcohol intake (a healthy drinkers' effect).
