Hybrid braided 3-D scaffold for bioartificial liver assist devices. Three-dimensional ex vivo hepatocyte culture is a tissue-engineering approach to improve the treatment of liver disease. The extracorporeal bioartificial liver (BAL) assists devices that are used in patients until they either recover or receive a liver transplant. The 3-D scaffold plays a key role in the design of bioreactor that is the most important component of the BAL. Presently available 3-D scaffolds used in BAL have shown good performance. However, existing scaffolds are considered to be less than ideal in terms of high-density cultures of hepatocytes maintaining long-term metabolic functions. This study aims to develop a 3-D hybrid scaffold for a BAL support system that would facilitate high-density hepatocyte anchorage with long-term metabolic functions. The scaffolds were fabricated by interlacing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers onto the polysulfone hollow fibers utilizing a modern microbraiding technique. Scaffolds with various pore sizes and porosities were developed by varying braiding angle which was controlled by the gear ratio of the microbraiding machine. The morphological characteristics (pore size and porosity) of the scaffolds were found to be regulated by the gear ratio. Smaller braiding angle yields larger pore and higher porosity. On the other hand, a larger braiding angle causes smaller pore and lower porosity. In hepatocyte culture it was investigated how the morphological characteristics (pore size and porosity) of scaffolds influenced the cell anchorage and metabolic functions. Scaffolds with larger pores and higher porosity resulted in more cell anchorage and higher cellular functions, like albumin and urea secretion, compared to that of smaller pores and lower porosity.
