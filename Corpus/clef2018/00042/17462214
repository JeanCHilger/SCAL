Recent evidences of the use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the management of colorectal cancer. Positron emission tomography is considered a potentially useful diagnostic tool in the management of a variety of malignancies. It has been used for staging, evaluation of recurrent and metastatic disease, evaluation of tumoral response to neoadjuvant therapy, and providing prognostic information. However, some data are available about its definitive role in the colorectal cancer population. In this review, the most recent evidences and future perspectives are presented for the use of the 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the management of patients with colorectal cancer.
