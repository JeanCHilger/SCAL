Detection of metastases from gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors: prospective comparison of 18F-TOCA PET, triple-phase CT, and PET/CT. The purpose of the investigation was to assess positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT) and the image fusion of PET and CT (PET/CT) in the detection of metastases from gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors. In a prospective study, thirty-one patients were consecutively examined using a state-of-the-art PET/CT. PET was performed with a carbohydrated F-18-labeled somatostatin receptor ligand (Gluc-Lys([(18)F]FP-TOCA) from the base of the skull to the proximal thigh using a Pico-3D PET scanner. CT was performed with a noncontrast low-dose CT (LD-CT) and a venous-dominant contrast-enhanced CT (VD-CT) from the base of the skull to the proximal thigh and a hepatic arterial-dominant contrast-enhanced CT (AD-CT) from the epigastric region using a 16-slice CT. The data sets from PET and CT (LD-CT and VD-CT) were fused automatically. To assess a relative sensitivity of each imaging modality, the total number of metastases by summing the number of metastases depicted for each patient by the highest sensitive modality was used as reference standard. PET, LD-CT, AD-CT, VD-CT, PET/LD-CT and PET/VD-CT showed a lesion-by-lesion based overall detection rate for liver metastases (n=858) of 90.8% (P<0.001), 29.4% (P<0.001), 45.5% (P<0.001), 73.9% (P<0.001), 91.5% (P<0.001) and 100%. PET, LD-CT, VD-CT, PET/LD-CT and PET/VD-CT showed an overall detection rate for lymph node metastases (n=193) of 93.8% (P<0.001), 25.4% (P<0.001), 64.8% (P<0.001), 93.8% (P<0.001) and 100% and for osseous metastases (n=567) of 98.6% (P<0.005), 40.7% (P<0.001), 40.7% (P<0.001), 100% and 100%. Furthermore, PET revealed 2 (22.2%) of 9 intrapulmonal lesions seen on LD-CT, VD-CT, PET/LD-CT and PET/VD-CT. PET as single modality revealed most liver, lymph node and osseous metastases. The combination of molecular/metabolic with anatomical/morphological information improves the diagnostic accuracy for the detection of metastases in comparison to any single imaging modality. LD-CT cannot replace VD-CT in the detection of liver and lymph node metastases, but was equal in the detection of osseous metastases and identifying of pulmonary lesions.
