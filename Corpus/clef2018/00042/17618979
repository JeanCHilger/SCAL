Monitoring cerebral oxygenation in traumatic brain injury. Ischemia is a common problem after traumatic brain injury (TBI) that eludes detection with standard monitoring. In this review we will discuss four available techniques (SjVO2, PET, NIRS and PbrO2) to monitor cerebral oxygenation. We present technical data including strengths and weaknesses of these systems, information from clinical studies and formulate a vision for the future.
