Roles of single photo emission computed tomography-CT in detecting residual tumor from patients with thyroid carcinoma. As newly, functional, diagnostic measure-18F-deoxyglucose single photo emission computed tomography (18F-FDG SPECT-CT) has well sensitivity and specialty , it was proved availability in differentiating benign and malignant tumor. In this study, it was compared the efficiency of detecting residual tumor of thyroid cancer between 18F-FDG SPECT-CT and CT-TWIN.During May 2004 to August 2004, 56 patients with thyroid disease were divided into two groups, one group was 32 cases suffered thyroid tumor, another was 24 cases suffered improper operation. All cases must take 18F-FDG SPECT-CT and CT-TWIN.Forty eight cases had been performed operation, and 8 cases waited and watched because they didn't be found residual tumor by 18F-FDG SPECT-CT and CT-TWIN. The results in detecting thyroid tumor showed that the same rate of diagnostic correction of SPECT-CT was 87.5% (28/32), and the Youden index of SPECT-CT was 0.667, higher than that of CT which was 87.5% (28/32) and 0.633 respectively. When the results two methods were accordant, the rate of diagnostic correction was 100% (24/24), and Youden index was 1, and the result had statistic signification. The rate of diagnostic correction of SPECT-CT in detecting residual tumor was 84.6%, and its Youden index was 0.675. The rate of diagnostic correction of CT in detecting residual tumor was 75.0%, and its Youden index was 0.492 and the result had statistics signification by being compared two different measures.SPECT-CT and CT all had higher diagnostic efficacy, and they could promote the diagnostic efficacy when they have the same diagnosis in detecting thyroid tumor. The rate of detecting residual tumor of SPECT-CT was 81.3%, compared with that of CT the diagnostic efficacy has greater raise.
