Identification and tissue localization of intermediate filament protein in Angiostrongylus cantonensis. To identify the type of the intermediate filament (IF) protein of Angiostrongylus cantonensis and analyze its tissue localization.Recombinant pET-IF of antigen IF was expressed in E.coli with IPTG induction, and the expression products were purified by His.Bind column and identified for determining the type of the IF protein by Western blotting. Anti-IF antibody was prepared by multi-spot subcutaneous injection into mouse and used to detect the tissue slices of A. cantonensis by immunohistochemical analysis.The antigen IF were correctly expressed and purified, and identified as a keratin located in the intestine wall and cytoplusma.The antigen IF is distributed in the intestine wall of A. cantonensis.
