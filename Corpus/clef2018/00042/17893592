Oral cavity cancer. The oral cavity is anterioly located and unique in the variety of tissues contained in this area. Although oral cancer screening may be done on clinical examination, imaging plays a critical role in staging and determination of deep margins for either tumor resectability or radiation planning. This article discusses the relevant anatomy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including the lips and gingiva, floor of mouth, and oral tongue. This is followed by a discussion of standard MRI techniques, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification, and relevant MRI findings with discussion and imaging examples of carcinoma in major sites, including floor of mouth, oral tongue, buccal mucosa, bony upper alveolus, hard palate, and retromolar trigone. A brief summary of newer imaging techniques for evaluation of oral cancer is also presented.
