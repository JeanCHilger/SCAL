Synthesis and evaluation of [123I] labeled iodovinyl amino acids syn-, anti-1-amino-3-[2-iodoethenyl]-cyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid, and 1-amino-3-iodomethylene-cyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid as potential SPECT brain tumor imaging agents. syn- and anti-1-amino-3-[2-iodoethenyl]-cyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (syn-, anti-IVACBC 16, 17) and their analogue 1-amino-3-iodomethylene-cyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (gem-IVACBC 18) were synthesized and radioiodoinated with [(123)I] in 34-43% delay-corrected yield. All these amino acids entered 9L gliosarcoma cells primarily via L-type transport in vitro with high uptake of 8-10% ID/1 x 10(6) cells. Biodistribution studies of [(123)I]16, 17 and 18 in rats with 9L gliosarcoma brain tumors demonstrated high tumor to brain ratios (4.7-7.3:1 at 60 min post-injection). In this model, syn-, anti-, and gem-[(123)I]IVACBC are promising radiotracers for SPECT brain tumor imaging.
