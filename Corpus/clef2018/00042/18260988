The role of multidetector computed tomography in detection of myocardial infarction. The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic value of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in detection of myocardial infarction (MI) in acute and chromic stages.49 patients with suspected MI were included in the study. In 44 patients the diagnosis of acute MI had been confirmed according to standard criteria. Contrast-enhanced MDCT of the heart and vessels was performed with 4-row MDCT scanner.MDCT detected areas of MI in 39 of 44 patients with proven MI. In 66,7% of cases they were transmural and in 33,3% -- subendocardial. In arterial phase the density of infarcted area was significantly lower than in normal myocardium (mean, 32,6 +/- 3,7 HU versus 101,9 +/- 3,7 HU, correspondingly, p < 0,0001). Mean values of myocardial density in the area of the MI did not change during follow-up (32,6 +/- 3,7 HU vs 41,3 +/- 4,5 HU, ns). In comparison to SPECT, sensitivity and specificity of MDCT in detection of transmural MI were 96,9% and 100%. corr. In the whole group of patients, taking results of troponin test as a gold standard, the sensitivity of MDCT in detection of Q-MI and non-Q MI were 89,1% and 93,5%, correspondingly.Cardiac MDCT can reliably detect and localize areas of acute and chronic MI. Contrary to SPECT, it also gives information about stenosis and occlusions in the coronary arteries.
