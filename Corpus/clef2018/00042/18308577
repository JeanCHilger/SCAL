Imaging and dosimetry of 99mTc EC annexin V: preliminary clinical study targeting apoptosis in breast tumors. Early detection of cellular events is important to predict the outcome of the patients. This study was aimed to use (99m)Tc EC-annexin V to image tumor cells undergoing apoptosis.In 10 patients with breast cancer, scintigraphic images and dosimetric estimates were obtained after administering (99m)Tc EC-annexin V.Nine of the 10 cases showed detectable (99m)Tc EC-annexin V uptake in tumor. Higher values of T/N ratios are associated with patient after treatment.Apoptosis can be quantified using (99m)Tc EC-annexin V.
