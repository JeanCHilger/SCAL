Simultaneous analysis of FDG, ClDG and Kryptofix 2.2.2 in [18F]FDG preparation by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. A practical, sensitive and rapid analytical method was established and validated for chemical impurity tests of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG), 2-deoxy-2-chloro-d-glucose (ClDG) and Kryptofix 2.2.2 (K-222) in [18F]FDG. This method was based on precolumn derivatization with ultraviolet (UV) detection. FDG and ClDG were rapidly derivatized with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone in the presence of borate buffer at 40 degrees C, and the labeled derivatives and K-222 were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and monitored by UV absorbance at 210 nm. After optimization of the conditions, FDG, ClDG and K-222 could be determined within 15 min and showed good performance in terms of sensitivity, linearity and reproducibility. This method could be successfully applied to the quality control test of [18F]FDG produced by a commercially available apparatus.
