Clinical influence of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography on the management of primary tumours of the thymus. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of PET on the management of primary tumours of the thymus. Patients with a primary tumour of the thymus who underwent PET were identified from a prospective database. Forty-three PET scans were carried out on 26 patients with primary thymic tumours. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 79, 100 and 85%, respectively. Conventional imaging and PET findings were discordant in 10 cases (23%). PET appropriately changed patient management in three (7.0%) cases based on accurate results that differed from pre-PET imaging. Most PET scans carried out (88%) did not influence clinical management. Patient comorbidities, limited treatment options and already planned surgery are factors that may hinder the effect of PET in the setting of thymic tumours. The potential for false-negative results, probably because of a combination of low-fluorodeoxyglucose avidity and small volume residual disease, needs to be considered in management planning. However, the positive predictive value of PET is high and enables appropriate modification of management in a small, but potentially important subset of patients.
