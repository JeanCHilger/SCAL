The surgery of epilepsy. The idea of surgical treatment for epilepsy is not new. However, widespread use and general acceptance of this treatment has only been achieved during the past three decades. A crucial step in this direction was the development of video electroencephalographic monitoring. Improvements in imaging resulted in an increased ability for preoperative identification of intracerebral and potentially epileptogenic lesions. High resolution magnetic resonance imaging plays a major role in structural and functional imaging other functional imaging techniques (e.g., positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography) provide complementary data and, together with corresponding electroencephalographic findings, result in a hypothesis of the epileptogenic lesion, epileptogenic zone, and the functional deficit zone. The development of microneurosurgical techniques was a prerequisite for the general acceptance of elective intracranial surgery. New less invasive and safer resection techniques have been developed, and new palliative and augmentative techniques have been introduced. Today, epilepsy surgery is more effective and conveys a better seizure control rate. It has become safer and less invasive, with lower morbidity and mortality rates. This article summarizes the various developments of the past three decades and describes the present tools for presurgical evaluation and surgical strategy, as well as ideas and future perspectives for epilepsy surgery.
