Volumes of chronic traumatic frontal brain lesions measured by MR imaging and CBF tomography. The volumes (ml) of chronic traumatic frontal brain lesions were compared measured "morphologically" with MR imaging (T1 and T2 weighted images) and "functionally" with a tomographic rCBF technique (SPECT with 133Xe i.v.). The T1 volumes varied between 11 and 220 ml. The correlation between T1 and T2 volumes was 0.95, the T2 volumes being 33% larger than T1 volumes (p less than 0.001). The functional SPECT volumes were considerably larger (range 16-324 ml) than the MR volumes. The mean volume difference was 81% between T1 and SPECT images (p less than 0.001), and 35% between T2 and SPECT images (p less than 0.001). Correlations between the MR and SPECT volumes were also higher for T2 than T1 volumes. The volume difference is most likely explained by a functional decrease in regions around the lesion in which no morphologic change visible on MR images had taken place. MR and SPECT volume measurements were positively related to persistent lack of energy and personality changes, but only moderately related to duration of impaired consciousness and neuropsychologic outcome.
