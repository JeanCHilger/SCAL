Neuroimaging in pediatric epilepsy: a multimodality approach. Pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy represent a challenging clinical population. However, recent advances in neuroimaging with a multimodality imaging approach that combines fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, magnetoencephalography, diffusion tensor imaging, and magnetic source imaging with conventional magnetic resonance imaging continue to improve diagnosis and treatment in affected patients. These advances are increasing the understanding of the underlying disease process and improving the ability to noninvasively detect epileptogenic foci that in the past went undetected and whose accurate localization is crucial for a good outcome following surgical resection.
