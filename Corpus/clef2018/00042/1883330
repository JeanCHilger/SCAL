Expression of a cDNA clone encoding the haem-binding domain of Chlorella nitrate reductase. A partial cDNA clone coding for the haem-binding domain of NADH:nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1) (NR) from the unicellular green alga Chlorella vulgaris has been isolated, sequenced and expressed. A 1.2 kb cDNA (pCVNR1) was isolated from a lambda gt11 expression library produced from polyadenylated RNA extracted from nitrate-grown Chlorella cells. pCVNR1 hybridized to a 3.5 kb mRNA transcript that was nitrate-inducible and absent from ammonium-grown cells. The entire sequence of pCVNR1 was obtained and found to have a single uninterrupted reading frame. The derived amino acid sequence of 318 amino acids has a 45-50% similarity to higher-plant NRs, including Arabidopsis thaliana, spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). A comparison with the putative domain structure of higher-plant nitrate reductases suggested that this sequence contains the complete haem-binding domain, approximately one-third of the Mo-pterin domain and no FAD-binding domain. A 32% sequence similarity is evident when comparing the Chlorella NR haem domain with that of calf cytochrome b5. Expression of pCVNR1 in a pET vector synthesized a 35 kDa protein that was antigenic to anti-(Chlorella NR) antibody. The spectral properties of this protein (reduced and oxidized) in the 400-600 nm region are identical with those of native Chlorella NR and indicate that haem is associated with the protein.
