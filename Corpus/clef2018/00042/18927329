Clinical correlate of brain SPECT perfusion abnormalities in fibromyalgia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the specific clinical correlate of brain SPECT perfusion abnormalities reported in fibromyalgia.We performed a whole-brain voxel-based correlation analysis involving regional cerebral blood flow and various parameters related to pain (Visual Analog Scale, Tubingen Pain Behavior Scale, and Questionnaire Douleur de Saint-Antoine Scale), disability (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire [FIQ]), and anxiety and depression status (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale) in 20 patients with fibromyalgia (P voxel < 0.005). Ten healthy control women were also included, in order to determine areas of significant hypo- and hyperperfusions in patients.FIQ total score was positively correlated with bilateral parietal perfusion, including postcentral cortex. These clusters of correlation were included in the areas of significant hyperperfusion. FIQ total score was also negatively correlated with perfusion of a left anterior temporal cluster, included in the areas of significant hypoperfusions. No other clinical correlation was observed with regional cerebral blood flow.These results show that brain perfusion abnormalities in patients with fibromyalgia are correlated with the clinical severity of the disease.
