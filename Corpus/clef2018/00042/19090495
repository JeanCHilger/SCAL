Analysis of bone mineral density and bone turnover in the presence of polymethylmethacrylate particles. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particles generated from joint arthroplasties appear to contribute to aseptic implant loosening through inflammation-induced periprosthetic osteolysis. However, osteolysis appears to be multifactorial whether a direct link exists between PMMA particles and osteolysis in vivo is unproven. With the aim to define the relationship between PMMA particles and osteolysis, the authors analyzed the bone mineral density, using microCT scans preoperatively, the first day postoperatively and then every 7-10 days for 32 days, and bone turnover, using (18)F-fluoride positron emission tomography scanner (PET scan) at 8 weeks in four groups of mice that had undergone intramedullary femoral injection. The experimental group of five mice was injected with PMMA particles, and compared with two negative control groups (no injection and injection with the carrier, phosphate-buffered saline) and one positive control group (injection of PMMA particles contaminated with endotoxin). There was no significant change in bone mineral density with addition of PMMA particles, and no evidence of osteolysis. However, bone turnover was increased in the presence of PMMA particles. Even though a direct link between PMMA particles and osteolysis was not found in the short term, PMMA particles appear to influence the regenerative capacity of bone.
