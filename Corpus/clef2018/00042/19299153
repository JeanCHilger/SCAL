A simple Cu-64 production and its application of Cu-64 ATSM. One of the positron emission radionuclides, (64)Cu, has been reported to be a particularly effective radioisotope in PET imaging study. This utility of (64)Cu depends on the chemical stability in water with proper energy and half-life as gamma-emitters. Hence, we tried to develop a simple method for producing this isotope using an old cyclotron model in our site (50MeV, Scantronics co.). In particular, we designed the equipments of enrich (64)Ni plating system and radioactive (64)Cu separation using plastic cartridge column (64)Ni plating system on gold foil which located in the 13 degrees angle target toward beam irradiation. For the nuclear reaction of (64)Cu, it was applied to (64)Ni(p, n) (64)Cu at low energy under the degrader composed of Al and Ta foils. After beam irradiation, (64)Cu was identified by multichannel analyzer installed for a HPGe detector and its utility was certified by the microPET images of (64)Cu-ATSM (CT-26 tumor bearing mouse as reported previously). The image quality of (64)Cu was also very similar to that of (18)F radioisotope in microPET scanner. In conclusion, a method of (64)Cu production and its application was successfully established in old cyclotron having high energy.
