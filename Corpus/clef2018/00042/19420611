High optical switching speed and flexible electrochromic display based on WO3 nanoparticles with ZnO nanorod arrays' supported electrode. The electrochromic (EC) property of WO(3) nanoparticles grown on vertically self-aligned ZnO nanorods (ZNRs) is reported. An electrochromic character display based on WO(3) nanoparticle-modified ZnO nanorod arrays on a flexible substrate has been fabricated and demonstrated. The ZNRs were first synthesized on ZnO-seed-coated In(2)O(3):Sn (ITO) glass (1 cm(2) cell) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (4 cm(2) cell) substrates by a low temperature hydrothermal method, and then amorphous WO(3) nanoparticles were grown directly on the surface of the ZNRs by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. The ZNR-based EC device shows high transparence, good electrochromic stability and fast switching speed (4.2 and 4 s for coloration and bleaching, respectively, for a 1 cm(2) cell). The good performance of the ZNR electrode-based EC display can be attributed to the large surface area, high crystallinity and good electron transport properties of the ZNR arrays. Its high contrast, fast switching, good memory and flexible characteristics indicate it is a promising candidate for flexible electrochromic displays or electronic paper.
