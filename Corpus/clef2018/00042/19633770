Diagnostics of cerebral gliomas with radiolabeled amino acids. Magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) is the investigation of choice for diagnosing cerebral glioma, but its capacity to differentiate tumor tissue from non-specific tissue changes is limited. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) using radiolabeled amino acids add information which helps increase diagnostic accuracy.Review based on the authors' own research results and a selective literature review.The use of radiolabeled amino acids allows better delineation of tumor margins and improves targeting of biopsy and radiotherapy, and planning surgery. In addition, amino acid imaging appears useful in distinguishing tumor recurrence from non-specific post-therapeutic scar tissue, in predicting prognosis in low grade gliomas, and in monitoring metabolic response during treatment.The benefits of amino acid imaging in cerebral gliomas support arguments for its introduction into routine clinical practice in defined clinical situations however, its influence on treatment quality remains to be demonstrated.
