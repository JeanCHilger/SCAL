18F]fluoromethyl-[1,2-2H4]-choline: a novel radiotracer for imaging choline metabolism in tumors by positron emission tomograph. Current radiotracers for positron emission tomography imaging of choline metabolism have poor systemic metabolic stability in vivo. We describe a novel radiotracer, [(18)F]fluoromethyl-[1,2-(2)H(4)]-choline (D4-FCH), that employs deuterium isotope effect to improve metabolic stability. D4-FCH proved more resistant to oxidation than its nondeuterated analogue, [(18)F]fluoromethylcholine, in plasma, kidneys, liver, and tumor, while retaining phosphorylation potential. Tumor radiotracer levels, a determinant of sensitivity in imaging studies, were improved by deuterium substitution tumor uptake values expressed as percent injected dose per voxel at 60 min were 7.43 +/- 0.47 and 5.50 +/- 0.49 for D4-FCH and [(18)F]fluoromethylcholine, respectively (P = 0.04). D4-FCH was also found to be a useful response biomarker. Treatment with the mitogenic extracellular kinase inhibitor PD0325901 resulted in a reduction in tumor radiotracer uptake that occurred in parallel with reductions in choline kinase A expression. In conclusion, D4-FCH is a very promising metabolically stable radiotracer for imaging choline metabolism in tumors.
