Diagnosis of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection using multi-slice spiral CT. To assess the value of multi-slice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) in the diagnosis of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC).A retrospective analysis was conducted in 12 patients with the diagnosis of TAPVC established by MSCT. Multi-planar reconstruction (MPR), curved-planar reconstruction (CPR), volume rendering (VR), maximum intensity projection (MIP) and minimum intensity projection were performed in all the cases, and the results were analyzed in comparison with those of ultrasound echocardiography (12 cases) and surgical findings (10 cases). Cardiovascular angiography was performed in 2 cases.In the 10 patients receiving surgical interventions, 7 presented with supracardiac TAPVC, 2 with cardiac TAPVC, and 1 with infracardiac TAPVC. MSCT allowed qualitative diagnosis and identified the location of the lesions in all the 10 surgical patients, whereas echocardiography established the diagnosis in only 5 patients. In the 2 cases undergoing cardiovascular angiography, the diagnosis was established in only 1 case without clear display of the draining vein.MSCT combined with 3-dimensional reconstruction provides a noninvasive and accurate means for the diagnosis of TAPVC.
