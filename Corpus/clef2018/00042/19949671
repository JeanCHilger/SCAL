Diagnostic efficacy of PET/CT plus brain MR imaging for detection of extrathoracic metastases in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. We aimed to evaluate prospectively the efficacy of positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) plus brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detecting extrathoracic metastases in lung adenocarcinoma. Metastatic evaluations were feasible for 442 consecutive patients (M:F=238:204 mean age, 54 yr) with a lung adenocarcinoma who underwent PET/CT (CT, without IV contrast medium injection) plus contrast-enhanced brain MRI. The presence of metastases in the brain was evaluated by assessing brain MRI or PET/CT, and in other organs by PET/CT. Diagnostic efficacies for metastasis detection with PET/CT plus brain MRI and with PET/CT only were calculated on a per-patient basis and compared from each other. Of 442 patients, 88 (20%, including 50 [11.3%] with brain metastasis) had metastasis. Regarding sensitivity of overall extrathoracic metastasis detection, a significant difference was found between PET/CT and PET/CT plus brain MRI (68% vs. 84%
