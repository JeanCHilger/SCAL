A CCD based approach to collimated photon counting imaging for micro-SPECT/CT. Analog summation methods of x-ray imaging have nonlinearity in signal readout and dynamic range limitations. To minimize these limitations, a photon counting CCD-based gamma camera imaging system has been developed and evaluated.
