Minimal zoonotic risk of cryptosporidiosis from pet dogs and cats. The role of dogs and cats in human cryptosporidiosis has been the focus of much attention. Studies in which genotyping of Cryptospiridium oocysts in feces of dogs and cats have been successful and have demonstrated that most infections in these animals are caused by host-specific C. canis and C. felis, respectively. Most human cases of cryptosporidiosis are associated with C. hominis and C. parvum C. canis and C. felis are responsible for only a small number of cases. Thus, molecular epidemiologic studies support the contention that the risk of zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. from pet cats and dogs is low. Veterinarians can inform their clients of this minimal risk, but nevertheless advise them to minimize contact with pet cat and dog feces.
