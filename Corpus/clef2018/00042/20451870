The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative positron emission tomography core. This is a progress report of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) positron emission tomography (PET) Core.The Core has supervised the acquisition, quality control, and analysis of longitudinal [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) data in approximately half of the ADNI cohort. In an "add on" study, approximately 100 subjects also underwent scanning with [(11)C] Pittsburgh compound B PET for amyloid imaging. The Core developed quality control procedures and standardized image acquisition by developing an imaging protocol that has been widely adopted in academic and pharmaceutical industry studies. Data processing provides users with scans that have identical orientation and resolution characteristics despite acquisition on multiple scanner models. The Core labs have used many different approaches to characterize differences between subject groups (Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, controls), to examine longitudinal change over time in glucose metabolism and amyloid deposition, and to assess the use of FDG-PET as a potential outcome measure in clinical trials.ADNI data indicate that FDG-PET increases statistical power over traditional cognitive measures, might aid subject selection, and could substantially reduce the sample size in a clinical trial. Pittsburgh compound B PET data showed expected group differences, and identified subjects with significant annual increases in amyloid load across the subject groups. The next activities of the PET core in ADNI will entail developing standardized protocols for amyloid imaging using the [(18)F]-labeled amyloid imaging agent AV45, which can be delivered to virtually all ADNI sites.ADNI has demonstrated the feasibility and utility of multicenter PET studies and is helping to clarify the role of biomarkers in the study of aging and dementia.
