Proteomic techniques and activity-based probes for the system-wide study of proteolysis. Proteolysis constitutes a major post-translational modification but specificity and substrate selectivity of numerous proteases have remained elusive. In this review, we highlight how advanced techniques in the areas of proteomics and activity-based probes can be used to investigate i) protease active site specificity ii) protease in vivo substrates
