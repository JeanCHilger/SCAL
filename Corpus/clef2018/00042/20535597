Patients with adenosine-induced ST-segment depressions and normal myocardial perfusion imaging: cardiac outcomes at 24 months. The significance of ischemic ECG changes during adenosine infusion in patients with normal myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is controversial. We evaluated the prevalence of, and defined the predictors for, severe coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with such discordant findings.The findings of 3700 adenosine MPI studies performed at our institution between June 2005 and March 2009 were reviewed.Data for 76 patients who had not previously undergone coronary revascularization and who had sufficient follow-up were analyzed 22 (29%) were referred for coronary angiography and 10 (13%) underwent revascularization. None had left main disease and only three (14%) had multivessel disease. Diabetes mellitus was more prevalent (70% vs. 23%In the presence of normal MPI, the specificity of ischemic ECG changes during adenosine infusion for the detection of severe obstructive CAD is poor, although patients with multiple coronary risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, should undergo further investigation.
