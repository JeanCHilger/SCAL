Characterization of RD-114 virus isolated from a commercial canine vaccine manufactured using CRFK cells. Recently, we found that several commercial pet vaccines were contaminated with an infectious endogenous retrovirus, RD-114-related virus. Here, we determined the entire nucleotide sequences of RD-114-related viruses isolated from CRFK cells and a vaccine manufactured using CRFK cells. These RD-114-related viruses were nearly identical to the authentic RD-114 virus.
