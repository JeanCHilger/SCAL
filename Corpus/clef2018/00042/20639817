Differentiation between peri-anastomotic inflammatory changes and local recurrence following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy surgery for colorectal cancer using visual and semiquantitative analysis of PET-CT data. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of visual and semiquantitative [¹⁸F]fluorodeoxy-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) data for the diagnosis of peri-anastomotic colorectal cancer recurrence, taking into account the time period between surgery and [¹⁸F]FDG PET-CT scanning.The study population consisted of 70 patients who had prior preoperative radiochemotherapy and surgical resection of the primary tumor and who underwent whole body [¹⁸F]FDG PET-CT scanning for the detection of recurrent disease. Visual and semiquantitative (SUV(max)) analysis of [¹⁸F]FDG uptake at the peri-anastomosis was performed. The final diagnosis was based on pathological proof or clinical and/or imaging follow-up data.On visual reading, 27 patients exhibited increased [¹⁸F]FDG uptake at the peri-anastomosis. Of these, 11 (41%) patients had a local tumor recurrence and 16 (59%) had no recurrent tumor. Among the 43 patients without increased [¹⁸F]FDG uptake at the peri-anastomosis, none had local tumor recurrence. On semiquantitation, SUV(max) in patients with and without a local recurrence overlapped. However, when the time period between surgery and [¹⁸F]FDG PET-CT scanning was taken into account, overlap of SUV(max) was mainly observed within a postoperative period of ≤12 months thereafter, a threshold SUV(max) of 3.2 discriminated between benign and malignant lesions in all but one patient.In our series, visually increased [¹⁸F]FDG uptake at the peri-anastomosis was 100% sensitive but non-specific (73% specificity) for the diagnosis of local tumor recurrence. On the other hand, normal [¹⁸F]FDG uptake at the peri-anastomosis precluded a local tumor recurrence (a negative predictive value of 100%). In addition, semiquantitative (SUV(max)) analysis of [¹⁸F]FDG uptake at the peri-anastomosis may increase specificity (up to 97%), while preserving maximum sensitivity, if the postoperative period is >12 months.
