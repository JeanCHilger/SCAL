Synthesis and characterization of a iodine-125-labeled pyrrolo[1,2-a]thieno[3,2-e]pyrazine and evaluation as a potential 5-HT4R SPECT tracer. In the aim to find new radiotracers for the in vivo imaging of 5-HT(4) receptors by ultra-high resolution quantitative SPECT, we have developed the synthesis of a radioiodinated 5-HT(4) ligand using an iododestannylation procedure. The [(125)I]-ligand was obtained in a high radiochemical yield. Preliminary autoradiographic and ex vivo studies failed to show a specific labeling of 5-HT(4) receptors.
