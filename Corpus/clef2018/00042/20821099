Measurement of absorbed doses in organs of medical staff at (18)F-FDG pet examination. In this study, the organ doses were measured using a human- body phantom simulating a medical staff member, and we considered an effective method for decreasing exposure to staff in positron emission tomography examinations. A fluorescence glass dosimeter was arranged for measurements in various organs. Regarding exposure, the average ratio of the dose at 100 cm from the source to the dose at 30 cm was 0.35. The ratio of the dose at 100 cm with a 3 cm lead shield to the dose at 100 cm with no shielding device was 0.01. To reduce the radiation exposure effectively, medical staff members should inform the patient of the details of the examination in advance, reduce the contact time with the patient during the examination, and maximize their distance from the patient when contact is necessary.
