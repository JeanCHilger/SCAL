123I-MIBG imaging detects cardiac involvement and predicts cardiac events in Churg-Strauss syndrome. In Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) it is important to detect cardiac involvement, which predicts poor prognosis. This study evaluated whether (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy could detect cardiac damage and predict cardiac events in CSS.(123)I-MIBG scintigraphy was performed in 28 patients with CSS, 12 of whom had cardiac involvement. The early and delayed heart to mediastinum ratio (early H/M and delayed H/M) and washout rate were calculated by using (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy and compared with those in control subjects.Early H/M and delayed H/M were significantly lower and the washout rate was significantly higher in patients with cardiac involvement than in those without and in controls (early H/M, p = 0.0024, p = 0.0001 delayed H/M, p = 0.0002, p = 0.0001Cardiac sympathetic nerve function was damaged in CSS patients with cardiac involvement. (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy was useful in detecting cardiac involvement and in predicting cardiac events.
