Adipose-derived stem cells modified genetically in vivo promote reconstruction of bone defects. Bone defects induced by different causes are difficult to replace and repair. We sought to repair bone defects by transplantation of genetically modified adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) and acellular bone matrix (ACBM).We constructed the biologic material of ACBM and evaluated its mechanical properties, general biocompatibility and biosafety. ADSC isolated from minipigs were cultured in vitro and then transfected by recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) and recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor (rhVEGF) plasmids, respectively. Subsequently, the compounds of ACBM/ADSC/rhBMP-2/rhVEGF were used to repair bone defects of the ulna in minipigs. X-ray examination, radionuclide bone imaging and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) were employed to monitor the therapeutic effects 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after operation. Histologic experiments were carried out 12 weeks after operation.ACBM had no or weak antigenicity and the natural mechanical properties of ACBM were preserved. In vitro, ADSC transfected by rhBMP-2 and rhVEGF, respectively, could release rhBMP-2 or rhVEGF for at least 4 weeks. The X-ray, radionuclide bone imaging and SPECT examinations indicated that the compound of ACBM/ADSC/rhBMP-2/rhVEGF had better treatment effects on bone defects compared with the controls.Scaffolds, seed cells and bioactive factors are key points in tissue engineering. This research indicates that ACBM is a good biologic material for tissue repair, and ACBM/ADSC/rhBMP-2/rhVEGF can accelerate bone formation significantly.
