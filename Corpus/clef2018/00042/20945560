. Endothelial cells are important cells in inflammatory responses (1-2). Bacterial lipopolysaccharide, virus, inflammation, and tissue injury increase secretion of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and other cytokines and chemokines. Emigration of leukocytes from blood is dependent on their ability to adhere to endothelial cell surfaces. Inflammatory mediators and cytokines induce chemokine secretion from endothelial cells and other vascular cells and increase their expression of cell surface adhesion molecules, such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), integrins, and selectins. Chemokines are chemotactic toward leukocytes and toward sites of inflammation and tissue injury. The movements of leukocytes through endothelial junctions into the extravascular space are highly orchestrated through various interactions with different adhesion molecules on endothelial cells (3). VCAM-1 is found in very low amounts on the cell surface of resting endothelial cells and other vascular cells, such as smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts (4-8). VCAM-1 binds to the very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) integrin on the cell surface of leukocytes. IL-1 and TNFα increase expression of VCAM-1 and other cell adhesion molecules on the vascular endothelial cells, which leads to leukocyte adhesion to the activated endothelium. Furthermore, VCAM-1 expression is also induced by oxidized low-density lipoproteins under atherogenic conditions (9). Overexpression of VCAM-1 by atherosclerotic lesions plays an important role in their progression to vulnerable plaques, which may erode and rupture. Cross-linked iron oxide nanoparticles targeted with anti-VCAM-1 antibody are being developed as a noninvasive agent for VCAM-1 expression in vascular endothelial cells during different stages of inflammation in atherosclerosis (10).
