 Isoniazid, also known as isonicotinylhydrazine (INH), is a first-line drug used in the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) (1, 2). INH is a prodrug that is activated by the catalase-peroxidase enzyme KatG of the mycobacteria. The activation process leads to the formation of the isonicotinic acyl-NADH complex. Subsequent binding of the complex with the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase InhA results in the inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis, which is essential for the wall of mycobacteria (3). INH is bactericidal to rapidly dividing mycobacteria but is bacteriostatic to slow-growing mycobacteria. INH labeled with
