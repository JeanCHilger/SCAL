 Acetylcholine is an endogenous neurotransmitter at cholinergic synapses and neuroeffector junctions in the peripheral and central nervous systems. It acts on nicotinic and muscarinic receptors to mediate complex functions, such as attention, memory, cognition, and consciousness. Degeneration of cholinergic neurons has been observed in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), but not in vascular dementia. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the enzyme that terminates cholinergic actions through the rapid hydrolysis of acetylcholine to choline and acetate. AChE is localized on both cholinergic and cholinoceptive neurons in the brain, with the highest activity in the striatum, thalamus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex (1). AChE has been a target for radioligand development as well as drug development because its levels decrease in AD (1, 2). Radiolabeled AChE inhibitors and acetylcholine analog substrates are the two major approaches to mapping AChE
