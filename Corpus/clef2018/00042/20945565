. The presence of hypoxia is a characteristic feature of solid neoplastic tumors, and it is believed to be related to the aggressive metastasis nature and the development of chemo- and radiotherapy resistance by the tumor (1, 2). In addition, tumor hypoxia is considered to be an important prognostic factor and indicates a poor outcome for the patient (1). Therefore, the hypoxia characterization of tumors is an important diagnostic method for planning cancer treatment(s). Although several invasive and noninvasive methods are available for the detection of hypoxic tumors, these methods have limitations because of the complex blood supply, tumor structure, and oxygen utilization by the tumor cells (3). The invasive method involves placement of oxygen-sensing electrodes
