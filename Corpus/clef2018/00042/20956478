Quantitative upright-supine high-speed SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging for detection of coronary artery disease: correlation with invasive coronary angiography. A recently developed camera system for high-speed SPECT (HS-SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging shows excellent correlation with conventional SPECT. Our goal was to test the diagnostic accuracy of an automated quantification of combined upright and supine myocardial SPECT for detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) (≥ 70% luminal diameter stenosis or, in left main coronary artery, ≥ 50% luminal diameter stenosis) in comparison to invasive coronary angiography (ICA).We studied 142 patients undergoing upright and supine HS-SPECT, including 56 consecutive patients (63% men mean age ± SD, 64 ± 13 yOn a per-patient basis, the sensitivity was 91%, 88%, and 94% for U-TPD, S-TPD, and C-TPD, respectively, and specificity was 59%, 73%, and 86% for U-TPD, S-TPD, and C-TPD, respectively. C-TPD had a larger area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve than U-TPD or S-TPD for identification of stenosis ≥ 70% (0.94 vs. 0.88 and 0.89, P < 0.05 and not significant, respectively). On a per-vessel basis, the sensitivity was 67%, 66%, and 69% for U-TPD, S-TPD, and C-TPD, respectively, and specificity was 91%, 94%, and 97% for U-TPD, S-TPD, and C-TPD, respectively (P = 0.02 for specificity U-TPD vs. C-TPD).In this first comparison of HS-SPECT with ICA, new automated quantification of combined upright and supine HS-SPECT shows high diagnostic accuracy for detecting clinically significant CAD, with findings comparable to those reported using conventional SPECT.
