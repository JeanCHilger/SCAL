PET imaging of nobiletin based on a practical total synthesis. A practical synthesis of nobiletin, a polymethoxylated citrus flavone, was accomplished by utilizing our novel flavone synthesis. Synthetic nobiletin was labelled by selective demethylation and rapid incorporation of (11)C atom. Positron emission tomography images successfully visualized the brain distribution, which may provide therapeutic benefits in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
