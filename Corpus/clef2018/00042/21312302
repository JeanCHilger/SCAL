Silicon-based chemistry: an original and efficient one-step approach to [18F]-nucleosides and [18F]-oligonucleotides for PET imaging. Take it eaSi! Nucleosides, dinucleotides, and one oligonucleotide, all modified by click chemistry, have for the first time been directly and very efficiently labeled with (18)F by using a silicon-based, one-step approach that opens the way for the development of a new class of positron emission tomography (PET) tracers (see graphic).
