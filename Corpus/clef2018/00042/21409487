Financial and clinical implications of low-energy CT combined with 99m Technetium-sestamibi SPECT for primary hyperparathyroidism. (99m)Technetium-sestamibi hybrid SPECT/CT has been favored over conventional SPECT in preoperative evaluation of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) patients. However, the financial implications of CT-image acquisition have never before been published. This prompted us to perform a cost analysis of the aforementioned nuclear procedures.A total of 55 PHPT patients operated on between 2004 and 2009 were studied. Overall, 27 patients underwent SPECT and 28 SPECT/CT. Localization results, as well as diagnostic and clinical cost variations between SPECT and SPECT/CT patients, were compared.SPECT/CT revealed higher sensitivity than SPECT (96.7 vs 79.3% P = .011), as well as higher specificity (96.4 vs 82.4%SPECT/CT ensures better focus for the surgical exploration, shortens surgical times, and eventually cuts costs when used for localization of parathyroid adenomas.
