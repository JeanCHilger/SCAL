11C]sorafenib: radiosynthesis and preliminary PET study of brain uptake in P-gp/Bcrp knockout mic. Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006, 1) is a second-generation, orally active multikinase inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of some cancers in patients. In this Letter, we developed [(11)C]1 as a novel positron emission tomography (PET) probe, and evaluated the influence of ABC transporters-mediated efflux on brain uptake using PET with [(11)C]1 in P-glycoprotein (P-gp)/breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) knockout mice versus wild-type mice. [(11)C]1 was synthesized by the reaction of hydrochloride of aniline 2 with [(11)C]phosgene ([(11)C]COCl(2)) to give isocyanate [(11)C]6, followed by reaction with another aniline 3. Small-animal PET study with [(11)C]1 indicated that the radioactivity level (AUC(0-60 min), SUVÃ—min) in the brains of P-gp/Bcrp knockout mice was about three times higher than in wild-type mice.
