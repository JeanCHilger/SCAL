Attenuation correction of PET images with interpolated average CT for thoracic tumors. To reduce positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) misalignments and standardized uptake value (SUV) errors, cine average CT (CACT) has been proposed to replace helical CT (HCT) for attenuation correction (AC). A new method using interpolated average CT (IACT) for AC is introduced to further reduce radiation dose with similar image quality. Six patients were recruited in this study. The end-inspiration and -expiration phases from cine CT were used as the two original phases. Deformable image registration was used to generate the interpolated phases. The IACT was calculated by averaging the original and interpolated phases. The PET images were then reconstructed with AC using CACT, HCT and IACT, respectively. Their misalignments were compared by visual assessment, mutual information, correlation coefficient and SUV. The doses from different CT maps were analyzed. The misalignments were reduced for CACT and IACT as compared to HCT. The maximum SUV difference between the use of IACT and CACT was ∼3%, and it was ∼20% between the use of HCT and CACT. The estimated dose for IACT was 0.38 mSv. The radiation dose using IACT could be reduced by 85% compared to the use of CACT. IACT is a good low-dose approximation of CACT for AC.
