Comparison of epicardial potential maps derived from the 12-lead electrocardiograms with scintigraphic images during controlled myocardial ischemia. Our aim was to cross-validate electrocardiographic (ECG) and scintigraphic imaging of acute myocardial ischemia. The former method was based on inverse calculation of heart-surface potentials from the body-surface ECGs, and the latter, on a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). A boundary-element torso model with 352 body-surface and 202 heart-surface nodes was used to perform the ECG inverse solution. Potentials at 352 body-surface nodes were calculated from those acquired at 12-lead ECG measurement sites using regression coefficients developed from a design set (n = 892) of body-surface potential mapping (BSPM) data. The test set (n = 18) consisted of BSPM data from patients who underwent a balloon-inflation angioplasty of either the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) (n = 7), left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) (n = 2), or the right coronary artery (RCA) (n = 9). Body-surface potential mapping distributions at J point for 352 nodes were estimated from the 12-lead ECG, and an agreement with those estimated from 120 leads was assessed by a correlation coefficient (CC) (in percent). These estimates yielded very similar BSPM distributions, with a CC of 91.0% ± 8.1% (mean ± SD) for the entire test set and 94.1% ± 1.4%, 96.7% ± 0.8%, and 87.4% ± 10.3% for LAD, LCx, and RCA subgroups, respectively. Corresponding heart-surface potential distributions obtained by inverse solution correlated with a lower CC of 69.3% ± 18.0% overall and 73.7% ± 10.8%, 84.7% ± 1.1%, and 62.6% ± 21.8%, respectively, for subgroups. Bull's-eye displays of heart-surface potentials calculated from estimated BSPM distributions had an area of positive potentials that qualitatively corresponded, in general, with the underperfused territory suggested by SPECT images. For the LAD and LCx groups, all 9 ECG-derived bull's-eye images indicated the expected territory for the RCA group, 6 of 9 ECG-derived images were as expected
