Multimodality imaging can help to doubt, diagnose and follow-up cardiac mass. Primary cardiac lymphoma is a very rare form of lymphoma primarily or mainly involving the heart, as in the two cases presented in this report. Various imaging modalities, including coronary computed tomography angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography were useful for the characterization and diagnosis of cardiac mass. Pathologic confirmation was successful with endomyocardial biopsy under echocardiographic guidance, intra- and extracardiacally. In primary cardiac lymphoma, diagnosis using multiple modalities may be useful for mass characterization, and for response monitoring after chemotherapy.
