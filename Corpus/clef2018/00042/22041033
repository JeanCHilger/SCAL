Is the predictive ability of positron emission tomography after neoadjuvant treatment for esophageal cancer ready for prime-time? Monjazeb et al performed a single-institution, retrospective study of 163 patients with histologically confirmed stage I to IVa esophageal cancer to assess the utility of positron-emission tomography (PET) in delineating which patients would most likely benefit from esophagectomy after induction chemoradiation therapy. They found that patients who achieve a PET complete response after definitive chemoradiation therapy had similar outcomes to patients treated with trimodal therapy and concluded that patients who achieve a PET complete response after induction therapy may not benefit from esophagectomy. Though their study is interesting, their results should be validated by a prospective trial before they are incorporated into clinical practice.
