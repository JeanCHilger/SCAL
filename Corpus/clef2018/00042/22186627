Phase 2 study of frontline bortezomib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Preliminary results indicated that bortezomib (B) (Velcade*) as a single agent may have activity in pretreated NSCLC patients with similar or lesser toxicity compared to chemotherapy. This phase II study was initiated to determine the efficacy of single-agent B in chemona√Øve patients with advanced NSCLC. An early tumor assessment (after 6 weeks of therapy) was performed to allow for rapid and appropriate management of non-responding patients.Patients received B (1.5 mg/m2) twice a week for 2 consecutive weeks (days 1, 4, 8, and 11) followed by a 10-day rest period. The primary endpoint was non-progression rate (NPR) after 6 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints included response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Exploratory analyses included FDG-PET response at 6 weeks and circulating tumors cell (CTC) assessment at day 1 of each cycle in a subset of patients.18 patients were enrolled from 06/06 to 02/07 from 3 French institutions.male/female 15/3 median age 66 (54-79)Although according to the protocol rules the trial should not be stopped, the lack of any objective response either by CT-scan or PET-CT, along with substantial toxicity, did not argue in favor of the current strategy of B as a single agent in the front-line setting of NSCLC.
