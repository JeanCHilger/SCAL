Detection of asymptomatic cardiac metastasis and successful salvage chemotherapy comprising a prednisone, Etoposide, procarbazine, and cyclophosphamide regimen in an elderly Japanese patient suffering from a delayed recurrence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We report a case of facial diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) associated with recurrent metastasis in the heart and other sites in a 76-year-old Japanese woman. Initially, she developed DLBCL in her left upper eyelid that spread into the left orbit (Ann Arbor classification stage I). The lesion went into clinical regression after 4 cycles of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. More than 3 years later, the lymphoma recurred in her facial skin, together with metastases in the mediastinal lymph nodes and the heart the tumor in the heart was successfully detected by PET/CT and cardiac MRI. To treat the recurrent lesions, we performed a salvage chemotherapy regimen comprising prednisone, etoposide, procarbazine, and cyclophosphamide, which successfully induced tumor regression.
