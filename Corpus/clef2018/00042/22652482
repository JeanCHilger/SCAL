Comparison of PET/CT with other imaging modalities in women with genital tuberculosis. To compare findings with 2-deoxy-2-((18)F)fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) with findings obtained using ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and CT in patients with proven tubercular tubo-ovarian masses.Seventeen patients with proven tubercular tubo-ovarian masses underwent (18)F-FDG-PET/CT imaging and the findings were compared with US (for all patients), MRI (for 9 patients), CT (for 4 patients), and laparotomy or laparoscopic findings (for 14 patients).Eleven patients (64.7%) had unilateral tubo-ovarian masses, with activity in 6 masses (35.3%) 4 patients (23.5%) had bilateral tubo-ovarian masses, with activity in all massesImaging with (18)F-FDG-PET/CT is noninvasive and appears to be clinically useful for the diagnosis of tubercular tubo-ovarian masses.
