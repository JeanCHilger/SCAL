Diagnostic value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with fever of unknown origin. This study investigates the diagnostic value of (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18) F-FDG PET/CT) in patients with 109 classical fever of unknown origin (FUO). Of the 48 (18) F-FDG PET/CT scans, 41 (85.4%) were interpreted as abnormal, and 25 (52.1% of all scans) were considered clinically helpful. The final cause of fever was determined in 41 patients (85.4%) infection (25%), malignancy (12.5%), non-infectious inflammatory disease (16.7%) and miscellaneous causes (31.3%). (18) F-FDG PET/CT contributed to the final diagnosis of FUO in 65.8%.
