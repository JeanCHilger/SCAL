(68)Ge/ (68)Ga generators: past, present, and future. In 1964, first (68)Ge/(68)Ga radionuclide generators were described. Although the generator design was by far not adequate to our today's level of chemical, radiopharmaceutical and medical expectations, it perfectly met the needs of molecular imaging of this period. (68)Ga-EDTA as directly eluted from the generators entered the field of functional diagnosis, in particular for brain imaging. A new type of generators became commercially available in the first years of the 21st century. Generator eluates based on hydrochloric acid provided "cationic" (68)Ga instead of "inert" (68)Ga-complexes and opened new pathways of Me(III) based radiopharmaceutical chemistry. The impressive success of utilizing (68)Ga- DOTA-octreotides and PET/CT instead of e.g., (111)In-DTPA-octreoscan and SPECT paved the way not only towards clinical acceptance of this particular tracer for imaging neuroendocrine tracers, but to the realisation of the great potential of the (68)Ge/(68)Ga generator for modern nuclear medicine in general. The last decade has seen a (68)Ga rush. Increasing applications of generator based (68)Ga radiopharmaceuticals (for diagnosis alone, but increasingly for treatment planning thanks to the inherent option as expressed by THERANOSTICS), now ask for further developments - towards the optimization of (68)Ge/(68)Ga generators both from chemical and regulatory points of view. Dedicated chelators may be required to broaden the feasibility of (68)Ga labeling of more sensitive targeting vectors and generator chemistry may be adopted to those chelators - or vice versa. This review describes the development and the current status of (68)Ge/(68)Ga radionuclide generators.
