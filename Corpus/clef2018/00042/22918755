Purification and labeling strategies for (68)Ga from (68)Ge/ (68)Ga generator eluate. For successful labeling, (68)Ge/(68)Ga generator eluate has to be concentrated (from 10 mL or more to less than 1 mL) and to be purified of metallic impurities, especially Fe(III), and (68)Ge breakthrough. Anionic, cationic and fractional elution methods are well known. We describe two new methods: (1) a combined cationic-anionic purification and (2) an easy-to-use and reliable cationic purification with NaCl solution. Using the first method, (68)Ga from 10 mL generator eluate was collected on a SCX cartridge, then eluted with 1.0 mL 5.5 M HCl directly on an anion exchanger (30 mg AG1X8). After drying with a stream of helium, (68)Ga was eluted with 0.4 mL water into the reaction vial. We provide as an example labeling of BPAMD. Using the second method, (68)Ga from 10 mL generator eluate was collected on a SCX cartridge, then eluted with a hydrochloric solution of sodium chloride (0.5 mL 5 M NaCl, 12.5 μL 5.5 M HCl) into the reaction vial, containing 40 μg DOTATOC and 0.5 mL 1 M ammonium acetate buffer pH 4.5. After heating for 7 min at 90°C, the reaction was finished. Radiochemical purity was higher than 95% without further purification. No (68)Ge breakthrough was found in the final product.
