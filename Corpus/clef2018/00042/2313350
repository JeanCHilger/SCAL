Skeletal assessment in neuroblastoma--the pitfalls of iodine-123-MIBG scans. This study was carried out to compare iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine ([I123I]MIBG) and technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate bone scans (99mTc-MDP) in the detection of skeletal involvement by neuroblastoma. Forty-four children with neuroblastoma underwent both [123I] MIBG and 99mTc-MDP scans within a 4-wk period bone marrow examination also was performed
