Quantitative analysis of 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Myocardial scintigraphy with 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and thallium-201 (201Tl) was performed in 29 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) using whole-body scintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Nonhypertensive patients were classified into three groups according to the septal thickness determined by ultrasonography group 1 (wall thickness less than 16 mm, n = 5), group 2 (from 16 to 20 mm, n = 12) and group 3 (greater than 20 mm, n = 4). The regional myocardial uptakes of both 201Tl and 123I-MIBG (percent of injected dose/cm3 myocardium) were higher in the more hypertrophic septa. However, when regional MIBG uptake at 3 hours was divided by the 201Tl uptake to calculate the MIBG uptake per unit of blood flow, the hypertrophic septa showed lower mean values--0.39 +/- 0.23 and 0.50 +/- 0.10 in groups 3 and 2, respectively (p less than 0.1 compared with 0.69 +/- 0.20 in group 1). The regional MIBG clearance rate in the septum was significantly higher in group 3 compared with group 1 (13.4 +/- 8.0%/hr versus 1.5 +/- 6.2%/hr, p less than 0.05). The uptake and 123I-MIBG clearance rate in the lateral wall showed a similar tendency. Myocardial uptake determined by whole-body scintigraphy was slightly increased in group 2 (3.5 +/- 0.6%, p less than 0.05) compared with group 1 (2.7 +/- 0.8%)
