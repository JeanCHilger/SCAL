The relationship between CNS metabolism and cytoarchitecture: a review of 14C-deoxyglucose studies with correlation to cytochrome oxidase histochemistry. Since the inception of the 14C-deoxyglucose method and its extension to in vivo imaging of regional cerebral glucose metabolism in humans by positron emission tomography, uncertainty has persisted concerning the type of work to which regional metabolism is coupled, as well as the distribution of this work within the neuron. 14C-deoxyglucose studies indicate that functionally-coupled neural metabolism is more apparent in axon terminals and perhaps dendrites than neuronal perikarya. Moreover, it appears that most of the metabolism in axon terminals is accounted for by Na+-K+-ATPase activity. Nevertheless, cytochrome oxidase histochemistry reveals the presence of intensely reactive mitochondria in soma-dendrite regions opposite presynaptic axon terminals, thereby indicating that continuous temporal and spatial summation of postsynaptic graded potentials is associated with increased metabolism. While the situation concerning the relative postsynaptic metabolic prices of EPSP's and IPSP's remains uncertain, the presence of elevated levels of cytochrome oxidase activity within certain classes of presynaptic terminals indicates that active excitation and inhibition is associated with increases in presynaptic metabolism. This observation has been confirmed in 14C-deoxyglucose studies. Nevertheless, studies of neonatal hippocampus indicate that, before metabolic activity shifts to dendritic and telodendritic regions of electrophysiological activity, metabolism is high in somal foci of biosynthesis.
