Experimental study on the collimator for increasing the resolution of N-isopropyl-p-(123I)iodoamphetamine (IMP) SPECT imaging of the brain. This study was carried out to design a new collimator for the present 123I-IMP SPECT imaging of the brain, which is hindered by the contamination of 124I and 126I. In this study we intended to increase spacial resolution along the transaxial direction and, at the same time, to compensate for the decrease of sensitivity by sacrificing the resolution along the axial direction to some extent. For this purpose, we developed 4 kinds of slat type units ultrahigh resolution (UHR), high resolution (HR), high sensitivity (HS), and ultrahigh sensitivity (UHS). In practice, either UHR or HR is set to the detector together with either HS or UHS. After testing 4 kinds of combinations, we found that the combination of UHR-HS gave us far better images than those obtained with the conventional medium energy parallel hole collimator and was best suited for 123I-IMP SPECT imaging of the brain at present. We are now thinking of fusing these two units together into one collimator.
