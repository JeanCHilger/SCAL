Thallium-201 stress-redistribution myocardial rotational tomography: development of criteria for visual interpretation. Despite high sensitivity and specificity for overall detection of coronary artery disease (CAD), planar stress-redistribution thallium-201 (Tl-201) scintigraphy remains suboptimal in localizing disease, because of overlap of myocardial segments. Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), by providing three-dimensional representation of myocardial Tl-201, offers promise for improved localization of CAD. In 50 consecutive patients (22 normal and 28 with CAD), who underwent SPECT stress-redistribution Tl-201 imaging, we systemically developed visual interpretive criteria for perfusion abnormality on SPECT. For overall detection of disease, the best criterion for abnormality was greater than or equal to 8 sectors of moderately decreased Tl-201 uptake. With this criterion, the true positive and true negative rates for overall detection of disease were 96% and 91%, respectively. The best criterion for significant defect in the anterior or posterior coronary circulation was greater than or equal to 3 sectors of moderately decreased Tl-201 uptake. With this criterion, the true positive and true negative rates for anterior circulation disease were 71% and 100%, respectively. With respect to posterior circulation disease, the true positive and true negative rates were 100% and 50%, respectively. Regarding identification of dual circulation disease, the true positive and true negative rates were 71% and 82%, respectively.
