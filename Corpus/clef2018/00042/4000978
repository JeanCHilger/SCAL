Use of 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine in pediatric oncology. The detection of specific trapping of MIBG by neuroblastoma cells is of great importance for the diagnosis and management of neuroblastoma in childhood. The specificity and sensitivity of the test has been demonstrated by Kimmig and Feine in a multi-center study. Moreover, MIBG might be used in the therapy of neuroblastoma. The first therapeutic cases allow slight optimism. There remain however still a number of questions to be answered. In vitro investigations of uptake kinetics and cytotoxicity of MIBG performed by our group provided valuable information for clinical investigations.
