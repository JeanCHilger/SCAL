Diagnosis of benign and malignant tumors of the female breast using single photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-DTPA. 31 patients with suspicious findings on mammographic films were examined preoperatively by single photon emission computed tomography. A scintigraphic study was performed at 30 and 120 min after i.v. administration of 370 MBq (10 mCi) 99mTc-DTPA. The radionuclide accumulation in both breasts was analyzed quantitatively on transaxial slices using the ROI-technique. In benign lesions (n = 12) as well as in carcinomas (n = 19), an increased 99mTc-DTPA accumulation was found as compared to clinically and radiographically unaffected sides. A radionuclide accumulation exceeding 20% of the contralateral side was considered to indicate malignancy. Thus the sensitivity in diagnosing malignant tumours was 74%, the specificity 64% and the accuracy 70%. In contrast to studies with planar scintigraphic imaging techniques the results clearly show an increased 99mTc-DTPA uptake even in benign breast lesions.
