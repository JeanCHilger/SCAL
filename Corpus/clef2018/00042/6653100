The effect of the guinea pig maximization protocol on the irritant response to deodorized kerosene - the excited skin syndrome. Deodorized kerosene in a concentration of 50 g/100 g in pet. did not cause cutaneous inflammation in 10 control guinea pigs. The proportion of 19 guinea pigs exhibiting inflammation following exposure to deodorized kerosene in the guinea pig maximization test increased, but the increase was not significant. The response in a group of 40 animals, half exposed to tetraethyleneglycol diacrylate and half to nonylphenol polyethoxylate-6, increased (z = 3.505, p = 0,004). The inflammatory response was related to concentration in both groups of animals which exhibited inflammatory responses to deodorized kerosene. The relevance of this alteration and irritant response to the interpretation of predictive tests in animals for sensitization, routine patch testing and repeated insult contact dermatitis is discussed.
