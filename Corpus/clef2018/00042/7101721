Autoimmune lymphocytic thyroiditis in dogs. Primary diseases of the thyroid gland, especially lymphocytic thyroiditis and idiopathic follicular atrophy, were the most common lesions associated with clinical hypothyroidism in pet dogs. Lymphocytic thyroiditis resembled naturally occurring lymphocytic thyroiditis in the Obese-strain of White Leghorn chickens and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in man. The morphology of the thyroid lesion and frequent occurrence of circulating thyroglobulin autoantibodies suggested that lymphocytic thyroiditis was immune-mediated in pet dogs. Thyroid lesions similar to naturally occurring autoimmune thyroiditis in experimental dogs were induced by a local thyroidal graft-versus-host reaction. The lesions observed in the thyroid lobe which was not injected with immunocompetent cells appeared to develop from the formation of thyroid antibodies in the gland by migrating host lymphocytes. Autoimmune lymphocytic thyroiditis occurred secondary to an unrelated immune response occurring in target tissue.
