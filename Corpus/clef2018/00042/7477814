Healthy aging, memory subsystems and regional cerebral oxygen consumption. The present study was designed to search for concomitant age-related changes in memory subsystems, defined according to current structural theories, and resting oxygen consumption in selected brain regions. We have investigated a sample of subjects between 20 and 68 years of age and strictly screened for their good health. We applied in the same subjects a battery of neuropsychological tests selected to investigate several memory subsystems, and high-resolution positron imaging with stereotaxic localization to study a purposely limited number of cerebral structures, selected on a priori hypotheses to match the different memory subsystems. Our results showed significant age-related changes in performance on some tests, consistent with the literature, including an increase in semantic memory and a decrease in both working memory (central executive system) and verbal episodic and explicit memory. There was also an age-related linear decrease in global brain oxygen consumption which regionally reached statistical significance for the neocortical areas and the left thalamus. There was a limited number of significant, age-independent correlations between the raw psychometric test scores and resting regional oxidative metabolism. Consistent with our present understanding of the functional anatomy of memory, the Associate Learning scores (verbal episodic and explicit memory) were positively correlated with left hippocampal and thalamic metabolism. The positive relationships found between right hippocampal metabolism and performance in the Associate Learning and the Brown-Peterson tests were less expected but would be consistent with findings from recent PET activation studies. The results from this investigation are discussed in the light of current knowledge concerning the neuropsychology and the neurobiology of both aging and memory.
