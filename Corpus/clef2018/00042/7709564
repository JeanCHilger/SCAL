Perioperative nutritional support for the animal with cancer. Tumors directly consume nutrients and produce paraneoplastic pathometabolic changes in food use efficiency. In combination with anorexia, negative energy balance and nutrient depletion can be extensive. Refeeding against catabolic changes supports general and specific host defenses. Enteral feeding methods are preferred to parenteral techniques and nutrient profiles are available that appear to favor host repletion.
