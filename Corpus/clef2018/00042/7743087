Positron emission tomography. Biomedical research and clinical application. Positron emission tomography (PET) is described as a tool in basic and clinical research in the neurosciences, especially in brain and heart. The physics and chemistry of the technique are reviewed. Numerous applications include measuring metabolism, blood flow and neurotransmitter properties quantitatively in vivo. Applications in facilitating drug research are outlined. PET is a unique tool for assessing in vivo biochemistry in humans.
