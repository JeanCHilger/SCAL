Effects of radiotherapy on the cellular uptake of carbon-14 labeled L-methionine in tumor tissue. In order to examine in vivo effects of irradiation on tumor uptake of L-[methyl-11C]methionine at a cellular level, the distribution of L-[methyl-14C]methionine (Met) in a rat AH109A tumor model was investigated using microautoradiography. Silver grain density of tumor cell layer decreased rapidly within the first day after 20 Gy of irradiation, and continued to fall during day 2. Grain density of granulation tissue was 25% of tumor cells and was unchanged after irradiation. Macrophages and necrotic tissue showed low grain density and a small post-irradiation decrease. One day after irradiation, tumor cell showed giant cell formation and decreased cell density per unit area. The number of grains was greater in giant tumor cells than in non-irradiated tumor cell. Rapid response of Met uptake by tumor cells without a significant uptake by granulation tissue and macrophages suggest that 11C-Met is a suitable tracer for monitoring tumor radiotherapy with positron emission tomography.
