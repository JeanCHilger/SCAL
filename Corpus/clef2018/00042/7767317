Rapid radiochemical purity testing for [131I]m-iodobenzylguanidine. The standard high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for determining radiochemical purity (RCP) of [131I]m-iodobenzylguanidine ([131I]mIBG) is cumbersome and time-consuming. A simplified and rapid separation method with the use of a reverse-phase extraction chromatography technique (i.e. Sep-Pak C18 [SPC] cartridge) is described. The new SPC system closely correlates (r = 0.99) to the standard HPLC method, and the time to complete the SPC analysis is less than 5 min.
