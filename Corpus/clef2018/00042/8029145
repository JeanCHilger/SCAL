Examination of cerebral blood flow in diagnosis of epilepsy. Cerebral blood flow was measured in 80 epileptic patients with the aid of SPECT and HM-PAO techniques. Blood flow in the brain was assessed between epileptic attacks. A significant decrease in HM-PAO accumulation in suspected epileptic foci has been noted in 85 per cent of cases. It seems that radioisotopic techniques may be helpful in localization epileptic foci.
