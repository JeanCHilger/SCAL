Quantitative analysis of right ventricular overloading by 201Tl myocardial SPECT. Clinical usefulness of quantitative analysis of right ventricular overloading was evaluated by 201Tl myocardial SPECT in comparison with cardiac catheterization and MRI. Seventy-four MBq of 201TlCl was intravenous injected and 201Tl myocardial SPECT was performed on 40 patients (mean age: 61.0 +/- 11.8) with right ventricular overloading. Regions of interest (ROI) were selected on right and left ventricular walls in a midventricular short axis image of SPECT and uptake of each ROI were counted. The right ventricle (RV)/left ventricle (LV) 201Tl uptake ratio (R/L-Tl) was calculated. Wall thickness of RV and LV were measured on MRI and the RV/LV wall thickness ratio (R/L-WT) was calculated. RV and LV pressure were recorded in cardiac catheterization, and the RV/LV systolic pressure ratio (R/L-P) was calculated. There was significant positive correlation (Y = 0.73X + 0.19, r = 0.71, p < 0.001) between R/L-Tl and R/L-WT. R/L-Tl was positively correlated with R/L-P in patients with pressure overload (Y = 1.14X - 0.049, r = 0.85, p < 0.001) and in patients with volume overload (Y = 0.51X + 0.023, r = 0.88, p < 0.001) and the slope of the regression line in patients with pressure overload was significantly steeper than that in patients with volume overload (p < 0.001). In conclusion, quantitative analysis of right ventricular overload by 201Tl myocardial SPECT is useful to estimate RV/LV wall thickness ratio and pressure ratio.
