Bone scintigraphy in patients with atypical lumbar Scheuermann disease. Fourteen patients presenting during an 8-year period with radiographic changes suggestive of atypical lumbar Scheuermann disease (ALSD) involving one or more vertebral levels and low-back pain symptoms were referred for bone scintigraphy. Eleven of these studies included single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The bone scans were reviewed with the intent of defining the scintigraphic characteristic of ALSD. Eleven of the 14 patients had subtle increases in activity on planar bone scintigraphy and/or SPECT at the radiographic sites of involvement. These scintigraphic findings should be distinguished from the more intense radiotracer uptake patterns of infection (osteomyelitis and discitis) and trauma (fracture).
