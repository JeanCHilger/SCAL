Presynaptic dopaminergic deficits in Lesch-Nyhan disease. Lesch-Nyhan disease is a rare, devastating, X-linked recessive disorder of purine synthesis. Patients present with hyperuricemia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, and aggressive and self-injurious behavior. Although the genetic and biochemical abnormalities have been identified, the causes of the neuropsychiatric syndrome remain unclear.We used positron-emission tomography to measure presynaptic accumulation of fluorodopa F 18 tracer in the dopaminergic regions of the brains of 12 patients with Lesch-Nyhan disease (age, 10 to 20 years) and 15 healthy controls (age, 12 to 23). The results were expressed as ratios of specific to nonspecific radioactive counts. A low ratio indicates decreased dopa decarboxylase activity and dopamine storage.The fluorodopa F 18 ratio was significantly lower in the putamen (31 percent of control values), caudate nucleus (39 percent), frontal cortex (44 percent), and ventral tegmental complex (substantia nigra and ventral tegmentum 57 percent) in the patients with Lesch-Nyhan disease than in the controls. Uptake of the tracer was abnormally low even in the youngest patients tested, and there was no overlap in the values between patients and controls.Patients with Lesch-Nyhan disease have abnormally few dopaminergic nerve terminals and cell bodies. The abnormality involves all dopaminergic pathways and is not restricted to the basal ganglia. These dopaminergic deficits are pervasive and appear to be developmental in origin, which suggests that they contribute to the characteristic neuropsychiatric manifestations of the disease.
