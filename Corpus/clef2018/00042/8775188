The use of positron emission tomography imaging in the management of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Rational management of patients with CAD and poor left ventricular function relies on proper identification of the subgroup at high risk and those who have the highest potential of benefiting from a particular type of treatment. It is now well recognized that patients with CAD and left ventricular dysfunction have a high but variable mortality rate while receiving medical therapy. Many of these patients who have intractable heart failure are considered candidates for cardiac transplantation. Despite favorable survival after cardiac transplantation, this procedure cannot be performed in 90% of the heart failure patients who are potentially eligible because of the shortage of donor hearts. Cardiac transplantation is also an expensive procedure. Perfusion-FDG metabolism PET imaging has become the gold-standard noninvasive imaging method to identify the presence and extent of hibernating myocardium. Positron emission tomography accurately predicts recovery of regional and global left ventricular dysfunction after revascularization. In patients with poor left ventricular function, the PET pattern of perfusion metabolism mismatch is also predictive of improvement in heart failure symptoms and survival benefit after myocardial revascularization. These data suggest that a rational approach may be developed for cost-effective management of patients with CAD and poor left ventricular function.
