Activation of prefrontal and posterior superior temporal areas in visual calculation. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured with H2(15)O-positron emission tomography during the performance of visually presented calculation tasks to clarify cortical areas involved in arithmetic operations. The findings on a calculation task were compared with those on a covert reading task and with those of a fixation control task. Region of interest-based analysis showed that the left prefrontal area was activated in visual calculation relative to covert reading and the posterior superior temporal gyrus including part of Wernicke's area was activated in calculation relative to fixation control. The role of the prefrontal area in computation (arithmetic operations) and that of the posterior superior temporal gyrus in both comprehension of the stimuli and computation were suggested.
