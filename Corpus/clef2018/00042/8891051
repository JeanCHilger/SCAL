HMPAO SPECT in non-epileptic seizures: preliminary results. The diagnosis of non-epileptic seizures (NES) is problematic. Although diagnosis can be achieved by videotelemetry, these facilities are expensive and not widely available. HMPAO SPECT studies show focal hypoperfusion interictally in focal epilepsy. SPECT has not been studied in any detail in NES previously. Two groups (10 patients each) were studied, one with NES and one with complex partial seizures and localisation related epilepsy. SPECT scans were normal in 7 of 10 (70%) NES patients, while showing clear focal hypoperfusion in 8 of 10 patients (80%) with epilepsy. In the NES group, 1 patient showed hypoperfusion indistinguishable from that seen in epilepsy, while 2 patients in the epilepsy group showed only equivocal focal hypoperfusion. The remaining 2 patients in the NES group showed bifrontal and equivocal focal hypoperfusion. A normal HMPAO SPECT study supports the diagnosis of NES in patients with seizures of uncertain aetiology.
