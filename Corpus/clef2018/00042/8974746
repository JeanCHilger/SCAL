Single photon emission computer tomography in the differential diagnosis of the paroxysmal clinical events in newborns. Conventional computerized cranial tomography by single photon emission (TLCESF) is a nuclear medicine technique which makes use of a radioactive chemical complex to obtain a qualitative image of cerebral, cerebellar and brain-stem vascularization. This technique shows the changes in vascularization which occur between (decrease) and during (increase) the clinical events of paroxysmal epilepsy (ECP) in the area of origin. This technique is indicated in neonates with ECP which does not disappear on etiological treatment, where a non-epileptic cause cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds and where there are no associated encephalographic epileptic changes during the ECP.
