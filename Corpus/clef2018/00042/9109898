Effects of duration of epilepsy on the uncoupling of metabolism and blood flow in complex partial seizures. We derived interhemispheric asymmetry indices (AIs) in interictal glucose uptake and blood flow in the temporal lobes of patients with intractable complex partial seizures from 18F and 15O positron emission tomograms. All patients subsequently underwent either left (n = 16) and right (n = 18) temporal lobectomy. We determined the effects on AIs of clinical seizure variables, including duration of seizure disorder, age at seizure onset, frequency of complex partial seizures, history of secondary generalization, history of febrile seizures, and magnetic resonance imaging evidence for mesial temporal sclerosis. Duration of seizure disorder produced the only significant effects. Degree of interhemispheric asymmetry in both glucose uptake and blood flow increased with duration of seizure disorder. However, the rate of increase in asymmetry was significantly greater for glucose uptake than for blood flow. These results indicate that uncoupling of metabolism and blood flow is a progressive process that results from the differential response of glucose metabolism and blood flow to chronic seizure activity. The results also suggest that duration of seizure disorder may be an important variable to consider in the interpretation of PET studies for evaluation of seizure surgery candidates.
