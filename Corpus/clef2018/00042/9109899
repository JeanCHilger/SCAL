Presynaptic and postsynaptic striatal dopaminergic function in patients with manganese intoxication: a positron emission tomography study. We performed PET on four patients with chronic industrial Mn intoxication presynaptic and postsynaptic dopaminergic function were measured with [18F]6-fluoro-L-dopa (6FD) and [11C]raclopride (RAC).
