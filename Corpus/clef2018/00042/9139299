Cottonseed protein: what does the future hold? Cottonseed protein has the potential to increase the world's food supply while decreasing the incidence of malnutrition among the world's hungry. Nutritionally, cottonseed flour compares favorably to other animal and vegetable protein sources, as it is low in fat and contains a substantial amount of high biological value protein. Animal studies, as well as human research, using gossypol-free glandless cottonseed flour have shown that cottonseed protein promotes growth, increased weight gain, and a positive nitrogen balance. Cottonseed protein food products have been shown to be a healthy addition to the diets of children, college-age women, and the elderly. With its light color and bland flavor, cottonseed has many uses in the food processing arena. Baked goods, snack foods and candy, as well as pet and livestock feed are just a few successful products developed utilizing cottonseed protein.
