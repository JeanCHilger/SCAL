Estimating cortical activity from VEPS with the shrinking ellipsoid inverse. An iterative inverse method using Tikhonov regularization (the shrinking ellipsoid method) previously tested in a model system is used to invert the sequence of bioelectric scalp fields evoked by the onset of a checkerboard pattern in either the right or left lower hemifield. The shrinking ellipsoid method is modified from its original description to accommodate simultaneously inverting a sequence of thirteen VEP scalp fields measured from 65 to 125 ms after stimulus onset. This allows the evoked cortical activity to be tracked in 5-ms intervals without distortion due to occasional VEP scalp fields in the sequence that have too low a signal-to-noise ratio to be reliably inverted in isolation. A new method is described to identify the surface of the cortex from MRI data. This is required to implement the shrinking ellipsoid inverse. Results from two subjects studied in detail are presented. The earliest cortical activity occurs either in area MT (the middle temporal area) or simultaneously in MT and striate cortex (V1). However when it does occur in both areas, the activity in V1 is relatively weak and quickly subsides. Seventy-five ms after stimulus onset activity is seen mainly near MT corresponding to a region identified from PET studies as one that subserves motion processing. Activity moves to V1 by 90-100 ms after stimulus onset. Near 120 ms after stimulus onset, cortical activity returns to the region near MT. Virtually all activity identified in this time epoch occurs in the cortical hemisphere contralateral to the location of the stimulus in the visual field.
