Cardiac risk assessment before vascular surgery: a prospective study comparing clinical evaluation, dobutamine stress echocardiography, and dobutamine Tc-99m sestamibi tomoscintigraphy. Preoperative evaluation for cardiac risk assessment before peripheral vascular surgery remains controversial. Between January and June 1994, a prospective open study was carried out in 156 patients scheduled for elective vascular procedures (63 carotid endarterectomies, 34 abdominal aortic aneurysms, 29 aortoiliac and 30 infrainguinal reconstructions) to compare the ability of clinical data, dobutamine stress echocardiography, and dobutamine Tc-99m sestamibi tomoscintigraphy to predict postoperative cardiac events. Pharmacological stress testing consisted of incremental dobutamine infusion (+/-1 mg atropine to achieve 85% of age-predicted maximal heart rate, with continuous echocardiographic monitoring, and injection of Tc-99m sestamibi after dobutamine infusion). Dobutamine echocardiography was abnormal in 36 patients (worsening resting wall motion abnormality in 11 new induced wall motion abnormality in 25). Dobutamine Tc-99m sestamibi tomoscintigraphy revealed a reversible perfusion defect in 34 patients, indicating the presence of myocardial ischaemia. As a result, eight patients underwent myocardial revascularization (n = 5) or the proposed operation was cancelled (n = 3). In the remaining 142 vascular procedures, there were eight (5.6%) adverse cardiac events: three myocardial infarctions (two fatal), three prolonged myocardial ischaemia, one acute congestive heart failure and one sustained ventricular arrhythmia in the post operative period. Univariate analysis selected unstable angina (relative risk (RR) 11.6), previous congestive heart failure (RR 6.4), Detsky's score of > or = 15 (RR 3.0), positive dobutamine stress echocardiography (RR 3.7), and positive dobutamine tomoscintigraphy (RR 7.4) as significant predictors of postoperative cardiac events. In patients without clinical markers of coronary artery disease (n = 66), non-invasive cardiac testing did not predict cardiac complications (n = 2
