Significant reduction of seizure incidence and increase of benzodiazepine receptor density after interstitial radiosurgery in low-grade gliomas. Epilepsy is the leading symptom in low grade gliomas. In order to evaluate the effect of interstitial radiosurgery on seizure incidence the authors retrospectively analysed the outcome of 80 patients with temporal grade-II astrocytomas and a history of epilepsy. Patients were treated by 125-iodine temporary implants using 60 Gy as reference dose. The dose rate was 9.6 +/- 1.6 cGy/h. Median follow-up was 4.1 years. In 20 patients benzodiazepine receptor imaging was performed using single photon emission computed tomography and iomazenil. Treatment with carbamazepine alone led to a significant reduction in seizure incidence with 28% of patients being seizure-free (p < 0.05). Interstitial radiosurgery led to a further reduction of seizures rendering 40% of patients seizure-free after 3 months. After 6 months only 21% of patients still had seizures that were refractory to medical treatment (p < 0.01). SPECT imaging revealed that all tumours had a significant reduction of benzodiazepine receptors which also applied to the surrounding brain. After interstitial radiosurgery of tumours, receptor density increased in brain adjacent to the tumour (0.68 to 0.94 ratio ipsi to contralateral brain, p < 0.01) coincident with significant tumour shrinkage. Thus, in epileptogenic temporal low grade gliomas, interstitial radiosurgery not only reduced the tumour burden but also effectively treated the concomitant epilepsy, resulting in 79% of patients being seizure-free after combined treatment by radiosurgery and anticonvulsive medication. These results compare favourably to the outcome after resection in lesional epilepsy raising the issue of radiosurgery as a less invasive alternative to open epilepsy surgery.
