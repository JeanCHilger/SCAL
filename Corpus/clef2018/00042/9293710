Evaluation of single photon emission computed tomography of tumors in the head and neck with technetium-99m MIBI. SPECT using 99mTc-MIBI was performed in patients with tumors in the head and neck in order to determine 99mTc-MIBI uptake in tumors and to evaluate the efficacy of 99mTc-MIBI imaging in the assessment of treatment response. A MIBI uptake index was calculated as the ratio of average counts/pixel in the tumor to average counts/pixel in the homologous contralateral side. Eighteen of 19 (95%) of the cases had increased MIBI uptake in the tumor on early images, and 8 of 14 (57%) of the cases had increased uptake of the tumor on delayed images. MIBI uptake was related to the size of the tumor. Only 6 of 25 of cervical lymph node metastases were detected by 99mTc-MIBI SPECT. In the tumors evaluated before and after radiotherapy, the superiority of 99mTc-MIBI SPECT over MRI was not obtained, but there was a tendency for MIBI-index to decrease after radiotherapy.
