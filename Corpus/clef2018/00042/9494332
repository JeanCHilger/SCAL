Quantification of cerebral blood flow with 99mTc-ECD SPECT by a single arterial or venous blood sample. The purpose of the study is to develop a simple and less invasive method for quantifying regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using 99mTc-ECD and SPECT. By employing a microsphere model, a new method to measure rCBF was developed, which required a single arterial or venous sample instead of continuous withdrawal of arterial blood. Using a regression line, the integral of input function of arterial blood from 0 to 30 min was inferred by activity of arterial blood sampled at time t A(t), by activity multiplied by its octanol extraction rate
