Neural activation during acute capsaicin-evoked pain and allodynia assessed with PET. The PET H2 15O-bolus method was used to image regional brain activity in normal human subjects during intense pain induced by intradermal injection of capsaicin and during post-capsaicin mechanical allodynia (the perception of pain from a normally non-painful stimulus). Images of regional cerebral blood flow were acquired during six conditions: (i) rest (ii) light brushing of the forearm
