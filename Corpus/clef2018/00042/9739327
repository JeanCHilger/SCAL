A serological study of canine herpes virus-1 infection in the English dog population. An epidemiological survey investigated the prevalence of canine herpes virus-1 antibodies in a population of 325 pet dogs in England. Sera were analysed for the presence of canine herpes virus-1 neutralising antibody by means of a serum neutralisation test and for virus-specific IgG and IgM by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. In contrast with published results from other parts of the world, canine herpes virus-1 infection was shown to be common among the domestic dog population of England.
