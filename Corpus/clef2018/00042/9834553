Dementias and memory impairment of degenerative origin. In dementias and memory impairments of neurodegenerative origin, imaging of brain metabolism and perfusion by means of positron or single-photon emission tomography or functional MRI has utility in the following domains: 1) pathophysiology, by revealing the topography and severity of synaptic damage even at the earliest stages of the disease, at a time when structural imaging is of little or no help 2) diagnosis, by showing profiles of abnormalities characteristic to each disorder, even though such profiles are neither specific to, nor constantly present in each disorder
