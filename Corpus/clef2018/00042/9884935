Optimized technical considerations for acquiring high-quality FDG studies with a dual-headed gamma camera. This retrospective analysis was designed to optimize the parameters and techniques required to successfully perform high-quality coincidence imaging in a general nuclear medicine department using a dual-headed gamma camera.Coincidence imaging was performed on 33 patients after an intravenous injection of 3.0-5.0 mCi fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG). Data for all subjects were evaluated to determine which technical considerations contributed to an overall improvement in image quality.After reviewing the data for the 33 subjects, several modified techniques were implemented and parameters were adjusted that enhanced the overall quality of the images. The extremely short half-life of 18F restricts the opportunity to repeat studies that were delayed, interrupted or technically substandard.The review of the data indicated that strict adherence to protocol is necessary to achieve optimal results while attempting to incorporate this new imaging modality into a typical nuclear medicine department.
