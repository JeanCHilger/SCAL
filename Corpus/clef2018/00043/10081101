Lymph node staging of bladder neck carcinoma with positron emission tomography. PET is a new method in nuclear medicine which examines the metabolism and not the morphology. Tumors show a higher rate of glycolysis than benign tissue and hence can be detected by radioactive glucose. This method has proved good for various tumors. In this study the lymph node staging of bladder cancer by PET was investigated. In 64 patients a PET of the pelvis after injection of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was carried out preoperatively the PET-results were compared with the histology of the OR specimen after classical pelvic lymphadenectomy. For lymph node staging positive nodes were found in 14 patients which was correct
