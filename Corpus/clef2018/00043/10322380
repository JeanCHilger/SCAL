Imaging techniques for assessing drug delivery in man. In vivo imaging technologies have a vital role to play in the pharmaceutical development process. Gamma scintigraphy, comprising two-dimensional 'planar' imaging, is used widely to visualize and to quantify drug delivery, particularly by the oral and pulmonary routes. However, three-dimensional imaging modalities - single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - may also have applications within this area. Single photon emission computed tomography and PET offer potential advantages over gamma scintigraphy in the assessment of regional lung deposition from aerosol inhalers, but these advantages are greatly outweighed by the practical problems associated with conducting SPECT and PET studies. It is concluded that, for the foreseeable future, gamma scintigraphy is the imaging modality of choice in assessing the delivery of new oral and pulmonary drug products.
