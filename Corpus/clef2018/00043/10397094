Imaging of adrenal tumors using FDG PET: comparison of benign and malignant lesions. The aim of this study was to differentiate benign from malignant adrenal tumors using positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in patients with unilateral adrenal masses originally detected by CT or MR imaging.PET imaging with FDG can metabolically characterize adrenal masses. Abnormally increased FDG uptake in adrenal malignancies allows one to differentiate these abnormalities from benign lesions. Whole-body PET can also reveal extraadrenal tumor sites in patients with malignant tumors, using a single imaging technique for accurate disease staging.
