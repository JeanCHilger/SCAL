Cerebral glucose metabolism in unilateral entorhinal cortex-lesioned rats: an animal PET study. To evaluate the effect of entorhinal cortical lesion on cerebral cortical function, we studied cerebral glucose utilization (CMRGlc) using a high resolution PET scanner after quinolinic acid lesion of the unilateral entorhinal cortex in rats. [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose PET was performed at 4 days and 4 weeks after surgery, and CMRGlc in the bilateral frontal, parietal and temporal regions were analyzed. At 4 days, the entorhinal lesion induced a 12-15% decrease in CMRGlc of frontal, parietal and temporal regions ipsilateral to the lesion. The hypometabolism continued at 4 weeks in the temporal region. These findings suggest that entorhinal lesion induces cerebral cortical hypometabolism, which implies a pathogenetic role of entorhinal area on the cortical hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease.
