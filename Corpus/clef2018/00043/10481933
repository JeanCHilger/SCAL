Stability of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in human blood samples. Stability of immunoreactivity of human brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in blood samples was investigated. After storage of the whole blood samples in the blood collecting tubes made of glass or polyethylene terephthalate (PET), residual immunoreactivity of BNP in the plasma was measured by sandwich radioimmunoassay for human BNP. BNP in the blood samples collected in the PET tubes were kept more stable than that in the glass tubes. The results suggested that commercially available PET tubes would enable more accurate BNP values and this would also help to simplify the sample preparation.
