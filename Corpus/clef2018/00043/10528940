Effects of vigabatrin on the GABAergic system as determined by [123I]iomazenil SPECT and GABA MRS. To evaluate effects of vigabatrin (VGB) by using [123I]iomazenil single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to estimate central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A))/benzodiazepine receptors (BZRs), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to assess tissue GABA levels.Six patients with partial seizures had both SPECT and MRS before and 25-84 days after starting VGB (3 g p.o., q.d.). SPECT was acquired by using the constant-infusion method and, after nonuniform attenuation correction, coregistered with T1-weighted MR Imaging (MRI) A volume of interest (VOI) of 3 x 2 x 2 cc over the occipital cortex, used for MRS acquisition, was positioned on both MRI and coregistered SPECT. Occipital activity was divided by either total plasma activity or plasma [123I]iomazenil concentration to estimate BZR distribution volume (V(T)-p and V'(T), respectively). Wilcoxon's test was used for VOI differences in GABA levels, BZR V(T)-p or V'(T). SPM96 (either no global normalization or proportional scaling) was used to compare BZR V(T)-p changes in the patients with and without VGB with test-retest data in eight healthy age-matched controls.Occipital GABA levels were increased threefold (without VGB, 1.1+/-0.1 micromol/g with VGB, 2.9+/-0.5 micromol/gA clinically effective dose of VGB caused a threefold increase in tissue GABA levels but was not associated with a substantial BZR downregulation.
