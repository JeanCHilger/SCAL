Striatal dopamine transporter binding assessed by [I-123]IPT and single photon emission computed tomography in patients with early Parkinson's disease: implications for a preclinical diagnosis. Specific binding to dopamine transporters may serve as a tool to detect early loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in patients with Parkinson's disease.To determine striatal dopamine transporter binding using the cocaine analogue [I-123]N-(3-iodopropen-2-yl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chl orophenyl) tropane ([I-123]IPT) and single photon emission computed tomography.We studied 9 control subjects (mean age, 58 years range, 41-69 years) and 28 patients with early Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr stages I [n = 14] and II [n = 14] [symptom duration, <5 years]Specific striatal [I-123] IPT binding (mean +/- SD) was significantly reduced in patients with early Parkinson's disease (ipsilateral striatum: 4.09+/-0.97 range, 2.46-6.40Use of [I-123] IPT and single photon emission computed tomography demonstrates a reduction of dopamine transporter binding in patients with early Parkinson's disease. Significantly reduced IPT binding already observed in the ipsilateral striatum of patients with Hoehn and Yahr stage I demonstrates the potential of this method to detect preclinical disease.
