Global reduction of cerebral glucose metabolism in persons with symptomatic as well as asymptomatic lacunar infarction. To clarify the hemodynamic changes in lacunar infarction, we evaluated cerebral glucose metabolism by using positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) in patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic lacunar infarction and in persons without cerebral infarction on MRI. Subjects in this study were 27 patients with symptomatic lacunar infarction (SCI group), 73 subjects with asymptomatic lacunar infarction (ACI group), and 134 persons without infarction (NC group). CMRgl in the ACI group was significantly lower than that in the NC group in the cerebral cortex (P < 0.05) and thalamus (P < 0.05). CMRgl in the SCI group was significantly reduced from that in the NC group in the cerebral cortex (P < 0.005), basal ganglia (P < 0.001), thalamus (P < 0.05) and white matter (P < 0.005). The reduction in CMRgl in the SCI group was more severe than that in the ACI group in basal ganglia (P < 0.05) and thalamus (P < 0.05). Our results indicated that glucose metabolism in patients with asymptomatic lacunar infarction is reduced throughout the whole brain as compared with non-infarcted elderly persons. Follow-up and treatment of risk factors if present, may be necessary in such patients.
