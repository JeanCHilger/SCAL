Heterogeneity of cerebral blood flow: a fractal approach. We demonstrate the heterogeneity of regional cerebral blood flow using a fractal approach and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Tc-99m-labelled ethylcysteine dimer was injected intravenously in 10 healthy controls and in 10 patients with dementia of frontal lobe type. The head was imaged with a gamma camera and transaxial, sagittal and coronal slices were reconstructed. Two hundred fifty-six symmetrical regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn onto each hemisphere of functioning brain matter. Fractal analysis was used to examine the spatial heterogeneity of blood flow as a function of the number of ROIs.Relative dispersion (= coefficient of variation of the regional flows) was fractal-like in healthy subjects and could be characterized by a fractal dimension of 1.17 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- SD) for the left hemisphere and 1.15 +/- 0.04 for the right hemisphere, respectively. The fractal dimension of 1.0 reflects completely homogeneous blood flow and 1.5 indicates a random blood flow distribution. Patients with dementia of frontal lobe type had a significantly lower fractal dimension of 1.04 +/- 0.03 than in healthy controls.Within the limits of spatial resolution of SPECT, the heterogeneity of brain blood flow is well characterized by a fractal dimension. Fractal analysis may help brain scientists to assess age-, sex- and laterality-related anatomic and physiological changes of brain blood flow and possibly to improve precision of diagnostic information available for patient care.
