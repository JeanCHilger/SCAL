Evidence for impaired presynaptic dopamine function in parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations. We used [18F]6-fluorodopa (FD) positron emission tomography (PET) to examine the severity of nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction in 67 patients with Idiopathic Parkinsonism (IP), 52 with fluctuations and 15 with a stable response to levodopa. FD uptake (Ki) was reduced by 12% in the caudate (p = 0.08) and by 28% in the putamen (p = 0.0004) of patients with fluctuations compared to those with a stable response. However, there was considerable overlap of FD Ki values between the two groups. The fluctuators had a longer symptom duration (11.6 +/- 5.7 years) than the patients with a stable response to levodopa (4.3 +/- 2.4 years p < 0.0001) and the age of onset of symptoms was earlier in the fluctuators (43.9 +/- 8.9 versus 54.1 +/- 10.4
