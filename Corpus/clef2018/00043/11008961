Factor analysis with a priori knowledge--application in dynamic cardiac SPECT. Two factor analysis of dynamic structures (FADS) methods for the extraction of time-activity curves (TACs) from cardiac dynamic SPECT data sequences were investigated. One method was based on a least squares (LS) approach which was subject to positivity constraints. The other method was the well known apex-seeking (AS) method. A post-processing step utilizing a priori information was employed to correct for the non-uniqueness of the FADS solution. These methods were used to extract 99mTc-teboroxime TACs from computer simulations and from experimental canine and patient studies. In computer simulations, the LS and AS methods, which are completely different algorithms, yielded very similar and accurate results after application of the correction for non-uniqueness. FADS-obtained blood curves correlated well with curves derived from region of interest (ROI) measurements in the experimental studies. The results indicate that the factor analysis techniques can be used for semi-automatic estimation of activity curves derived from cardiac dynamic SPECT images, and that they can be used for separation of physiologically different regions in dynamic cardiac SPECT studies.
