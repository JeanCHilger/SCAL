Results of the cooperative protocol (N-III-95) for metastatic relapses and refractory neuroblastoma. Prognosis of relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma is uniformly fatal new therapeutic approaches are needed.Relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma patients were treated with continuous infusion chemotherapy combined with MIBG.Over 4 years, 35 heavily pretreated patients were registered, 29 with bone or/and bone marrow metastases. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was frequent, without toxic deaths. Sixteen patients responded. The probability of 5-year overall survival was 0.19.This approach is feasible and toxicity manageable it rescued some patients and prolonged their survival. It merits assay in newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma patients.
