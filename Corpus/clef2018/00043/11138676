Three-dimensional color-modulated display of myocardial SPECT perfusion distributions accurately assesses coronary artery disease. The objective of this study was to compare visual assessment of 3-dimensional color-modulated (to counts) surface displays with visual assessment of oblique tomographic slices of myocardial SPECT perfusion distributions in the detection and localization of coronary artery disease (CAD).Sixty-two consecutive patients (41 men, 21 women mean age, 61 +/- 11 y) who had undergone conventional dual-isotope perfusion SPECT were retrospectively chosenNo significant differences were found between visual interpretation of 3-dimensional displays and visual interpretation of slices.These preliminary results indicate that visual interpretation of 3-dimensional displays of myocardial perfusion SPECT distributions may someday replace visual assessment of conventional slices without loss of diagnostic accuracy.
