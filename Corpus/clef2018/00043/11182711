Copper-62-pyruvaldehyde bis(N-methyl-thiosemicarbazone) PET imaging in the detection of coronary artery disease in humans. Copper-62 (II)-pyruvaldehyde bis(N(4)-methyl-thiosemicarbazone) (PTSM) has been proposed for cardiac imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). This study evaluated the agreement between Cu-62-PTSM and coronary angiography in the detection of occlusive coronary artery disease. The normalcy rate for Cu-62-PTSM PET in a group of healthy volunteers was also assessed.Forty-five subjects completed the study. Twenty-eight patients underwent stress technetium-99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and cardiac catheterization followed by Cu-62-PTSM rest/dipyridamole stress PET scans, and 17 volunteers underwent Cu-62-PTSM rest/dipyridamole stress PET scans. Cu-62-PTSM myocardial perfusion defects were identified in 100% of patients with 3-vessel disease (n = 8), 100% of patients with 2-vessel disease (n = 9), and 67% of patients with single-vessel disease (n = 6). When considering individual vessels, Cu-62-PTSM perfusion defects were seen in 72% of patients with occlusive disease in the left anterior descending artery territory, 67% in the left circumflex artery territory, and 60% in the right coronary artery territory, respectively. All 17 healthy volunteers had Cu-62-PTSM scans interpreted as normal, for a normalcy rate of 100%.Perfusion abnormalities are demonstrated by means of Cu-62-PTSM PET in 91% of patients with occlusive coronary artery disease seen at the time of cardiac catheterization, and it shows an excellent normalcy rate of 100%.
