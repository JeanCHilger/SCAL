The role of positron emission tomography in skeletal disease. The role of positron emission tomography (PET) in the evaluation and management of skeletal disorders is increasing. A number of reports are available in both benign and malignant disease with a variety of tracers. The bone agent 18F-fluoride can be used to evaluate bone metastases both qualitatively and, for a number of focal and systemic skeletal disorders, quantitatively. 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose is used as a tumor agent in both primary and metastatic bone and bone marrow malignancies its use has also been described in the evaluation of infection within the skeleton. A possible role for the use of the hypoxia selective tracer 18F-fluoromisonidazole in skeletal infection also exists. This article summarizes the current role of PET in the skeleton with regard to these tracers and diseases.
