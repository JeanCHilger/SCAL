Introduction to PET instrumentation. The purpose of this paper is to introduce technologists to the basic principles of PET imaging and to the instrumentation used to acquire PET data. PET imaging is currently being done on a variety of imaging system types, and the technologist will be introduced to these systems and learn about the basic physical image-degrading factors in PET. After reading this article, the technologist should be able to describe the basics of coincidence imaging, identify at least 3 physical degrading factors in PET, and describe 2 different types of PET scanning systems.
