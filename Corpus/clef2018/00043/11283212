Single-photon emission computed tomography in the year 2001: instrumentation and quality control. SPECT instrumentation is more complex than that used for whole-body and planar imaging, and requires careful quality control to ensure optimum performance. Conventional and new hybrid SPECT imaging systems (coincidence and SPECT/CT) will be discussed. New imaging detector materials such as LSO and CZT will also be discussed, along with their potential advantages. Finally, basic SPECT quality control will be reviewed. After reading this article, the nuclear medicine technologist should be able to: (a) explain the use of single and multihead gamma cameras for SPECT imaging (b) have an understanding of the potential of new hybrid SPECT imaging systems
