Making slides of nuclear medicine images using a scanner, personal computer, commercial software, and a laser graphic printer. The process of making slides for presentation of nuclear medicine data has historically used methods that require some photographic expertise. This paper describes the use of readily available software and hardware to achieve the same result. Surface images generated for SPECT images of a normal patient and a patient with Alzheimer's dementia were used to develop the technique described. Images were scanned and processed using commercially available software and a personal computer. Slides were generated by a slide printer and compared with electronic presentations of the same images. The method described is easier than the photographic method used in the past, and the quality of the presentation material (either slide or electronic) is readily predictable.
