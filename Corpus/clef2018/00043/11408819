Distant metastases from cervical esophagus cancer. Cancer of the cervical esophagus has a poor prognosis in relation to stage. Correct staging is thus essential in order to establish the prognosis and the treatment program. Distant metastases can involve the lymph nodes (mediastinal and celiac lymph nodes) or they can be extranodal visceral types. Correct lymph node staging can be performed with esophageal endoscopic ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scan and, currently, with positron emission tomography (PET) and minimally invasive surgery. For hematogenous metastases, CT scan and PET are mainly used, as well as minimally invasive surgery, with the eventual aid of intraoperative ultrasonography.
