Importation of dogs and cats to rabies-free areas of the world. Public pressure from a very mobile society has caused the governments of many rabies-free areas to reevaluate lengthy quarantine systems. In some areas a policy of vaccination, certification, and rabies antibody testing have been implemented to reduce the length of time a dog or cat must spend in quarantine. This has caused an increasing need for pet owners and veterinarians to understand quarantine regulations and shipping methods.
