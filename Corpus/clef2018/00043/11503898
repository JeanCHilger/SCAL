Establishment of the prediction table of parturition day with ultrasonography in small pet dogs. To establish a prediction table of parturition day the real-time B-mode ultrasonographic examinations were performed in the 8 pregnant Malteses and 10 Yorkshire terriers (total pups, 25 and 38 pups, respectively) from 18 days of gestation until the parturition. Ovulation was designated the first day of gestation (day 0). Extra fetal and fetal structures were measured from all conceptues. The parameters that exhibited the best correlation to parturition were used to compile a prediction table of parturition day. To testify the precision of the prediction table of parturition day, the 15 pregnant Malteses (48 pups) and 13 pregnant Yorkshire terriers (42 pups) with unknown mating time were examined using ultrasonography. Inner chorionic cavity diameter on days 18 to 37 and fetal head diameter on day 38 to parturition that showed the best correlation to gestational age were the most pertinent to the estimation of gestational age and the prediction of parturition day. The two parameters were used to compile a prediction table of parturition with averaged regression equations. In verificational examinations, with the exception of I Yorkshire terrier (3.6%) having 1 fetus, 18 of 28 bitches (64.3%) delivered exactly on the date predicted and 9 of 28 bitches (32.1%) delivered within I day of the date predicted. Therefore, the prediction table of parturition day seems to be a useful tool of the prediction of parturition day in practice.
