Is there a role for gastric accommodation and satiety in asymptomatic obese people? The relationships of gastric accommodation and satiety in moderately obese individuals are unclear. We hypothesized that obese people had increased gastric accommodation and reduced postprandial satiety. The objective of this study was to compare gastric accommodation and satiety between obese and non-obese asymptomatic subjects.In 13 obese (body mass index [BMI] > or = 30 kg/m(2) mean BMI, 37.0 +/- 4.9 kg/m(2)) and 19 non-obese control subjects (BMI < 30 kg/m(2)Total fasting and postprandial gastric volumes and the ratio of postprandial/fasting gastric volume were not different between asymptomatic obese and control subjects. However, the fasting volume of the distal stomach was greater in obese than in control subjects. Maximum tolerable volume of ingested Ensure and aggregate symptom score 30 minutes later were also not different between obese and control subjects.Asymptomatic obese individuals (within the BMI range of 32.6 to 48 kg/m(2)) did not show either increased postprandial gastric accommodation or reduced satiety. These data suggest that gastric accommodation is unlikely to provide an important contribution to development of moderate obesity.
