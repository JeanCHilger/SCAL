Glucose uptake and glycogen levels are increased in pig heart after repetitive ischemia. Repetitive myocardial ischemia increases glucose uptake, but the effect on glycogen is unclear. Thirteen swine instrumented with a hydraulic occluder on the circumflex (Cx) artery underwent 10-min occlusions twice per day for 4 days. After 24 h postfinal ischemia and in the fasted state, echocardiogram and positron emission tomography imaging for blood flow ([(13)N]-ammonia) and 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake were obtained. Tissue was then collected for ATP, creatine phosphate (CP), glycogen, and glucose transporter-4 content, and hexokinase activity. After reperfusion, regional function and CP-to-ATP ratios in the Cx and remote regions were similar. Despite the absence of stunning, the Cx region demonstrated higher glycogen levels (33 +/- 11 vs. 24 +/- 11 micromol/g P < 0.05), and this increase correlated well with the increase in FDG uptake (r(2) = 0.78
