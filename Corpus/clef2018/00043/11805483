Intrathoracic and intra-abdominal Tl-201 abnormalities seen on rotating raw cine data on dual radionuclide myocardial perfusion and gated SPECT. The lower thorax and upper abdomen are visualized during cardiac acquisition of rest Tl-201 and stress Tc-99m tetrofosmin gated SPECT. Thus, abnormal Tl-201 localization in these areas and in organs such as parts of the lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys can be observed, including rotating raw cine data.Other than cardiac images, the authors retrospectively reviewed Tl-201 rotating (raw data) images of 235 patients. Abnormal findings in the lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys were identified that correlated with the patients' clinical information radiographic findings, including computed tomography and ultrasonography of the abdomenIn 53 patients, 54 abnormalities were detected. Intrathoracic abnormalities included focal areas of increased uptake, one in the right lower lung and another in the right upper lung that confirmed lung cancer, in 2 patients diffuse uptake in both lungs in 11 patientsDiscernible intrathoracic and intra-abdominal abnormalities using rotating raw cine data from imaging in three-dimensional displays include diffuse or focal pulmonary uptake, pleural effusion, elevation of a hemidiaphragm, splenomegaly, increased uptake in the gastric area, renal abnormalities including absent or small kidneys, end-stage renal disease, renal scarring, renal cyst(s), and lower position of a kidney. The incidental finding of such abnormalities may prompt further clinical investigation.
