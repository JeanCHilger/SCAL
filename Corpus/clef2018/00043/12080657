Study on combined clinical manifestation and myocardial perfusion imaging with 99mTc-MIBI SPECT for diagnosing myocarditis. In 568 cases suffering from upper-respiratory tract infection with sore throat and more than one of following clinical manifestations: arrhythmia, heart failure and chest pain or oppressive sensation over the chest(Group A), and another 108 cases without above clinical manifestations(Group B), myocardial perfusion imaging with 99mTc-MIBI SPECT was studied. The results revealed that the imaging in 404 cases (71.12%) of Group A supported diagnosis of myocarditis, but only 6 cases(5.56%) did so in Group B. Because of lacking the clinical manifestations of myocarditis but positive finding of CVB-IgM antibody was detected in their sera, we considered that the positive SPECT imaging in these six cases of Group B belonged to myocardial reaction due to virus infection. It was possible that some of them were suffering from subclinical type of myocarditis.
