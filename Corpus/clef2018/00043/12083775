Behavior of fluorinated analogs of L-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)alanine and L-threo-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)serine as substrates for Dopa decarboxylase. We have determined the kinetic parameters for Dopa decarboxylase (DDC) of three ring-fluorinated analogs of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa). The rank order of catalytic efficiency of decarboxylation (k(cat)/K(m)) is Dopa>6-F-Dopa>2-F-Dopa>5-F-Dopa. This rank is consistent with previous in vivo and in vitro studies which indicate that, of the fluorinated analogs, 6-F-Dopa has pharmacokinetics that are most suited for positron emission tomographic (PET) evaluation of dopamine function. The effectiveness of PET as a diagnostic tool, the convenient half-life of (18)F (110 min) and the favorable pharmacokinetics of 6-[(18)F]FDOPA have combined to make this an extremely valuable reagent to study dopaminergic activity. The reactions of the related fluorinated DOPS analogs show that, while 6-F-threo-3,4-(dihydroxyphenyl)serine (DOPS) is decarboxylated at approximately the same rate as the non-fluorinated substrate, 2-F-threo-DOPS is not converted into the corresponding amine. In both cases a Pictet-Spengler condensation with the pyridoxal 5(')-phosphate (PLP) cofactor occurs to produce tetrahydroisoquinolines. Condensation of fluorinated catecholamines and catechol amino acids with endogenous aldehydes will be investigated as an approach to study possible mechanisms of L-Dopa-linked neurotoxicity.
