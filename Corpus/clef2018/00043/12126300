Circadian gating of photoinduction of commitment to cell-cycle transitions in relation to photoperiodic control of cell reproduction in Euglena. A novel type of circadian and photoperiodic control of the cell division cycle was found in photoautotrophic Euglena gracilis. When algae entrained to 24 h light-dark (LD) cycles (14 h L) were transferred to continuous darkness (DD) at the eighth hour of the final LD photoperiod, cell-cycle transition was arrested in phase G1, S or G2. The subsequent exposure of these dark-arrested cells to a 6 h light-break allowed the dark-arrested cells to undergo cell-cycle progression in DD, in a manner dependent on the circadian phase maximum photoinduction occurred around dusk. Inhibitor experiments suggested that the photoinduced commitment of G2 cells to cell division required light for a signal originating in noncyclic photosynthetic electron transport (PET), particularly cytochrome b6-f but not for the metabolic energy required by the process. The fact that the circadian rhythm of photoinduction ran out-of-phase from that of noncyclic PET signaling suggests that the site of regulation by the former rhythm is downstream of noncyclic PET. The occurrence of maximum photoinduction around dusk suggests that the 'external coincidence' model of photoperiodic induction describes the activation of the photoinductive phase. Further evidence supporting this hypothesis is the relationship between cell reproduction and day length
