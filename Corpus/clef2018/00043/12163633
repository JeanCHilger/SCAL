Comparison of PET with radioactive microspheres to assess pulmonary blood flow. Microsphere technique is the reference for assessment of pulmonary blood flow (PBF) but is destructive PET, however, can determine PBF noninvasively. Comparisons of these 2 methods are scanty. Our study aimed at comparing these 2 techniques using a mathematic model taking into account the right ventricle in determining the transit time of a tracer through lung tissue.Ten normal pigs were investigated at baseline, during dobutamine infusion, and during 10 cm H(2)O of positive end-expiratory pressure. Under each condition, PBF was successively measured with PET (PET-PBF) and radioactive microspheres (MS-PBF). For PET-PBF, 2 mCi (74 MBq) (15)O-labeled water were injected intravenously over 20 s and PET scanning was performed for 10 min. The input function was determined noninvasively from PET and invasively from mixed venous blood withdrawals. PET-PBF was computed using a mathematic model taking into account the right ventricle in determining the transit time of the tracer through lung tissue. For MS-PBF, 1 given isotope was injected under a given condition. PET-PBF and MS-PBF for 5 lung regions were compared.PET-PBF significantly correlated with MS-PBF both over all experimental points (PET-PBF = 0.79. MS-PBF + 1,538 r = 0.79PBF can accurately be assessed using PET and a mathematic model taking into account the right ventricle in determining the transit time of a tracer through lung tissue. Noninvasive determination of the input function of the right ventricle is accurate and can readily be used for clinical applications.
