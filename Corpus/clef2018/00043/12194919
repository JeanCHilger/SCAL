Single-point cardiac troponin T at coronary care unit discharge after myocardial infarction correlates with infarct size and ejection fraction. One of the major concerns in replacing creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) with cardiac troponins is the lack of evidence of the ability of troponins to estimate the size of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We investigated the ability of a single measurement of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) at coronary care unit (CCU) discharge to estimate infarct size and assess left ventricular (LV) function in AMI patients.We studied 65 AMI patients in whom infarct size was estimated by CK-MB peak concentrations and gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion using technetium-99m sestamibi and LV function by SPECT imaging. Measurements of cTnT and SPECT were performed 72 h (median) after admission (range, 40-160 h). SPECT was also repeated 3 months later.We found a significant correlation between cTnT and both the peak CK-MB concentrations (r = 0.76 P <0.001) and the perfusion defect size at SPECT (r = 0.62A single cTnT measurement at CCU discharge after AMI is useful as a noninvasive estimate of infarct size and for the assessment of LV function in routine clinical setting.
