Rat studies comparing 11C-FMAU, 18F-FLT, and 76Br-BFU as proliferation markers. We analyzed and compared 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-[methyl-(11)C]thymine ((11)C-FMAU), 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) and 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-[(76)Br]bromouracil ((76)Br-BFU) with respect to tissue uptake, DNA incorporation, and excretion modulation in rats. The goal of the investigation was to evaluate the efficiency of the 3 nucleoside tracers as potential tracers for measuring proliferation.Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups and administered 5 MBq (11)C-FMAU, 1 MBq (18)F-FLT, or 2 MBq (76)Br-BFU. For each tracer, a subgroup was also administered 6 mg/kg cimetidine. The rats in the (11)C-FMAU group were killed at 5, 20, 40, 60, and 80 min after injection the rats in the (18)F-FLT group were killed at 80 min and 2 and 4 hMaximal uptake of radioactivity was seen in the spleen and intestine, organs with active DNA synthesis. The highest relative radioactivity uptake was at 60 min in the (11)C-FMAU groups and at 4 h in the (18)F-FLT group. In the (76)Br-BFU group, the uptake increased gradually during the observation period, and uptake of radioactivity increased markedly in rats receiving cimetidine. Cimetidine did not affect radioactivity uptake in the (11)C-FMAU or (18)F-FLT groups. The fraction of radioactivity in DNA was 78% in spleen at 60 min in the (11)C-FMAU group, 80% at 60 min and 97% at 4 h in the (76)Br-BFU group. The DNA-incorporation was only 2% in the (18)F-FLT group.(76)Br-BFU predominantly incorporates into DNA and has great potential as a PET tracer for the assessment of proliferation in vivo. (11)C-FMAU also may have potential as a proliferation marker, but the observation time is limited. (18)F-FLT does not incorporate into DNA and is therefore not a direct marker of proliferation.
