Clinical validation of simultaneous dual-isotope myocardial scintigraphy. Simultaneous dual-isotope (rest thallium-201/stress technetium-99m sestamibi) myocardial single-photon emission tomography (SPET) would be an ideal procedure however, (99m)Tc cross-talk on the (201)Tl window hampers its routine use. Photon energy recovery (PER) is a spectral deconvolution technique validated for scatter and cross-talk removal in phantom studies and a limited series of patients. In this study we aimed to validate the technique in 295 patients within a context of clinical routine practice. Conventional separate rest (201)Tl myocardial SPET data sets were visually compared with simultaneous dual-isotope data sets corrected by PER. Conventional separate rest (201)Tl data sets were identical to dual PER-corrected (201)Tl data sets in 173 (58.6%) patients. As dual PER (201)Tl data sets are corrected for (99m)Tc cross-talk but also for (201)Tl scatter, they were compared with separate rest (201)Tl data sets corrected by PER in the 122 discordant patients. No difference was found in 77 (26.1%) patients. In 26 (8.8%) patients, the difference consisted in the presence of a defect on dual PER (201)Tl data sets only, mirroring an ischaemic defect on (99m)Tc-sestamibi data sets. This difference can be attributed to the influence of stress on the kinetics of (201)Tl injected at rest. In the remaining 19 (6.4%) patients, the difference between separate and simultaneous PER-corrected data sets was scored as mild in 11 and moderate in eight patients and seemed to be related to multiple methodological factors. It is concluded that PER correctly removes (99m)Tc cross-talk. With the addition of an appropriate attenuation correction, the PER technique may allow the routine use of simultaneous dual-isotope myocardial scintigraphy in the near future.
