18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography: a new explorative perspective. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) is a new functional imaging technique available for clinical and experimental use. 18F-FDG-PET studies can be used for screening, localization and follow-up of hypermetabolic processes including malignancies, infections and autoimmune processes. For several years it has been applied in oncological, cardiological and neurological patients, but nowadays an increasing number of studies favours its use in patients with autoimmune diseases including large vessel arteritis. From the experimental view, this technique has even become more important since the introduction of a small PET scanner for the use in animal models. This review focuses on technical aspects, clinical experiences and experimental and future perspectives of 18F-FDG-PET, with a special emphasis on large vessel vasculitis and other autoimmune diseases.
