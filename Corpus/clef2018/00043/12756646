Neuroimaging in patients with head injury. Head trauma affects thousands of people every year. Neuroimaging techniques provide some of the most important diagnostic, prognostic, and pathophysiological information in the management of brain injury. Anatomical imaging modalities can help assess intracranial hemorrhage, fractures, and other structural lesions. Functional imaging has been shown to be helpful in assessing the areas of the brain affected by the trauma as well as determining long term prognosis and rehabilitation potential. This article will review the current uses of neuroimaging techniques in head trauma and delineate future applications.
