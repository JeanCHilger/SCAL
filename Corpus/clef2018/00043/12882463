Pet- and pollen-induced upper airway symptoms in farmers and in nonfarmers. The effect of farming on the risk of upper airway symptoms is not clear. In this cross-sectional, population-based study, 198 female farmers, 50 nonfarmers living on a farm, and 218 nonfarmers not living on a farm, filled in a symptom questionnaire and underwent skin-prick testing with common and agricultural allergens. In the logistic regression analysis, the latter group served as a control. Several adjustments were made, including childhood farming environment. Current farming was found to decrease the risks of pet- and pollen-induced upper airway symptoms, dose-dependently with the intensity and duration of animal husbandry. Including skin-test positivity to pets in the regression models did not affect the negative association between farming and pet-induced symptoms. In contrast, animal husbandry increased the risk of farm work-induced upper airway symptoms. Animal husbandry often induces work-related upper airway symptoms. However, the present study among female adults suggests that it may also decrease the risk of pet- and pollen-induced upper airway symptoms.
