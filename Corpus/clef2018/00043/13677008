Animals helping people. People helping animals. Interview by Shirley A. Smoyak. 1. Counseling in the Country at the Gress Mountain Ranch provides both educational programs (i.e., animal-assisted activities) and counseling sessions (i.e., animal-assisted therapy). 2. Animals who participate in the educational and counseling sessions include Great Pyrenees, cats, goats, horses, and mules. 3. Animals help people develop trust and overcome shyness. Sometimes the process is reciprocal. 4. Animals develop "specialist" roles, such as greeter or calming agent, and help people cope with their illnesses. Interacting with animals builds individuals' confidence and enhances their social skills.
