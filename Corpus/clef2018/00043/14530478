Prognostic implications of combined prone and supine acquisitions in patients with equivocal or abnormal supine myocardial perfusion SPECT. Although acquisition of (99m)Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) with the patient in the prone position is commonly used to minimize attenuation artifacts, the impact of combined prone and supine imaging on the prognostic evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been determined. The prognostic implications of MPS obtained in both prone and supine positions in patients with perfusion defects on supine MPS were evaluated.We studied 3,834 patients who were monitored for 24.2 +/- 6.0 mo after rest (201)Tl/stress (99m)Tc-sestamibi MPS acquired during 1994-1995, when prone acquisition was performed only in patients with inferior wall perfusion defects that might represent attenuation or motion artifact.During follow-up, there were 132 hard events (cardiac death or myocardial infarction) and 375 total events (hard events or late myocardial revascularization). Overall, patients who underwent prone and supine acquisitions had similar characteristics to those who underwent supine-only imaging, with the exception of being more commonly male. In multivariable analysis, there were similar independent predictors for hard events and total events the type of acquisition (prone and supine or supine-only) was not a significant predictor of either of these outcome events. After risk adjustment, the predicted event rates were nearly identical for patients undergoing prone and supine compared with supine-only studies. Both observed and predicted hard event rates of patients with normal prone and supine versus supine-only imaging were very low (observed, 0.7%/y and 0.5%/y, respectivelyPatients with inferior wall defects on supine MPS that are not present on prone MPS have a low risk of subsequent cardiac events, similar to that of patients with normal supine-only studies.
