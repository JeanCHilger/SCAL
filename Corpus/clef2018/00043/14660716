Whole-body (18)F-FDG PET improves the management of patients with small cell lung cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of whole-body (18)F-FDG PET on staging and managing patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC).The treatment records of 42 consecutive patients (27 men, 15 women mean age, 62 yFor 12 of 42 patients (29%), PET results changed the patient's management. In 8 patients (19%), PET resulted in a change of radiation therapy because of the detection of previously unknown tumor foci. Adjuvant radiation therapy was cancelled in 3 patients. A change of radiation field and volume was necessary in 5 patients. In 1 patient, PET results excluded extensive disease, which permitted surgical resection of the tumor. Chemotherapy was discontinued in 2 patients and restarted in 1 patient on the basis of the PET findings. In 5 patients (12%), PET excluded malignancy as the suspicious lesions found with conventional cross-sectional imaging did not take up (18)F-FDG.The results of this study show that (18)F-FDG PET has a major impact on the management of patients with SCLC, influencing both the stage and the management in 29% of patients. PET is a highly valuable tool for accurate target definition of radiation treatment by reducing the probability of overlooking involved areas.
