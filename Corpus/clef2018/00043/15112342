Correlation of expression of multidrug resistance protein and messenger RNA with 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) imaging in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. To explore whether P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and other pumps, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) and lung resistance protein (LRP), could affect tumor accumulation and efflux of 99mTc-MIBI in liver cancer.Surgically treated 78 liver cancer patients were included in this study. Before surgery, 99mTc-MIBI SPECT was performed 15 min and 120 min after injection of 20 mCi 99mTc-MIBI, respectively. Early uptake, delayed uptake (L/Nd), and washout rate (L/Nwr) of 99mTc-MIBI were obtained. Expressions of Pgp, MRP and LRP were investigated with Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Messenger RNA (mRNA) level of Pgp, MRP and LRP was determined by RT-PCR.No 99mTc-MIBI uptakes in tumor lesions of 68 of 78 (87.2%) patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were found on 99mTc-MIBI SPECT. P-gp expression was observed in tumor tissues of the patients with no uptake of 99mTc-MIBI (P<0.017). No appreciable correlation was found between liver cancer 99mTc-MIBI images and expression of MRP or LRP on the level of protein or mRNA.99mTc-MIBI SPECT is noninvasive, and useful in predicting the presence of MDR1 gene-encoded Pgp in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
