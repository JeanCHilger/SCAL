Retrospective fusion of radiographic and MR data for localization of subdural electrodes. Prior to epilepsy surgery, subdural electrodes are often implanted and monitored for a few days to identify the focus of abnormal electrical activity. During the implantation and subsequent brain resection, there may be uncertainty about the exact location of the electrodes with respect to features of brain anatomy such as specific gyral convolutions or lesions. In experiments with a phantom and patients, implanted electrodes were imaged with multiplanar skull radiographs (or CT scans). After retrospective registration with preimplantation MR data, the electrodes were mapped from these studies onto an MR-derived three-dimensional brain model. The resulting multimodality displays showed the relationship of the electrodes to brain anatomy. In one patient the position of each electrode with respect to a metabolic lesion was also displayed by mapping preimplantation PET data onto the same brain model. This new display of electrode positions may strengthen the interpretation of subdural electrical recordings and thereby reduce uncertainty in planning the resection of epileptic tissue.
