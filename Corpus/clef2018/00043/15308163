MicroPET-based pharmacokinetic analysis of the radiolabeled boron compound [18F]FBPA-F in rats with F98 glioma. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is one of the effective methods of radiation therapy for the treatment of tumors such as malignant glioma. Boronophenylalanine ((10)B-BPA) solution has been used as a potential boron carrier for such a treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate 4-borono-2-[(18)F]-fluoro-l-phenylalanine-fructose ([(18)F]FBPA-F) in rats injected in the brain with glioma using in vivo small animal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (microPET). Male Fischer 344 rats with F98 glioma in the left brain were used for these studies. Dynamic PET imaging of [(18)F]FBPA-F was performed on the 13th day after tumor inoculation. Arterial blood sampling was performed to obtain an input function for tracer kinetic modeling. The accumulation ratios of [(18)F]FBPA-F for the glioma-to-normal brain approached 3. The uptake characteristics of BPA-F and [(18)F]FBPA-F were similar. The results indicate that 4h after BPA-F injection would be the optimal irradiation time for BNCT. Rate constants were estimated using a three-compartment model. This study provides useful information for the clinical application of BNCT in patients with brain tumors.
