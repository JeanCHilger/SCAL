Accuracy of measurement of left ventricular volume and ejection fraction by new real-time three-dimensional echocardiography in patients with wall motion abnormalities secondary to myocardial infarction. Three-dimensional echocardiography is an ideal tool for the measurement of left ventricular (LV) volume because no geometric assumptions about LV shape are needed. The introduction of new real-time 3-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE) has allowed rapid acquisition of a 3-dimensional dataset with good image quality. The purpose of this study was to examine the accuracy of RT3DE for the measurement of LV volume and ejection fraction in patients with wall motion abnormalities by using quantitative gated single-photon emission computed tomography (QGSPECT) as a reference standard. The study population consisted of 25 consecutive patients with wall motion abnormalities who underwent LV volume measurement by 2-dimensional echocardiography and by QGSPECT. LV volume and ejection fraction by RT3DE were measured offline by using the average rotation method. In 23 of 25 patients (92%), it was possible to measure 3-dimensional volume with RT3DE. RT3DE correlated well with QGSPECT in the measurement of end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume (r = 0.97, mean difference 3.4 ml r = 0.98, mean difference 2.0 ml, respectively), 2-dimensional echocardiography also correlated with QGSPECT but underestimated LV volume (r = 0.98, mean difference 21.1 ml
