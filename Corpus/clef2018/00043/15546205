Multimodality in vivo molecular-genetic imaging. Multimodality imaging is increasingly being used in molecular-genetic studies in small animals. The coupling of nuclear and optical reporter genes represents the beginning of a far wider application of this technology. Optical imaging and optical reporter systems are cost-effective and time-efficient, they require less resources and space than PET or MRI, and they are particularly well suited for small animal imaging and for in vitro assays to validate different reporter systems. However, optical imaging techniques are limited by depth of light penetration and scatter and do not yet provide optimal quantitative or tomographic information. These issues are not limiting for PET- or MRI-based reporter systems, and PET- and MRI-based animal studies are more easily generalized to human applications. Many of the shortcomings of each modality alone can be overcome by the use of dual- or triple-modality reporter constructs that incorporate the opportunity for PET, fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging. We optimistically expect that some form of tomographic, small animal optical imaging capability will be developed soon, and that this will provide the opportunity for the colocalization of optical signals to anatomical structures provided by tomographic CT and MR imaging.
