Blinded clinical evaluation of positron emission tomography for diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of positron emission tomography for diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease under conditions similar to those encountered in the routine clinical practice of nuclear medicine. We obtained tomographic images of regional cerebral blood flow from three groups of subjects: (1) 13 subjects, ages 69 to 84, who had probable Alzheimer's disease diagnosed by validated clinical criteria (2) 15 subjects, ages 57 to 77, who had Parkinson's disease without dementia
