Silent myocardial ischemia: recent developments. Silent myocardial ischemia is now in its fourth decade of recognition as a clinical syndrome within the spectrum of coronary artery disease. Prior decades have seen important research into the pathophysiology, detection, prevalence, prognosis, and therapy of this syndrome. More recent developments have continued to add data to each of these areas, with particular emphasis on the comparative value of various diagnostic procedures and the effect of therapy on prognosis. While controversy still exists concerning proper screening guidelines for the asymptomatic population, there is a growing consensus that some form of stress testing in high-risk individuals (ie, those with multiple coronary risk factors) is appropriate.
