CBF studies with Xenon-133 in arteriovenous malformations: a methodological study. A new model for the two dimensional rCBF technique using the inhalation of Xenon 133 was tested in patients with arteriovenous malformations. It was hypothetized that, in contrast to the conventional CBF model, it corrects for the artifactual shunt flow through the AVM and thus yields physiological CBF data. Four regions of interest (AVM, contralateral to AVM, ipsilateral hemisphere, contralateral hemisphere) were defined in 17 patients with AVMs and analyzed for differences in grey matter flow (F1). In contrast to the conventional CBF model, the new model shows a decreased flow over the AVM area, corresponding to the results of Xenon CT and SPECT. Furthermore, the blood pool parameter P4 is very sensitive to the location of the AVM. Thus further investigations of the hemodynamics of AVMs with this model are encouraged.
