Neuroimaging of ischemia and infarction. Since the introduction of thrombolytic therapy as the foundation of acute stroke treatment, neuroimaging has rapidly advanced to empower therapeutic decision making. Diffusion-weighted imaging is the most sensitive and accurate method for stroke detection, and, allied with perfusion-weighted imaging, provides information on the functional status of the ischemic brain. It can also help to identify a response to thrombolytic and neuroprotective therapies. Additionally, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging, including magnetic resonance angiography, offers information on stroke mechanism and pathophysiology that can guide long-term medical management. Multimodal computed tomography is a comprehensive, cost-effective, and safe stroke imaging modality that can be easily implemented in the emergency ward and that offers fast and reliable information with respect to the arterial and functional status of the ischemic brain. Accessibility, contraindications, cost, speed, and individual patient-determined features influence which is the best imaging modality to guide acute stroke management.
