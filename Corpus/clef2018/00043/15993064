Radiosynthesis of carbon-11-labeled camptothecin derivatives as potential positron emission tomography tracers for imaging of topoisomerase I in cancers. Four carbon-11-labeled camptothecin derivatives, 9-[11C]methoxy-20(S)-camptothecin ([11C]5), 10-[11C]methoxy-20(S)-camptothecin ([11C]7), 9-nitro-10-[11C]methoxy-20(S)-camptothecin ([11C]9), and 9-[([11C]trimethylamino)methyl]-10-hydroxy-20(S)-camptothecin ([11C]11), have been synthesized as potential positron emission tomography tracers for imaging of topoisomerase I in cancers.
