Analytical algorithms improving the reconstruction of SPECT image. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a cost-effective, widely-used diagnostic modality for the assessment of cardiac and cerebral functions. However, most SPECT protocols for clinical use support only qualitative reconstruction. Its lack of quantitative capability compromises the accurate evaluation of diseases. Quantitative SPECT by simultaneous compensation for different degradation factors is in great demand and should improve the diagnosis greatly. The variety of the existing SPECT algorithm can be split into a family of analytical methods and a wide class of iterative techniques. By reviewing the research work published in the past decades, this paper tries to make a state of arts and comprehensive outline of efficient, analytical solutions to SPECT reconstruction problem, which could compensate scatter, photon attenuation, and detector response, as well as suppression of Poisson noise, respectively.
