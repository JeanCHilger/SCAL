Effectiveness of percutaneous intervention for patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease. Seven patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and single-vessel coronary artery disease underwent percutaneous revascularization of the coronary lesion in addition to alcohol septal ablation therapy for dynamic outflow tract obstruction. One year later, there was a significant reduction of dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and no clinical evidence of restenosis.
