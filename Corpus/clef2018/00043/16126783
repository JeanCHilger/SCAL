Effects of pre-eclampsia on maternal plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and umbilical cord urotensin II concentrations: a pilot study. Urotensin II (UII) is the most potent endogenous vasoconstrictor identified to date. Pre-eclampsia is associated with arteriolar vasospasm but the precise underlying mechanism is uncertain and we hypothesized that UII concentrations might also be elevated. In this study we measured UII concentrations in maternal plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and umbilical vein plasma from pre-eclamptic (PET) and normotensive patients undergoing elective Caesarean section under spinal or combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia.With LREC approval and informed consent we recruited two groups of 10 patients control [mean (range) age, 29 (22-43) yrTwo plasma and two CSF samples in the control and two CSF samples in the PET group were below the assay detection limits. There were no differences in maternal plasma or CSF or umbilical vein UII concentrations between the groups. However, there was a small ( approximately 40%) but significant increase in cord UII concentrations when compared with paired plasma in the PET group. There was a weak but significant negative correlation (r=-0.4, P=0.049) between cord UII concentrations and gestation in the PET group. In addition, we observed a significant positive correlation between plasma and CSF (r(2)=+0.57, P=0.0009, n=16), plasma and cord (r(2)=+0.43, P=0.0031, n=18) and CSF and cord (r(2)=+0.32, P=0.022, n=16) UII concentrations for the whole data set.Collectively the data indicate that UII concentrations do not increase in PET compared with controls but, in PET patients, cord UII concentrations are elevated relative to paired plasma samples. Elevated umbilical vein UII concentrations may simply indicate reduced placental viability and possibly UII metabolism as a result of reduced blood flow or possibly that the placenta is producing UII.
