(99m)Tc-HmPAO single photon emission tomography, magnetic resonance proton spectroscopy and neuropsychological testing in evaluation of carbon monoxide neurotoxicity. There were 10 acutely CO poisoned study patients without CNS history (head traumas, epilepsy, dementia, migraine or alcoholic diseases) in whom (99m)Tc-HmPAO SPET, HMRS and neuropsychological testing were performed. 99mTc-HmPAO SPET and neuropsychological testing were performed twice: in acute phase and at six months post CO exposure. HMRS was carried out at 8 months post CO exposure. A multidimensional analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to statistical analysis. Regional CBF disturbances in acute phase of CO poisoning were observed in frontal cortex, basal ganglia and parietal cortex respectively. The most reversible, as seen in control (99m)Tc-HmPAO SPET examination, were the changes observed in parietal cortex. Diffuse generalized cortex hypoperfusion, both in acute phase and at 6 months post exposure, was seen only in one the patient. In all of the examined patients different elevation in mobile lipid or/and lactate concentration in frontal lobe or/and basal ganglia was revealed by HMRS evaluation at eight months post acute CO exposure. Results of neuropsychological testing at baseline and at 6 months partially correlated with neuro-imagine techniques applied.
