Integration and expression of beta-endoglucanase I from Trichoderma reesei in brewing yeast. An integration plasmid pA15-PET for expression and secretion of beta-Endoglucanase I (EG I ) in yeast was constructed by insertion of EG I cDNA between yeast alcohol dehydrogenase promoter and terminator region. The plasmid contained part of yeast rDNA sequence, which was used as a homologous fragment for integration. The EG I cDNA was introduced into an engineered brewing yeast BE9711 containing alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase (alpha-ALDC) encoding gene and integrated onto its rDNA sequence of chromosomal DNA by co-transformation of pA15-PET and a YEP type plasmid pA15TXR carrying G418 resistance. The stable engineered brewing yeast expressing intracellulase alpha-ALDC and extracellular EG I simultaneously were obtained.
