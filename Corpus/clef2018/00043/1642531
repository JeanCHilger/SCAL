Diagnosis of myocardial contusion. Quantitative analysis of single photon emission computed tomographic scans. Prior studies from our institution have shown that single photon emission computed tomography is sensitive (100%) in predicting patients at risk for serious arrhythmias. However, the positive predictive value is low (15% to 20%). The purpose of this study was to determine if quantitative analysis of single photon emission computed tomographic defects could improve predictive value. One hundred seventy-five patients with positive single photon emission computed tomographic scans were studied. One hundred two patients developed arrhythmias, 42 of which were ventricular. Arrhythmias were associated with all defect loci and all defect sizes. The incidence of arrhythmias did increase with increasing size. Patients were at risk for arrhythmias up to 72 hours after trauma. The value of single photon emission computed tomography is its ability to predict patients at risk for arrhythmias. This study shows that any single photon emission computed tomographic defect, regardless of location or size, is a significant predictor of arrhythmias.
