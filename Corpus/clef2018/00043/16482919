Correlation of the cognitive function and the duration of the illness with the regional cerebral blood flow in the patients with Parkinson's disease: objective evaluation using stereotactic extraction estimation analysis in 123I-IMP SPECT. To investigate the correlation of the cognitive function and the duration of the illness with the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), by means of an objective diagnostic index of brain imaging, stereotactic extraction estimation (SEE) of 123I-IMP SPECT.We examined 123I-IMP SPECT in 24 patients with PD (age = 71.79 +/- 5.18 years the Mini-Mental State Examination: MMSE score = 21.46 +/- 7.62 pointsThere were negative correlations between the MMSE score and Z*extent ratio in the temporal (p < 0.05) and posterior cingulate cortices (p < 0.05), and positive correlations between the duration of the illness and Z*extent ratio in the frontal (p < 0.01), temporal (p < 0.01), parietal (p < 0.05) and posterior cingulate cortices (p < 0.01). Z*extent ratio was significantly high only in the posterior cingulate cortex(p < 0.05) in the demented group.SEE for Z-score images of 3D-SSP revealed a close relationship between the decline of the MMSE score and the duration of the illness, and the perfusion reduction of the posterior cingulate cortex in patients with PD. These findings suggest that the perfusion reduction of the posterior cingulate cortex reflects the decline of cognitive impairment of patients with PD.
