Carcinoma of unknown primary site. Carcinoma of unknown primary site is a common clinical syndrome, accounting for 2% of cancer patients. Diagnosis is a recurrent challenge for internists. Treatment is difficult and prognosis is still poor. This review presents one synthesis of diagnosis strategies and therapeutic trials. It envisages the interest of new molecular biology methods as well as therapeutic perspectives.Pathologic examination completed with immunohistochemical tests, and, depending on cases, with electron microscopy, cytogenetics, and molecular biology is a key-point for diagnosis. Diagnosis work-up, based on histological type and on individualization of some clinical presentation, proceeds in three steps. Positron emission tomography is recommended when a curative treatment is planed, particularly in cases of isolated metastasis. Functional status analysed using the performance status and simple biologic parameters (serum lactate dehydrogenase, serum alkaline phosphatase) permit us to assess prognosis. Chemotherapy is offered for patients with a good general health status.Further evaluation of positron emission tomography, as well as cost-benefit analyses, is warranted. Further randomised trials are necessary to determine the optimal chemotherapy regimen in good-risk patients and the interest of chemotherapy in patients with poor-risk disease. Gene expression profiling and proteomic evaluation, as well as pharmacogenomic offer new investigation fields.
