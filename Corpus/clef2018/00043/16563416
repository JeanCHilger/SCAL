Production of microsized PMMA droplets using electrospraying with various auxiliary fields. To fabricate uniform nano/microsized beads using the electrospraying process, poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) polymer solution is ejected from a reservoir tip to form suspended droplets using the force of a controllable syringe pump. Using a newly designed electrode connected to the nozzle and a field-controllable target electrode, we obtained uniform microsized beads of the solution. Moreover, by using a two-axis x-y stage, we could obtain selective coverage of microsized PMMA droplets on an insulating PET film. To clarify the effect of the applied field conditions, the droplets deposited on a dielectric substrate were characterized under an optical microscope.
