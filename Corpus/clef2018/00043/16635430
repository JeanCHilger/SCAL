Recent advances in the treatment of oligodendrogliomas. The optimal treatment for patients with oligodendrogliomas is unknown, and current management strategies remain controversial. This past year, further exploration of the molecular genetics of the tumors and its prognostic implications for outcome, evaluation of the utility of positron emission tomography imaging, and the role of radiation and chemotherapy in the treatment of oligodendrogliomas have been reported. It is becoming increasingly apparent that oligodendrogliomas are several distinct diseases on a molecular level, and that key genetic derangements can signify a response to treatment and favorable outcome. The added contributions of recent publications consolidates these emerging impressions. Ultimately, the combination of improved imaging techniques, molecular profiling, and new therapies should result in improved outcome with reduced treatment-related toxicity for patients with newly diagnosed, progressive, and recurrent oligodendrogliomas.
