MR imaging and MIBG scintigraphy of pheochromocytomas and extraadrenal functioning paragangliomas. To compare the potential of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and scintigraphy performed with radiotracer-labeled metaiodobenzyl-guanidine (MIBG) in localization and characterization of functioning paragangliomas, the authors analyzed results of both modalities in 33 patients. Overall sensitivity for detection was 91% for MR imaging and 80% for MIBG scintigraphy. MR imaging demonstrated 100% of adrenal paragangliomas and 75% of extraadrenal paragangliomas, whereas MIBG scintigraphy revealed 75% and 88%, respectively. MIBG scintigraphy was more specific in the characterization of paragangliomas than MR imaging (100% vs 82%). However, MR imaging demonstrated nine other lesions not seen on scintigrams. On the basis of their results and other considerations, the authors believe MR imaging is the preferred initial technique when a functioning paraganglioma is suspected.
