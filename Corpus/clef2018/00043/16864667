Does myocardial fibrosis hinder contractile function and perfusion in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy? PET and MR imaging study. To prospectively evaluate, by using positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, the interrelationships between regional myocardial fibrosis, perfusion, and contractile function in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).The study protocol was approved by the hospital ethics committee, and all subjects gave written informed consent. Sixteen patients with idiopathic DCM (mean age, 54 years +/- 11 [standard deviation] nine men) and six healthy control subjects (mean age, 28 years +/- 2Mean global hyperemic MBF (2.23 mL/min/mL +/- 0.73), E(cc) (-10.5% +/- 2.9), and PTI (0.95 +/- 0.10) were lower in the patients with DCM than in the control subjects (4.33 mL/min/mL +/- 0.85, -17.4% +/- 0.6, and 1.09 +/- 0.12, respectively P < .05 for all). In the patients with DCM, regional PTI was related to E(cc) (r = -0.21, P = .009) but not to resting or hyperemic MBF. Furthermore, regional E(cc) was correlated to both resting (r = -0.28, P = .004) and hyperemic MBF (r = -0.29, P < .001). In addition, the ratio of left ventricular end-diastolic volume to mass, as a reflection of wall stress, was related to global hyperemic MBF (r = -0.52, P = .047) and to global E(cc) (r = 0.69, P = .003).In idiopathic DCM, the extent of myocardial fibrosis is related to the impairment in contractile function, whereas fibrosis and perfusion do not seem to be interrelated. The degree of impairment of hyperemic myocardial perfusion is related to contractility and end-diastolic wall stress.
