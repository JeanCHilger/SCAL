Synthesis, characterization, and biological evaluation of M(I)(CO)3(NNO) complexes (M = Re, 99mTc) conjugated to 2-(4-aminophenyl)benzothiazole as potential breast cancer radiopharmaceuticals. The synthesis and biological evaluation of new M(I)(CO)3(NNO) (M = Re, 99mTc) complexes attached to the antitumor agent 2-(4-aminophenyl)benzothiazole are reported. The fluorescent rhenium complex enters MCF-7 breast cancer cells but does not enter normal HFFF-2 and MRC-5 cells. The analogous radioactive 99mTc complex produces fast blood and soft tissue clearance when administered to healthy mice. These complexes are promising candidates for developing radiopharmaceuticals for imaging (99mTc) and targeted radiotherapy (186Re, 188Re) of breast cancer.
