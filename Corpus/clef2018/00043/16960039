The use of complementary and alternative therapies in dogs and cats with cancer. The use of complementary and alternative medical therapies is becoming widespread. The objective of this study was to examine the use of complementary and alternative therapies in dogs and cats with cancer. The types of modalities used, the intended purpose for each modality, sources of information pet owners used, and the level of interest in these modalities were all evaluated. Information was obtained by written survey, and 254 owners agreed to participate. Complementary and alternative therapy use was commonplace, with 76% of surveyed owners reporting some use. When prayer for health reasons was excluded, the number of owners reporting use dropped to 65%. Nutritional supplements were the most commonly used therapy.
