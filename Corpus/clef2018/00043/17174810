Changing patterns of abnormal vascular wall F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on follow-up PET/CT studies. Fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake may be increased in atherosclerotic plaques in asymptomatic patients. Repeat positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) studies were assessed for changes in patterns of FDG uptake and CT calcifications.Fifty consecutive cancer patients (mean age, 68 +/- 8 years) had repeat PET/CT studies 8 to 26 months apart. PET, CT, and PET/CT images were retrospectively evaluated for vascular wall abnormalities and for interval changes in the thoracic and abdominal aortas, as well as in carotid and iliac arteries, classified as PET+/CT+, PET+/CT-, and PET-/CT+. There were 485 abnormal sites in the first study and 495 in the second. CT calcifications were found in 46 patients (92%) in the first study and in 47 (94%) in the second. Vascular wall FDG uptake was found in both studies in 37 patients (74%). The pattern changed in 57 of 119 PET+ sites (48%) in the second study compared with 15 of 366 PET- sites (4%) (P < .0001). In the second study new PET+ sites were observed in 36 of 111 sites (32%) versus new PET-/CT+ sites in 19 of 384 sites (5%) (P < .0001).Changes in vascular FDG activity and CT calcifications can be assessed by repeat PET/CT. FDG-avid foci may represent a dynamic process, transient inflammation, whereas CT calcifications may indicate stable atherosclerosis. These preliminary results support the need for further research.
