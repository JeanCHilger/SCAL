Comparison between 18F-FDG PET and conventional imaging techniques (CT SCAN and MRI) in the diagnosis of head and neck tumor suspicion of recurrence. This study aimed to assess the results obtained with the positron emission tomography (PET) and conventional anatomic imaging methods (CT scan and MRI) in the diagnosis of suspicion of tumor recurrence in head and neck cancers.Thirty patients with suspicion of tumor recurrence due to head and neck cancers were reviewed retrospectively. Consequently, 34 PET studies were performed. The images were obtained in the PET Institute of Madrid. They were interpreted by visual and semiquantitative analysis. The results were confirmed with clinical follow-up, response to treatment or with histological studies in some cases.Sensitivity and specificity of the PET were 95.6% and 81.8% respectively, while it was 65% and 80% for the CT scan/MRI.We can conclude that PET provides better results than conventional imaging techniques in the detection of head and neck cancer recurrence.
