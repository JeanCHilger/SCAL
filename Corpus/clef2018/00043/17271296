Dynamic evaluation of [18F]-FDG uptake in the rat brain by microPET imaging. This study aims to acquire the functional image of the rat brain, small animal positron emission tomography (microPET) with high resolution and sensitivity is adopted to assess the metabolic activity corresponding to the neuronal activity induced by the electrical stimulation of the rat tail using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as the radiotracer. The microPET imaging technology can provide anatomical and functional information on neuronal activity used to analyze responses in pathway sequence relationships between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex.
