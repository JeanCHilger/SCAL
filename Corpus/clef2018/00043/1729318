Dipyridamole vasodilator response after human orthotopic heart transplantation: quantification by oxygen-15-labeled water and positron emission tomography. To assess coronary vasodilator reserve after orthotopic heart transplantation, regional myocardial perfusion was measured with oxygen-15-labeled water and dynamic positron emission tomography in 14 cardiac allograft recipients who were not experiencing rejection and who had no angiographic evidence of epicardial coronary sclerosis 15 to 73 months (mean +/- SD 43 +/- 19) after transplantation (group I). Twelve normal men with an average age of 31 years (group II) served as a control group. Regional perfusion was measured at rest and after the intravenous administration of 0.6 mg/kg body weight of dipyridamole. Rest regional myocardial blood flow was homogeneously distributed throughout the left ventricle and was significantly higher in transplant recipients (mean 1.16 +/- 0.26 ml/g per min [range 0.8 to 1.73] than in normal subjects (mean 0.85 +/- 0.13 ml/g per min [range 0.57 to 0.99] p = 0.001) as was rest heart rate-systolic blood pressure product (rate-pressure product 11,255 +/- 2,540 vs. 7,073 +/- 1,306
