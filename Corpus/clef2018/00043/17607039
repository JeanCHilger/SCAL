Comparison of contrast-enhanced MRI with (18)F-FDG PET/201Tl SPECT in dysfunctional myocardium: relation to early functional outcome after surgical revascularization in chronic ischemic heart disease. Revascularization of viable myocardial segments has been shown to improve left ventricular (LV) function and long-term prognosis however, the surgical risk is comparatively higher in patients with a low ejection fraction (EF). We compared contrast-enhanced MRI with (18)F-FDG PET/(201)Tl SPECT for myocardial viability and prediction of early functional outcome in patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD).Forty-one patients with chronic CAD and LV dysfunction (mean age +/- SD, 66 +/- 10 y 32 menThree hundred ninety-four dysfunctional segments were compared, and the extent of DE on MRI correlated negatively with the viability on (18)F-FDG PET. Of 252 dysfunctional segments that were successfully revascularized, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of PET/SPECT were 60.2%, 98.7%, 76.6%, and 96.7% and of MRI were 92.2%, 44.9%, 72.4%, and 78.6% using the cutoff value of 50% DE on MRI, without significant differences in overall accuracies. In 18 subjects who underwent isolated CABG, improvement of EF (> or =5%) and reverse LV remodeling (> or =10% LV size reduction) was best predicted by the no DE on MRI, and patients with substantial nonviable myocardium on (18)F-FDG/SPECT predicted a poor early functional outcome (all P < 0.001).Accurate prediction of early functional outcome by PET/SPECT and contrast-enhanced MRI is possible.
