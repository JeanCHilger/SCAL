TNM staging with FDG-PET/CT in patients with primary head and neck cancer. PET/CT, PET+CT, and CT were compared concerning accuracies in TNM staging and malignancy detection in head and neck cancer. The impact of PET/CT compared to the other imaging modalities on therapy management was assessed.Fifty-five patients with suspected head and neck primary cancer underwent whole-body FDG-PET/CT. PET/CT and PET+CT were evaluated by a nuclear medicine physician and a radiologist CT was evaluated by two radiologists, PET by two nuclear physicians. Histopathology served as the standard of reference. Differences between the staging modalities were tested for statistical significance by McNemar's test.Overall TNM-staging and T-staging with PET/CT were more accurate than PET+CT and CT alone (p < 0.05). PET/CT was marginally more accurate than CT alone in N-staging (p = 0.04) no statistically significant difference was found when compared to PET+CT for N-staging. PET/CT altered further treatment in 13 patients compared to CT only and in 7 patients compared to PET+CT.Combined PET/CT proved to be partly more accurate in assessing the overall TNM-stage than CT and PET+CT. These results were based on a higher accuracy concerning the T-stage, mainly in patients with metallic implants and marginally the N-stage. Therapy decisions have been influenced in a substantial number of patients. PET/CT might be considered as a first line diagnostic tool in patients with suspected primary head and neck cancer.
