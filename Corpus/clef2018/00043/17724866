Quantitative analysis of heart scintigraphy (99mTc-MIBI GSPECT) with regional myocardial wall motion and thickening assessment for detecting myocardial injury in patients after acute paracetamol poisoning. The aim of the study was to evaluate the myocardium function in acute paracetamol poisoning using 19mTc-MIBI GSPECT.Under examination there were 25 acutely paracetamol poisoned patients (age: 24.5 +/- 6 years) treated at the Ward of Toxicology and Environmental Diseases. The control group necessary to perform quantitative analysis of myocardial scintigraphy consisted of 20 people examined in Nuclear Medicine Unit with normal results of 99mTc-MIBI GSPECT examination.The quantitative analysis of the heart scintigraphy (GSPECT) revealed that, the average value of left ventricle ejection fraction (EF) in examined women and men after paracetamol poisoning was lower than in control group, while end diastolic (EDV) and end systolic volumes (ESV) were higher these differences were not statistically significant. Indicators of regional wall motion of the left ventricle were lower for the most of the heart segments. According to the control group, they were significantly lower for anterior and inferior LV segments. Wall thickening analysis revealed the impaired systolic thickening of majority of heart segments in examined group of patientsThe quantitative analysis of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (99mTc-MIBI GSPECT) with wall motion and wall thickening assessment, showed that the left ventricle function was usually diffusely depressed in paracetamol poisoned patients. The disturbances of regional wall motion of anterior and inferior wall (LV) were mainly visible.
