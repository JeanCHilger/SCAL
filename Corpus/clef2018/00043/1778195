The comparative value of exercise echocardiography and 99m Tc MIBI single photon emission computed tomography in the diagnosis and localization of myocardial ischaemia. To determine the relative value of exercise two-dimensional echocardiography and 99m Tc methoxyisobutylisonitrile single photon emission computed tomography (MIBI SPECT) for the detection of myocardial ischaemia, 103 consecutive patients with either proven or suspected coronary artery disease, who were referred for perfusion scintigraphy, were studied by a combination of the two techniques during the same symptom-limited upright bicycle exercise test. Appropriate echocardiographic images were recorded both at rest and immediately post-exercise and subsequently analysed by means of digital cine loop processing. Both echocardiographic and MIBI SPECT images were visually analysed. For each technique, three different responses to exercise were defined: normal (absence of rest and exercise abnormalities) ischaemic (transient scintigraphic perfusion defects and transient wall motion abnormalities during exercise echocardiography)
