Potential of chemo-immunotherapy and radioimmunotherapy in relapsed primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Five patients with relapsed PCNSL were given chemo-immunotherapy (rituximab followed by carboplatin and methotrexate) with osmotic blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening. Four patients achieved CR and one patient had stable disease. Two patients (2/5) had durable responses (survival: 230+, 122+, 82, 42, 38 weeks). One patient later received Indium-111-ibritumomab tiuxetan and Yttrium-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan intravenous, without BBB opening. There was good uptake of Indium-111 ibritumomab tiuxetan in tumor on SPECT scan after 48 h. Estimated radiation doses to brain around and distant from tumor were within safe limits. After Ytrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan there was CR in enhancing tumor where the BBB was leaky, but lesions occurred in other brain regions, where the BBB was intact during Yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan infusion. Imaging and dosimetry with Indium-111 ibritumomab tiuxetan and efficacy with Yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan suggest the need for future enhanced CNS delivery when using monoclonal or radiolabeled antibodies, as intravenous delivery alone may provide modest clinical benefit due to limited BBB permeability.
