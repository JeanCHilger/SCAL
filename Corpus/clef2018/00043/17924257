Neuroreceptor imaging studies in schizophrenia. The ability of SPECT and PET to image specific biomolecules in the living brain provides a unique tool for clinical researchers. It is therefore not surprising that the use of neuroreceptor-imaging techniques has become more widespread over the past decade. This article reviews the application of these techniques to the study of schizophrenia. The design of neuroreceptor-imaging studies performed in the field of schizophrenia research can be broadly divided into two categories: (1) studies of pathophysiology and (2) studies of pharmacology. The former examines neuroreceptor and neurotransmitter parameters in individuals with schizophrenia compared to control subjects in order to provide a better understanding of the disease process. Studies of pharmacology seek to elucidate the mechanism of action for the treatments utilized in schizophrenia. This review will consider both studies of pathophysiology and pharmacology, with a discussion of the application of these techniques to drug development.
