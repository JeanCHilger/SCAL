Prevalence and nature of systemic involvement and stage at initial examination in patients with orbital and ocular adnexal lymphoma. To determine the stage at initial examination and the prevalence of systemic involvement in patients with orbital and ocular adnexal lymphoma.The medical records of all patients with orbital and ocular adnexal lymphoma treated in a recent 7-year period were reviewed for stage at initial examination, highest stage during the follow-up period, and recurrence-free survival.Forty-three patients were included. Nineteen patients had mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, 9 had follicular, 9 had diffuse large-cell, 3 had mantle cell, 2 had small lymphocytic, and 1 had large T-cell lymphoma. The staging workup included chest radiography orbital computed tomography or magnetic resonance imagingExtraorbital involvement is present at diagnosis in more than half of patients with orbital and ocular adnexal lymphoma and warrants extensive systemic workup at diagnosis, continued surveillance, and consideration of systemic therapy.
