Intracoronary transfer autologous bone marrow stem cells can improve cardiac function in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. To evaluate the efficacy of intracoronary transfer of autologous bone marrow mononuclear stem cells in patients with heart dysfunction after myocardial infarction.Forty-two patients with anterior myocardial infarction [BMSC(bone marrow mononuclear stem cells) group: 13 cases control group: 29 cases] were treated by standard percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and medical therapy. Patients in BMSC group were also transplanted bone marrow mononuclear stem cells through coronary injection. Baseline and 12 months' follow-up evaluations included New York Heart Association Class ( NYHA class) and the level of plasma NT-proBNP, six minutes walk test, single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT).In BMSC group, the NYHA class improved significantly at the end of the 12 months' follow-up (1.54+/-0.27 vs. 2.62+/-0.33, P=0.002) and was better than that of control group (2.45+/-0.21, P=0.02). The level of plasma NTjproBNP reduced significantly [(701.05+/-154.60) ng/L vs. (1,921.70+/-373.70) ng/L, P=0.000 8]. The distances of six minutes walk test of the two groups increased significantly [BMSC group: (432.85+/-27.81) m vs. (363.77+/-20.14) m, P=0.000 6control group: (381.48+/-17.72) m vs. (339.00+/-9.87) m, P=0.000 5], but the difference was not obvious between the two groups. The score of myocardial blood perfusion improved significantly in BMSC group at the end of the 12 months' follow-up (31.15+/-3.65 vs. 46.31+/-2.87, P=0.002) and was better than that of control group (42.59+/-2.08,P=0.015 7). The area of the perfusion defects in SPECT reduced significantly in BMSC group [(32.23+/-4.40)% vs. (39.54+/-3.76)%, P=0.000 1], but no obvious difference was found between the two groups. Global LVEF of BMSC group increased [(38.54+/-2.94)% vs. (35.38+/-2.16)%, P>0.05).Intracoronary transplantation of bone marrow mononuclear cells could improve myocardial blood perfusion and increase the systolic function in patients with heart failure after myocardial infarction.
