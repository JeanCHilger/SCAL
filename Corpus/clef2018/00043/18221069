Technologies for translational imaging using generators in oncology. Improvement of scintigraphic tumor imaging is extensively determined by the development of more tumor specific radiopharmaceuticals. Thus, to improve the differential diagnosis, prognosis, planning and monitoring of cancer treatment, several functional pharmaceuticals have been developed. The application of molecular targets for cancer imaging, therapy and prevention using generator-produced isotopes is the major focus of many ongoing research projects. Radionuclide imaging modalities (single photon emission computed tomography, SPECT positron emission tomography, PET) are diagnostic cross-sectional imaging techniques that map the location and concentration of radionuclide-labeled radiotracers. Generator produced isotopes, such as 99mTc and 68Ga, are readily available and affordable. 99mTc (t1/2=6 hr
