Construction and expression of a fusion gene of human heptoma peptide with human heat shock protein 70. To construct and express a fusion gene of human heptoma peptide (EPVTKAEML) with human heat shock protein 70 (HSP70).A cDNA fragment encoding EPVTKAEML was added to 3 terminus of human HSP70 gene by PCR amplification. The PCR products of fusion gene were cloned into pET-28a(+)vector. The recombinant plasmid pET-28a(+)/EPVTKAEML-HSP70 was identified by enzyme digestion analysis and sequencing, and then it was transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3) through IPTG induction to express the target protein bearing His tag.A fragment of about 2.0 kb was amplified by PCR. Sequence analysis revealed that the sequence of EPVTKAEML was connected successfully to 3 terminus of human HSP70. Enzyme digestion analysis showed the fusion gene was cloned into pET-28a(+). SDS-PAGE showed that a relative molecular mass 72 000 fusion protein was expressed.The fusion gene of EPVTKAEML-HSP70 has been successfully constructed and expressed in E.coli BL21(DE3).
