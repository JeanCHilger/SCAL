Role of positron emission tomography and bone scintigraphy in the evaluation of bone involvement in metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma: specific implications for succinate dehydrogenase enzyme subunit B gene mutations. We performed a retrospective analysis of 71 subjects with metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (30 subjects with mutation of succinate dehydrogenase enzyme subunit B (SDHB) gene and 41 subjects without SDHB mutation). Sixty-nine percent presented with bone metastases (SDHB +/-: 77% vs 63%), 39% with liver metastases (SDHB +/-: 27% vs 47%), and 32% with lung metastases (SDHB +/-: 37% vs 29%). The most common sites of bone involvement were thoracic spine (80% SDHB+/-: 83% vs 77%), lumbar spine (78%
