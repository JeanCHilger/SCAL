Perfusional evaluation of postesophagectomy gastroplasty with a radioisotopic study. Anastomotic fistula represents one of the frequent causes of postoperative morbidity and mortality following transhiatal esophageal resections. The main etiological factor is the ischemia of the gastric tube created for digestive transit reconstruction. Evidence suggests that per operative hypoperfusion can be maintained or even impaired after the surgery. Several methods have been employed in an attempt to assess the blood perfusion of the gastric flap, but they all pose limitations. However, there is a chronological relationship between perfusion assessments, which are almost exclusively performed per operatively, and the occurrence of a leak, which commonly appears several days after the surgery. The authors have developed a method of gastric perfusion evaluation by single photon emission computed tomography scintigraphy, which corrects that temporal matter, allowing the estimation of postoperative gastric perfusion. It is noninvasive, low cost, and may be applied by the time frame when most fistulas occur. High correlation between the event fistula and the low radiotracer uptake in the group of studied patients could be demonstrated. A role in the research of perfusion evaluation of different types of esophageal reconstruction is suggested.
