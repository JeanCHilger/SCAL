Motion-frozen myocardial perfusion SPECT improves detection of coronary artery disease in obese patients. In this study, we compared the diagnostic performance of the standard SPECT with motion-frozen (MF) myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) in obese patients.A total of 90 consecutive obese patients (body mass index, 30.1-46.8, average, 34.3 +/- 3.6 age, 63 +/- 12 yThe area under the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve for detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) by MF-TPD was significantly larger than that for S-TPD (0.93 +/- 0.25 vs. 0.88 +/- 0.32, P < 0.05). MF-TPD had higher specificity (77% vs. 55%, P < 0.05) and accuracy (89% vs. 80%, P < 0.05) than did S-TPD.MF processing of MPS improves CAD detection in obese patients.
