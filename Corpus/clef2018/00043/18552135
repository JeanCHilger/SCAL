Brain adenosine A2A receptor occupancy by a novel A1/A2A receptor antagonist, ASP5854, in rhesus monkeys: relationship to anticataleptic effect. The purpose of the present study was to measure adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) occupancy in the brain by a novel adenosine A(1)/A(2A) antagonist, 5-[5-amino-3-(4fluorophenyl)pyrazin-2-yl]-1-isopropylpyridine-2(1H)-one (ASP5854), and to determine the degree of receptor occupancy necessary to inhibit haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rhesus monkeys.A(2A)R occupancy by ASP5854 (0.001-0.1 mg/kg) was examined in the striatum using an A(2A)R-specific radiotracer, (11)C-SCH442416, and PET in conscious rhesus monkeys. A(2A)R occupancy was monitored after a single intravenous administration of ASP5854 in 3 animals, and a dynamic PET scan was performed at 1, 4, and 8 h after an intravenous bolus injection of the tracer for approximately 740 MBq. Catalepsy was induced by haloperidol (0.03 mg/kg, intramuscularly) and examined for incidence and duration.ASP5854 dose-dependently increased A(2A)R occupancy in the striatum and showed long-lasting occupancy even after the reduction of plasma concentration. Haloperidol induced severe catalepsy at 40 min after intramuscular injection. The incidence and duration of cataleptic posture were dose-dependently reduced by ASP5854 at 1 h after oral administration, and the minimum ED(50) value was 0.1 mg/kg. Administration of a dose of 0.1 mg/kg yielded a plasma concentration of 97 +/- 16.3 ng/mL, which corresponded to 85%-90% of A(2A)R occupancy.These results showed that ASP5854 antagonized A(2A)R in the striatum, and the dissociation from A(2A)R was relatively slow. In addition, more than 85% A(2A)R occupancy by ASP5854 resulted in an inhibition of haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Thus, such a pharmacodynamic study directly demonstrates both the kinetics of a drug in the brain and the relationship between dose-dependent receptor occupancy and plasma level.
