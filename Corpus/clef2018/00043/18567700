Exercise training impacts the myocardial metabolism of older individuals in a gender-specific manner. Aging is associated with decreases in aerobic capacity, cardiac function, and insulin sensitivity as well as alterations in myocardial substrate metabolism. Endurance exercise training (EET) improves cardiac function in a gender-specific manner, and EET has been shown to improve whole body glucose tolerance, but its effects on myocardial metabolism are unclear. Accordingly, we studied the effect of EET on myocardial substrate metabolism in older men and women. Twelve healthy older individuals (age: 60-75 yr 6 men and 6 women) underwent PET with [(15)O]water, [(11)C]acetate, [(11)C]glucose, and [(11)C]palmitate for the assessment of myocardial blood flow (MBF), myocardial O(2) consumption (MVo(2)), myocardial glucose utilization (MGU), and myocardial fatty acid utilization (MFAU), respectively, at rest and during dobutamine infusion (10 microg.kg(-1).min(-1)). Measurements were repeated after 11 mo of EET. Maximal O(2) uptake (Vo(2max)) increased (P = 0.005) after EET. MBF was unaffected by training, as was resting MVo(2)
