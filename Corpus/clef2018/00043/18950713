Expression, purification and osteogenic bioactivity of recombinant human BMP-4, -9, -10, -11 and -14. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are cytokines from the TGF-beta superfamily, with important roles during embryonic development and in the induction of bone and cartilage tissue differentiation in the adult body. In this contribution, we report the expression of recombinant human BMP-4, BMP-9, BMP-10, BMP-11 (or growth differentiation factor-11, GDF-11) and BMP-14 (GDF-5), using Escherichia coli pET-25b vector. BMPs were overexpressed, purified by affinity his-tag chromatography and shown to induce the expression of early markers of bone differentiation (e.g. smad-1, smad-5, runx2/cbfa1, dlx5, osterix, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein and alkaline phosphatase) in C2C12 cells and in human adipose stem cells. The described approach is a promising method for producing large amounts of different recombinant BMPs that show potential for novel biomedical applications.
