Detection of breast cancer microcalcifications using a dual-modality SPECT/NIR fluorescent probe. Efficient chemical synthesis of a trifunctional, hydroxyapatite-binding molecule, which provides simultaneous in vivo imaging by NIR fluorescence and SPECT/CT has been described. Quantitation by SPECT provides the "gold standard" by which NIR fluorescence tomography of breast cancer microcalcifications can now be compared and optimized.
