Mean and maximum standardized uptake values in [18F]FDG-PET for assessment of histopathological response in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma after radiochemotherapy. To evaluate the potential of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for the assessment of histopathological response and survival after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in patients with oesophageal cancer.In 2005 and 2006, 55 patients (43 men, 12 women median age 60 years) with locally advanced oesophageal cancer (cT3-4 Nx M0Histopathological responders had a slightly higher baseline SUV than nonresponders (p<0.0001 between PET 1 and PET 2 for responders and nonresponders) and the decrease was more prominent in responders. Except for SUVmax in patients with squamous cell carcinoma neither baseline nor preoperative SUV nor percent SUV reduction correlated significantly with histopathological response. Histopathological responders had a 2-year overall survival of 91 +/- 9% and nonresponders a survival of 53 +/- 10% (p = 0.007).Our study does not support recent reports that FDG-PET predicts histopathological response and survival in patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer treated by neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy.
