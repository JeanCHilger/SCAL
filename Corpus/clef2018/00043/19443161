Hybrid cardiac SPECT/64-slice CTA-derived LV function parameters: correlation and reproducibility assessment. The purpose of this study is to define the relationship between SPECT and CTA measured parameters of left ventricular (LV) function and volumes obtained in a single session using SPECT/64-slice CT hybrid imaging device, and in addition, to assess the reproducibility of LV parameters measured using 64-slice CTA.Seventy-six patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease underwent cardiac CTA and GSPECT in one session using a hybrid SPECT/CT device. LV end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV) and ejection fraction (EF) were measured on each component of the hybrid device. For the CTA component, these parameters were re-measured by the same investigator and by a second investigator with an interval of 3-54 weeks. Corresponding GSPECT and CTA measured parameters were compared. For CTA, intra-observer and inter-observer variability of LV function and volume measurements were calculated.A very good correlation was found between the GSPECT and CTA measured LVEF (r=0.81), ESV (r=0.90) and EDV (r=0.82). There was a small positive difference by CTA measured LVEF (3.9+/-14.2%), and more prominent positive differences by CTA measured ESV and EDV (9.8+/-14.8 and 44.9+/-23.1cm(3), respectively). There was excellent reproducibility in the measurements of all parameters with very low intra- and inter-observer variability (r=0.93 for EF and 0.98 for EDV and ESV).Although a good correlation was found between the EF measurements obtained from CTA and SPECT, interchangeable use of EF measurements between the two modalities should be done cautiously and interchangeable use of LV EDV and ESV should be avoided.
