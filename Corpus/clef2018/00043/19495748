Limited value of 18F-FDG PET/CT and S-100B tumour marker in the detection of liver metastases from uveal melanoma compared to liver metastases from cutaneous melanoma. The objective of this study was to evaluate the value of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and S-100B tumour marker for the detection of liver metastases from uveal melanoma in comparison to liver metastases from cutaneous melanoma.A retrospective evaluation was conducted of 27 liver metastases in 13 patients with uveal melanoma (UM) (mean age: 56.8, range: 30-77) and 43 liver metastases in 14 patients (mean age: 57.9, range: 40-82) with cutaneous melanoma (CM) regarding size and FDG uptake by measuring the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)). S-100B serum tumour markers were available in 20 patients. Cytology, histology, additional morphological imaging and follow-up served as reference standard. In nine patients liver metastases were further evaluated histologically regarding GLUT-1 and S-100 receptor expression and regarding epithelial or spindle cell growth pattern.Of 27 liver metastases in 6 of 13 patients (46%) with UM, 16 (59%) were FDG negative, whereas all liver metastases from CM were positive. Liver metastases from UM showed significantly (p < 0.001) lower SUV(max) (mean: 3.5, range: 1.5-13.4) compared with liver metastases from CM (mean: 6.6, range: 2.3-15.3). In four of six (66.7%) patients with UM and liver metastases S-100B was normal and in two (33.3%) increased. All PET-negative liver metastases were detectable by morphological imaging (CT or MRI). S-100B was abnormal in 13 of 14 patients with liver metastases from CM. S-100B values were significantly higher (p = 0.007) in the CM patient group (mean S-100B: 10.9 microg/l, range: 0.1-115 microg/l) compared with the UM patients (mean: 0.2 microg/l, range: 0.0-0.5 microg/l). Histological work-up of the liver metastases showed no obvious difference in GLUT-1 or S-100 expression between UM and CM liver metastases. The minority (36%) of patients with UM had extrahepatic metastases and the majority (86%) of patients with CM had extrahepatic metastases, respectively. There was a close to significant trend to better survival of UM patients compared with CM patients (p = 0.06).FDG PET/CT and serum S-100B are not sensitive enough for the detection of liver metastases from UM, whereas liver metastases from cutaneous melanoma are reliably FDG positive and lead regularly to increased S-100B tumour markers. The reason for the lower FDG uptake in UM liver metastases remains unclear. We recommend to perform combined contrast-enhanced PET/CT in order to detect FDG-negative liver metastases from UM.
