Response judgement - conventional versus new methods. New ways of evaluating treatment success among thoracic tumour patients are increasingly being used alongside more conventional methods. These new approaches include tumour regression grading, CAD volumetry (computer-assisted volumetry), determination of the tumour density and tumour perfusion as well as the use of positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) or other tracers. Increasingly, endpoints that impact directly on the patient's quality of life and tumour-related symptoms are becoming more relevant factors together with the objectively measurable parameters used for assessing treatment response. This contribution describes the potential value of new methods and end-points from the point of view of a pathologist, radiologist, nuclear medicine specialist, radiotherapist, thoracic surgeon, medical and pneumology oncologist, and general practitioner.
