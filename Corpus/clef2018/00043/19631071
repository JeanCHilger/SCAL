CT arthrography, MR arthrography, PET, and scintigraphy in osteoarthritis. CT arthrography and MR arthrography are accurate methods for the study of surface cartilage lesions and cartilage loss. They also provide information on subchondral bone and marrow changes, and ligaments and meniscal lesions that can be associated with osteoarthritis. Nuclear medicine also offers new insights in the assessment of the disease. This article discusses the strengths and limitations of CT arthrography and MR arthrography. It also highlights nuclear medicine methods that may be relevant to the study of osteoarthritis in research and clinical practice.
