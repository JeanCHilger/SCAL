PET/CT scans in ovarian cancer: prognostic versus predictive utility? The use of PET/CT has been advocated in the management of ovarian cancer as a diagnostic strategy to assist in patient management. To date, data in the peer reviewed literature support the argument that findings on PET/CT reveal evidence of the extent of disease and may be helpful in documenting disease recurrence. However, it remains to be determined through the conduct of phase 3 randomized trials if the information generated will be useful in predicting benefit of a management plan specifically selected based on the results of this expensive radiographic procedure.
