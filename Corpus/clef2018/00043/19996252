A comparative analysis of completed suicide using high resolution brain SPECT imaging. The authors compared regional cerebral blood flow in the brains of 12 psychiatric patients who completed the act of suicide with groups of healthy and nonsuicidal depressed subjects using statistical parametric mapping. Results were consistent with prior imaging studies on depression and were indicative of impaired impulse control and limbic dysregulation, including significant perfusion deficits in the medial prefrontal and subgenual areas (Brodmann's areas 11, 25) and ventral tegmentum. These results warrant further research.
