Adiponectin is associated with abnormal lipid profile and coronary microvascular dysfunction in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy without overt heart failure. Reduced plasma adiponectin has been associated with abnormal lipid profile, reduced left ventricle (LV) function, and the extent of coronary atherosclerosis in coronary artery disease. The aim of this study was to assess these relationships in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) without overt heart failure. Plasma adiponectin was measured in 55 DCM patients (age, 59 Â± 12 years male, 36
