Locally recurrent prostate cancer following radiation therapy: radical salvage prostatectomy. Radical salvage prostatectomy represents a secondary local treatment with curative intent in patients with organ-confined prostate cancer (PC) recurrences following radiation therapy. Preoperative risk factors predicting organ-confined disease are initial low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy, preoperative Gleason biopsy score<or=6, <or=50% biopsy cores involved with cancer, and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time>12 months. Metastatic disease should be ruled out preoperatively by skeletal scintigraphy, abdominal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, and/or choline-PET/CT. Functionality of the lower urinary tract needs to be preoperatively evaluated by urethrocystoscopy and urodynamics. With appropriate patient selection, oncological control can be achieved in 80% of patients. A continence rate of 83%-96% depending on the type of previous radiation therapy is achievable.
