The SPECT tracer [123I]ADAM binds selectively to serotonin transporters: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy young men. The tracer (123)I-2-([2-({dimethylamino}methyl)phenyl]thio)-5-iodophenylamine ([(123)I]ADAM) has been developed to image serotonin transporters (SERTs) with SPECT. Preclinical studies have shown that [(123)I]ADAM binds selectively to SERTs. Moreover, initial human studies have shown that [(123)I]ADAM binding could be blocked by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). However, in humans it has not been proven that [(123)I]ADAM binds selectively to SERTs.We examined the in vivo availability of SERTs in 12 healthy young volunteers 5 h after bolus injection of [(123)I]ADAM. To evaluate the selectivity of binding, four participants were pretreated (double-blinded design) with placebo, four with paroxetine (20 mg) and four with the dopamine/norepinephrine blocker methylphenidate (20 mg). SPECT studies were performed on a brain-dedicated system (Neurofocus), and the SPECT images were coregistered with individual MR scans of the brain. ADAM binding in SERT-rich brain areas and cerebellar cortex (representing non-specific binding) was assessed by drawing regions of interest (ROIs) on the individual MR images. Specific to non-specific ratios were used as the outcome measure.We found that specific to non-specific ratios were statistically significantly lower in paroxetine-pretreated participants than in placebo- or methylphenidate-pretreated participants. No such difference was found between groups pretreated with placebo or methylphenidate.Our preliminary findings suggest that [(123)I]ADAM binds selectively to SERTs in human brain.
