Multiplexed imaging in cancer diagnosis: applications and future advances. The development of imaging technologies that have sufficient specificity and sensitivity to enable early, accurate detection of cancer and response to therapy has long been a goal in oncology. Various radiological techniques have been used for diagnosis and surveillance of disease recurrence and imaging has revolutionised oncology. However, despite the widespread use of technologies, the ability of currently available imaging methods to facilitate early detection, precise characterisation, and accurate localisation of malignant disease could be improved. The simultaneous use of two or more techniques, contrast reagents, signalling methods, or the coupling of agent and tissue properties to achieve so-called multiplexed imaging is a promising approach. In this review, we provide a broad overview of current and emerging multiplexed, imaging technologies.
