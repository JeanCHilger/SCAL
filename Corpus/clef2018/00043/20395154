Radiosynthesis of [2-(11)C-carbonyl]dantrolene using [(11)C]phosgene for PET. Automated radiosynthesis of [2-(11)C-carbonyl]dantrolene, the substrate of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2), was performed for the first time through a multi-step/one-pot labeling sequence that started with ethyl 2-{2-[5-(4-nitrophenyl)furfurylidene]hydrazino}acetate and used [(11)C]phosgene as a labeling agent. After optimization of the automated synthesis conditions and parameters, [2-(11)C-carbonyl]dantrolene was obtained at a radiochemical yield of 34.0+/-8.4% (decay-corrected). The radiochemical purity was greater than 98% and the specific activity was 46.8+/-15.2GBq/micromol at the end of the synthesis.
