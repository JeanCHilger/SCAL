Incidental focal hypermetabolic colorectal lesions identified by positron emission tomography: prevalence of malignancy. Colorectal cancer is commonly diagnosed in the United State and is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths. Positron emission tomography has been used for the evaluation and management for patients with colorectal cancer. Frequently, abnormal incidental lesions are detected on positron emission tomography. This article will review current literature for the prevalence of malignancy and pre-malignancy in incidental focal hypermetabolic colorectal lesions detected by positron emission tomography and briefly discuss its clinical impact.
