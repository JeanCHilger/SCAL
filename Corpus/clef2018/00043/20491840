Perfusion heterogeneity does not explain excess muscle oxygen uptake during variable intensity exercise. The association between muscle oxygen uptake (VO(2)) and perfusion or perfusion heterogeneity (relative dispersion, RD) was studied in eight healthy male subjects during intermittent isometric (1 s on, 2 s off) one-legged knee-extension exercise at variable intensities using positron emission tomography and a-v blood sampling. Resistance during the first 6 min of exercise was 50% of maximal isometric voluntary contraction force (MVC) (HI-1), followed by 6 min at 10% MVC (LOW) and finishing with 6 min at 50% MVC (HI-2). Muscle perfusion and O(2) delivery during HI-1 (26 +/- 5 and 5.4 +/- 1.0 ml 100 g(-1) min(-1)) and HI-2 (28 +/- 4 and 5.8 +/- 0.7 ml 100 g(-1) min(-1)) were similar, but both were higher (P<0.01) than during LOW (15 +/- 3 and 3.0 +/- 0.6 ml 100 g(-1) min(-1)). Muscle VO(2) was also higher during both HI workloads (HI-1 3.3 +/- 0.4 and HI-2 4.1 +/- 0.6 ml 100 g(-1) min(-1)) than LOW (1.4 +/- 0.4 ml 100 g(-1) min(-1) P<0.01) and 25% higher during HI-2 than HI-1 (P<0.05). O(2) extraction was higher during HI workloads (HI-1 62 +/- 7 and HI-2 70 +/- 7%) than LOW (45 +/- 8%
