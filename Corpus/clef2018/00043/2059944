Detection and quantification of recent myocardial infarction: diagnostic value of multiecho multislice spin echo imaging. Thirty-four patients with documented transmural MI were studied with gated three echo, multislice MR imaging. In 12 patients MRI MI size was compared with CK release measurement, Tl-201 SPECT defect, and with Tc-99m LVEF. Infarct was visualised in 29/34 patients on 3rd echo images (18/34 on 2nd and 6/34 on 1st echo images). Mean MR infarct size (planimetered from 3rd echo images): 33.1 +/- 9% overestimated the SPECT defect (mean value of 23.8 +/- 15%). However, the overall correlation between MRI and Tl-201 sizing was significant: r = 0.82 p less than 0.001
