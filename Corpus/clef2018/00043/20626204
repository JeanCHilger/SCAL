Target volume delineation for preoperative radiotherapy of rectal cancer: inter-observer variability and potential impact of FDG-PET/CT imaging. To analyze the inter-observer variability and the potential impact of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging for target volume delineation in preoperative radiotherapy of rectal cancer. Gross tumor volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) in 2 cases of rectal cancer were contoured by 10 radiation oncologists, 5 on CT and 5 on PET/CT images. Resulting volumes were analyzed by coefficient of variation (CV) and concordance index (CI). Mean GTV was 120 cc +/- 20.4 cc in case A and 119 cc +/- 35.7 cc in case B. Mean CTV was 723 cc +/- 147.5 cc in case A and 739 cc +/- 195.6 cc in case B. CV was lower and CI was similar or higher across the observers contouring GTV on PET/CT. CTV variability was less influenced by the use of PET/CT. PET/CT may allow reducing inter-observer variability in GTV delineation.
