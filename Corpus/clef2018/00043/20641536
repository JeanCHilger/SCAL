. Acetate is readily taken up by cells and is activated to acetyl-CoA in both the cytosol and mitochondria by acetyl-CoA synthetase. Acetyl-CoA is a common metabolic intermediate for synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids, which are then incorporated into membrane (1). Acetyl-CoA is also oxidized in mitrochondria by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to carbon dioxide and water. Some of the acetate is converted to amino acids. In normal myocardium, acetate is metabolized to CO
