Cy5.5-3-Benzo[1,3]dioxol-5-yl-5-hydroxy-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-5 Optical fluorescence imaging is increasingly being used to monitor biological functions of specific targets in small animals (1-3). However, the intrinsic fluorescence of biomolecules poses a problem when fluorophores that absorb visible light (350–700 nm) are used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700–1,000 nm) detection avoids the natural background fluorescence interference of biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues in small animals. NIR fluorophores have a wider dynamic range and minimal background fluorescence as a result of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. NIR fluorophores also have high sensitivity, attributable to low background fluorescence, and high extinction coefficients, which provide high quantum yields. The NIR region is also compatible with solid-state optical components, such as diode lasers and silicon detectors. NIR fluorescence imaging is a non-invasive alternative to radionuclide imaging in small animals. Endothelin (ET) plays an important role in a variety of physiological processes and contributes to the development of diseases such as acute and chronic renal failure, atherosclerosis, hypertension, chronic heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension (4-6). All these effects are mediated through G-protein–coupled receptor binding. Three isoforms of ET (ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3) exist in mammalian tissues, each of which has 21 amino acids with two disulfide bonds. Two ET receptors (ETRs), ET
