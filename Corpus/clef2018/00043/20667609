Feasibility of contrast-enhanced cone-beam CT for target localization and treatment monitoring. A dog with a spontaneous maxillary tumour was given 40 Gy of fractionated radiotherapy. At five out of 10 fractions cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging before and after administration of an iodinated contrast agent were performed. Contrast enhancement maps were overlaid on the pre-contrast CBCT images. The tumour was clearly visualized in the images thus produced.
