Use of FDG-PET/CT for peritoneal carcinomatosis before hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is associated with a very poor prognosis. Complete cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival rates of PC. However, this treatment is beneficial for patients if the complete cytoreductive surgery is macroscopically completed before implementing hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Even so, a strict selection of patients is of fundamental importance because of the invasive nature of the intervention. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of FDG-PET/CT examinations for the diagnosis and evaluation of the extent of PC.A retrospective analysis was conducted on 28 consecutive patients with suspected PC, scheduled for a complete cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and who underwent an FDG-PET/CT examination. We compared the results of PET examinations with histological and intraoperative findings. The extent of PC was assessed precisely using a simplified 'peritoneal cancer index', within the three modalities (PET, surgery and histology).Of 28 patients, 23 had histological PC. The sensitivity and specificity of the PET examination for the diagnosis of PC were, respectively, 82 and 100%. Even if the extent of PC was underestimated by PET, there was a good correlation when compared with histology and intraoperative results.PET presented a good performance level in the diagnosis and evaluation of the extent of PC. PET/CT examinations could be useful to avoid unnecessary surgery.
