Analysis of the electrocardiographic findings in 288 patients with acute pulmonary thromboembolism. To research variety orderliness of electrocardiogram in patients with acute pulmonary thromboembolism (PET).288 patients with first episode of acute PET were included in the study: There were 136 patients with massive and sub massive PTE (group A) and 152 with non-massive PET (group B). Thrombolytic agents were used for patients in group A and anticoagulant agents for those in group B. The electrocardiographic patterns of these patients were observed on 6 time points during the course. The rate of electrocardiographic abnormalities and differences between groups were analyzed.A high rate of S(I)Q(III)T(III) change was observed, 32.4% (44/136) in group A and 21.7% (33/152) in group B. Q(III), T(III), and S(I)T(III) were also very common. Negative T-waves in precordial leads were present in 77.8% (105/136) of patients in group A, and 52.0% (79/152) in group B. The amplitude of R(aVR) and S(V5) was decreased gradually and regularly after treatment. The highest rate of left axis deviation was 47.06% in group A and 30.26% in group B, the difference being significant between the 2 groups. The occurrence of right axis deviation was lower, 16.2% (22/136) in group A and 15.1% (23/152) in group B, with no significant difference.The electrocardiographic findings were useful in the early diagnosis of PTE.
