Hot tongue on FDG PET scan in a patient of Hodgkin's lymphoma undergoing antipsychotic treatment. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (F-18 FDG PET-CT) is the modality of choice for the diagnosis, staging, and restaging of many malignancies. The importance of eliminating false positives cannot be underestimated because they can dramatically alter the clinical course. We present a case of benign uptake in the tongue secondary to tardive dyskinesia in a 53-year-old woman referred for therapy response evaluation of Hodgkin's lymphoma who was concurrently receiving oral antipsychotic therapy. This case emphasizes the importance of detailed clinical history and examination when concluding definite diagnosis.
