Beware of the focal uptake at the ischium on the bone scan in prostate cancer. The isotope bone scan is routinely used in the management of prostate cancer as the skeleton is the second most common area of metastasis after lymph nodes. A classic site of involvement in the pelvis is the ischium, and the aim of this study was to assess the value of single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging in patients with focal ischial uptake on the planar scan.This was a retrospective study of consecutive 150 patients with prostate cancer who were referred for a whole-body bone scan between August 2007 and 2008. Two experienced nuclear medicine consultants along with a musculoskeletal radiologist reviewed the scans.Sixty-eight patients were diagnosed with widespread metastases and 46 patients showed typical degenerative disease changes on planar whole-body imaging. SPECT/CT imaging was done in 36 patients to clarify the diagnosis in areas of indeterminate uptake noted on planar whole-body imaging. Ten of these 36 patients who had focal increased ischial uptake were included in the study. Only three of these 10 patients were diagnosed as having a metastatic lesion with the presence of an enthesopathy, a common finding.Isolated focal uptake in the ischium is a relatively common finding in patients with prostate cancer and there is concern that this, on occasion, could be misinterpreted as metastasis. SPECT/CT imaging has an important role in differentiating a benign from a malignant lesion.
