Frontality, laterality, and cortical-subcortical gradient of cerebral blood flow in schizophrenia: relationship to symptoms and neuropsychological functions. According to the three hypotheses on the regional brain dysfunction in schizophrenia that have received some support in studies of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate, we calculated eight CBF measurement indices in 59 schizophrenic patients frontality, laterality, cortical to subcortical gradients and superior to inferior difference. Four factors were selected from these eight indices, treated by principal component factor analysis (factor 1: cortical to subcortical gradient
