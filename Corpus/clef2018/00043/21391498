Application of ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry for the measurement of vitamin D in foods and nutritional supplements. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)/MS/MS was applied to measure vitamin D in various foods and nutritional supplements. The run-time of the chromatographic separation was cut from 20 min in HPLC/MS/MS to 10 min in UPLC/MS/MS, while equal or better separation efficiency was achieved to deal with complex food matrixes. Under the optimized conditions, all the previtamins of vitamin D3, D2, and isotope-labeled vitamin D3 were baseline-separated from their corresponding vitamins. It was also demonstrated that many sterol isomers in complex food matrixes that interfere in the analysis could be well-separated from the analytes. Accuracy of this method was evaluated by analysis of NIST SRM 1849 infant formula reference material. With eight replicates, the average vitamin D3 concentration was 0.251 +/- 0.012 mg/kg, an excellent agreement with the certified value of 0.251 +/- 0.027 mg/kg. In addition, spike recovery from a commercial infant formula matrix was in the range of 100 to 108% for both vitamins D3 and D2 at three spike concentration levels. The spike recovery for an even more complex matrix, pet food, was 101-105%. LOQ values were 0.026 and 0.033 IU/g, or 0.086 and 0.11 IU/mL in solution, for vitamins D3 and D2, respectively. The dynamic range had three orders of magnitude, which made the method flexible and useful to deal with the wide concentration range of vitamin D in various samples. The method was robust based on the results of changing the parameters of LC separation and MS measurement. This accurate and reliable vitamin D method increased instrument efficiency and analysis productivity significantly.
