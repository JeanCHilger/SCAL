PET studies of dopamine receptor distribution using [18F]fluoroethylspiperone: findings in disorders related to the dopaminergic system. PET studies of dopamine D2-receptor binding were performed in thirty patients with various disorders related to the dopaminergic system and in six healthy controls. Uptake of [18F]fluoroethylspiperone in caudate over three hours was analyzed in terms of several indices of receptor binding:caudate-to-cerebellum activity ratio, concentration of ligand as percentage of injected dose, caudate-to-blood radioactivity ratio, slope of tracer uptake curves, binding potential, kinetic constants of a three compartment model. In 14 patients brain glucose metabolism was also measured. Data on medicated patients demonstrate that the average values of most of the above parameters indicate the decreased number of available D2-receptors whereby, besides an age dependent decline, the caudate-to-cerebellum ratio affords the relatively best distinction among diagnostic groups. In individual cases, large variability among subjects permits only the classification of severe pathologies. Morphological damage and neuronal loss in the striatum may also cause abnormal low values both for the indices of receptor binding and for glucose consumption, thus providing a possible pathogenetic link between receptor dysfunction and impaired energy metabolism.
