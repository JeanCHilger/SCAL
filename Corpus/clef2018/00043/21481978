Impact of myocardial perfusion gated-SPECT on the decision to perform coronary angiography in patients with left ventricular dysfunction of ischemic origin. The aim of this study was to analyze how the myocardial perfusion gated-SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) influences the practice of a coronary angiography in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (IM).A total of 120 consecutive patients (mean age: 64.9±11.5 years, 25 female) with IM (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%) and without previous coronary angiography were evaluated by myocardial perfusion gated-SPECT (96 stress-rest and 24 only at rest). The ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was obtained at rest by gated-SPECT in all patients. The ischemic origin of the systolic dysfunction was established by means of coronary angiography in 64 patients and by previous myocardial infarction in the rest. Gated-SPECT results of these 64 patients were compared with those of 56 patients in whom coronary angiography had not been indicated.Scintigraphic myocardial ischemia (HR: 5.2 CI 95%: 2.68 to 10.35) in patients who were able to perform the stress-rest test) and who had severely impaired EF (<30%) (HR: 0.9In patients with IM, demonstration of ischemia and severe reduction of the EF, but not detection of viable myocardium, prompted the performance of coronary angiography.
