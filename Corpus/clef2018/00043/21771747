Free water transport in children on peritoneal dialysis is higher with more biocompatible dialysis solutions, higher with older age and declines with time. Water transport in peritoneal dialysis occurs through small pores and aquaporins. Free water transport (FWT) occurs through aquaporins only and gives a reflection of peritoneal aquaporin function. In this study, FWT in children was calculated for the first time in different settings.A prospective cohort study was performed 87 peritoneal equilibrium tests (PETs) were analysed in 65 patients. Three subgroups were analysed: patients with their first PETThe proportional contribution of FWT was significantly higher in patients using dialysis solution with neutral pH/low GDP solution compared to patients using solutions with low pH/high GDP (50 versus 40%). Transcapillary ultrafiltration (TCUF) showed the same trend but was not statistically significant. Total FWT was higher as well. Higher FWT was observed with older age. In the longitudinal group, TCUF and water transport through small pores declined, while FWT remained stable in the first 1.5 years. The contribution of FWT increased in this period (48-61%), then slowly declined again to baseline level during the third year.Total FWT and relative contribution of FWT were significantly higher with neutral pH/low GDP solution. This can reflect a better preservation of aquaporins. The decline in the contribution of FWT in long-term dialysis could hypothetically implicate aquaporin dysfunction or different trafficking of aquaporins.
