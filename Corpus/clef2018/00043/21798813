Surgical decision making in temporal lobe epilepsy: a comparison of [(18)F]FDG-PET, MRI, and EEG. The goals of this work were (1) to determine the effect of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), MRI, and EEG on the decision to perform temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) surgery, and (2) to determine if FDG-PET, MRI, or EEG predicts surgical outcome.All PET scans ordered (2000-2010) for epilepsy or seizures were tabulated. Medical records were investigated to determine eligibility and collect data. Statistical analysis included odds ratios, Îº statistics, univariate analysis, and logistic regression.Of the 186 patients who underwent FDG-PET, 124 had TLE, 50 were surgical candidates, and 34 had surgery with post-operative follow-up. Median length of follow-up was 24 months. MRI, FDG-PET, and EEG were significant predictors of surgical candidacy (P<0.001) with odds ratios of 42.8, 20.4, and 6.3, respectively. FDG-PET was the only significant predictor of postoperative outcome (P<0.01).MRI showed a trend toward having the most influence on surgical candidacy, but only FDG-PET predicted surgical outcome.
