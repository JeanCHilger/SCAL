MNU-induced mammary gland carcinogenesis: chemopreventive and therapeutic effects of vitamin D and Seocalcitol on selected regulatory vitamin D receptor pathways. The effects of administration of vitamin D₃ and Seocalcitol on MNU-induced carcinogenesis of mammary gland in Sprague-Dawley rats have been investigated. Administration of both substances in a weekly dose of 7 μg/kg caused prolonged latency of mammary gland tumors. The latency of tumors was markedly prolonged for 30-40 days by Seocalcitol. Using PET analysis, reduction in [¹⁸F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) uptake or tumor volume in tumors chemopreventively treated with vitamin D₃ were detected in MNU-induced tumors, vitamin D₃ reduced expression of 25-hydroxylase (25OHase) (p<0.01) and 24-hydroxylase (24OHase) (p<0.01) and Seocalcitol 24OHase. Positive regulation of 25OHase mRNA level after the treatment with vitamin D₃ was observed in liver, while in kidney, vitamin D₃ and Seocalcitol induced expression of 24OHase was significant. Our observations indicate a cross talk between respective pathways of VDR, RARs/RXRs, TRs and ERs in carcinogenesis process.
