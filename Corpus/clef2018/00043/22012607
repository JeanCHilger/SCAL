Role of FDG-PET in Staging and Therapy of Children with Hodgkin Lymphoma. The paediatric Hodgkin lymphoma treatment optimisation concepts aim at reduction of treatment intensity with preservation of the high cure rates. A negative interim FDG-PET result after 2 cycles of chemotherapy is associated with a good prognosis. In the current EuroNet-PHL-C1 study radiotherapy is being omitted, if interim PET becomes negative. In addition to the early interim PET after 2 cycles of chemotherapy, all patients undergo an initial PET investigation which is part of the staging processs and plays an essential role for the interpretation of the interim PET. Skeletal involvement can be detected by a typical FDG-PET uptake pattern with high sensitivity and specifity. Therefore, in the forthcoming EuroNet-PHL-C2 study bone marrow biopsy and bone scintigraphy will no longer be part of the staging algorithm.
