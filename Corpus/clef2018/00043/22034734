Imaging in head and neck tumors. Precise staging and knowledge of the aggressiveness and manner of growth of the tumor provide the cornerstone for a treatment plan for head and neck cancer. Although the basic methods of imaging have remained relatively unchanged for some decades, the information about the properties of the tumor provided by molecular imaging and gene research is changing the status of diagnostics. The aim is more personalized treatment. Appropriately conducted imaging reduces total treatment costs, despite the fact that novel methods may seem expensive at the time of therapeutic decision.
