Correlation between serum calcium levels and dual-phase (99m)Tc-sestamibi parathyroid scintigraphy in primary hyperparathyroidism. The goal of the study is to correlate serum calcium levels with the results of dual-phase (99m)Tc-sestamibi parathyroid scintigraphy to find the best cut-off level of the serum calcium that correlates with a positive presurgery.In 111 patients, serum calcium and plasma parathormone (PTH) levels were compared with the results of the (99m)Tc-MIBI scintigraphy and with this data determined the level of calcium above which the (99m)Tc-MIBI scintigraphy was likely to be positive and below which the study was likely to be negative.In total, 11 men (18%) and 50 women (82%) had a positive (99m)Tc-MIBI study. Overall 67% of those patients with a positive (99m)Tc-MIBI study had a PTH >200 ng l(-1) compared to only 9% of those with a negative (99m)Tc-MIBI scintigraphy however, for those with a positive study on an early (99m)Tc-MIBI scintigraphy, this rose to 85%. Overall a serum calcium of >2·70 mmol l(-1) was found in 82% of patients with a positive (99m)Tc-MIBI study but only 14% of those with a negative (99m)Tc-MIBI study, this is rose to 97% of patients with a parathyroid adenoma identified on early images. It is also shown that patients whose serum total calcium <2·51 mmol l(-1) rarely have positive (99m)Tc-MIBI scintigraphy.(99m)Tc-MIBI parathyroid scintigraphy is most likely to yield identification and localization of a parathyroid adenoma when both PTH and calcium are elevated however, although there is no lower limit of PTH which can predict a negative study, we cannot recommend (99m)Tc-MIBI parathyroid scintigraphy if the serum calcium is <2·51 mmol l(-1).
