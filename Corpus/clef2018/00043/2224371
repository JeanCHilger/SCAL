Multimodal imaging in Alzheimer's disease. The relationship between MRI, SPECT, cognitive and pathological changes. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease were studied using MRI, SPECT, and psychometric tests. Significant correlations between focal perfusion deficits and focal cognitive deficits were found. Significant correlations between regional relaxation time of white matter and psychometric tests of diffuse and focal categories were also found. Pathological examination confirmed Alzheimer's disease as the only diagnosis.
