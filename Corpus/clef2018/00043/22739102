Clinical significance of plasma Epstein-Barr Virus DNA loads in a large cohort of Malaysian patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-associated cancer that is the fifth most common cancer in Malaysia. Early and accurate diagnoses are critical for patient prognosis. Unfortunately, early detection of NPC is still a challenge and the cost of more accurate imaging protocols is prohibitive in developing countries like Malaysia.To evaluate the clinical values of pre-treatment plasma EBV DNA levels in Malaysian NPC patients.Plasma EBV DNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) in a large and multi-ethnic cohort of Malaysian patients with NPC (n=459) and 72 control subjects.We show for the first time that, compared to controls, NPC patients with stage I disease had significantly higher levels of EBV DNA (p<0.001). Further, the median level of plasma EBV DNA in stage IV patients with distant metastasis was >9-fold higher than those without systemic spread (p=0.001), suggesting plasma EBV DNA measurement could aid in the diagnosis of metastatic disease in advanced cases. Further, using a cut-off value of 8000 copies/mL, we demonstrate that EBV DNA level is a strong predictor for overall survival of NPC patients.Our data show that pre-treatment plasma EBV DNA is a potential biomarker for early stage and metastatic NPC. We conclude that the quantification of plasma EBV DNA is a useful tool in developing countries to stratify patients for MRI or PET/CT scans where such imaging protocol is not routinely applied.
