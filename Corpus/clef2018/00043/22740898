A case of early stage lung cancer detected by repeated cancer screening with positron emission tomography. There has been an increase in the detection rate of small early lung cancer due to recent improvements in imaging technology. However, conventional imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) alone are not capable of differentiating small pulmonary nodules. New modalities such as F-18 2'-deoxy-2fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography combined with CT (PET/CT) have contributed to the evaluation of lung cancer staging, although the differential diagnosis of pulmonary nodules showing ground-glass opacity (GGO) with PET/CT is controversial. In Japan, cancer screening with whole body FDG-PET has been available for asymptomatic individuals, and it has been reported that a wide variety of cancer types are detectable by FDG-PET at potentially curable stages. We present the case of a 62-year-old male with early lung cancer, which was revealed by repeated health screening. A PET/CT scan revealed definite intense FDG uptake (SUVmax 1.2) in the pulmonary nodules of the right upper lobe, while no definite FDG uptake was observed in the lesion in the previous annual screening. Right upper lobectomy was performed, and the pathological diagnosis was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Five-year survival has been noted since the thoracotomy, and the patient is doing well without recurrence. This is a significant case of early lung cancer with GGO lesions, which revealed intense FDG uptake during an annual repeated health screening with FDG-PET/CT.
