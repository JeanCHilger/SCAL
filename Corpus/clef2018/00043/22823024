The role and future potential of fluorinated biomarkers in positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) is rapidly emerging as the functional imaging method of choice for in vivo imaging applications in a number of key areas of drug discovery and clinical pathology, but especially in oncology. One key limitation of PET is the requirement for rapid synthesis and purification of biomarker/drug molecules regiospecifically labelled with short-lived positron-emitting isotopes.In this review, we focus on the role of (18)F-labelled molecules in PET, presenting a perspective on the challenges associated with the synthesis and future clinical utility of a range of labelled small molecules and macromolecular structures. Further preclinical method development for the regiospecific synthesis of fluorinated biomarkers under mild conditions is required before a wide range of (18)F-labelled molecules take their place alongside clinically established oncology biomarkers such as (18)FDG and (18)FLT.In this review, we offer insights into current and future chemical methods for the efficient synthesis of fluorinated PET biomarkers, featuring modern technologies such as microwave-promoted chemistries and microfluidic reactors, both of which possess the capability to routinely and rapidly produce the small quantities of PET-labelled molecules under the mild and efficient conditions that are required for PET tracer synthesis.(18)F PET is a flourishing field with many applications in drug discovery and development, through radiolabelling of drug molecules or use of fluorinated disease biomarkers.
