ATLANTIC DIP: pregnancy outcomes for women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. ATLANTIC DIP prospectively evaluated the perinatal and maternal outcomes of pregnancies complicated by Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes during 2006/2007 in 5 antenatal centres. All women with established diabetes for at least 6 months prior to the index pregnancy and booking for antenatal care between 1/1/2006 and 31/12/2007 were included in the study. Results were collected electronically via the DIAMOND Diabetes Information System. Pregnancy outcome was compared with that of the background population receiving antenatal care in the region during the same time. There were 104 singleton pregnancies during the period of study. The stillbirth rate (SBR) of 25/1000 was 5 times greater than that reported in the background population at 5/1000 and the perinatal mortality rate (PMR) of 25/1000 was 3.5 times greater than background 7/1000. The congenital malformation rate (CMR) of 24/1000 was twice that observed in the background population. Women were not well prepared for pregnancy with 28% receiving pre pregnancy care (PPC), 43% receiving pre pregnancy folic acid and 51% achieving a HbA1C < = 7% at first antenatal visit. Pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and/or pre eclampsia toxaemia (PET) were three times more common than in women in the background population. In conclusion women are not well prepared for pregnancy. Maternal and infant morbidity and infant mortality are greater in women with diabetes. A regional pre pregnancy care (PPC) programme and centralised glucose management are urgently needed.
