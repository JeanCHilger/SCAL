Estimation of 3 rate constants of the 3 compartments model in PET measurement by a weighted integral method--simulation of estimation errors. A simulation study to evaluate the errors in rate constants of the three compartment model using the weighted integral method was performed. Ten combinations of 7 kinds of weight functions, the errors were tested in 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) study. The error factors arising in PET measurement were statistical noise, cerebral blood volume, time shift and scanning time of PET measurement. Errors in each rate constant were within the range of 10 percent and those in k1k3/(k2+k3) within 1 percent. The weighted integral method was confirmed to be a faster method than the conventional least squares method within a reasonable error range.
