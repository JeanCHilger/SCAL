Acute and chronic inflammation studies of Strobilanthes callosus leaves extract on rat model. To assess the protective efficacy of Strobilanthes callosus against the acute and chronic inflammation on rat model.Inflammation was induced by carrageen and Freund's complete adjuvant in plantar surface of the rats. The ethanol, chloroform and petroleum ether extracts in three divided doses (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) were administered orally. Diclofenac sodium (10 mg/kg), prednisolone (5 mg/kg) and methotrexate (0.5 mg/kg) were used as standard. The statistical significance between means was analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. A p <0.005 was considered as statistically significant.Pet. ether (200 and 400 mg/kg) and ethanol extract (100 and 400 mg/kg) showed statistically significant (p < 0.001) effect in analgesic activity. In a carrageen-induced model, only pet. ether extract (100 and 400 mg/kg) confirmed statistically significant effect (p < 0.001) at every interval (four in all) of 1 h. In Freund's adjuvant model, Pet ether and ethanol extract (200 and 400 mg/kg) have shown statistically significant effect (p < 0.001) and in case of chloroform extract only single dose (400 mg/kg) were observed statistically significant results considered to be anti-arthritic effects. The histopathology pictures showed there was positive inhibition of arthritis at a certain level in different groups compared to positive control group.Pet. ether and ethanol extracts of S. callosus were observed to have a promising efficacy against acute and chronic inflammation.
