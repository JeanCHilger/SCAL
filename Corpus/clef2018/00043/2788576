Clinical evaluation of the 99mTc-CPI myocardial perfusion imaging. 99mTc-CPI myocardial perfusion scintigraphy including planar images in 35 patients and SPECT images in 16 patients has been studied. Scintigraphic data revealed that high quality 99mTc-CPI myocardial perfusion images were obtained. The sensitivity and specificity of 99mTc-CPI planar images in detecting CAD was 92% and 80% respectively. There was no significant difference in sensitivity for detecting CAD between planar and SPECT. However, the specificity of SPECT was much better than that of planar imaging.
