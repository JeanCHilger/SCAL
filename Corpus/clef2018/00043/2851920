PET determination of regional cerebral glucose metabolism in alcohol-dependent men and healthy controls using 11C-glucose. Regional brain glucose metabolism was determined in 9 male alcohol-dependent inpatients and 12 male healthy controls. All the patients were socially impaired by the alcohol abuse. All the subjects had abstained from alcohol and drugs for more than four weeks before entering the study. Brain glucose metabolism was determined by positron emission tomography (PET) with 11C-glucose as the tracer. Regions of interest were drawn on displayed computed tomographic (CT) images of the brain. Regions were transferred to corresponding PET slices, allowing the determination of regional glucose metabolism. In the healthy volunteers there was a reduction in glucose metabolism with age. In 11 of the 19 brain regions examined, the alcoholics had a 20% to 30% lower glucose metabolism than the controls. This was true for both cortical and subcortical structures. The distribution of relative regional metabolic rates indicated that parietal cortical areas were most affected. Atrophic changes as shown by CT were not correlated to the reduced metabolism in the alcohol-dependent patients.
