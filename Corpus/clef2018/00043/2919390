To the welfare of man and animals. This inaugural address consists of three parts, starting with an elaboration of the fact that there is great differentiation among animals and humans. The second section goes into their interests. In the third section some practical relationships between humans and animals are discussed and some common denominators are sought. The title of the address is a well-known motto in the Dutch veterinary world: 'Hominum animaliumque saluti', which stands for: 'To the Welfare of Man and Animal'.
