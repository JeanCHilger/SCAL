Single-photon emission computed tomography with 201Tl in the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. One hundred and thirty-six patients with CHD were examined by plane scintigraphy and single-photon emission computer-aided tomography (SPECT). The control group comprised 26 healthy persons. Two SPECT techniques were compared (gamma-chamber rotation at 360 and 180 degrees). In acute myocardial infarction, focal defects of perfusion were detected by SPECT in 36 out of 39 patients, those by plane scintigraphy in 30 patients. In angina pectoris patients, perfusion alterations were detected by SPECT and scintigraphy in 91.6 and 75% of cases, respectively. During tomographic examination of patients with postinfarction cardiosclerosis, the perfusion defects were revealed in 38 out of 42 patients, whereas during plane scintigraphy, such alterations were detected but in 31 patients. The advantages of SPECT and its high importance for diagnosing different patterns of CHD are discussed. It is recommended that SPECT and plane scintigraphy can be used combined in clinical practice.
