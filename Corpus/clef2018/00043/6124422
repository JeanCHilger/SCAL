Uptake and turnover of L-(13N)-glutamate in the normal human heart and in patients with coronary artery disease. L-(13N)-glutamate (4-8 mCi) was administered IV to 27 patients with coronary artery disease and to 12 control subjects. Quantitative whole body imaging of the 13N label was performed in 31 individuals at different time intervals following the injection. Initial uptake of the total myocardium was estimated to be 5.0 +/- 0.88% of the dose. Standardized areas of reduced size on the projection plane contained 2.38 +2- 0.41% of the total dose in control subjects and 2.67 +/- 0.49% in coronary patients. Subsequent imaging exhibited significant differences in the dynamic behavior of both groups: 13N activity loss within 10 min was 3.2 +/- 4.2% of the initial value in control subjects and 16.0 +/- 9.8% in coronary patients. In individual cases a high myocardial accumulation of the 13N label was observed in regions of reduced 201Tl uptake. The findings are explained by an augmented extraction efficiency in cases of flow reduction. Glutamate utilization may be involved in metabolic adaptations of the myocardium to chronic or repetitive ischemia and may be worthy of further investigation by positron emission tomography.
