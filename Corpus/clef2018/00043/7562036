Vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor scintigraphy. This study presents the biodistribution, safety and absorbed dose of 123I-VIP administered to 18 patients with intestinal adenocarcinomas or endocrine tumors.To achieve high-specific activity, 123I-VIP was purified by HPLC. Following intravenous administration of 123I-VIP (172 +/- 17 MBq (4.65 +/- 0.5 mCi) < 300 pmole ( < 1 microgram)/patient), sequential images were recorded during the initial 30 min. Thereafter, whole-body images were acquired in anterior and posterior views at various time points. Dosimetry calculations were performed on the basis of gamma camera data, urine, feces and blood activities.After injection of labeled peptide, the lung was the primary site of 123I-VIP uptake. Peak lung activity represented 40% +/- 7% of the injected dose at 0.7 hr and declined to 21% +/- 7% at 3.5, to 14% +/- 3% at 7 and to 8% +/- 4% 22 hr postinjection. Radioactivity was excreted into the urine and amounted to 37% +/- 16% of the injected dose within 4, 68% +/- 12% within 8, 82% +/- 16% within 16 and 93% +/- 8% within 24 hr postinjection. The mean effective half-life of 123I-VIP in the lungs was 2.2 and 6 hr in the urinary bladder. The highest radiation absorbed doses were calculated for the lungs [67 muGy/MBq (248 mrad/mCi)], urinary bladder [77 muGy/MBq (284 mrad/mCi)] and thyroid gland [104 muGy/MBq (386 mrad/mCi)]. The effective dose was 28 muSv/MBq (104 mrem/mCi).HPLC-purified 123I-VIP shows favorable dosimetry and is a safe and promising peptide tracer for localization of tumors expressing receptors for VIP.
