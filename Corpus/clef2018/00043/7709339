Haloperidol blocks the uptake of [18F]N-methylspiroperidol by extrastriatal dopamine receptors in schizophrenic patients. We had previously demonstrated extrastriatal uptake of [18F]N-methylspiroperidol (18F-NMS) in the human brain. This study evaluates the effect of haloperidol on 18F-NMS binding in extrastriatal brain regions. Six schizophrenic patients on haloperidol underwent two PET scans with 18F-NMS at 12 h and at 6 days after haloperidol withdrawal. There was a significant increase in 18F-NMS uptake in striatal, thalamic, and temporal regions but not in frontal, occipital, or cerebellar regions, following drug withdrawal. Haloperidol's ability to block the uptake of 18F-NMS is an indication of the specificity of the radioligand's binding in these regions and supports the postmortem data demonstrating the presence of dopamine D2 receptors in the thalamus and temporal cortex of the human brain.
