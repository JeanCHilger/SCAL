The interrenicular septum. A normal anatomical variant seen on DMSA SPECT. SPECT imaging has been shown to identify additional defects when applied to Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy. However, the nature of these defects is uncertain. They may be because of small scars or anatomical variants. The interrenicular septum (IRS) is a normal finding that may mimic a scar on ultrasound examination or tomography. In this study, it was found that the IRS may be identified on Tc-99m DMSA SPECT and that it was present in 32% of patients. Its characteristic appearance is a linear area of absent tracer uptake extending from the renal hilum into the parenchyma, usually anterosuperiorly. The preservation of renal cortical uptake differentiates it from a scar, which results in a defect in the rim of cortical Tc-99m DMSA accumulation.
