Studies of migration of potentially genotoxic compounds into water stored in pet bottles. Coloured polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles for carbonated beverages were studied for potential migration of genotoxic compounds. A combined approach, using physicochemical methods and a bacterial short-term mutagenicity test (Ames test) was followed. Standard EEC and US FDA tests for total migration of non-volatile migrant compounds into distilled water were performed, together with modified tests, where freeze-drying instead of evaporation of water was used, in order to measure both volatile and non-volatile chemicals. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed on these residues. PET bottles filled with naturally carbonated mineral water were also used for long-term total organic carbon (TOC) and mutagenicity migration studies (up to 6 months' storage). Total migration results for PET bottles were within the EEC and US FDA limits. The use of freeze-drying for the elimination of water enabled much higher total migration data (higher than the limits) to be revealed. Some potentially genotoxic compounds (acetaldehyde, dimethyl terephthalate, terephthalic acid) were identified in these migrant compounds by GC-MS analysis. The tests for TOC migration gave a maximum value after 2 wk storage and the mutagenicity tests on non-volatile migrant compounds gave always negative results.
