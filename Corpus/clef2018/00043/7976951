Viral encephalitis in children: detection with technetium-99m HMPAO brain single-photon emission CT and its value in prediction of outcome. To assess the role of regional cerebral blood flow measured by technetium-99m hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) brain single-photon emission CT (SPECT) in viral encephalitis of children.Eighteen children diagnosed as having viral encephalitis (12 Epstein-Barr virus, 4 herpes simplex virus, and 2 Japanese B virus) underwent Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT and brain MR and/or CT.During the acute episode, 4 (22%) of the 18 patients had localized abnormality on brain MR and/or CT. Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT in the acute phase showed that 17 (94%) of the 18 patients had increased regional cerebral blood flow and 1 (6%) of the 18 children had a normal brain SPECT. Follow-up brain SPECT was performed at least 15 days after the acute episode. In 17 patients with abnormal first brain SPECT, 12 (71%) had normal second brain SPECT and 5 (29%) had decreased regional cerebral blood flow. The group of patients with normal regional cerebral blood flow on the follow-up brain SPECT had a better outcome than the group of patients with decreased regional cerebral blood flow.(a) The Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT was abnormal more often than CT or MR in children with acute viral encephalitis and provided better location. (b) In acute episodes of encephalitis, most patients showed locally increased regional cerebral blood flow. (c) After acute episodes, the regional cerebral blood flow returned to normal in most cases. (d) A normal Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT in the subacute phase usually indicates a good clinical outcome (no neurologic defect) 1 year after the acute illness in children with viral encephalitis.
