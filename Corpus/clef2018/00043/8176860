A study on evaluation of CBF measurement based on microsphere model with N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (IMP) and SPECT--its correction with the value of PaCO2. To evaluate the regional cerebral blood flow measurement with N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (IMP), we performed 123I-IMP SPECT and 133Xe inhalation method on 9 patients with mild cerebrovascular diseases and so on. A tracer dose of 123I-IMP (111 MBq) was injected i.v. and the data were obtained 15 min later. Regional CBF was measured by the microsphere model and arterial blood sampling method. However, mean cerebral blood flow values was not in agreement with both methods. We supposed the reason of the disagreement was due to the difference of PaCO2 when the studies were performed. Hence, CBF measurement with 123I-IMP was performed on the other patient's population with loading of hyperventilation before the IMP injection. Comparing with the control state with normal breathing, we calculated the rate of change of mean CBF between the state with normal breathing and the state with hyperventilation that was 1.02 ml/100 g/min/mmHg PaCO2. After the correction with the rate, we observed a much significant relation between the mean CBF measured with 123I-IMP SPECT and 133Xe inhalation method. When compared CBF values with loading studies or certain therapies, the correction of CBF with the rate of change of PaCO2 is one of the very important factors to be considered. Moreover, 133Xe inhalation method without the correction of PaCO2 can not be a golden standard method for rCBF measurement.
