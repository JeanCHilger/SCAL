Comparative study of 201Tl-scintigraphic image and endomyocardial biopsy findings in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. 201Tl-SPECT image was compared with the findings of endomyocardial biopsy in patients with dilated cardiomyopathies (DCM), and diagnostic value of 201Tl patchy pattern image for fibrosis with DCM was evaluated. Serial 22 patients diagnosed as DCM with endomyocardial biopsy findings were selected for this study (age: 50 +/- 17 y.o., Male/Female = 17/5). Patchy pattern of 201Tl-SPECT image was visually classified to 4 stage according to the severity of inhomogeneous defect, and pathologic findings of fibrosis was also classified into 4 according to the severity of fibrosis (0: none, 1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe). Ejection fraction calculated from left ventriculography and end-diastolic dimension by echocardiography were also compared with 201Tl-SPECT image. Out of 22 patients, 21 patients (95%) showed fibrosis, and 18 patients (82%) showed patchy pattern with 201Tl-SPECT. Severity of patchy pattern was not in good relation to that of fibrosis (r = 0.374). 201Tl image was not related to the function nor dimension. Four autopsy studies revealed a good relation of macroscopic severity, spatial distribution of fibrosis and inhomogeneous 201Tl-defect pattern before death. Patchy pattern of 201Tl-SPECT image will show the myocardial fibrosis in patients with DCM, and is independent of the function. 201Tl-SPECT may show more clinically useful findings of spatial distribution and severity of fibrosis with focal myocardial biopsy.
