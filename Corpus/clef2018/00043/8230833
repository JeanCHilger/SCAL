A basic study of multi-gated single photon emission computed tomography with thallium-201. A Multi-gated SPECT was acquired commonly in 64 x 64 matrix and 8 frames per cardiac cycle (64 x 64/8F). But it was not established that 64 x 64 matrix and 8 frames per cardiac cycle were the most suitable in multi-gated SPECT. Five normal volunteers were examined multi-gated 201Tl SPECT with 5 acquisition modes of 128 x 128 matrix/16 frames, 128 x 128/8F, 64 x 64/32F, 64 x 64/8F using multi-detector SPECT system (GCA-9300). And we calculated percent wall thickening (%WT) [%WT = (ES counts - ED counts)/ED counts] in 9 cases with 64 x 64/8F. The images quality of both 128 x 128/16F and 128 x 128/8F was not clear in compared with images of both 64 x 64/16F and 64 x 64/8F, because the end-diastolic phase of 128 x 128/16F images showed a decreased uptake of 201Tl in the antero-apical region. Although 64 x 64 (8) images had only 8 frames per cardiac cycle, we could observe systolic and diastolic phase and we could calculate %WT. The %WT (M +/- SD) of horizontal long axis images were 48 +/- 15 (sept. basal), 48 +/- 19 (sept. apical), 65 +/- 29 (apex), 49 +/- 22 (lat. apical) and 40 +/- 15 (lat. basal).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
