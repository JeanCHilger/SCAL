Evaluation of reconstruction algorithms in SPECT neuroimaging: I. Comparison of statistical noise in SPECT neuroimages with 'naive' and 'realistic' predictions. In the presence of statistical noise, an iterative reconstruction algorithm (IRA) for the quantitative reconstruction of single-photon-emission computed tomographic (SPECT) brain images overcomes major limitations of applying the standard filtered back projection (FBP) reconstruction algorithm to projection data which have been degraded by convolution of the true radioactivity distribution with a finite-resolution distance-dependent detector response: (a) the non-uniformity within the grey (or white) matter voxels which results even though the true model is uniform within these voxels (b) a significantly lower ratio of grey/white matter voxel values than in the true model
