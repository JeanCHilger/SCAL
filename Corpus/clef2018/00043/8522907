A study on 3D Monte Carlo modeling of photon propagation through tissue. Monte Carlo techniques have become popular in modeling of the random events with advantage of powerful computing systems. Especially they have been applied to simulate processes involving random behavior such as diffusion of the Gamma rays through matter and electron concentrations in semiconductors. Recent medical innovations such as Computer Automated Tomography (CAT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are ideal for Monte Carlo modeling techniques. This paper presents derivation and results of the three dimensional Monte Carlo simulation. The results are presented for tissue interactions with photons at wavelength of 207 nm X rays and 630 nm red light. Resulting values of model tissue have been interpolated and mapped into two-dimensional pattern in gray tone. Combination of two-dimensional patterns allow a reconstruction in three dimensions.
