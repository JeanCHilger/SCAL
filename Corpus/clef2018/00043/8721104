Evaluation of reserved hepatic function in patients with hepatobiliary tumor by 99mTc-GSA: effect of hyperbilirubinemia and usefulness of regional reserved hepatic functional imaging. The evaluation of the reserved hepatic function was performed by 99mTc-galactosyl serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) in seventy patients with hepatobiliary tumor. The dynamic study was performed to evaluate global reserved hepatic function following the intravenous bolus injection of 99mTc-GSA, and the hepatic single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was obtained to assess the regional reserved hepatic function. The functional hepatic index (LHL15) was derived from liver time-activity data, and it was compared with serum total-bilirubin level, serum albumin level and plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green (ICG15). In the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, LHL15 value agreed well with ICG15 value, serum total-bilirubin level, and serum albumin level. Moderate or severe hepatic dysfunction was observed at 65.4% of these patients. In the patients with cholangiocellular carcinoma, a discrepancy of LHL15 value and ICG15 value was observed. Increment of the ICG15 value was correlated with that of the serum total-bilirubin level, whereas the correlations was not observed between the LHL15 value and the serum total-bilirubin level. These results indicate that 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy can evaluate the reserved hepatic function without the embellishment of jaundice. This method is useful for assessing the global and regional reserved hepatic function.
