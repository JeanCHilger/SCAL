Small pet aquarium frogs as a source of Salmonella. Salmonellae were isolated from 21% of the samples of freshwater aquarium frogs tested and from 25% of the samples of aquarium water containing these frogs. The salmonellae were Salmonella arizonae, S. bovis-morbificans, S. hadar, S. saint-paul, S. typhimurium, and S. worthington. These isolations were made over a period of 9 months and from three different cities. This association of salmonellae with frogs may contribute to cases of human salmonellosis since other aquarium species have already been shown to contribute to such cases.
