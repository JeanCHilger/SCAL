Human brain activity related to orientation discrimination tasks. In order to relate regional activity in the human brain to the different components of discrimination tasks, we compared regional cerebral blood flow, measured with positron emission tomography, under four conditions: successive orientation discrimination, orientation identification, detection and passive viewing. By adding successive discrimination and passive viewing at a second, lower rate we were able to investigate the main effects and interaction between task and presentation rate. Four occipital regions--the posterior calcarine region bilaterally, the right lingual gyrus and the right interior occipital cortex--displayed a main effect of presentation rate. Two regions--a right posterolateral occipital region and a right posterior fusiform region--displayed a significant main effect of task. The involvement of this posterior fusiform region in successive discrimination was also revealed by the subtraction of detection from successive discrimination, as was that of the right middle fusiform gyrus. Finally, a more anterior right middle fusiform region was differentially active in successive discrimination compared to identification, suggesting that activity in this region is related to the temporal comparison of orientation.
