Intravenous dextroamphetamine and brain glucose metabolism. This study reports the effects of intravenous dextroamphetamine on cerebral glucose metabolism assayed by positron emission tomography (PET) and [fluorine-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in 13 healthy adults during the performance of a continuous visual attention task. Two FDG PET scans were performed within a single experimental session. The first scan was preceded by the injection of placebo and the second scan by the injection of 0.15 mg/kg dextroamphetamine. Global and normalized regional glucose metabolic rates (rCMRglc) were examined as a function of pharmacological challenge and subjective experience. Subcortical, limbic, frontal, and cerebellar rCMRglc significantly increased after dextroamphetamine, whereas rCMRglc of the temporal cortex significantly decreased. Physiological and self-report measures of subjective states showed the expected alterations. These rCMRglc changes reflect both the direct pharmacological effect of dextroamphetamine on monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems as well as enhancement of the activation of the neural network mediating the performance of the continuous attention task.
