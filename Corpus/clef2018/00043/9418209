Single-step synthesis of [18F]haloperidol from the chloro-precursor and its applications in PET imaging of a cat's brain. We have established a convenient synthesis process for the synthesis of[18F]haloperidol using a single-step 18F-for-Cl exchange reaction and a new elution system for the preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using C18 bonded vinylalcohol copolymer gel (ODP) and a basic eluent. We successfully applied the product to cat-PET study and got clear images of the striatum, showing the usefulness of this synthesis.
