Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in diagnosis of untreated prostate cancer. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been utilized since glucose metabolism in cancer tissue is considered to relate to its malignant potential. We evaluate the application of FDG-PET to prostate cancer. FDG uptake of cancer tissues was higher with higher Gleason grade, advanced clinical stage and higher serum PSA value than that with lower Gleason grade, localized clinical stage and lower serum PSA value. The measurement of glucose metabolism in the prostate using FDG-PET was suggested to be useful for evaluation of the biological malignant potential of prostate cancer. It may serve as a predictive factor for prognosis and may be useful in determining the effectiveness of hormonal therapy in prostate cancer.
