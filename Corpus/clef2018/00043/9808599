Intensive medical therapy versus coronary angioplasty for suppression of myocardial ischemia in survivors of acute myocardial infarction: a prospective, randomized pilot study. Patients who have inducible ischemia after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) generally undergo coronary angiography with the intent to revascularize. Whether this approach is superior to intensive treatment with anti-ischemic medications is unknown.We performed a prospective, randomized pilot study comparing intensive medical therapy with coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for suppression of myocardial ischemia in 44 stable survivors of AMI. Myocardial ischemia was quantified with adenosine 201Tl tomography (SPECT) performed 4.5+/-2.9 days after AMI. All patients at baseline had a large total (>/=20%) and ischemic (>/=10%) left ventricular perfusion defect size (PDS). SPECT was repeated at 43+/-26 days after therapy was optimized. The total stress-induced PDS was comparably reduced with medical therapy (from 38+/-13% to 26+/-16% P<0.0001) and PTCA (from 35+/-12% to 20+/-16%In this small pilot study, intensive medical therapy and PTCA were comparable at suppressing ischemia in stable patients after AMI. Sequential imaging with adenosine SPECT can track changes in PDS after anti-ischemic therapies and thereby predict subsequent outcome. Corroboration of these preliminary findings in a larger cardiac-event trial is warranted.
