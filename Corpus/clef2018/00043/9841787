Structural and functional meta-analytic evidence for fronto-subcortical system deficit in progressive supranuclear palsy. Meta-analytic methods were used to determine the most sensitive indexes to fronto-subcortical deficit in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and to further characterize the neurocognitive and related features of PSP that can provide a basis of comparison to other disorders with prominent subcortical brain lesions. Studies dating back to 1984 were gathered and calibrated to compare the neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological test results from 229 patients with PSP, and 357 healthy controls. The tests most sensitive to fronto-subcortical deficit in PSP were mostly neuropsychological measures that include such tests as the Stroop Task, Trail Making Test Part A, and Purdue pegboard performance. We conclude that although neuropsychological measures may be most sensitive to deficits in PSP, they are also less specific and valid indicators of fronto-subcortical brain system integrity.
