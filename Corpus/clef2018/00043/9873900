A symbolic environment for visualizing activated foci in functional neuroimaging datasets. This paper presents a symbolic visualization environment known as the Corner Cube environment, which was developed to facilitate rapid examination and comparison of activated foci defined by analyses of functional neuroimaging datasets. We have performed a comparative evaluation of this environment against maximum-intensity projection and 'gallery of slices' displays, and the results suggest that the Corner Cube environment has definite advantages over both conventional display techniques. We conclude that the Corner Cube is an effective tool for summarizing the spatial characteristics of activated foci within an easily understood visual context and is especially useful for displaying the similarities and differences in functional neuroimaging datasets.
