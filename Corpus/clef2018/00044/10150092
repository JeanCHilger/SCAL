Advances in imaging for assessment of ischemic heart disease. Cardiac imaging techniques continue to develop for the noninvasive detection and evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease. These techniques include single photon and positron emission tomography along with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.  The new myocardial perfusion tracers 99mTc-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile and  99mTc-teboroxime have recently come into general use for these purposes, and their role alongside that of more traditional agents is currently being defined using new imaging protocols and instrumentation. 99mTc-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile has also been documented as an important research tool for evaluating both at-risk myocardium and the degree of subsequent myocardial salvage following reperfusion therapies for acute myocardial infarction. Antimyosin antibody imaging is another emerging approach in the evaluation of patients with acute myocardial infarction.  Metabolic imaging with  18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose using positron emission tomography to detect myocardial segments with compromised blood flow but preserved glucose metabolism is currently the best noninvasive method of identifying viable myocardium in patients with left ventricular dysfunction who may benefit from revascularization. Insights from these studies have led to development of the current 201Tl stress-rest reinjection protocols for viability evaluation using single photon emission computed tomography. Positron emission tomography, in combination with blood flow tracers using kinetic modeling, provides accurate estimates of coronary blood flow and flow reserve.  The use of these new imaging techniques will allow increasingly accurate evaluation of patients with suspected and proven coronary artery disease in the future.
