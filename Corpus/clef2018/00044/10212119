Comparison of four 64Cu-labeled somatostatin analogues in vitro and in a tumor-bearing rat model: evaluation of new derivatives for positron emission tomography imaging and targeted radiotherapy. Previous studies have shown that modification of the somatostatin analogue octreotide (OC), by substitution of tyrosine for phenylalanine at position 3 and of a C-terminal carboxylic acid for an alcohol, to give Tyr3-octreotate (Y3-TATE) improved uptake of the peptide in somatostatin receptor-positive tissues. To determine which substitution best accounts for increased target tissue uptake, the peptides containing single modifications, Tyr3-octreotide (Y3-OC) and octreotate (TATE), were synthesized. These peptides were conjugated to the macrocyclic chelating agent 1,4,8, 11-tetraazacyclotetradecane-N,N',N",N"'-tetraacetic acid (TETA) and radiolabeled with 64Cu(II). The in vitro receptor binding, in vitro tumor cell uptake, and in vivo distribution properties of 64Cu-labeled TETA-Y3-OC and TETA-TATE were compared to those of [64Cu]TETA-OC and [64Cu]TETA-Y3-TATE. Cu-TETA-TATE (IC50 = 0.297 +/- 0.0055 nM) and Cu-TETA-Y3-TATE (IC50 = 0.308 +/- 0.0375 nM) displayed significantly higher binding affinity to somatostatin receptors on CA20948 rat pancreatic tumor membranes than Cu-TETA-Y3-OC (IC50 = 0.397 +/- 0.0206 nM) and Cu-TETA-OC (IC50 = 0. 498 +/- 0.039 nM). Similarly, the uptakes of [64Cu]TETA-Y3-TATE (60. 75 +/- 1.21%) and [64Cu]TETA-TATE (55.62 +/- 0.16%) into AR42J rat pancreatic tumor cells over a 2-h time period were higher than those of [64Cu]TETA-Y3-OC (47.20 +/- 1.20%) and [64Cu]TETA-OC (34.07 +/- 2. 24%). The in vitro results suggest that the C-terminal carboxylate may contribute more to enhanced receptor binding and tumor cell uptake than the substitution at the 3-position. Biodistributions in CA20948 tumor-bearing rats showed receptor-mediated uptake of the 64Cu-labeled peptides in somatostatin-rich tissues, including the pituitary, adrenals, pancreas, and tumor. The structure-activity relationships of the four 64Cu-labeled peptides did not show consistent trends in all target tissues, but [64Cu]TETA-Y3-TATE exhibited tumor uptake 1.75-3.5 times higher than the other derivatives at 4 h postinjection. The greater tumor retention of [64Cu]TETA-Y3-TATE justifies the selection of this agent for future PET imaging and targeted radiotherapy studies.
