The clinical picture of frontotemporal dementia: diagnosis and follow-up. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) was diagnosed in 74 outpatients with a standardized assessment including neuropsychological tests, behavioural scale, structural and functional imaging. Clinical characteristics were consistent with the literature data. The cohort was followed for 2-6 years to determine the reliable variable for evaluating the progression of FTD. Every fourth patient died after a mean duration of 7 years. At first, FTD manifests itself in behavioural changes with relatively stable global cognition although language, verbal fluency and memory tests were reliable tools to follow the progression of the disease. Below 18 of Mini-Mental State Examination, mutism and apathy prevented from neuropsychological testing within the next 6 months. Behavioural disorders evolved with time but restlessness and hyperorality were long-lasting. Imaging showed the progression of a consistent pattern of anterior abnormalities with frequent leukoaraiosis.
