Contribution of mitogen-activated protein kinase to stimulation of phospholipase D by the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe in human neutrophils. Phospholipase D (PLD) plays an important role in signaling through phosphatidylcholine (PC) and in the production of superoxide (respiratory burst) by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) stimulated by the chemoattractant fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP). However, the regulation of PLD activity by protein kinases is not fully understood. In the present study, we have used a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitor (PD 98059) to investigate a possible connection between extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and PLD activity and respiratory burst. Using a range of concentrations (3-20 microM) which inhibit ERK activity, PD 98059 inhibited PLD activity induced by fMLP in cytochalasin B-primed PMN, as assessed by production-tritiated phosphatidylethanol (PEt), phosphatidic acid (PA), and hydrolysis of PC. However, the inhibition was partial (approximately 50%), while inhibition of PC hydrolysis was almost complete, suggesting a concomitant inhibition of PLA2 activity. In addition, PD 98059 reduced fMLP-induced respiratory burst by 50%, an effect which was correlated with PLD inhibition of PLD (r = 0.981, P < 0.01), and neither did PD 98059 inhibit the PLD activity and respiratory burst induced by PKC upon its direct activation by phorbol myristate acetate. These data provide the first evidence for implication of the ERK cascade in the stimulation of PLD through Gi signaling. They further indicate that PLD stimulation by fMLP receptors occurs through two pathways, dependent and independent on MAP kinase, the former pathway being linked to superoxide production.
