Adequacy of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in children. When the use of dialytical therapy is decided after a careful assessment of clinical and laboratory variables, the close supervision of the procedure, that allows a feedback between our indications and its clinical efficacy, is essential. The correct and routine use of validated adequacy tools such as Kt/V and the Peritoneal Equilibration Test (PET) is mandatory. We compare the adequacy figures for adult and pediatric populations, mentioning the Kt/V and PET values obtained in eight patients followed during 12 months in a Nephrology Unit. An initial Kt/V of 2.04 and of 2.14 after 12 months of procedure are values that adjust to the general recommendations discussed in this paper. According to PET results, this group of patients were classified as low average for ultrafiltration and high average for creatinine clearance. Based on the local experience and literature review, some recommendations are made for the management of peritoneal dialysis in children.
