Pet markets: permits and surveillance. When pets are sold on pet markets there are frequently situations that are not consistent with the laws concerned with animal welfare. Animals are not packed properly, tropical animals needing certain temperatures are sold outdoors under unsuitable weather conditions, animals are kept and transported in unsuitable containers, shy animals not used to market conditions or sick animals are being offered. Different possibilities to guarantee proper conditions for the animals are being described involving the organizer as well as the local veterinary authority surveying the market. Possible executive measures are presented.
