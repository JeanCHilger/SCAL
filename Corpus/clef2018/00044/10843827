Doppler tissue velocity sampling improves diagnostic accuracy during dobutamine stress echocardiography for the assessment of viable myocardium in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Both nuclear imaging with F18-fluorodeoxyglucose and dobutamine stress echocardiography have been used to identify viable myocardium, although dobutamine-stress echocardiography has been demonstrated to be the less sensitive of the two.To compare the accuracy of pulsed-wave Doppler tissue sampling with dobutamine-stress echocardiography for the detection of viable myocardium, using F18-fluorodeoxyglucose imaging as a reference. Methods Forty patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction (mean ejection fraction 33+/-11%), underwent F18-fluorodeoxyglucose imaging, dobutamine-stress echocardiography and pulsed-wave Doppler tissue sampling. Evaluation was performed using a six-segment model.Visual assessment by resting echo was feasible in 230 out of 240 segments (96%) 177 (77%) segments showed severe dyssynergy at rest. F18-fluorodeoxyglucose imaging showed viability in 95 (54%) segments while 82 (46%) were non-viable. Ejection phase velocity at rest was not significantly differentThe sensitivity of pulsed-wave Doppler tissue sampling is superior to dobutamine-stress echocardiography for the assessment of myocardial viability.
