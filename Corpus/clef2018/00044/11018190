Relation among exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and viability late after acute myocardial infarction. This study assesses the relation between exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmia (VA) and scintigraphic markers of myocardial ischemia and viability in patients referred for exercise stress testing late after acute myocardial infarction. We studied 171 patients (144 men, age 57 +/- 10 years) with resting wall motion abnormalities by exercise stress testing in conjunction with methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) single-photon emission computed tomography at a mean of 4.1 years after myocardial infarction. Ischemia was defined as reversible perfusion abnormalities. Myocardial viability was considered in myocardial segments with resting wall motion abnormalities in the presence of normal perfusion, a reversible defect or a fixed defect with regional MIBI uptake > or = 50% of maximal uptake. Exercise-induced VA occurred in 46 patients (27%). Patients with VA had a higher prevalence of infarct-related artery stenosis (43 [93%] vs 93 [74%], p < 0.01), peri-infarction ischemia (32 [70%] vs 54 [43%], p < 0.005), and ischemia in > or = 2 vascular regions (20 [43%] vs 27 [22%], p < 0.01) than patients without VA. Reversible defects were detected in 39 of 97 dyssynergic segments (40%) in patients with versus 40 of 248 dyssynergic segments (16%) in patients without VA (p < 0.0001). In dyssynergic segments without reversible perfusion abnormalities, the percent resting MIBI uptake was > or = 50% in 39 of 58 segments (67%) in patients with versus 63% in 131 of 208 segments in patients without VA (p = NS). The percentage of viable segments was 80% and 69% in patients with and without VA, respectively (p < 0.05). It is concluded that patients with exercise-induced VA late after myocardial infarction have a higher prevalence of ischemia in the peri-infarction zone and in multivessel distribution. Myocardial ischemia in the dyssynergic myocardium appears to be a major mechanism underlying the occurrence of VA in these patients.
