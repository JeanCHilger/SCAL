A technique for extracting physiological parameters and the required input function simultaneously from PET image measurements: theory and simulation study. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an important tool for enabling quantification of human brain function. However, quantitative studies using tracer kinetic modeling require the measurement of the tracer time-activity curve in plasma (PTAC) as the model input function. It is widely believed that the insertion of arterial lines and the subsequent collection and processing of the biomedical signal sampled from the arterial blood are not compatible with the practice of clinical PET, as it is invasive and exposes personnel to the risks associated with the handling of patient blood and radiation dose. Therefore, it is of interest to develop practical noninvasive measurement techniques for tracer kinetic modeling with PET. In this paper, a technique is proposed to extract the input function together with the physiological parameters from the brain dynamic images alone. The identifiability of this method is tested rigorously by using Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the proposed method is able to quantify all the required parameters by using the information obtained from two or more regions of interest (ROI's) with very different dynamics in the PET dynamic images. There is no significant improvement in parameter estimation for the local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (LCMRGlc) if the number of ROI's are more than three. The proposed method can provide very reliable estimation of LCMRGlc, which is our primary interest in this study.
