Quantitative gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging with 201Tl: an assessment of the limitations. Gated SPECT (GSPECT) perfusion imaging has been increasing in popularity both with 99Tc(m) agents and 201Tl. However, both higher activities than administered in the UK and multi-headed cameras are often used. The aim of this study was to assess GSPECT imaging using lower activities of 201Tl with a single-headed camera. Seventy patients underwent stress and redistribution GSPECT imaging after a mean injected activity of 62 +/- 7 MBq 201Tl. These patients also underwent radionuclide ventriculography (RNVG) imaging. The Cedars Sinai Quantitative Gated SPECT (QGS) package was used to calculate left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from the GSPECT studies. Comparison of ejection fractions calculated using GSPECT with those calculated using RNVG yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.70 for the stress studies and 0.71 for the redistribution studies. The width of the mean 95% prediction interval ranged from 22 to 74 percentage points for the stress studies and 22 to 86 percentage points for the redistribution studies. Ejection fractions calculated from stress and redistribution GSPECT studies showed a correlation of 0.80 with a mean 95% prediction interval of 42.6 +/- 0.4 percentage points. In conclusion, left ventricular ejection fractions calculated using the QGS algorithm from 201Tl GSPECT studies are inadequate for use in clinical practice.
