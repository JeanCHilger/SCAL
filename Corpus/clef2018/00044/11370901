An interior point iterative maximum-likelihood reconstruction algorithm incorporating upper and lower bounds with application to SPECT transmission imaging. The algorithm we consider here is a block-iterative (or ordered subset) version of the interior point algorithm for transmission reconstruction. Our algorithm is an interior point method because each vector of the iterative sequence [x(k)], k = 0, 1, 2, ... satisfies the constraints a(j) < x(j)k < b(j), j = 1, ..., J. Because it is a block-iterative algorithm that reconstructs the transmission attenuation map and places constraints above and below the pixel values of the reconstructed image, we call it the BITAB method. Computer simulations using the three-dimensional mathematical cardiac and torso phantom, reveal that the BITAB algorithm in conjunction with reasonably selected prior upper and lower bounds has the potential to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed attenuation coefficients from truncated fan beam transmission projections. By suitably selecting the bounds, it is possible to restrict the over estimation of coefficients outside the fully sampled region, that results from reconstructing truncated fan beam projections with iterative transmission algorithms such as the maximum-likelihood gradient type algorithm.
