Minimally invasive open parathyroidectomy in an endemic goiter area: a prospective study. Single-gland disease identified by preoperative localization studies in combination with rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring seems to allow a limited exploration of the neck in sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism. Minimally invasive open parathyroidectomy by lateral approach (oMIP) in sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism seems feasible in an endemic goiter region.One hundred consecutive patients with sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism underwent preoperative double-phase technetium Tc 99m sestamibi scanning with single-photon emission computed tomography and high-resolution ultrasonography with color Doppler imaging of the cervical region. All patients were operated on with the use of quick parathyroid hormone assay to confirm the surgical success "on-line." Patients with localized single-gland disease, irrespective of additional ipsilateral thyroid disease requiring surgery, were selected for oMIP. Success of the preoperative localization studies, postoperative (at least 6 months) serum calcium levels, and operating time were analyzed.University hospital, section of endocrine surgery.Of 100 patients, 83 (83%) were considered suitable for oMIP. In 69 patients, oMIP was finished successfully. Nine of these had had previous neck surgery, and another 24 underwent additional ipsilateral thyroid resection. Permanent normocalcemia was achieved in 67 (97.1%) of 69 patients and 98 (98%) of 100 patients.The oMIP in combination with quick parathyroid hormone assay may become the treatment of choice for sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism in an endemic goiter region in centers with high experience in thyroid and parathyroid surgery. It allows treatment of concomitant ipsilateral thyroid disease and is feasible in reoperations.
