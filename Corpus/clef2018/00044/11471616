Quantitative assessment of regional cerebral blood flows by perfusion CT studies at low injection rates: a critical review of the underlying theoretical models. Viability of the cerebral parenchyma is dependent on cerebral blood flow (CBF), which is usually kept in a very narrow range due to efficient autoregulation processes and can be altered in a variety of pathological conditions. An accurate method allowing for a quantitative assessment of regional cerebral blood flows (rCBF) and available for the routine clinical practice would, for sure, greatly contribute to improving the management of patients with cerebrovascular diseases. Different imaging techniques are now available to evaluate rCBF: positron emission tomography single photon emission CT
