Template images for nonhuman primate neuroimaging: 1. Baboon. Coregistration of functional brain images across many subjects offers several experimental advantages and is widely used for studies in humans. Voxel-based coregistration methods require a high-quality 3-D template image, preferably one that corresponds to a published atlas. Template images are available for human, but we could not find an appropriate template for neuroimaging studies in baboon. Here we describe the formation of a T1-weighted structural MR template image and a PET blood flow template, derived from 9 and 7 baboons, respectively. Custom software aligns individual MR images to the MRI template human supervision is needed only to initially estimate any gross rotational misalignment. In these aligned individual images, internal subcortical fiducial points correspond closely to a photomicrographic baboon atlas with an average error of 1.53 mm. Cortical test points showed a mean error of 1.99 mm compared to the mean location for each point. Alignment of individual PET blood flow images directly to the PET template was compared to a two-step alignment process via each subject's MR image. The two transformations were identical within 0.41 mm, 0.54 degrees, and 1.0% (translation, rotation, and linear stretch
