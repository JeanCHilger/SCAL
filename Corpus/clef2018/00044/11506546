Template images for nonhuman primate neuroimaging: 2. Macaque. Neuroimaging studies are increasingly performed in macaque species, including the pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina). At times experimental questions can be answered by analysis of functional images in individual subjects and reference to a structural image in that subject. However, coregistration of functional brain images across many subjects offers the experimental advantage of enabling voxel-based analysis over multiple subjects and is therefore widely used in human studies. Voxel-based coregistration methods require a high-quality 3D template image. We created such templates, derived from T1-weighted MRI and blood-flow PET images from 12 nemestrina monkeys. We designed the macaque templates to be maximally compatible with the baboon template images described in a companion paper, to facilitate cross-species comparison of functional imaging data. Here we present data showing the reliability and validity of automatic image registration to the template. Alignment of selected internal fiducial points was accurate to within 1.9 mm overall (mean) even across species. The template images, along with copies aligned to the UCLA nemestrina brain atlas, are available on the Internet (purl.org/net/kbmd/n2k) and can be used as targets with any image registration software.
