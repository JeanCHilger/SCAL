Synthesis and Structures of Solvated Monoclusters and Bridged Di- and Triclusters Based on the Cubic Building Block [Re(6)(&mgr(3)-Se)(8)](2+). The cluster formulated as [Re(6)Se(7)(SeH)I(6)](3)(-) has been previously shown to undergo ligand substitution reactions to generate the family [Re(6)Se(8)(PEt(3))(n)()I(6)(-)(n)()](()(n)()(-)(4)+) (n = 3-6), several members of which form solvate clusters upon treatment with Ag(I) in acetonitrile. Here it is demonstrated that additional de-iodination reactions afford solvate clusters useful in building up bridged cluster arrays. In dichloromethane/solv (5:1 v/v) in the presence of 2 equiv of AgSbF(6) at room temperature, trans-[Re(6)Se(8)(PEt(3))(4)I(2)] forms trans-[Re(6)Se(8)(PEt(3))(4)(solv)(2)](2+) (solv = MeCN (5), DMF (6), Me(2)SO (7)). The hexaiodo cluster with 6 equiv of AgSbF(6) gives the fully solvated clusters [Re(6)Se(8)(solv)(6)](2+) (solv = DMF (9), Me(2)SO (10), py (11)). In refluxing chlorobenzene for 3 days, [Re(6)Se(8)(PEt(3))(5)(MeCN)](2+) (1) and 4,4'-bipyridine (4,4'-bpy) yield [Re(6)Se(8)(PEt(3))(5)(4,4'-bpy)](2+) (12) similarly, cis- and trans-[Re(6)Se(8)(PEt(3))(4)(MeCN)(2)](2+) afford the cis- and trans-14 isomers, respectively, of [Re(6)Se(8)(PEt(3))(4)(4,4'-bpy)(2)](2+). Clusters 1 and 12 (or 1 and 1/2 equiv of 4,4-bpy) under the same conditions afford the bridged dicluster {[Re(6)Se(8)(PEt(3))(5)](2)(4,4'-bpy)}(4+) (15). The related diclusters {[Re(6)Se(8)(PEt(3))(5)](2)(L-L)}(4+) (L-L = 4,4'-py(2)C(2)H(2) (16), 4,4'-py(2)C(2)H(4) (17) (4,4'-py(2)C(2)H(2) = trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene, 4,4'-py(2)C(2)H(4) = trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane)) are obtained by analogous methods. Reaction of 14 and 2 equiv of 1 in refluxing dichloromethane produces the linear tricluster {[Re(18)Se(24)(PEt(3))(14)(4,4'-bpy)(2)}(6+). All clusters were isolated as SbF(6)(-) salts in yields of ca. 60-90% and were characterized by their (1)H and (31)P NMR spectra and by mass spectrometry. In addition, the structures of 10 clusters (5-7, 9-12, 14-16) were confirmed by X-ray structure determinations. All clusters are based on the cubic [Re(6)(&mgr
