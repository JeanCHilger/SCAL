Brain imaging in neurobehavioral disorders. Neuroimaging studies of neurobehavioral disorders are using new imaging modalities. In dyslexia, anatomic imaging studies demonstrate an abnormal symmetry of the planum temporale. Functional imaging supports the hypothesis that developmental dyslexia is frequently the result of deficits in phonologic processing and that normal reading requires a patent network organization of a number of anterior and posterior brain areas. In autism, anatomic imaging studies are conflicting. Functional imaging demonstrates temporal lobe abnormalities and abnormal interaction between frontal and parietal brain areas. In attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, imaging studies suggest an abnormality in the prefrontal and striatal regions. Neuroimaging studies are often contradictory, but trends, especially with functional imaging analysis, are evolving. Because neurobehavioral disorders seem to be a result of a dysfunction in brain circuits, no one region will be abnormal in all patients studied. Further studies with well-defined patient populations and appropriate activation paradigms will better elucidate the pathophysiology of these conditions.
