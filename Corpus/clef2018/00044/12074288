Canine neoplasia in the UK: estimates of incidence rates from a population of insured dogs. Neoplasia is common in pet dogs but accurate figures for the incidence of tumours in this, as in other species, are sparse. The purpose of this study was to document the occurrence of tumours in a defined population of dogs. From a database of 130,684 insured dogs, claims relating to the investigation or treatment of tumours or tumour-like lesions during a 12-month period were accessed and followed up. A total of 2,546 claims were tumour related and were classified according to tumour site and type. Because the demographics of the insured population were skewed towards younger animals, a standard population, as described in the veterinary literature, was used in the calculation of tumour incidence rates. The skin and soft tissues were the most common sites for tumour development, with a standardised incidence rate of 1,437 per 100,000 dogs per year, followed by alimentary (210), mammary (205), urogenital (139), lymphoid (134), endocrine (113) and oropharyngeal (112). Canine cutaneous histiocytoma was the most common single tumour type, with a standardised incidence rate of 337 per 100,000 dogs per year, followed by lipoma (318), adenoma (175), soft tissue sarcoma (142), mast cell tumour (129) and lymphosarcoma (114). These data are unique and provide a valuable basis for future research into the aetiology and epidemiology of canine tumours.
