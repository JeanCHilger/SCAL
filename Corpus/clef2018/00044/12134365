Positron emission tomography for evaluation of colorectal carcinoma. Evaluation of patients with known or suspected recurrent colorectal carcinoma is now an accepted indication for FDG PET imaging. FDG PET does not replace imaging modalities such as CT for preoperative anatomic evaluation but is indicated as the initial test for diagnosis and staging of recurrence and for preoperative staging (N and M) of known recurrence that is considered to be resectable. FDG PET imaging is valuable for differentiation of posttreatment changes from recurrent tumor, differentiation of benign from malignant lesions (indeterminate lymph nodes, hepatic and pulmonary lesions), and evaluation of patients with rising tumor markers in the absence of a known source. Addition of FDG PET to the evaluation of these patients reduces overall treatment costs by accurately identifying patients who will and will not benefit from surgical procedures. Although initial staging at the time of diagnosis is often performed during colectomy, FDG PET imaging is recommended for a subgroup of patients at high risk (with elevated CEA levels) and normal CT and for whom surgery can be avoided if FDG PET shows metastases. Screening for recurrence in patients at high risk has also been advocated. FDG PET imaging seems promising for monitoring therapy, but larger studies are necessary.
