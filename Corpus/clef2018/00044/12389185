Syndrome of attention deficit with hyperactivity as the expression of an organic functional disorder. The diagnosis of ADHD can be determined reliably from the clinical history, but the causes and pathophysiology of the disorder remain unclear.Recent findings using magnetic resonance imaging, and imaging with PET and SPECT, as well as studies that probe brain functioning through transcranial magnetic stimulation suggest that circuits linking prefrontal cortex, striatum, and cerebellum are not functioning normally in ADHD.
