Interaction of colony-stimulating factors and fluorodeoxyglucose f(18) positron emission tomography. To evaluate reports of altered diagnostic images with fluorodeoxyglucose F(18) (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) after treatment with colony-stimulating factors (CSFs).Literature was identified by a MEDLINE search (1966-December 2001). Key search terms included granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, fluorodeoxyglucose, and emission-computed tomography. English language literature was reviewed.Reports have suggested altered FDG PET images following CSF treatment. Studies that assessed the effect of CSF administration on FDG PET imaging of the bone and bone marrow were reviewed.Administration of CSFs may interfere with accurate FDG PET imaging. Separating FDG PET imaging from CSF therapy by >/=5 days may diminish this interference.
