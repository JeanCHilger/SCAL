Brain blood flow in the nitroglycerin (GTN) model of migraine: measurement using positron emission tomography and transcranial Doppler. Nitroglycerin has been widely used as a model of experimental migraine. Studies combining measurement of flow velocity using transcranial Doppler (TCD) concurrently with measures of cerebral blood flow (CBF) are uncommon. We report the results of a study combining TCD and positron emission tomography (PET). Healthy volunteers with no personal or family history of migraine underwent measurement of CBF using H215O PET, and velocity using TCD. Measurements were done at baseline, and following i.v. nitroglycerin at 0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 micro g/kg per min. Subcutaneous sumatriptan (6 mg) was injected, with CBF and velocity measured 15, 30, and 60 min later. Nitroglycerin was terminated and measurements obtained 30 min later. Six male and six female subjects were studied. Nitroglycerin increased global CBF while flow velocities decreased. Sumatriptan did not have a significant effect on these values. Regions of increased flow included the anterior cingulate, while regions of decreased flow included the occipital cortex. Our data suggest that nitroglycerin induces regional changes in CBF that are similar to changes reported in spontaneous migraine, but produces distinctly different effects on global CBF and velocity.
