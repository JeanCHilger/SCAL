99mTc-ECD SPECT CBF-quantification and its clinical significance. To establish a quantitative method of non-blood withdrawn with 99mTc-ECD SPECT for measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF).Combining three compartment models and technology of the best parameters by computer with 99mTc-ECD SPECT to quantitate CBF and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in control group and patient group.The CBFs of the control group (8 cases) and the patient group (16 cases) were (57.16 +/- 4.21) ml.min-1/100 g and (38.80 +/- 8.21) ml.min-1/100 g, respectively. The CBF and rCBF were significantly lower in patient group than those in control group (P < 0.05).The method is simple and more convenient for quantification of CBF in patients with brain disorders, and it may increase the diagnostic sensitivity and the accuracy of focus location. It is suggested that the method is accurate and reliable.
