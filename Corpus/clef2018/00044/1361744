Methods for detecting early signs of AIDS dementia complex in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected subjects. To determine the optimal diagnostic procedures for identifying early signs of AIDS dementia complex (ADC) in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected individuals, in order to prevent further cognitive function impairment by early treatment.Study patients had been referred electively and consecutively to hospital all had been referred for the first time and gave informed consent. Inclusion criteria were (1) lack of history and/or symptoms of psychosis and neurological disordersSubjects were seen at the L. Spallanzani Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Rome, Italy between March 1989 and March 1991.Eighty-two asymptomatic HIV-1-infected subjects: 41 drug users, 27 homosexuals and 14 heterosexuals.All subjects were evaluated using Wechsler-Bellevue I, Benton C form and Bender tests. Thirty-nine subjects underwent single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and 12 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The immunological status of each subject was determined.On psychometric testing, 23 out of the 82 (28%) asymptomatic subjects had a mental decay percentage (MD%) > or = 20%. Cerebral perfusion abnormalities were detected in 31 out of 39 (79.48%) subjects who underwent SPECT MRI abnormalities were observed in seven out of 12 (58%) subjects. Twelve out of 23 subjects with MD% > or = 20, 15 out of 29 subjects with SPECT abnormalities and four out of seven patients with MRI abnormalities had total CD4+ lymphocyte counts > or = 500 x 10(6)/l.The high incidence of abnormal SPECT and of MD% > or = 20 in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients, and the lack of correlation between immunological status and degree of mental decay, SPECT and MRI abnormalities raise many questions about subclinical HIV-1 neurological disease.
