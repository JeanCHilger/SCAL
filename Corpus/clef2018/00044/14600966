The usefulness of CBF brain SPECT in forensic medicine. A description of four cases. The aim of this study was to show the applications of cerebral blood flow SPECT scanning in forensic medicine using four cases: two suspects and two victims of crime.Cerebral blood flow studies were performed with the use of (99m)Tc-ECD and a triple head gammacamera. Qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed, utilising an asymmetry index for unilateral perfusion deficits and a comparison to cerebellar perfusion for assessing the regional cerebral perfusion. For assessing the normal values, a control group of 30 patients was studied.In these cases CBF SPECT scanning proved its usefulness in medico-legal argument and played an important role in formulating the final forensic expert's opinion.Radionuclide cerebral blood flow studies may play a role in forensic medicine, where this method it is mostly under-utilised at present.
