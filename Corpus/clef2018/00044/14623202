The urinary corticoid:creatinine ratio (UCCR) in healthy cats undergoing hospitalisation. Thirty-one healthy pet cats had voided urine samples collected prior to, during and after a brief period of hospitalisation. Urinary corticoids were measured, both prior to and following an extraction technique, and the urinary corticoid:creatinine ratio (UCCR) was calculated. Associations between the UCCR and age, sex, breed and time of urine collection were investigated. There was no significant relationship established between age, sex and breed and the UCCR. A significant increase in the UCCR, however, did occur between the first home collected and first hospitalised urine sample, but only when comparing extracted corticoid results. A normal range for feline UCCR is established for the chemiluminescent immunoassay used in this study.
