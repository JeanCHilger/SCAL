Amphetamine-stimulated dopamine release competes in vivo for [123I]IBZM binding to the D2 receptor in nonhuman primates. We used the reversibly binding D2 dopamine receptor radioligand [123I]IBZM (iodobenzamide) to test whether the endogenous neurotransmitter dopamine competes in vivo for radiotracer binding measured with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In a series of nonhuman primate experiments (n = 27), the effects of temperature, amphetamine, haloperidol, and reserpine on brain uptake of [123I]IBZM were measured. Specific brain uptake of [123I]IBZM reached a peak by 100 min postinjection of radioligand and demonstrated a gradual, apparent "steady-state" washout over the next 2 hr. Brain uptake was temperature dependent, with rates of washout of specifically bound radioligand greater under normothermic conditions (26%/hr: core body temperature 35-37 degrees C) than under conditions of controlled hypothermia (11%/hr 32-34 degrees C). Given the greater retention of radioactivity, low-temperature conditions were used in all other experiments. Administration of haloperidol (0.02 mg/kg IV) during the period of apparent steady state resulted in a dramatic increase in washout (60%/hr
