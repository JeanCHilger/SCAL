Hybrid imaging for endocrine diseases: new perspectives. Hybrid Imaging, also termed dual modality imaging, is the technique of fusionizing and interpreting images, that are gained from two different modalities constructed in one unit. Therefore, hybrid imaging may be regarded as a form of image fusion. Clinical applications in the field of endocrinology are the localization of neuroendocrine tumors and of lesions of the adrenal or the parathyroid glands. Significant diagnostic impact can be gained with this technique influencing the certainty of radiological reports.
