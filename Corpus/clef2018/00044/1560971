Ergometric stress test using Tl-201 myocardial perfusion. Tomographic or planar imaging?. The clinical performance of the planar vs. tomographic ergometric stress 201-Tl myocard perfusion scintigraphy was compared. The results of the investigations of 80 patients were analysed retrospectively. In 59 patients planar, in 21 tomographic imaging was performed. As a consequence of clinical decision making cardiac catheterization was made in all of the patients, within 3 months after the perfusion scintigraphy. The sensitivity of the planar method was 23/27 (85%), the specificity 18/32 (56%), the accuracy 41/59 (69%). The respective values of the SPECT technique were: Sensitivity: 12/12 (100%), specificity 6/9 (66%), accuracy 18/21 (86%). It is concluded, that in comparison to the planar imaging the SPECT technique is superior in the detection of the perfusion abnormalities of the myocard due to significant coronary narrowings.
