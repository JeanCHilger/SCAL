The 17th International IRIST Congress Proceedings. The 17th IRIST (International Research Group on Immunoscitigraphy and Therapy) meeting was held July 27-29, 2004, at the Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium. Cochairs Christophe Van de Wiele and Alberto Signore brought together basic researchers, clinicians, radiopharmacists, and nuclear medicine specialists to discuss progress in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), using radiolabeled antibodies and peptides for imaging biologic properties related to the effectiveness of available treatment options and for treatment of cancer patients. The format of the conference was the presentation of research that focused on the basic and translational biology of cancer and on current state-of-the-art radiopharmacy and related SPECT and PET imaging techniques for the purposes described above. This report summarizes the 17th International IRIST Congress.
