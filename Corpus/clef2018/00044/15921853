Relationship between regional cerebral blood flow and separate symptom clusters of major depression: a single photon emission computed tomography study using statistical parametric mapping. This study examined the relationship between resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) patterns in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and specific symptom clusters derived from ratings on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) and the Mini Mental State Examination. We hypothesized that the functional activity in frontal, parietal, anterior cingulate, basal ganglia and limbic regions would be related to specific symptom domains. Fifteen patients fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for MDD who were off all psychotropic medications for >4 weeks and 15 normal volunteers were recruited. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were obtained after (99m)Tc-ECD injection, and correlations between rCBF patterns and symptom severity ratings were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis, using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Severity of depressive mood was inversely correlated with rCBF in the left amygdala, lentiform nucleus, and parahippocampal gyrus, and directly correlated with rCBF in the right postero-lateral parietal cortex (p < 0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons). Insomnia severity was inversely correlated with rCBF in the right rostral and subgenual anterior cingulate cortices, insula and claustrum. Anxiety severity was directly correlated with rCBF in the right antero-lateral orbitofrontal cortex, while cognitive performance was directly correlated with rCBF in the right postero-medial orbitofrontal cortex and in the left lentiform nucleus. Our findings confirmed the prediction that separate symptom domains of the MDD syndrome are related to specific rCBF patterns, and extend results from prior studies that suggested the involvement of anterior cingulate, frontal, limbic and basal ganglia regions in the pathophysiology of MDD.
