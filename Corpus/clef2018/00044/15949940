Module-assisted synthesis of the bifunctional labelling agent N-succinimidyl 4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB). The three-step radiosynthesis of N-succinimidyl 4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB) was adapted to a remotely controlled synthesis module. After optimization of the reaction conditions, the final [(18)F]SFB was obtained in decay-corrected radiochemical yields of 34-38% (related to [(18)F]fluoride n=12) within a synthesis time of 68 min. The radiochemical purity was in the range of 93-96%.
