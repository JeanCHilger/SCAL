Uses and limitations of positron emission tomography in clinical pharmacokinetics/dynamics (Part II). Positron emission tomography (PET) involves imaging the biodistribution and tissue localisation of small amounts of radiolabelled biomolecules or drugs. In Part I of this article, which appeared in the previous issue of the Journal, the applications of pharmacokinetics in PET were discussed in order to derive quantitative measures of physiological function. Part II examines the use of PET imaging as a tool to study the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of specific drugs.
