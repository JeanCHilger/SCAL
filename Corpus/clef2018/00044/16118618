Gender differences in detecting coronary artery disease with dipyridamole stress myocardial perfusion imaging using 99m-Tc sestamibi gated SPECT. There are some specifics in the presentation of coronary artery disease (CAD) in women compared with men that may cause diagnostic pitfalls. The accuracy of noninvasive diagnostic testing in women tends to be lower than that in men. Stress myocardial perfusion imaging with 99m-Tc sestamibi gated SPECT is an accurate technique for detecting CAD. Only a few studies have compared dipyridamole stress imaging according to gender. The aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic value of dipyridamole myocardial perfusion imaging with 99m-Tc sestamibi gated SPECT in detecting CAD among patients of both sexes. We studied 62 consecutive patients (38 men, 24 women) using 99m-Tc sestamibi gated SPECT and dipyridamole stress to detect CAD. All the patients also underwent coronary angiography. Overall regional sensitivity was significantly lower in women compared with men (71.4% vs. 92.7%, p=0.039). There were no significant differences for detecting CAD in individual coronary arteries, although regional sensitivity in all three vascular territories was higher in men compared to women. The lowest sensitivity in women was found in the LAD territory (66.6%). Overall regional specificity in men and women was similar and did not reach statistical significance (88.7% vs. 94.7%). Significantly lower specificity in men was found only in the RCA territory (79.1%), compared with that in women (100%). Our results confirmed that there are certain gender differences in the diagnostic performance of dipyridamole stress myocardial perfusion imaging with 99-Tc sestamibi gated SPECT which are assigned to the characteristics of the female population. However, the diagnostic accuracy is also quite high in women, which makes this technique efficient enough in detecting CAD among this population.
