Surface modification of poly(ethylene terephthalate) via hydrolysis and layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and chondroitin sulfate to construct cytocompatible layer for human endothelial cells. Surface modification of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film was performed by surface hydrolysis and layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly followed a mechanism of electrostatic adsorption of oppositely charged polymers, exemplified with chitosan and chondroitin sulfate (CS). Hydrolysis of PET in concentrated alkaline solution produced a carboxyl-enriched surface. The changes of weight loss and surface chemistry, morphology and wettability were monitored and verified by UV-vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and water contact angle. Assembly of positively charged chitosan and negatively charged CS was then conducted in a LBL manner to create multilayers on the hydrolyzed PET film. The process of layer growth and oscillation of surface wettability were monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy and water contact angle measurement, respectively. In vitro cell culture revealed that the adherence of endothelial cells was significantly enhanced on the biomacromolecules-modified PET film with preserved endothelial cell function, in particular on those assembled with larger number of chitosan/CS layers. However, with regard to cell proliferation and viability properties after cultured for 4 days, minor difference was determined between the modified and the unmodified PET films.
