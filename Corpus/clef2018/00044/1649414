Quantitative in vivo analysis of benzodiazepine binding sites in the human brain using positron emission tomography. Central-type benzodiazepine binding sites were characterized in a single normal human subject, using positron emission tomography (PET) and the radiolabelled benzodiazepine antagonist, carbon-11 labelled flumazenil ([11C] Ro 15-1788). The subject was scanned using tracer alone and tracer plus 4 different concentrations of unlabelled Ro 15-1788, including one concentration of unlabelled Ro 15-1788, chosen to produce maximum displacement of [11C] Ro 15-1788 from specific binding sites. Concentrations of free, unmetabolized [11C] Ro 15-1788 in plasma were estimated using a simple extraction and ultrafiltration method. Radioactivity in the regional exchangeable pool in brain was estimated under non-saturation conditions from the ratio of radioactivity in brain to plasma, under saturation conditions and the kinetics of free ligand in plasma. The specific binding was, then, estimated by the difference between the total radioactivity in brain and exchangeable pool radioactivity. Scatchard analyses were performed to yield Bmax and Kd values under pseudo-equilibrium conditions, which was observed as an increase of specific binding/free with reduction in specific binding. In cerebral cortex and cerebellum, the Bmax values were about 62-73 nmol/l and the Kd values were 3.6-6 nM in the estimation of free ligand in plasma and 12-15 nM in the estimation of exchangeable pool in brain, as free in brain.
