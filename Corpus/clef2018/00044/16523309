Prediction of functional recovery after revascularization in patients with chronic ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction: head-to-head comparison between 99mTc-sestamibi/18F-FDG DISA SPECT and 13N-ammonia/ 18F-FDG PET. (18)F-FDG PET is an important modality for myocardial viability assessment in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Dual-isotope simultaneous acquisition (DISA) SPECT may be an alternative to PET. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of PET and DISA SPECT for the prediction of improvement in regional and global LV function as well as LV reverse remodelling after revascularization.Patients (n=47) with chronic coronary artery disease and LV dysfunction underwent DISA SPECT (with (99m)Tc-sestamibi and (18)F-FDG) and PET (with (13)N-ammonia and (18)F-FDG) on the same day to assess viability. All patients underwent revascularization and recovery of function was derived from serial magnetic resonance imaging studies.Of 264 revascularized, dysfunctional segments, 143 (54%) improved in function. For prediction of improvement in regional LV function, PET and DISA SPECT had similar sensitivity (90% versus 89%, NS) and specificity (86% versus 86%, NS). For prediction of improvement in global LV function, sensitivity was 83% for DISA SPECT and 86% for PET (p=NS), whereas both modalities had a specificity of 100%. Finally, sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of LV reverse remodelling were also similar for DISA SPECT and PET.In patients undergoing revascularization, DISA SPECT and PET predict the improvement in regional and global LV function and LV remodelling equally well post revascularization.
