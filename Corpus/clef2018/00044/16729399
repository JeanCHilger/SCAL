Lack of benefit for routine functional testing early after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: results from the ROSETTA-CABG Registry. There is little consensus regarding the use of functional testing after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Some physicians opt for a routine functional testing strategy, while others employ a symptom-driven strategy.To examine the effects of routine post-CABG functional testing on the use of follow-up cardiac procedures and clinical events.The Routine versus Selective Exercise Treadmill Testing after Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery (ROSETTA-CABG) Registry is a prospective, multicenter cohort study examining the use of functional testing after CABG among 408 patients. The frequencies of functional testing, cardiac procedures, and clinical events were examined during the first 12 months following a successful CABG.Patients were predominantly male (80%) with a mean age of 63 +/- 10 years. During the 12-month follow up, 111 patients were observed to undergo a routine functional testing strategy, while 284 patients underwent a selective strategy. Patients undergoing routine functional testing underwent fewer follow-up cardiac catheterizations, but similar numbers of revascularization procedures (cardiac catheterizations = 0.9% vs. 8.1% p = 0.027Because routine functional testing 1 year after CABG is associated with extremely low event rates, this strategy does not appear to be warranted.
