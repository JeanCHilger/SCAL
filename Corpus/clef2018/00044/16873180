Reduced Global Cerebral Blood Flow in Non-Demented HIV Positive Patients. Twelve non-demented HIV positive men with different degrees of immunodeficiency were examined with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Reduction in relative global cerebral blood flow was found in HIV positive patients compared to healthy HIV negative controls (p = 0.014). In the patients there was also a change in cerebral flow distribution, with lower global flow compared to central flow (p = 0.01), most pronounced in patients with early disease. In the patients with advanced HIV disease the relative cerebral blood flow was lower than in the controls in 108 of 116 (93%) regions investigated.
