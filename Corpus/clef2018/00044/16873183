MR and TL-210 spect imaging with pathologic correlation for the assessment of CNS lymphoma vs. toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients. Analyze the value of TL-201 (Tl) brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), to differentiate CNS lymphoma from toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients.Twenty-four AIDS patients with MR enhancing lesion(s), underwent a brain Tl SPECT. Final diagnosis was established by pathology and clinical/MR follow-up.Nine patients had CNS tumor, 9 toxoplasmosis and 6 other non-tumorous lesions. The sensitivity of T1 to diagnose CNS tumor was 77% and the specificity 93%. Two false negative studies correspond to tumors with significant necrosis.T1 proved useful for differentiating brain neoplasm from toxoplasmosis. Tumors with significant necrosis, did not show the expected increase in T1 uptake. Determination of T1 uptake ratios help detect tumor with faint tracer uptake.
