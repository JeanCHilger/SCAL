Value of fusing PET plus CT images in hepatocellular carcinoma and combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma patients with extrahepatic metastases: preliminary findings. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (PET) and PET plus computed tomography (CT) fusion images for the detection of extrahepatic metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma (combined HCC/CC).Twenty-one patients with HCC and combined HCC/CC were enrolled in the study from December 2004 to February 2005. In all patients, PET and CT of the chest to pelvis region were performed. The sensitivity of PET plus CT fusion images was compared with the sensitivity of PET, CT, and bone scintigraphy.In 14 patients, a total of 58 extrahepatic metastases were diagnosed. The detection rate of PET plus CT fusion images, PET, CT, and bone scintigraphy was 98.2% (57 of 58 metastases), 89.6% (52 of 58 metastases), 91.2% (52 of 57 metastases), and 68.7% (11 of 16 bone metastases), respectively. No extrahepatic metastases were detected in the other seven patients. The detection rate of PET was 10/18 (55.6%) for intrahepatic lesions of HCC and combined HCC/CC.The fusion of PET plus CT images is useful in detecting extrahepatic metastases in HCC and combined HCC/CC patients.
