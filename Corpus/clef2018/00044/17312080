Brain abnormalities detected on whole-body 18F-FDG PET in cancer patients: spectrum of findings. The purpose of this article is to discuss and show examples of the PET appearance of common brain abnormalities that radiologists encounter when interpreting whole-body 18F-FDG PET examinations of cancer patients.Knowledge of the PET appearance of various brain abnormalities can yield diagnostically relevant information in cancer patients. Detection of brain abnormalities on whole-body PET often requires adjusting window settings to reduce the intensity of normal brain FDG activity. Often, close correlation of PET/CT and MRI with clinical history offers the most complete radiologic diagnosis.
