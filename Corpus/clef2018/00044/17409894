Short-term restaging of patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving chemotherapy. To determine whether computed tomography (CT) performed within a month of receiving chemotherapy is useful in assessing response among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Consecutive patients receiving chemotherapy for NSCLC who underwent short-term CT restaging between April 2001 and June 2005 were included in the study. Serial CT scans were performed within 31 days (mean, 24 days range, 9-31 days) after receiving chemotherapy for all patients. Tumors were measured in consensus by two diagnostic radiologists. Tumor response was assessed using uni-dimensional tumor measurements according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria.There were 57 patients in the study (30 men, 27 women mean age, 63 yearsEarly restaging CT is useful in evaluating therapeutic response among patients with NSCLC and may allow the institution of more appropriate therapy.
