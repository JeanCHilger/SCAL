Hybrid SPECT-CT: integration of CT coronary artery calcium scoring and angiography with myocardial perfusion. A natural extension of current imaging paradigms for diagnosing coronary artery disease may well be the integration of CT with myocardial perfusion single-photon CT (SPECT). Although there is a wealth of clinical information regarding the utility of SPECT, the value of CT in the cardiology arena has only recently been explored. CT has the advantage of detecting coronary atherosclerosis at its earliest stages, allowing initiation of appropriate therapeutic measures well before development of obstructive coronary artery disease. However, SPECT can clarify the anatomic findings of CT based on a functional assessment of myocardial blood flow, thereby guiding management decisions. Hybrid imaging with SPECT and CT angiography may prove important from a diagnostic and therapeutic view point in several clinical scenarios, and it is likely that over the next decade fusion imaging may more precisely tailor therapy, reduce healthcare costs, and improve patient outcome.
