Imaging of matrix metalloproteinase activation and left ventricular remodeling. Although left ventricular (LV) remodeling may be adaptive in early phases of cardiac injury, continued remodeling is a pathologic process that is associated with poor prognosis and diminished cardiac function. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteolytic enzymes involved in the degradation of myocardial extracellular proteins and have been implicated in adverse cardiac remodeling. There is a growing body of literature that supports the role of specific MMPs in cardiac remodeling in both animal models and clinical studies. Conventional imaging of physiologic indices, such as perfusion and function, have been used to monitor LV remodeling. Recently, the potential advantage of targeted imaging of MMPs has been demonstrated, particularly if this is linked with physiologic imaging.
