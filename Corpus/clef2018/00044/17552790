Ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer from dimethylaniline to coumarin dyes in sodium dodecyl sulfate and triton X-100 micelles. The primary steps of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA) to five coumarin dyes are studied in an anionic micelle [sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)] and a neutral micelle [triton X-100 (TX-100)] using femtosecond upconversion. The rate of PET in micelle is found to be highly nonexponential. In both the micelles, PET displays components much faster (approximately 10 ps) than the slow components (180-2900 ps) of solvation dynamics. The ultrafast components of electron transfer exhibit a bell-shaped dependence on the free energy change. This is similar to Marcus inversion. The rates of PET in TX-100 and SDS micelle are, in general, faster than those in cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) micelle. In the SDS and TX-100 micelle, the Marcus inversion occurs at -DeltaG0 approximately 0.7 eV which is lower than that (approximately 1.2 eV) in CTAB micelle. Possible causes of variation of PET in different micelles are discussed.
