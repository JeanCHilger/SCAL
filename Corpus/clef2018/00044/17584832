Hyperventilation-induced hypocapnic alkalosis slows the adaptation of pulmonary O2 uptake during the transition to moderate-intensity exercise. The effect of voluntary hyperventilation-induced hypocapnic alkalosis (RALK) on pulmonary O2 uptake (VO2) kinetics and muscle deoxygenation was examined in young male adults (n=8) during moderate-intensity exercise. Subjects performed five repetitions of a step-transition in work rate from 20 W cycling to a work rate corresponding to 90% of the estimated lactate threshold during control (CON PET,CO2, approximately 40 mmHg) and during hyperventilation (RALK
