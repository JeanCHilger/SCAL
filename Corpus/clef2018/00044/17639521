Conversion of perhydropolysilazane into a SiOx network triggered by vacuum ultraviolet irradiation: access to flexible, transparent barrier coatings. The photochemical conversion of 200-500 nm layers of perhydropolysilazane --(SiH2-NH)n-- (PHPS) in the presence of oxygen into an SiOx network was studied. Different UV sources in the wavelength range of 160-240 nm, that is, 172 nm Xe2* and 222 nm KrCl* excimer, and 185 nm Hg low-pressure (HgLP) lamps were used for these purposes. The role of both ozone and O(1D) as well as of catalytic amounts of tertiary amines in the degradation process of PHPS and the formation of SiOx were studied. In this context, the kinetics of the entire reaction were elucidated and allowed both a continuous and discontinuous process to be established for the production of fully transparent, flexible barrier coatings. Barrier improvement factors (BIFs) of 400 were achieved with one single layer on 23 microm poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET), which translated into oxygen transmission rates (OTRs) of 0.20 cm3 m(-2) day(-1) bar(-1). Double layers prepared by this technique allowed the realization of OTRs of <or=0.1 cm3 m(-2) day(-1) bar(-1), corresponding to BIFs of >or=800.
