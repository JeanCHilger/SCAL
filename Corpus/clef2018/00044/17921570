First in-beam PET measurement of beta+ radioactivity induced by hard photon beams. In this note, we present the first experimental results of in-beam PET measurements during high energy photon phantom irradiation. An inhomogeneous phantom was irradiated with pulsed 34 MV bremsstrahlung. The measurements have been conducted with a dedicated double head positron camera. A high material contrast could be achieved and furthermore production rates of (11)C and (15)O were derived from the time-dependent activity.
