Statistical image reconstruction from correlated data with applications to PET. Most statistical reconstruction methods for emission tomography are designed for data modeled as conditionally independent Poisson variates. In reality, due to scanner detectors, electronics and data processing, correlations are introduced into the data resulting in dependent variates. In general, these correlations are ignored because they are difficult to measure and lead to computationally challenging statistical reconstruction algorithms. This work addresses the second concern, seeking to simplify the reconstruction of correlated data and provide a more precise image estimate than the conventional independent methods. In general, correlated variates have a large non-diagonal covariance matrix that is computationally challenging to use as a weighting term in a reconstruction algorithm. This work proposes two methods to simplify the use of a non-diagonal covariance matrix as the weighting term by (a) limiting the number of dimensions in which the correlations are modeled and (b) adopting flexible, yet computationally tractable, models for correlation structure. We apply and test these methods with simple simulated PET data and data processed with the Fourier rebinning algorithm which include the one-dimensional correlations in the axial direction and the two-dimensional correlations in the transaxial directions. The methods are incorporated into a penalized weighted least-squares 2D reconstruction and compared with a conventional maximum a posteriori approach.
