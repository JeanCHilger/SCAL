Standardized uptake value in para-aortic lymph nodes is a significant prognostic factor in patients with primary advanced squamous cervical cancer. We sought to identify prognostic factors-including positron emission tomography (PET) parameters-in patients with previously untreated squamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix and MRI- or CT-defined pelvic or para-aortic lymph node (PLN or PALN) metastasis.Patients with untreated squamous cell cervical cancer and PLN or PALN metastasis detected by CT/MRI were enrolled. FDG-PET scans were performed for primary staging. Prognostic variables were investigated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Five-year recurrence-free and 5-year overall survivals (RFS and OS) were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method.A total of 70 patients [54 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I or II, and 16 patients with stage III or IV] were eligible. Follow-up ranged from 26.1 to 71.6 months. In multivariate analysis, FIGO stage > or =III (5-year RFS, p = 0.008 5-year OS, p = 0.008) was a significant prognostic factor for both RFS and OS. In addition, SUV(max) for PALN (dichotomized by 3.3) was significantly associated with OS (p = 0.012) and marginally with RFS (p = 0.078). The presence of SUV(max) > or = 3.3 at PALN or FIGO stage > or =III were significantly associated with both recurrence [5-year RFSSUV(max) > or = 3.3 for PALN and FIGO stage > or =III were significant adverse factors in patients with primary squamous cervical carcinoma and PLN or PALN metastasis detected by CT/MRI.
