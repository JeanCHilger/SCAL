Mobile PET in the UK: legislative, regulatory and cost-effectiveness considerations. Mobile PET/CT or mobile stand alone PET, is becoming more widely available throughout the developed world, allowing many small and medium-sized hospitals that do not have the scale or financial resources to purchase the static diagnostic equipment, to benefit from this imaging technology. Before embarking on such a service, a number of legislative, logistical and administrative issues have to be addressed to ensure that a mobile PET/CT service is run with optimal efficiency and safety and in compliance with the regulations governing the use of radioactive substances. Some of these issues are similar to those encountered in operating a mobile magnetic resonance imaging scanner but there are important differences owing to the use of both sealed and open radioactive sources. This article highlights the legislative, administrative and practical issues relevant to the UK and also discusses some of the practical issues that need to be addressed to ensure the operation of a safe and effective PET service.
