Comparison between 180 degrees and 360 degrees acquisition arcs with and without correction by CT-based attenuation maps in normal hearts at rest. To investigate the effect of acquisition arc (180 degrees or 360 degrees ) and attenuation correction (AC), in artifact occurrence and image uniformity of myocardial perfusion SPECT studies in normal hearts.Twenty male and 44 female patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and low probability of resting perfusion abnormalities were analysed. Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion studies were performed at rest with a hybrid SPECT/CT system. An anthropomorphic phantom was also imaged.Without AC, a 360 degrees orbit resulted in significantly lower artifact rates compared to the standard 180 degrees in both gender groups. Differences persisted (P<0.001) even after adjusting reconstruction filter settings to compensate for disproportionate count statistics between the two arcs. However, gender-related variation was not considerably decreased and sub-diaphragmatic activity was augmented with a 360 degrees arc. After AC with either arc, substantially lower defect scores and minimal gender-related differences were obtained compared to the standard technique. A 360 degrees arc yielded lower defect rates and count variability than did the 180 degrees arc (P<0.05). These differences were small and were eliminated after weighting for dissimilar count statistics. Sub-diaphragmatic signal was amplified, particularly with 360 degrees  severe bowel-myocardial activity overlap complicated image interpretation in 14% of cases with 360 degrees versus 8% with 180 degrees . In certain aspects, phantom imaging findings diverged from patient studies.Without AC there is significant disparity between 180 degrees and 360 degrees concerning artifact occurrence. After CT-based AC differences between arcs in defect rate and image uniformity seem less critical. However, 180 degrees is favoured by less intensification of intestinal activity.
