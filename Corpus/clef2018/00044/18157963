Anatomic correlates of a normal perfusion scan using 64-slice computed tomographic coronary angiography. Both myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and multislice computed tomography (MSCT) are currently used to detect coronary artery disease (CAD). However, MSCT permits early detection of atherosclerosis while myocardial perfusion is still normal. In addition, MPI results can be normal despite the presence of high-risk CAD (left main and balanced 3-vessel CAD). In this study, the range of anatomic findings using MSCT in patients with normal MPI results was evaluated. In 180 patients presenting with chest pain, MPI (with gated single-photon emission computed tomography) and 64-slice MSCT were performed. In patients with normal MPI results, prevalences of completely normal coronary arteries, nonobstructive CAD, and obstructive CAD were determined using MSCT. The occurrence of high-risk CAD, including left main and 3-vessel disease, was also evaluated. Normal MPI and adequate MSCT findings were obtained in 97 patients (54% 50% women
