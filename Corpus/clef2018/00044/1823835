Results of [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine treatment in metastatic malignant phaeochromocytoma. The results obtained with [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) treatment in 6 patients affected by metastatic phaeochromocytoma are reported. Single doses of 3.7-7.4 GBq were given, in 1-6 courses, up to cumulative doses of 5.4-37.8 GBq. Objective responses were observed in 5 patients (2 tumour shrinkages, even if small 5 lowering of blood pressure), which were only temporary in 3 patients and stable in 2. Complete disappearance of pain was obtained in 2/2 patients. No adverse side-effects were observed. The problem of treatment strategy in situations of stable disease deserves further study.
