Potential sources of diagnostic pitfall and variants in FDG-PET/CT. Oncological FDG PET show variants and findings that may lead to a diagnostic error and that may be clarified by the morfofunctional imaging from PET/CT. In this article we show the experience acquired since a Siemens PET/CT Biograph LSO Pico3D was applied in our centre. We describe some representative examples of FDG distribution patterns which may lead to erroneous interpretations of the clinical studies when they refer to specific clinical situations. The examples included are classified into two main groups according to the cause: Technical and biological, and the latter into physiological and non-physiological (pathophysiological). Patterns are described within the biological group showing changes of the FDG biodistribution that may reduce the uptake in tumoural lesions, the physiological variants that may be interpreted as pathology, the effects of previous treatment and uptakes related to benign diseases.We consider that knowledge of these variants and findings to be crucial in order to obtain optimal performance of PET/CT and to overcome the PET limitations.
