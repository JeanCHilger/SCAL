Polymerase chain reaction detection of Salmonella spp. in fecal samples of pet birds. The aims of this study were 1) to determine the prevalence of Salmonella in clinically ill birds in aviaries in Ankara, Turkey, and 2) to compare conventional culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of Salmonella in feces from clinically ill pet birds. In the study, 185 fecal samples (feces and/or swabs) collected from the pet birds kept in the seven different aviaries in the city of Ankara were investigated for the existence of Salmonella spp. by bacterial isolation and PCR. The conventional isolation and identification methods were performed for Salmonella isolation from fecal cultures. Suspected colonies were confirmed with the Salmonella polyvalent O antiserum and serogrouped with Salmonella group-specific antiserum. PCR was performed after the fecal swabs were incubated for 18 hr in 10 ml of tetrathionate broth. Three (1.63%) out of 185 fecal samples were found to harbor Salmonella spp. by conventional identification tests and were found to belong to serogroup B. Five (2.7%) swab samples were found to harbor Salmonella DNA by PCR tests. As a conclusion, PCR following incubation of clinical samples in pre-enrichment broth seemed to be a fast and practicable method for Salmonella spp. diagnosis when compared to protracted labor-intensive conventional culture techniques.
