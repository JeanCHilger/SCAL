Fluorine-18-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography imaging with magnetic resonance and computed tomographic correlation in the evaluation of bone and soft-tissue sarcomas: a pictorial essay. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has a growing role as an imaging modality to be used in conjunction with magnetic resonance and computed tomographic imaging in the detection, staging, and management of many sarcomas and carcinomas. Since PET is a relatively new modality and the incidence of sarcomas is low, it has not yet been approved for use in all bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. The purpose of this article is to pictorially evaluate soft-tissue and bone sarcomas, including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, synovial sarcoma, osteosarcoma, liposarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosarcoma, and myxofibrosarcoma. This pictorial essay illustrates and describes these tumors in various stages of disease progression vis-Ã -vis fluorine-18-deoxyglucose-PET imaging with computed tomographic and magnetic resonance correlation. Various stages of disease progression will be discussed including initial diagnosis, treatment response, and metastatic involvement.
