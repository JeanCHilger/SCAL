Usefulness of 201TlCl/ 123I-BMIPP dual-myocardial SPECT for patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Earlier studies suggested that elevated cardiac troponin T (cTnT) might be useful for detecting less severe types of myocardial injury (i.e., non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction). The objective of this study is to elucidate the usefulness of (201)thallous chloride ((201)TlCl) and (123)I-betamethyl-p-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid ((123)I-BMIPP) dual-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging for patients with myocardial infarction (MI) without ST segment elevation.Consecutive 86 patients (56 men and 30 women mean age 66 +/- 12 years) clinically diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were divided into two groups according to serum creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) and cTnT levels. Group A consisted of 53 patients with increased serum CK-MB and cTnT levels, and Group B, 33 patients with increased serum cTnT without increased serum CK-MB. All patients underwent (201)TlCl and (123)I-BMIPP dual-SPECT about 8 days following the onset. The left ventricular myocardium was divided into 20 segments on each SPECT image, and tracer accumulation in those segments was scored on a five-point scoring system. The total defect scores (TDS) were calculated by summing the scores for all 20 segments, and compared between groups A and B. Group B patients were subdivided into two groups according to the TDS on (123)I-BMIPP images as groups B(S) (severeThe TDS of group A derived from (201)TlCl and (123)I-BMIPP images was significantly higher than those of group B (14.5 +/- 10.8 vs. 1.5 +/- 2.4 and 20.8 +/- 13.3 vs. 9.1 +/- 6.2, respectively P < 0.0001). The sensitivities of (201)TlCl and (123)I-BMIPP images were 94.3% (50/53) and 96.2% (51/53) to detect the culprit coronary lesions in group A (no significant difference). In contrast, the sensitivity of (123)I-BMIPP images (72.7%, 24/33) was higher than that of (201)TlCl images (27.3%, 9/33) in group B (P < 0.05). At 2 years of follow-up, the incidence of hard cardiac events in groups A, B(S), and B(M) was 24.5%, 27.8%, and 6.7%, respectively. The rate of group BS, as well as that of group A, was significantly higher than that of group B(M) (P < 0.05).Of those with a clinical diagnosis of AMI accompanied by increased cTnT, the CK-MB negative patients accounted for 38% (33/86) of all patients as having non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction such as NTMI. For such patients, (123)I-BMIPP imaging is useful not only for the detection of the culprit lesions but also for the prediction of the prognosis.
