Detection of metastatic lesions from malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging: comparison with 18F-FDG positron emission tomography and 123I-MIBG scintigraphy. To investigate the diagnostic features of whole-body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) as compared with 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and (123)I-meta-iodo-benzyl guanidine scintigraphy (MIBG) on metastatic lesions of patients with malignant pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.We prospectively studied 11 patients with histologically confirmed pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma and possible metastatic lesions. FDG-PET, MIBG, and DWI examinations were performed within 1 week, and the images were visually interpreted. Abnormal positive uptake either on MIBG or on FDG-PET was considered as metastases. Abnormal high signal intensities on DWI were considered as metastases using conventional T1-and T2-weighted images as reference.FDG-PET and DWI demonstrated metastatic lesions in all 11 patients, but MIBG showed no metastatic lesions in two patients. The numbers of lymph node metastases depicted on FDG-PET, MIBG, and DWI were 19, 6, and 39 bone metastases were 50, 49, and 60DWI may be particularly advantageous in depicting lymph node and liver metastases and may have a higher rate of detecting metastatic lesions when compared with MIBG or FDG-PET. The limitations of DWI were possible false-positive finding, and probable lower detectability of mediastinal lymph node and lung metastasis.
