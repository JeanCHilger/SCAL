Molecular imaging: reporter gene imaging. Non-invasive in-vivo molecular genetic imaging developed over the past decade and predominantly utilises radiotracer (PET, gamma camera, autoradiography), magnetic resonance and optical imaging technology. Molecular genetic imaging has its roots in both molecular biology and cell biology. The convergence of these disciplines and imaging modalities has provided the opportunity to address new research questions, including oncogenesis, tumour maintenance and progression, as well as responses to molecular-targeted therapy. Three different imaging strategies are described: (1) "bio-marker" or "surrogate" imaging (2) "direct" imaging of specific molecules and pathway activity
