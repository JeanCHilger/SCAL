A review of diagnostic imaging in melanoma. The incidence of melanoma continues to rise, and is responsible for 50% of deaths related to skin cancer. Imaging plays a vital role in the diagnosis, assessment, treatment and follow-up of patients. Costs have risen dramatically over the last few years, largely due to increased use of newer technologies. This article examines the evidence for the use of radiological imaging in melanoma, in particular, ultrasound, computerised tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), positron emission tomography (PET) and combined CT/PET. Recommendations are made on the basis of comparison of costs of imaging methods.
