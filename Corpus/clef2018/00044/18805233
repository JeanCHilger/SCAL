Contemporary imaging of the temporomandibular joint. This article discusses imaging techniques for visualization of the temporomandibular joint. Conventional plain film modalities are discussed briefly, with an emphasis on the more contemporary modalities, such as CT with cone-beam technology, MRI, and nuclear imaging, including single-photon emission computed tomography, and positron emission tomography. Indications, advantages, and limitations are discussed. As advancements in this area continue, our understanding of this complex joint and its pathology will follow, which will lead to more defined imaging indications and ultimately, to improved treatment outcomes.
