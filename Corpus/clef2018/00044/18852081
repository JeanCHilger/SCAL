PET/CT imaging in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is a common malignancy that afflicts many in the western world. Imaging studies are frequently used to evaluate patients in the screening, staging and surveillance of colorectal cancer. Cross sectional imaging studies such as ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging provide anatomic and morphologic information about tumor and patterns of spread. Positron emission tomography (PET) differs in that it provides information about tumor metabolism.[(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose PET has been clinically used for the evaluation of patients with a wide variety of cancers since most malignancies, including colorectal cancer, typically show increased glucose metabolism. This review present the positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging findings that may be encountered in the diagnosis, staging and follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer.
