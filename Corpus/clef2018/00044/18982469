Optimal scan time of oxygen-15-labeled gas inhalation autoradiographic method for measurement of cerebral oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral oxygen metabolic rate. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume, oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) can be estimated from C15O, H(2)15O, and 15O2 tracers and positron emission tomography (PET) using an autoradiographic (ARG) method. Our objective in this study was to optimize the scan time for 15O2 gas study for accurate estimation of OEF and CMRO2.We evaluated statistical noise in OEF by varying the scan time and error caused by the tissue heterogeneity in estimated OEF and CMRO2 using computer simulations. The characteristics of statistical noise were investigated by signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio from repeated tissue time activity curves with noise, which were generated using measured averaged arterial input function and assuming CBF=20, 50, and 80 (ml/100 g per minute). Error caused by tissue heterogeneity was also investigated by estimated OEF and CMRO2 from tissue time activity curve with mixture of gray and white matter varying fraction of mixture. In the simulations, three conditions were assumed (i) CBF in gray and white matter (CBFg and CBFw) was 80 and 20, OEF in gray and white matter (Eg and Ew) was 0.4 and 0.3, (ii) CBFg and CBFw decreased by 50%, and Eg and Ew increased by 50% when compared with conditions (i) and (iii). CBFg and CBFw decreased by 80%, and Eg and Ew increased by 50% when compared with condition (i).The longer scan time produced the better S/N ratio of estimated OEF value from three CBF values (20, 50, and 80). Errors of estimated OEF for three conditions owing to tissue heterogeneity decreased, as scan time took longer. Meanwhile in the case of CMRO2, 3 min of scan time was desirable.The optimal scan time of 15O2 inhalation study with the ARG method was concluded to be 3 min from taking into account for maintaining the S/N ratio and the quantification of accurate OEF and CMRO2.
