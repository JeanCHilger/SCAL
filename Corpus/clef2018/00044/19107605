Gene cloning, expression, and characterization of the Geobacillus Thermoleovorans CCR11 thermoalkaliphilic lipase. The gene for a Geobacillus thermoleovorans CCR11 thermostable lipase was recovered by PCR and cloned. Four genetic constructions were designed and successfully expressed in E. coli: (i) the lipase structural gene (lipCCR11) in the PinPoint Xa vector (ii) the lipase structural gene (lipACCR11) in the pET-28a(+) vector
