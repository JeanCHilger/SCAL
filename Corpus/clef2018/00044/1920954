The functional relationship between the cerebral cortex and deep brain areas in normal individuals. Recent PET or SPECT studies have demonstrated a reduction of blood flow and metabolism in the cortex ipsilateral to a deep-seated lesion, and in the thalamus and/or basal ganglia ipsilateral to a cortical lesion. A close relationship between the cerebral cortex and deep areas of the brain has been shown in pathological conditions, presumably because of functional interconnections between the cortex and deeper area. The present study was designed to investigate the relationship of cerebral blood flow in the cerebral cortex to that in the deep gray matter including the basal ganglia and the thalamus in normal subjects. Twenty-two healthy subjects were studied using SPECT with N-isopropyl-p[123I]iodoamphetamine while in a resting state. The asymmetry index (AI) of blood flow in both the cerebral cortex and deep gray matter was calculated as follows AI = (R-L)/(R+L)/200 (%) (R: right side, L: left side). The AI in deep gray matter was significantly correlated with the AI values in the upper frontal cortex (r = 0.54, p less than 0.01), and parietal cortex (r = 0.58, p less than 0.01), as well as the mean cortical hemispheric AI (r = 0.48, p less than 0.05). Our results suggest the existence of a functional relationship between the cerebral cortex and deep areas not only in pathological conditions but also in the resting state in normal subjects. This functional relationship is likely to be mediated by neuronal mechanisms through the projectional fiber connections between the cortex and the deep gray matter.
