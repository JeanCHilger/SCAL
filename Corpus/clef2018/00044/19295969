Myocardial perfusion after one year of spinal cord stimulation in patients with refractory angina. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is recommended for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and refractory angina. We used positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the long-term effect of SCS on regional myocardial perfusion in patients suffering from angina pectoris refractory to medical treatment and without option for coronary intervention.We analyzed data of 44 patients with stable CAD (91% three vessel disease). At baseline, we determined coronary flow reserve (CFR) using 13N-ammonia-PET and myocardial viability with 18F-FDG. SCS was performed for one year (Medtronic Itrell III or Synergy, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany). During follow-up, no cardiac interventions were necessary and no myocardial infarctions occurred. At one year follow-up, CFR was measured again.In the majority of patients (77%), SCS led to an improvement of clinical symptoms. CFR did not change significantly during follow-up. Subjective improvement did not correlate with an increase of CFR.Despite its clinical effect, SCS does not have a direct impact on CFR in patients with stable CAD. According to our results, the pain relief is not due to an improvement of the myocardial blood supply.
