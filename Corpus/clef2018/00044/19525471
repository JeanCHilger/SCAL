Diabetic foot infection: usefulness of SPECT/CT for 99mTc-HMPAO-labeled leukocyte imaging. Our aim was to evaluate the role of SPECT/CT for the diagnosis of diabetic foot infection by labeled leukocytes.Seventeen patients with 19 clinically suspected sites of infection were included. After leukocyte labeling and administration, planar scans were acquired at 30 min, 4 h, and 24 h for 18 consecutive patients. SPECT/CT was obtained at 6 h. The final diagnosis was established by clinical follow-up (24 mo) in all cases and by bone biopsy for 14 sites.Leukocyte scanning was positive in 16 of 19 lesions and negative in 3. SPECT/CT changed the interpretation of the planar and SPECT images for 10 of 19 suspected sites (52.6%): it excluded osteomyelitis in 6 cases, revealed bone infection in 1 case, and revealed both bone and soft-tissue infection in 3 cases. The hybrid device did not significantly contribute to the evaluation of patients with negative scan results.SPECT/CT can be useful for a more accurate diagnosis of diabetic foot infection by labeled leukocyte imaging.
