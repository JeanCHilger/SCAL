(18)F]-labeled 2-methoxyphenylpiperazine derivative as a potential brain positron emission tomography imaging agen. This study reports the synthesis and characterization of N-(3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)propyl-4-[(18)F]fluorobenzamide ([(18)F]MPP3F). The total reaction time for [(18)F]MPP3F, including final high-performance liquid chromatography purification, was about 3h. Typical decay-corrected radiochemical yield was 18.4+/-3.1%. The radiochemical purity was >98%. Biodistribution in mice showed that [(18)F]MPP3F is a potential brain imaging agent for positron emission tomography. The brain uptake of [(18)F]MPP3F was 6.59+/-0.77% Injected Dose/g at 2 min post-injection time. A brain-to-blood ratio of 3.67 was reached at 15 min after injection.
