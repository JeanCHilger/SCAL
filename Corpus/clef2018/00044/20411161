The radioiodine turnover rate as a determinant of radioiodine treatment outcome in Graves' disease. For individual iodine-131 ((131)I) treatment dosage calculations, most physicians use the 'standard dosage formula', which requires measurements of thyroid volume and thyroidal (131)I uptake. The effective half-life of (131)I (T(eff)) is then unjustifiably ignored. Evidence is presented that the 5/24h (131)I uptake ratio can be used as a surrogate parameter for T(eff), and that it is a determinant of the (131)I therapy outcome for patients with Graves' disease. A correction factor based on the thyroidal (131)I metabolism in individual patients could provide a means to increase the success rate of radioiodine treatment.
