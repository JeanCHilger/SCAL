Positron emission tomography in the diagnosis of atherosclerotic plaques in cancer patients. To assess the capacities of radionuclide diagnosis of atherosclerotic changes in the great vessels in cancer patients.18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) was used to image unstable atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta and great vessels. Whole-body radiodiagnostic studies were retrospectively analyzed in 500 cancer patients of different ages and with different forms of neoplasms.Tomographic images showed atherosclerotic plaques in 21% of the patients with the verified diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD) and in 17% without its clinical manifestations.The study showed it possible to identify a cardiovascular risk in cancer patients.
