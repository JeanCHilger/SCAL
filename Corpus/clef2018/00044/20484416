PET/CT with 18F-FLT: does it improve the therapeutic management of metastatic germ cell tumors? Because (18)F-FDG PET alone has only limited value in metastatic germ cell tumors (GCTs), we investigated the addition of 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine (FLT) to (18)F-FDG for early response monitoring and prediction of the histology of residual tumor masses in patients with metastatic GCT.Eleven patients with metastatic GCT were examined with both (18)F-FDG PET/CT and (18)F-FLT PET/CT before chemotherapy, after the first cycle of chemotherapy (early response), and 3 wk after completion of chemotherapy. In 1 patient with negative (18)F-FLT PET/CT results before chemotherapy, no further (18)F-FLT scanning was performed. PET images were analyzed visually and, using standardized uptake values (SUVs), semiquantitatively. The results were compared with the findings of CT and tumor marker levels and validated by histopathologic examination of resected residual masses, including Ki-67 immunostaining (7 patients), or by clinicoradiologic follow-up for at least 6 mo (4 patients). A responder was defined as a patient showing the presence of necrosis, a complete remission, or a marker-negative partial remission within a minimum progression-free interval of 6 mo. Early treatment response was judged according to the criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer.Before chemotherapy, reference lesions showed increased (18)F-FDG uptake (mean SUV, 8.8 range, 2.9-15.0) in all patients and moderate (18)F-FLT uptake (mean SUV, 3.7PET-negative residual masses after chemotherapy of metastatic GCT still require resection, since the low negative predictive value of (18)F-FDG PET for viable tumor cannot be improved by application of (18)F-FLT.
