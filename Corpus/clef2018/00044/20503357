Prickle1b mediates interpretation of migratory cues during zebrafish facial branchiomotor neuron migration. The facial branchiomotor neurons undergo a characteristic tangential migration in the vertebrate hindbrain. Several signaling mechanisms have been implicated in this process, including the non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. However, the role of this signaling pathway in controlling the dynamics of these neurons is unclear. Here, we describe the cellular dynamics of the facial neurons as they migrate, focusing on the speed and direction of migration, extension of protrusions, cell shape, and orientation. Furthermore, we show that the PET/LIM domain protein Prickle1b (Pk1b) is required for several aspects of these migratory behaviors, including cell orientation. However, we find that centrosome localization is not significantly affected by disruption of Pk1b function, suggesting that polarization of the neurons is not completely lost. Together, our data suggest that Pk1b function may be required to integrate the multiple migratory cues received by the neurons into polarization instructions for proper posterior movement.
