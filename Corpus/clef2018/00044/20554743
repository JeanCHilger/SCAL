Dynamic PET denoising with HYPR processing. HighlY constrained backPRojection (HYPR) is a promising image-processing strategy with widespread application in time-resolved MRI that is also well suited for PET applications requiring time series data. The HYPR technique involves the creation of a composite image from the entire time series. The individual time frames then provide the basis for weighting matrices of the composite. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the individual time frames can be dramatically improved using the high SNR of the composite image. In this study, we introduced the modified HYPR algorithm (the HYPR method constraining the backprojections to local regions of interest [HYPR-LR]) for the processing of dynamic PET studies. We demonstrated the performance of HYPR-LR in phantom, small-animal, and human studies using qualitative, semiquantitative, and quantitative comparisons. The results demonstrate that significant improvements in SNR can be realized in the PET time series, particularly for voxel-based analysis, without sacrificing spatial resolution. HYPR-LR processing holds great potential in nuclear medicine imaging for all applications with low SNR in dynamic scans, including for the generation of voxel-based parametric images and visualization of rapid radiotracer uptake and distribution.
