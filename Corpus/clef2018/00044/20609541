Neuroimaging of stroke-like episodes in MELAS. Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) shows sudden neurological deficits that are called 'stroke-like episodes'. With regard to the pathophysiology of stroke-like episodes, so-called mitochondrial angiopathy and cytopathy theories have been proposed, but the subject is still controversial. To clarify this matter and to contribute to the development of a treatment for MELAS, we review here current neuroimaging research and consider the pathophysiology of stroke-like lesions. With regard to diffusion-weighted imaging findings, early reports often showed an elevated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in stroke-like lesions this was considered to be mainly vasogenic edema in the acute phase and is a different pattern than that in stroke. However, there has recently been an increase in the number of reports of a decrease in ADC
