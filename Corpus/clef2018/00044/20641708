 The chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and its ligand, the stromal cell–derived factor-1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12), are known to play a major role in the migration of progenitor cells during embryonic development of the central nervous, cardiovascular, and the hematopoietic systems (1, 2). In addition, this receptor–ligand pair has a function in the development, progression, and spread of various cancers (3), and the CXCR4 acts as a co-receptor to facilitate entry of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into CD4
