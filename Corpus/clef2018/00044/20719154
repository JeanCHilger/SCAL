Evaluation of Three-Dimensional Reconstruction CT in Percutaneous Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) of the Unresectable Lung Tumor with a Clustered Electrode.. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of lung tumours has recently received much attention for the promising results achieved. Here, to evaluate the value of three-dimensional reconstruction CT in radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of advanced non-small cell lung cancer.Sixty-six cases of advanced non-small cell lung cancer with 68 lesions (2 patients had 2 lesion treated in one session) were underwent three-dimensional reconstruction CT-giuded percutaneous RFA therapy. To evaluate short-term therapeutic effect of lung tumors using spiral CT scanning in 1-3 months after RFA to investigate the alterations of tumor size and density pre-and post-procedure, and complications, to observe the short-term curative effect.Our experiences have shown an initial increase in lesion size at immediate follow-up CT. The density of 64 lesions was lowered (94.1%) and 4 lesion is increased (5.9%) at immediate and one month follow-up CT. SPECT scan findings that 82.4% (56/68) cases of FDG uptake in tumors after RFA with tumor/non-tumor of lower than 2.5 at one month follow-up. The change in treated lesion size over time, radiologically assessed through measurements of the lesions on axial CT scans in the lung window setting no lesions had complete response, 50 lesions (73.5%) had partial response, 2 lesions with stable disease, 6 lesions showed progressive disease at 3 month follow-up CT. SPECT scan findings that 79.4% (54/68) cases of FDG uptake in tumors after RFA with tumor/non-tumor of lower than 2.5 at 3 month follow-up.The percutaneous RFA therapy under the guidance of three-dimensional reconstruction CT scan is safe and effective, with few complications, and can serve as a new method to the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancers.
