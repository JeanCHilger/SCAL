Follicular lymphoma at relapse after rituximab containing regimens: comparison of time to event intervals prior to and after 90 Y-ibritumomab-tiuxetan. Radioimmunotherapies with Zevalin® (RIT-Z) showed encouraging results in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL), leading frequently to failure-free intervals longer than those achieved by the last previous therapy. We compared time-to-event variables obtained before and after RIT-Z in patients with relapsed FL, previously exposed to rituximab. All patients with relapsed non-transformed, non-refractory, non-rituximab-naïve FL who have been treated with RIT-Z in two different centres in Europe were included. Staging and response were assessed by contrast-enhanced CT in all patients PET/CT was performed according to local availability. Event-free survival (EFS) and time to next treatment (TTNT) following the last previous therapy and after RIT-Z were compared. Pre-therapy characteristics were tested in univariate analyses for prediction of outcomes. A description of the patterns of relapse was also provided. Among 70 patients treated, only 16 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. They were treated with a median of 3 prior lines of chemo-immunotherapies, including a median of 2 rituximab-containing regimens
