Standardised uptake value of 18F-FDG on staging PET/CT in newly diagnosed patients with different subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18) F-FDG) is considered to be the most beneficial imaging method for staging patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The intensity of (18) F-FDG accumulation may be determined by calculating the so-called standardised uptake value (SUV). The study aimed at assessing the benefit of SUV(max) determination in staging (18) F-FDG PET/CT in untreated patients with NHL.One hundred and forty-nine initial staging (18) F-FDG PET/CT scans performed in patients with NHL between January 2007 and August 2009 were assessed, and the SUV(max) was determined.The highest mean and median values of SUV(max) were observed in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the lowest mean and median values were found in small lymphocytic lymphoma. The overlap in SUV(max) < 10 between DLBCL and the other subgroups of NHL was very significant. Statistically, no correlation was found between the lactate dehydrogenase and SUV(max) values. On the other hand, a correlation of the Ki-67 proliferative index of tumour cells and SUV(max) was revealed (r = 0.409, P < 0.001). The geometric mean of SUV(max) in patients with Ki-67 â‰¤ 60 and those with Ki-67 > 60 was 8.8 and 14.3, respectively (P < 0.001).The results confirm that SUV(max) is not beneficial for making a more precise diagnosis in most patients with NHL. Correlation of SUV(max) with the Ki-67 values suggests that SUV(max) might have a prognostic values in NHL.
