Clinical relevance of hibernating myocardium in ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. Patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction may have a substantial amount of viable, hibernating myocardium, which is a state of chronic contractile dysfunction with reduced blood flow at rest. Coronary revascularization in these patients may result in improvement of left ventricular function in the absence of viability, left ventricular function will not improve postrevascularization. Various noninvasive imaging techniques are available for detection of viable myocardium, including magnetic resonance imaging, dobutamine stress echocardiography, and nuclear imaging with single photon emission computed tomography or positron emission tomography. Because these techniques probe different characteristics of viable myocardium, the sensitivities and specificities of the techniques are not precisely identical
