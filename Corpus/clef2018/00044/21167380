Practical considerations in the evaluation and management of adrenocortical cancer. Adrenocortical cancer (ACC) is a rare, challenging disease with a broad range of clinical presentations. Often presenting in an advanced stage with a large, locally invasive primary tumor or with Cushing's syndrome, it requires a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. We discuss controversies in the evaluation and management of ACC. We conclude that the role of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) remains unclear and that it should be employed sparingly. Biopsies should be performed only when metastatic disease is present and a primary tumor has not been clearly established. Care should be taken in using the Weiss criteria to make decisions regarding prognosis. Surgery is the preferred intervention initially and at the time of recurrence, and every effort should be made to attempt a surgical resection. The latter should be an open resection laparoscopic resection should not be performed if there is a high suspicion of ACC. The use of mitotane in patients without evidence of disease remains controversial. Systemic chemotherapy is effective in patients with widely metastatic disease or as an adjunct to a surgical intervention and should focus on regimens that have been shown to effect responses
