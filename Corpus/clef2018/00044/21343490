Imaging features of solitary fibrous tumors. The goal of this pictorial essay is to illustrate the multimodality imaging features of pleural and extrapleural solitary fibrous tumors.Solitary fibrous tumors tend to be well-defined, ovoid, heterogeneously enhancing lesions. MRI characteristically depicts areas of low signal intensity that correspond to dense collagen. The findings of lesion multiplicity and hypermetabolism on PET images should raise the suspicion of malignancy.
