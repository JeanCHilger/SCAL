Precuneus hypoperfusion plays an important role in memory impairment of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The present study was designed to identify regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) abnormalities in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with memory impairments. Nineteen SLE patients (mean age 36.1 ± 8.6 years, range 17-47) with subjective memory complaints underwent brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The Korean Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (K-WAIS) and the Rey-Kim Memory Test (RKMT) were used objectively to evaluate cognitive functions in these patients. On the basis of the Intelligence Quotient-Memory Quotient (IQ-MQ) difference score, patients were classified into two groups: those with below one standard deviation (SD) from the mean for normal subjects of comparable age and education (memory impairment, n = 6) and those with without memory impairment (non-memory impairment, n = 13). Their brain SPECT images were analyzed by statistical parametric mapping (SPM) for group comparisons. The group of SLE patients with memory impairment showed significant hypoperfusion in the right precuneus compared with those with non-memory impairment (p < 0.001). Hypoperfusion of the precuneus may play a significant role in the memory function of SLE patients. SPM analysis of brain SPECT images could be a useful and objective tool for identifying abnormal rCBF in SLE patients with memory impairment.
