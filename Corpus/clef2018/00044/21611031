Avid F-FDG uptake of pectoralis major muscle: an equivocal sequela of strenuous physical exercise. Avid functional (18)F-FDG uptake of skeletal muscle is a known false positive finding of PET-CT study especially after involuntary muscle exercise just prior to the study. We describe the case of a 50-year-old man in whom the finding of avid (18)F-FDG uptake of pectoralis major muscle was encountered during investigation of metastatic melanoma.
