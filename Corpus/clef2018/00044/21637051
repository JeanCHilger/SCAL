A comparative study of fused FDG PET/MRI, PET/CT, MRI, and CT imaging for assessing surrounding tissue invasion of advanced buccal squamous cell carcinoma. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of fused fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) compared with PET/computed tomography (CT), MRI, and CT in assessing surrounding tissue invasion of advanced buccal squamous cell carcinoma (BSCC).PET/CT and MRI were performed in 17 consecutive patients with suspected masticator space invasion of BSCC from CT images. Attenuation-corrected PET and head and neck MRI datasets were registered. For pathologic correlation, 4 regions of interest were examined, including the maxilla, mandible, pterygoid, and masseter muscle. The tumor maximal diameter, measured by different imaging modalities, was correlated with pathology results.All PET/MRI fusions were verified as well matched using specific anatomic criteria. For pathology results, 1 patient had inflammation only, 1 had spindle cell cancer, and 15 had squamous cell cancer. Of 64 regions of interest, 20 (31.3%) harbored tumor invasion. The likelihood ratio was highest in fused PET/MRI (42.56) compared with PET/CT (25.02), MRI (22.94), and CT (8.6 all P < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of fused PET/MRI were also highest among the 4 modalities (90.0%/90.9%, 80.0%/84.1%, 80.0%/79.5%, and 55.0%/81.8%, respectively). The level of confidence was higher in fused PET/MRI or MRI than in PET/CT or CT (85.9%, 85.9%, 70.3%, 73.4%, respectively). The maximal lesion size was 3.0 to 6.0 cm in the pathology specimen. Regression analysis showed better agreement between fused PET/MRI and pathology results.Fused PET/MRI is more reliable for focal invasion assessment and tumor size delineation in advanced BSCC compared with PET/CT, MRI, and CT. PET/CT has the lowest confidence level, which may limit its use in the clinical setting.
