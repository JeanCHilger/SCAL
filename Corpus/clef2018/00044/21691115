Role of the anion exchanger 2 in the pathogenesis and treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. The essential anion exchanger (AE) involved in biliary bicarbonate secretion is AE2/SLC4A2, a membrane protein which has also been recognized to be relevant for the regulation of the intracellular pH (pH(i)) in several cell types. Previously, we reported that the expression of AE2 mRNA is diminished in liver biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Immunohistochemical studies indicated that the expression of the AE2 protein is decreased in the bile ducts and hepatocytes in PBC livers. Moreover, we found that bile duct cells isolated from PBC patients and cultured for a few passages exhibit defective Na(+)-independent Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange. Interestingly, positron emission tomography studies have shown that PBC patients, even at early stages of the disease, fail to secrete bicarbonate to bile in response to secretin, a defect that can be partially reversed after several months of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. Altogether, these findings sustain our hypothesis that dysfunctions related to AE2 might have a role in the pathogenesis of PBC. Inadequate AE2 function in lymphocytes may disturb pH(i) regulation in these cells and alter immune homeostasis leading to autoimmunity. On the other hand, reduced AE2 in cholangiocytes could cause cholestasis and oxidative stress of bile duct cells. Cholangiocyte changes, together with altered immune homeostasis, could favor the development of antimitochondrial antibodies and the autoimmune attack on biliary ducts. Our recent findings that Ae2(a,b)-deficient mice indeed display most of these features strongly support the notion that AE2 abnormalities may be involved in the pathogenesis of PBC.
