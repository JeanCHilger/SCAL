Benign metastasizing leiomyoma with multiple lymph node metastasis: a case report. This is a case report about benign metastasizing leiomyoma with multiple lymph node metastasis. A 34-year-old woman received an abdominal myomectomy for a suspicious leiomyoma. On the pathology report, atypical leiomyoma was suspected. Due to the suspicion of multiple lymph node metastasis on pelvis computed tomography (CT) 1 year after the operation, she was transferred to the Samsung Medical Center on October, 2009 for further work up. According to original slide review, it was determined to be a benign leiomyoma with a mitotic count <5/10 high-power fields, little cytological atypia and no tumor cell necrosis. Additional immunostaining was done. Multiple lymph node metastasis and a small lung nodule were identified on positron emission tomography-CT [corrected] and chest CT. Extensive debulking surgery and diagnostic video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) wedge resection were subsequently done. Metastatic lesions were reported to have a histology similar to that of the original mass. VATS right upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed because of the pathology result of VATS (adenocarcinoma). She started taking an aromatase inhibitor (LetrozoleÂ®) and there was no evidence of recurrence of disease on an imaging study and no post-operative complications until recently.
