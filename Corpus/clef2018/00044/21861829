Developments in imaging technologies related to hypertensive cardiovascular diseases. This article reviews the current imaging techniques and the methodologies used to derive quantitative markers of hypertension in the cardiovascular system. Firstly, simple but effective methods to assess regional and global function of large arteries are discussed. After, the role of echocardiography and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging to assess geometric and mechanical indices of hypertension related cardiac diseases are summarized. In particular, quantitative indices of deformation and strain are derived from quantitative analysis of doppler tissue and tagged magnetic resonance images. Finally, the importance of high field magnetic resonance imaging to assess myocardial microcirculation is described.
