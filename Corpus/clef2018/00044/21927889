Investigation of depth-of-interaction (DOI) effects in single- and dual-layer block detectors by the use of light sharing in scintillators. In block detectors for PET scanners that use different lengths of slits in scintillators to share light among photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), a position histogram is distorted when the depth of interaction (DOI) of the gamma photons is near the PMTs (DOI effect). However, it remains unclear whether a DOI effect is observed for block detectors that use light sharing in scintillators. To investigate the effect, I tested the effect for single- and dual-layer block detectors. In the single-layer block detector, Ce doped Gd₂SiO₅ (GSO) crystals of 1.9 × 1.9 × 15 mm³ (0.5 mol% Ce) were used. In the dual-layer block detector, GSO crystals of a 1.9 × 1.9 × 6 mm³ (1.5 mol% Ce) were used for the front layer and GSO crystals of 1.9 × 1.9 × 9 mm³ (0.5 mol% Ce) for the back layer. These scintillators were arranged to form an 8 × 8 matrix with multi-layer optical film inserted partly between the scintillators for obtaining an optimized position response with use of two dual-PMTs. Position histograms and energy responses were measured for these block detectors at three different DOI positions, and the flood histograms were obtained. The results indicated that DOI effects are observed in both block detectors, but the dual-layer block showed more severe distortion in the position histogram as well as larger energy variations. We conclude that, in the block detectors that use light sharing in the scintillators, the DOI effect is an important factor for the performance of the detectors, especially for DOI block detectors.
