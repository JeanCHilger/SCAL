18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake of bone and soft tissue sarcomas in pediatric patients. A high (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging in sarcomas of adults has been reported. The current study aimed at defining the degree of (18)F-FDG uptake of pediatric sarcomas. This retrospective study included 29 patients (23 males, 6 females mean age 14 Â± 5 years) with soft tissue (n = 9) or bone (n = 20) sarcomas. Twenty-two patients (76%) underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT and 7 (24%) had dedicated (18)F-FDG PET studies. Tumor (18)F-FDG uptake was quantified by standard uptake value (SUV)(max) and tumor-to-liver ratios (SUV ratios
