Lack of clinically detectable acute changes on autonomic or thermoregulatory functions in healthy subjects after transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Neuromodulatory techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have been increasingly studied as possible treatments for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. tDCS is capable of inducing changes in regional cerebral blood flow in both cortical and subcortical structures, as shown by positron emission tomography studies, and might conceivably affect hypothalamic and autonomic nervous system functions. However, it remains unknown whether acute changes in autonomic or hypothalamic functions may be triggered by conventional tDCS protocols.To verify whether tDCS, when performed with a bipolar cephalic montage, is capable of inducing acute changes in autonomic or hypothalamic functions in healthy subjects.Fifty healthy volunteers were studied. tDCS was performed with the anode over the C3 position and the cathode over the right supraorbital region. Subjects received either real or sham tDCS. Parameters assessed before and after a 20-minute session included blood pressure, tympanic thermometry, hand skin temperature, heart rate and ventilatory rate. Plasma concentrations of cortisol were also measured in a sub-set of 10 participants.A repeated-measures, mixed-design ANOVA showed significant changes in hand skin temperature (PÂ = .005) and cortisol levels (P < .001) after both real and sham stimulation. There were no statistically significant changes in any of the other measurements.The changes in hand temperature and cortisol levels, having occurred in both the sham and experimental groups, probably reflect a non-specific stress response to a new procedure. There were no significant changes in autonomic functions, ventilation rate or core body temperature that can be attributed to conventional tDCS applied to healthy volunteers.
