No seasonal variation in human midbrain serotonin transporter availability in Taiwan. Sunlight exposure is considered responsible for seasonal serotonin changes. Sixty-six healthy participants were recruited, and single photon emission computed tomography ([¹²³I]-ADAM SPECT) was used to investigate the association between serotonin transporter (SERT) availability and duration of sunlight exposure in Taiwan, a subtropical country. No significant correlation between SERT availability and the duration of sunlight exposure was found.
