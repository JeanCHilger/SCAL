Photocrosslinking between peptide-peptide or peptide-oligonucleotide by Ru(II)-TAP complexes. Ru(II)-TAP complexes have been shown to be very attractive compounds in the frame of developments of new anticancer drugs targeting the genetic material. This increasing interest originates from observations of covalent bond formations, triggered by photo-induced electron transfer (PET) between Ru(II)-TAP complexes and guanine bases of DNA. This photoreaction has recently been extended to the tryptophan (Trp) amino acid for future applications involving peptides. Thus, a double photo-addition of Trp residues of peptides on Ru(II) complexes is demonstrated by mass spectrometry with some structural issues. Such bi-adduct formations offer the possibility of photocrosslinking two Trp-containing biomolecules, which is investigated in this study. Thus, photocrosslinking between two complementary oligonucleotides (ODNs) derivatized by Trp-containing tripeptides is demonstrated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in the presence of Ru(II)-TAP complexes. Both PAGE and MS indicate that such photocrosslinkings arise from two reaction pathways: either via the double addition of Trp residues on the Ru complex or from dimerization of Trp radicals. The competition between these two pathways depends on the experimental conditions. Heterobridgings between guanine bases and tryptophan residues mediated by Ru(II)-TAP complexes is also examined, opening the way to ODN-peptide photocrosslinkings.
