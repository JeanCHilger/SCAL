Parotid gland tumors: preliminary data for the value of FDG PET/CT diagnostic parameters. The purpose of this article is to establish (18)F-FDG metabolic imaging parameters to differentiate benign and malignant tumors of the parotid gland.Forty-nine patients with increased FDG uptake in the parotid gland were selected for the study group (29 men and 20 women mean age, 63.14 Â± 12.32 years). Another 49 patients without head and neck malignancies were selected as the control group (24 men and 25 womenThe median SUV(max) of the increased diffuse uptake (2.55 interquartile range [IQR], 1.03-4.07) was significantly lower than the median SUV(max) of tumors (8.48FDG PET/CT SUV(max), metabolic tumor volume, and total glycolytic activity are imaging parameters to differentiate benign and malignant tumors of the parotid gland.
