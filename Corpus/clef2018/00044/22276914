Regiospecific syntheses of functionalized diaryliodonium tosylates via [hydroxy(tosyloxy)iodo]arenes generated in situ from (diacetoxyiodo)arenes. Ready access to (18)F-labeled aryl synthons is required for preparing novel radiotracers for molecular imaging with positron emission tomography. Diaryliodonium salts react with cyclotron-produced no-carrier-added [(18)F]fluoride ion to produce [(18)F]aryl fluorides. We aimed to prepare functionalized diaryliodonium salts to serve as potential precursors for producing useful (18)F-labeled aryl synthons, such as (18)F-labeled halomethylbenzenes, benzaldehydes, and benzoic acid esters. Such salts were designed to have one functionalized aryl ring, one relatively electron-rich ring, such as 4-methoxyphenyl or 2-thienyl, and a nonfluorine containing weakly nucleophilic anion. Generation of a [hydroxy(tosyloxy)iodo]arene from a functionalized (diacetoxyiodo)arene in situ followed by treatment with an electron-rich arene, such as anisole or thiophene, or with a functionalized arylstannane gave expedient regiospecific access to a wide range of functionally diverse diaryliodonium tosylates in moderate to high yields (44-98%). The described methodology broadens the scope for producing new functionalized diaryliodonium salts for diverse applications.
