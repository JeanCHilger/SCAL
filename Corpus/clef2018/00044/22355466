Characteristics of thyroid incidentalomas detected by pre-treatment [F]FDG PET or PET/CT in patients with cervical cancer. Considering the increased use of [(18)F]FDG PET or PET/CT, the clinical significance of thyroid incidentalomas is the subject of controversy. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of malignancies associated with thyroid incidentalomas detected by pre-treatment PET or PET/CT in patients with cervical cancer.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with cervical cancer who had thyroid incidentalomas detected by pre-treatment PET or PET/CT and were treated at our institute between January 2001 and December 2009.Of 327 patients who underwent pre-treatment PET or PET/CT, 33 patients had thyroid incidentalomas (10.1%) and 4 patients were diagnosed with thyroid malignancies by percutaneous needle aspiration (PCNA) or surgery. To put it concretely, of 33 patients with thyroid incidentaloma, 16 patients had a diffuse uptake and 17 patients had a focal uptake. Four of 17 patients with focal uptake were diagnosed with thyroid malignancies (23.5%). One patient with a focal uptake had an atypical cell based on PCNA, but did not undergo additional studies. The mean SUV(max) of thyroid malignancies did not differ from that of benign thyroid diseases.Thyroid incidentalomas are frequently detected by pre-treatment PET or PET/CT in patients with cervical cancer. Focal uptake on PET or PET/CT has a high risk of thyroid cancer.
