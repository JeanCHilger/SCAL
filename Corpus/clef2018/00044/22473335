Advances in the follow-up of differentiated or medullary thyroid cancer. The long-term survival of patients with thyroid cancer and the possibility of tumour recurrence up to 30-40 years after the achievement of a disease-free status illustrate the importance of lifelong follow-up in these individuals. This Review discusses the most innovative aspects of follow-up protocols for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, that is, of papillary or follicular hystotype, and those with medullary thyroid cancer. Particular focus is placed on the relevance of new ultrasensitive assays for thyroglobulin measurement and the option of using recombinant human TSH to stimulate thyroglobulin secretion. Methods to compensate for the loss of diagnostic significance of serum thyroglobulin levels in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer and circulating anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are highlighted, as well as the role of the postoperative calcitonin stimulation test and the clinical relevance of determining the doubling time of calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen in patients with medullary thyroid cancer. Moreover, this Review gives some insights into the role of molecular thyroid cancer testing, both for prognostic and for therapeutic purposes. Finally, a general overview of traditional imaging procedures, such as neck ultrasonography, CT, MRI and bone scintigraphy, is provided alongside a comparison with new nuclear imaging tests such as PET.
