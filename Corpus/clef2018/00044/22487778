Hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is emerging in veterinary medicine as an effective treatment or adjunct therapy for a variety of disorders in which improving oxygen delivery to tissues is a priority. The primary mechanisms of action of HBOT are (1) immediate hyperoxygenation of plasma and tissues and (2) decreased gas bubble (air embolus) size. With each hyperbaric 'dive,' secondary physiologic effects are set into motion. This article provides an introduction to HBOT, as well as its benefits, potential indications, contraindications, complications, and future directions in small animal veterinary medicine.
