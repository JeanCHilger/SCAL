Current developments in the management of locally advanced esophageal cancer. Loco-regionally advanced esophageal cancer is a lethal disease with poor outcomes despite aggressive multimodality therapy. The appropriate management of these patients is contentious and no single standard of care has been defined. Literature suggests that preoperative chemoradiotherapy may be superior to preoperative chemotherapy. Recently, several developments have impacted the care of these patients. The 2010 AJCC TNM staging system now recognizes the biologic heterogeneity of the disease and stages adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma separately. Studies suggest potentially less toxic chemotherapeutic agents including oxaliplatin may be useful in the management of this disease. FDG-PET imaging appears to have prognostic value and may predict for pathologic response. In addition, several trials have explored inhibition of the ErbB1 (EGFR) and ErbB2 (Her2) receptors. The monoclonal antibody trastuzumab appears to extend survival for patients with metastatic gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma and is under investigation for use in patients with loco-regionally advanced disease.
