A highly selective and sensitive fluorescence "turn-on" probe for Ag+ in aqueous solution and live cells. A naphthalimide-based fluorescent probe, NPQ, that contains a novel receptor was successfully developed. NPQ exhibited "turn-on" fluorescence and excellent selectivity toward Ag(+) in the presence of various other metal ions in aqueous solution. A series of control compounds were designed and synthesized in order to explore the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) quenching mechanism of NPQ and binding mode of NPQ with Ag(+). Moreover, with the NPQ-Ag(+) complex, I(-) was easily selectively recognized by a marked fluorescence quenching. The live cell imaging experiments demonstrate that NPQ can be used as a fluorescent probe for monitoring Ag(+) in living cells.
