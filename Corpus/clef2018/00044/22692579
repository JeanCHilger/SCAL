18F-FDG PET-CT for detecting recurrent gastric adenocarcinoma:  results from a Non-Oriental Asian population. To evaluate the utility of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET-CT in the diagnosis of recurrent gastric adenocarcinoma in a Non-Oriental Asian population.In this retrospective analysis, data from 72 Non-Oriental Asian patients, who underwent 93 18F-FDG PET-CT studies, were evaluated. All patients had histopathologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma, for which they had undergone primary treatment. PET-CT was performed for suspected recurrence or for post-therapy surveillance. PET-CT findings were analysed on a per-patient and per-region basis (local/lymph node/liver/lung/bone/others). A combination of clinical follow-up (minimum 6 months range: 6-36 months), imaging follow-up and/or histopathology (when available) was taken as the reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated for PET-CT on both a per-study and per-lesion basis.The mean patient age was 52.8 Â± 11.8 years (male/female: 52/20). Out of 93 PET-CT studies, 56 (60.2%) were positive and 37 (39.8%) were negative for recurrent disease. On per-study-based analysis, 18F-FDG PET-CT has a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 95.9, 79.5 and 88.1%, respectively. The accuracy of 18F-FDG PET-CT was 89.2% for local recurrence, 94.6% for lymph nodes, 96.7% for liver, 96.7% for lung, 98.9% for bone and 98.9% for other sites. The accuracy of 18F-FDG PET-CT was lower for local recurrence as compared with that for liver (P=0.012) and bone (P=0.012). No significant difference was found in the diagnostic accuracies for other regions.18F-FDG PET-CT is highly sensitive and specific for detecting recurrence in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. It shows high accuracy both on a per-patient and per-lesion basis.
