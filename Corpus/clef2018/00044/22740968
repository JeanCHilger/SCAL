A case of pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma with low (18)FDG uptake in PET. Pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma (PSH) is a relatively rare benign neoplasm, often asymptomatic and presenting as a solitary pulmonary nodule on radiological imaging studies. In the present case report, we examined a case of PSH in a young adult female, and reviewed the literature pertaining to PSH with an emphasis on (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)FDG PET/CT) and pathology. Immunohistochemical staining was also performed to confirm the diagnosis of sclerosing hemangioma. The results revealed that the tumor cells were immunopositive for epithelial membrane antigen, thyroid transcription factor-1 and vimentin and cytoskeleton 7. The patient recovered and was discharged. Thus, (18)FDG PET/CT may be used in the diagnosis of a solitary benign pulmonary nodule.
