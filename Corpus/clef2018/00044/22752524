Technical performance evaluation of a human brain PET/MRI system. Technical performance evaluation of a human brain PET/MRI system.The magnetic field compatible positron emission tomography (PET) insert is based on avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays coupled with lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) crystals and slip-fits into a slightly modified clinical 3-T MRI system. The mutual interference between the two imaging techniques was minimised by the careful design of the hardware to maintain the quality of the B (0) and B (1) field homogeneity.The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the homogeneity of the MR images were minimally influenced by the presence of the PET. Measurements according to the Function Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN) protocol proved the combined system's ability to perform functional MRI (fMRI). The performance of the PET insert was evaluated according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) standard. The noise equivalent count rate (NEC) peaked at 30.7 × 10(3) counts/s at 7.3 kBq/mL. The point source sensitivity was greater than 7 %. The spatial resolution in the centre field of view was less than 3 mm. Patient data sets clearly revealed a noticeably good PET and MR image quality.PET and MRI phantom tests and first patient data exhibit the device's potential for simultaneous multiparametric imaging.• Combination of PET and MRI is a new emerging imaging technology. • Evaluated brain PET/MRI enables uncompromised imaging performance. • PET/MRI aims to provide multiparametric imaging allowing acquisition of morphology and metabolism.
