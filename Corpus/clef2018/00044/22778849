Synthesis and evaluation of novel chalcone derivatives with (99m)Tc/Re complexes as potential probes for detection of β-amyloid plaques. Four (99m)Tc-labeled chalcone derivatives and their corresponding rhenium analogues were tested as potential probes for imaging β-amyloid plaques. The chalcones showed higher affinity for Aβ(1-42) aggregates than did (99m)Tc complexes. In sections of brain tissue from an animal model of AD, the four Re chalcones intensely stained β-amyloid plaques. In biodistribution experiments using normal mice, (99m)Tc-BAT-chalcone ([(99m)Tc]17) displayed high uptake in the brain (1.48% ID/g) at 2 min postinjection. The radioactivity washed out from the brain rapidly (0.17% ID/g at 60 min), a highly desirable feature for an imaging agent. [(99m)Tc]17 may be a potential probe for imaging β-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's brains.
