The analysis of factors affecting the threshold on repeated 18F-FDG-PET/CT investigations measured by the PERCIST protocol in patients with esophageal carcinoma. When applying the PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors protocol, a threshold value based on standardized uptake value corrected to lean body mass (SUL) in liver parenchyma, or in the blood pool, is used: to metabolically specify a measurable lesion to calculate metabolic tumor volume (mTV) and its product total lesion glycolysis (TLG)Eighty-four patients with esophageal cancer were prospectively examined at BL using 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG)-PET/CT 53 of 84 patients were examined after ChT1, 47 of 84 after ChT3, and 41 of 84 underwent all three examinations. Coefficient of variance (CV) and relative differences (RDw) were assessed for test-retest liver SUL values. The influence of liver SUL MEAN to mTV and TLG was modeled on BL examinations by artificial changes in liver SUL MEAN by Â± 20%.No significant differences were found in test-retest liver SUL MEAN values. Comparing BL with ChT1, BL with ChT3, and ChT1 with ChT3, the CV of the liver SUL MEAN was 10.4, 10.7, and 10.3% nevertheless, in 34.0, 38.3, and 36.6% of these examinations, respectively, the liver average SUL MEAN values exceeded the limit for inclusion in the studySUL MEAN values in reference tissues (liver parenchyma or descending aorta) measured before chemotherapy did not differ significantly from those measured during chemotherapy. The CV of liver SUL MEAN was comparable to that seen in published data, but some patients had to be excluded from the study because of the individual variability of their mean liver SUL MEAN, which consequently hinders the clinical usage of mTV and TLG. Even in the standardized protocol, all potential sources of variability should be minimized.
