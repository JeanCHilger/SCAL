Cognitive disconnective syndrome by single strategic strokes in vascular dementia. Strategic regions correspond to associative, limbic and paralimbic structures and related circuits, that underpin cognitive/behavioral functions. Strokes in these eloquent sites produce pictures of vascular dementia with syndromic features due to specific site lesion and/or interruption of their interconnections. This study aims at analysing subcortical strategic strokes that express similar cognitive/behavioral elements, by sharing common pathways. Patients (n=6) who attended in specialized ambulatory, were submitted to neuropsychological and neuroimaging assessments through MRI (GE Signa Horizon 1.5T) and brain SPECT (Millennium MG, ECD [TC-99m]). Stroke locations and respective main symptoms were: 1. anteromedian thalamus [L]: anterograde and retrograde amnesia (ARA), expression aphasia (EA), executive dysfunction (ED), apathy, and depression 2. anterior thalamus [R]: ARA, inattention, apathy, and aggressiveness
