Insights into imaging of aortitis. Aortitis is a subtype of the more general term "vasculitis", an inflammatory condition of infectious or noninfectious origin involving the vessel wall. The term "vasculitis" refers to a broad spectrum of diseases with different aetiologies, pathophysiologies, clinical presentations and prognoses. The clinical manifestations are nonspecific, as are the laboratory findings such as pain, fever, weight loss, vascular insufficiency and elevated levels of acute phase reactants, as well as other systemic manifestations, and sometimes may mimic other entities. Thus, if not suspected as part of the initial differential diagnosis, aortitis can be overlooked during the workup of patients with constitutional symptoms and systemic disorders.Imaging is rarely used for the primary diagnosis, but imaging findings, although nonspecific, can help in the assessment of these patients and is often required for making the final diagnosis. Imaging can be critical in the initiation of appropriate management and therapy.Noninvasive cross-sectional imaging modalities such as contrast-enhanced CT, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, nuclear medicine and in particular positron emission tomography (PET) are the leading modalities in modern diagnostic imaging of aortitis for both the initial diagnosis and follow-up.This review focusses on the most common manifestations of aortitis with which radiologists should be familiar.                                                                           TEACHING POINTS                         :                          • Aortitis is an inflammatory condition of infectious/noninfectious origin involving the vessel wall.                         • Imaging findings can help in the assessment of aortitis and are often crucial for the final diagnosis.                         • Contrast-enhanced CT, MRI and PET-CT are used for both the initial diagnosis and follow-up of aortitis.
