Tinea capitis in The Netherlands (Rotterdam area). This retrospective study reviews the occurrence and treatment of various forms of tinea capitis at the out-patient clinic for Dermatology and Pediatric Dermatology of the University Hospital Sophia/Dijkzigt over the period 1977-1988. Tinea capitis was diagnosed in 64 children. Trichophyton violaceum was the pathogen most frequently isolated, with Microsporum canis ranking second. The potassium hydroxide preparation was positive in 58% of the cases. Four cases showed a positive potassium hydroxide preparation with a negative culture. Immigrant children from Morocco were the largest group (61%). A zoophilic dermatophyte was isolated in 15 cases (27%). A pet animal was the source of infection in 4 cases. The ratio between boys and girls was equal in the patient population studied. In 43% of the children suffering from tinea capitis the clinical features were mild flaking without hair loss (so called seborrheic dermatitis-like infection).
