Quality control in emission-computed tomography. The authors considered the major aspects of the control of the quality of computed emission tomography (SPECT), assessed the influence of the physicotechnical parameters of the instrument, parameters of recording of results and methods of their processing on end-results of investigations. The authors propose a list of controlled parameters, methods of testing and their periodicity they also describe the techniques and results of some phantom studies using SPECT with the Jaszczak phantom.
