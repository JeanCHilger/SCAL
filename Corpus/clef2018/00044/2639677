Brain perfusion defect size in SPECT predicts outcome in cerebral infarction. The results of previous reports on the usefulness of brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in predicting the outcome of patients with acute cerebral infarction are conflicting. We therefore studied brain perfusion in 64 patients with a single supratentorial infarction. Contradictory to previous results the perfusion defect volume estimated from transversal and coronal slices correlated significantly with both presenting clinical findings and outcome. Although the clinical status at admission also correlated well with outcome, there was a subgroup of patients in which the favourable outcome was predicted only by SPECT and not by physical or any other examination at admission.
