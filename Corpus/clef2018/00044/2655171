Peculiarities of exotic animals in human-pet relations. In the past years an upward tendency in zoo animal husbandry is seen which is reflecting itself in additional visits to the small animal practitioner. The motivation for the increased keeping of zoo animals is of various nature and is a result of changes in the living conditions in the age of high technology. Misinterpretation when purchasing a zoo animal frequently leads to torturous husbandry. In contrast to dogs and cats, avian and rodent pets have additional characteristics. Cage housing and the therefore total dependence on the owner as well as the frequently missing sexual partner mean individual consideration for the needs of each species. Only the knowledge of these circumstances enables the small animal practitioner to assess the relationship of the owner and his pet, which is essential for therapy but also for an appropriate animal protection.
