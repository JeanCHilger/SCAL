Single photon emission computed tomography of patients with benign and malignant spinal diseases. SPECT has been used in a comparative study with planar bone scintigraphy in 54 patients. Spatial resolution of the method is sufficient to localise the vertebral bodies, the spinous processes, the intervertebral, costotransverse and costovertebral joints. In all patients it was possible to relate the areas of increased uptake to specific anatomical sites of the spine known to be affected in the different conditions. A detailed localisation is rarely possible using planar scintigraphy alone, due to the complex osseous anatomy of the spine. In some patients lesions could be seen only with SPECT. SPECT is an invaluable supplement to planar scintigraphy of the spine.
