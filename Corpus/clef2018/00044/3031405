Organ and tumor distribution of (18F)-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose in fasting and non-fasting rats. Differences in the uptake of (18F)-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18F)FDG) in various normal organs and the Rous sarcoma of fasted and unfasted rats were studied at 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after i.v. injection. The uptake of (18F)FDG in the tumor, spleen, and testis increased for 120 minutes, while uptake in the other organs was either level (brain, heart, white fat) or cleared off. The uptake was higher in the tumor than in the normal organs. The fraction of viable tumor tissue as measured morphometrically correlated intraindividually with the uptake of (18F)FDG--an increase of 1% of vital tumor corresponded to a 1.01-fold increase in tumor uptake of (18F)FDG. The nutritional state was of importance for the uptake of (18F)FDG into the heart, testis and brown fat. (18F)FDG is taken quantitatively up by the viable parts of the Rous tumor this may make it possible to follow the response of treatment in individual tumors also in man with (18F)FDG and positron emission tomography (PET).
