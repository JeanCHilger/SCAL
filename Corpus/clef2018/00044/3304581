Animal well-being and animal care. To know how to care for animals, one must understand their needs. Physiologic and safety needs of farm animals are reasonably well fulfilled. Behavioral needs have yet to be determined and used as bases for animal care. The concept of the welfare plateau is important for the design and operation of facilities for agricultural animals. Current issues in the care of farm animals include standard agricultural practices, stockmanship and the human-animal bond, and standards of design for animal-production equipment.
