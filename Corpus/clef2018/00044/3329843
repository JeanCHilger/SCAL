Stereotactic biopsy for deep-seated intracerebral lesions. Correlation between computer tomography, positron emission tomography and electrophysiological activity. In 16 cases of stereotactic deep brain biopsy, a correlative study was made by computer tomography, positron emission tomography, and electrophysiological depth recording. This multimodal study is shown to be of great value in stereotactic biopsy of deep-seated cerebral lesions.
