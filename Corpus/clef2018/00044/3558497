A system for cerebral blood flow measurement using an H215O autoradiographic method and positron emission tomography. A system for CBF measurement using an H215O autoradiographic method and positron emission tomography (PET) has been designed and installed as a clinical tool. Following an intravenous injection of H215O, a radioactivity accumulation in the brain tissue for 60 s and a continuous record of radioactivity in arterial blood were measured by a high counting speed PET device and a beta-ray detector, respectively, and CBF was calculated by a table-lookup procedure. First, this method was compared with the C15O2 inhalation steady-state method on 17 cerebrovascular disease patients and four normal subjects. The two values for CBF agreed with each other when H215O autoradiographic method was applied by correction for the dispersion in the measured arterial radioactivity-time curve. However, without the correction, the CBF by the H215O autoradiographic method revealed substantial overestimation by 30.6 +/- 17.5%. A reduced gray/white ratio of CBF was also observed in the H215O autoradiographic method. Second, simulation was performed in order to determine optimal accumulation time by PET scan the result was that errors due to dispersion and time mismatch became critical as the accumulation time was shortened to less than 60 s.
