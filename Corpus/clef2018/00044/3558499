Measurement of glucose utilisation with [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose: a comparison of different analytical methods. A number of different analytical methods were applied to dynamic scans obtained with [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and positron emission tomography. In particular, methods applying three, four, standard, or no rate constants were compared in four studies on three normal subjects. In addition, regional cerebral blood flow, oxygen utilisation, and blood volume were measured using the oxygen-15 steady-state inhalation technique. There was a large difference between values of glucose utilisation obtained with the various analytical methods, in particular between methods using three or four rate constants. This difference was not due to contamination of the tracer with [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-mannose. For dynamic techniques, the separate measurement of regional cerebral blood volume was essential. Static techniques (single scans with standard or no rate constants) were best related to dynamic techniques utilising four rate constants. From the results, it followed, however, that these static techniques can only be applied clinically if relatively large disturbances of glucose metabolism and no changes in rate constants are anticipated. The lumped constant was assessed from the combined measurement of oxygen and glucose utilisation and was higher than previously reported.
