The D2 dopamine receptor occupancy of risperidone and its relationship to extrapyramidal symptoms: a PET study. Risperidone is a recently introduced neuroleptic distinguished by a decreased incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). The mechanism of its low EPS is unclear. Since it has been shown that EPS is related to the level of D2 receptor occupancy, we studied nine patients receiving 2-6 mg/day of risperidone using [11C]-raclopride PET scans in order to determine the in vivo D2 receptor binding characteristics of risperidone. The mean level of receptor occupancy was 66% at 2 mg 73% at 4 mg
