Clinical application of 18F-FUdR in glioma patients--PET study of nucleic acid metabolism. Positron emission tomography was used to investigate the metabolism of nucleic acids by 18F-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (18F-FUdR) in 22 patients with gliomas. Sixteen cases of high grade glioma clearly demonstrated a region of high activity with a differential absorption rate (DAR) of 0.64 +/- 0.34. Six cases of low grade glioma failed to reveal a positive image of the tumor and the DAR in tumor was 0.21 +/- 0.042 (p < 0.01). This PET-18F-FUdR study succeeded in differentiating high and low grade gliomas from the view point of nucleic acid metabolism.
