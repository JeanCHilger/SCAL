Immunoscintigraphy of carcinomas in the area of the head-neck with technetium-99m marked monoclonal antibody 174H.64. A new diagnostic procedure. Twenty-one patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck were studied by immunoscintigraphy and immunoemission, computed tomography (ECT) using monoclonal antibody 174H.64 (Biomira Edminton) labelled with 99Tcm (Schwartz Method). Immunoscintigraphic results were compared with routine clinical assessments, including CT and ultrasonography, and were controlled by histopathological examination after surgery. All primary localizations (pT1 = 3, pT2 = 3, pT3 = 7, pT4 = 5 oropharynx 7, larynx 5, hypopharynx 3, oral cavity 3, lymph nodes 3) could be visualized, while 15 out of 18 neck lesions from tumor metastases could also be visualized (pN1 = 8, pN2 = 8, pN3 = 2). In one case with micrometastases in lymph nodes that could not be demonstrated by other methods, staging was upgraded by the immunoscintigraphic results. Three other micrometastases in lymph nodes could not be visualized. Distant metastases were suspected in 5 cases, three of which were confirmed either histologically or by radiography. Two of the cases with distant metastases were detected by the immunoscintigraphy. The present results indicate that immunoscintigraphy in combination with immuno-ECT can improve preoperative staging of head and neck carcinomas, especially with regard to metastatic neck disease, tumor recurrences and some cases of distant metastases.
