Myocardial viability assessment in ischemic cardiomyopathy: benefits of coronary revascularization. Patients with ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and low ejection fraction are usually referred for orthotopic heart transplantation. Based on results of myocardial viability assessment, we have prospectively used either coronary artery bypass grafting or orthotopic heart transplantation. From January 1990 to June 1992, among 50 patients initially referred for heart transplantation, 46 showing myocardial viability underwent bypass grafting. Forty-five of these 46 patients were men, and the mean age was 58 +/- 12 years (range, 40 to 70 years). Congestive heart failure was present in all patients, and dyspnea was the main symptom in 80% (37/46). Patients were selected according to three criteria. (1) Myocardial viability was primarily assessed by thallium scintigraphy for up to 24 hours (28/46 patients). When results were negative, patients underwent positron emission tomography (20/46 patients). (2) Regional left ventricular function was assessed using gated blood pool single-photon emission computed tomography combined with (3) full hemodynamic evaluation. Results were as follows: end-diastolic volume, 129 +/- 35 mL/m2 ejection fraction, 0.23 +/- 0.06
