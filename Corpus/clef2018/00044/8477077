Dynamic cranial CT in ischemic cerebral lesions. 58 patients with recent transient or permanent neurologic deficits of with proven carotid stenoses were examined by dynamic CT at the level of the internal capsule. In the presence of cerebral infarcts there was marked delay in the time/density curve with reduced peaks. Abnormal perfusion could be demonstrated by early examinations before definite morphological changes were seen. With transient ischaemic attacks there were no significant changes in perfusion in the presence of carotid stenoses the results were variable. The perfusion abnormalities in the hemispheres shown by dynamic cranial CT could be confirmed to some extent by 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT.
