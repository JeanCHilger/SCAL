Prevalence of and potential risk factors for symptoms associated with insecticide use among animal groomers. Pet groomers make numerous insecticide applications during the flea season, but few studies have examined their health complaints. The Pesticide Control Program of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection conducted a health and safety survey of this population. All licensed pet applicators in New Jersey were contacted, as were New Jersey veterinarians listed as pet-animal practitioners by the American Veterinary Medical Association. Approximately 36% of the respondents indicated that during the 1994 flea season, they had experience at least one of the 17 symptoms associated with insecticide application. Central nervous system symptoms (headache, dizziness, or confusion) and skin symptoms (skin rash or numbness/tingling) were reported most frequently. Logistic regression results suggest that applications per season, years as an applicator, certain hygiene variables, certain classes of products, and status of applicator (veterinary vs veterinary) are potentially important risk factors.
