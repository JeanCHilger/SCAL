Changes in the body composition of cats during weight reduction by controlled dietary energy restriction. Thirteen overweight domestic short-haired cats were fed a commercial low calorie diet for 18 weeks at an energy intake to lose weight they lost an average of 18.1 per cent of their starting weight. An evaluation of their body composition by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry before and after the study suggested that most of the weight lost was composed of fat. The cats' lean bodyweight did not change significantly, but increased as a proportion of total bodyweight.
