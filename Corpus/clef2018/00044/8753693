Measurement of cardiac output with first-pass determination during rubidium-82 PET myocardial perfusion imaging. In addition to providing useful clinical information, cardiac output determined during rubidium-82 positron emission tomographic (PET) myocardial perfusion studies can be used in the measurement of absolute regional myocardial blood flow using Sapirstein's method. This investigation was conducted to compare cardiac output values obtained by post-processing data acquired in a list mode PET myocardial perfusion study with those obtained using a technetium-99m-labeled red blood cell method on the same patients. Results from 14 patients showed that cardiac output can be accurately measured simultaneously in a 82Rb PET myocardial study, allowing determination of multiple perfusion and functional parameters of the heart, thus improving the cost-effectiveness of the 82Rb PET study.
