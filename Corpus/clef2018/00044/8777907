Clinical applications of registration and fusion of multimodality brain images from PET, SPECT, CT, and MRI. Several image registration and fusion techniques have been discussed in the context of applying them to patient studies obtained during clinical workup. Mainly retrospective techniques, either automated or interactive, seem to be flexible enough to be adapted to clinical situations. Examples are provided to express the usefulness of multi-modality, multi-tracer brain studies.
