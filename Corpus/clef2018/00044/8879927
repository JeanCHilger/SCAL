Elicitation thresholds for thiuram mix using petrolatum and ethanol/sweat as vehicles. An estimate of amounts of thiurams that may be released from rubber gloves into synthetic sweat, has previously been generated. These amounts should be compared to elicitation thresholds of patch tests performed with serial dilutions of thiuram mix using synthetic sweat as vehicle. Because of solubility properties of thiurams in aqueous media, such dilutions cannot directly be prepared. In this study, a stem solution was prepared in ethanol. This solution was then further diluted with synthetic sweat. Thiuram mix 0.5 w/v% was the most concentrated solution in ethanol achievable. The patch test reactions were compared to reactions to serial dilutions using petrolatum as vehicle. The experiment revealed that endpoint dilution with synthetic sweat was not achieved in this study. The threshold for elicitation of positive patch test reactions seemed to be lower for ethanol/sweat as vehicle compared to petrolatum: 32% reacted to ethanol/synthetic sweat 0.001 mg/cm2 compared to 14% reacting to thiuram in pet. 0.002 mg/cm2. Based on these results, synthetic sweat may be considered a more relevant medium for threshold finding studies than petrolatum. Because of expected instability of the aqueous solutions, petrolatum is probably a more suitable vehicle for routine testing. The study does not permit final conclusions concerning acceptable thresholds for leachable thiurams in rubber gloves, but it is likely that an acceptable threshold would be substantially less than 0.001 mg/ cm2.
