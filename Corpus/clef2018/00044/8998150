Assessment of left ventricular volume using ECG-gated SPECT with technetium-99m-MIBI and technetium-99m-tetrofosmin. We evaluated ECG-gated SPECT (g-SPECT) in the measurement of absolute left ventricular (LV) volume by comparing it with left ventriculography (LVG) and with cine-MRI.Projection data from 31 patients were acquired with a three-headed SPECT system in 12 min using a 64 x 64 matrix with 1.5 zoom (1 pixel = 4.27 mm). The R-R interval from simultaneously acquired ECG was divided into eight frames. The end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (EDV ESV) and LV mass were assessed by an area-length method with manual delineation of the epi- and endocardial LV borders using midventricular vertical and horizontal long-axis images. The stroke volume, LVEF and cardiac output (CO) were generated from the EDV, ESV and heart rate during the study. The g-SPECT LV values were compared with those of LVG (25 patients) and cine-MRI (18 patients).The g-SPECT values correlated well with those from LVG (r = 0.83 to 0.92 p < 0.001) and cine-MRI (r = 0.76 to 0.99Despite potential problems that may cause inaccuracy and require improvements such as an accurate and reproducible automatic edge detection algorithm, g-SPECT has clinical utility in assessing global LV volumes and function.
