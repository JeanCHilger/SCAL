Follow up control of stage IV neuroblastoma: 123I-MIBG scintigraphy, bone scintigraphy and catecholamine metabolites. The diagnostic value of 123I-mIBG-scintigraphy, bone scintigraphy and catecholamine metabolites in the follow up of neuroblastoma stage IV will be evaluated.Nineteen children suffering from neuroblastoma were analysed retrospectively by 123I-mIBG-scintigraphy, bone scintigraphy and measurement of homovanillic acid, vanillic acid, neuronspecific enclose, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritine. Follow up was 7-132 (median 36) months.The significance of the methods was dependent on the time of diagnostic use. In principal, 123I-mIBG-scintigraphy has the highest diagnostic impact. For initial staging and diagnosis of recurrence a combination of all three methods can be used. On the contrary, follow up during chemotherapy is best documented by 123I-mIBG-scintigraphy, whereas bone scintigraphy is of limited and measurement of catecholamine metabolites of less diagnostic value.
