Radiosynthesis of [18F] N-3-fluoropropyl-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane and the first human study with positron emission tomography. A procedure for the routine preparation of [18F]FP-CIT has been developed. Purification of the final product was achieved by preparative HPLC using phenethyl column without decomposition or epimerization. [18F] labeled-N-fluoropropyl-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane was prepared and PET imaging was performed on human subjects. A high uptake into striatal regions was observed. HPLC plasma analysis using [18F]FP-CIT indicated the presence of only one metabolite. By directly comparing the behavior of these three radiotracers ([18F]DOPA, [123I]FP-CIT, and [18F]FP-CIT) in the same subjects, we can enhance our understanding of the dopaminergic system as well as the relative potential of these techniques in a clinical research setting.
