Potential use of iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine radioaerosol as a marker of pulmonary neuroadrenergic function. Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) radioaerosol is of potential use in the investigation of the neuroadrenergic function of the lungs however, before the method can be successfully employed the following issues need to be clarified: (1) Does the nebulization affect the radiochemical purity of 123I-MIBG? (2) Is the pulmonary distribution of inhaled 123I-MIBG homogeneous in normal subjects? (3) Does the pulmonary clearance of inhaled 123I-MIBG reflect the functional status of the neuroadrenergic system of the lungs? In this study we performed: (1) a chromatographic study of nebulized 123I-MIBG
