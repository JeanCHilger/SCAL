Neural substrates of facial recognition. Seventeen healthy normal volunteers performed three facial recognition tasks while their cerebral blood flow was measured with PET: categorizing faces according to gender, recognizing new faces, and recognizing familiar faces. These tasks activated three different pathways: respectively, the left inferior temporal lobe and left frontal cortex a predominantly right frontal-right parietal-left cerebellar network
