Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) for diagnosis of residual mass in patients with lymphoma. PET using 18fluorodesoxyglucose (FDG) may offer the possibility of differentiating vital from necrotic residual masses.Seventeen patients with HD and 17 patients with NHL underwent FDG-PET following therapy. According to staging by routine methods at diagnosis, 7 patients presented stage I, 13 stage II, 5 stage III, and 9 stage IV. A dose of 250-400 MBq FDG was injected and whole-body PET was performed 30-60 minutes later.Residual mass was found in 32 patients with routine methods. FDG-PET was negative in 17 patients, who were considered to be in CR. None of them relapsed (median follow-up 63 weeks ). FDG-PET was positive in 17 patients. Sixteen patients had residual mass with routine methods. Four patients received radiation after PET. Their median follow-up is 58 weeks without relapse. Two other patients with lasting CR had FDG uptake outside the residual mass--one with confirmed pneumonia. Five patients had histologically confirmed lymphoma, 2 patients relapsed according to routine methods. One patient is likely to be false positive because of fracture at lymphoma site. Seven of 10 patients with FDG uptake in the residual mass after completed therapy relapsed. According to routine restaging, 2 patients achieved CR. In 1 patient an additional focus was found in the humerus in spite of normal scintigraphy with histologically confirmed lymphoma. There were no false-negative results, but 3 false-positive results inside and 2 false-positive results outside the residual mass after completed therapy.PET performed for evaluation of residual mass after treatment of lymphoma has a high predictive value.
