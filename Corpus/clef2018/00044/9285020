Presence of domestic pets and respiratory symptoms in asthmatic children. The allergens of domestic pets such as cats, dogs and birds, have been known to sensitive predisposed individuals. In Singapore, approximately 25% to 35% of our atopic populations are sensitised to cat, dog or bird feather allergens. It is not known, however, if the presence of such domestic pets would translate to higher rates of sensitisation, or more importantly, give rise to increased respiratory symptoms. This study evaluated the association between the presence of domestic pets at home and the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among asthmatic children in Singapore. The parents of 1517 doctor-diagnosed asthmatic children were interviewed using the American Thoracic Society-Division of Lung Diseases respiratory questionnaire. More than 20% were found to have domestic pets (cats, dogs or birds) at home. Of these, those with exposure to passive smoke in the home were excluded. A total of 188 current pet owners (cats, dogs and birds) were demographically-matched for sex, race and socio-economic status (type of housing) to those without pets, past or current. Compared to those without pets, asthmatic children with pets at home had a higher prevalence of coughing with cold [relative risk (RR) 1.30 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.69]
