Evaluation of the indomethacin-nitroglycerin interaction with positron-emission tomography. The hypothesis that local release of prostanoids may contribute to the pharmacologic effect of nitroglycerin (NTG) has long been debated. Results of prostanoid blockade by indomethacin on NTG-induced effects, to date, have been inconclusive. To quantitate the effects of intravenous indomethacin on NTG-induced myocardial blood flow by using positron-emission tomography, we conducted a prospective, controlled, parallel-design study comparing patients with coronary artery disease with healthy volunteers. Eight subjects, four Canadian Class II-III coronary artery disease (CAD) with luminal narrowing of > 80% in a minimum of two vessels, and four healthy volunteers were evaluated. Baseline global myocardial blood flow was equivalent between the groups. NTG produced a 49.3 +/- 4.7% increase in myocardial blood flow in healthy volunteers (p = 0.006) and an -0.5 +/- 19.8% decrease in the group with CAD (p = 0.62 between groups). After indomethacin, both groups had a 24% decline in myocardial blood flow (CAD, p = 0.25 healthy, p = 0.03). One patient with CAD had acute ischemia after indomethacin. The study demonstrated that short-term intravenous indomethacin decreases NTG-induced myocardial blood flow to the same degree in both subjects with CAD and healthy individuals. Impairment of myocardial blood flow from this pharmacologic combination may be most important in patients with severe fixed lesions.
