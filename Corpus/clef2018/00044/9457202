Extranodal malignant lymphoma: detection with FDG PET versus CT. To evaluate use of functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) versus computed tomography (CT) for detection of extranodal lymphoma spread.Eighty-one consecutive and previously untreated patients with malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 43) or Hodgkin disease (n = 38) were examined with 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET and contrast material-enhanced CT. Concordant findings at both CT and FDG PET were regarded as actual locations of disease discordant results were resolved on the basis of biopsy or follow-up results when possible.Forty-two lesions were identified at both PET and CT, and 19 were verified with biopsy results. PET demonstrated a further 24 lesions. Verification was possible in 15 of these lesions with biopsy (n = 10), magnetic resonance imaging (n = 1), scintigraphic (n = 1), or follow-up (n = 3) results. In 14 of these 15 lesions, PET findings were confirmed (bone marrow, nine spleen, threePET may provide more information about extranodal lymphoma than does incremental CT.
