Brain mapping with single photon emission CT. To investigate the feasibility of performing brain mapping studies by using cortical activation paradigms and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and to evaluate methods of analysis.Twenty healthy volunteers underwent technetium-99m bicisate SPECT under baseline conditions and during either full-field or right hemifield visual stimulation with a black and white reversing checkerboard pattern. Changes in regional cerebral perfusion were measured by using regions of interest (ROIs) and statistical parametric mapping.ROI analysis identified statistically significant increases in perfusion in the occipital cortex with full-field visual stimulation (mean +/- standard error of the mean percentage change from baseline: left, 8.0 +/- 1.5 right, 6.6 +/- 2.4). With right hemifield visual stimulation, perfusion was significantly increased only in the left occipital cortex (left, 5.2 +/- 1.5Brain mapping studies were preformed with Tc-99m bicisate SPECT, and activation-induced changes were visualized and measured. These methods can be applied to develop improved methods of diagnosis and assessment of treatment outcome in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.
