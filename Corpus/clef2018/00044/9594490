A study on accuracy of rCBF measurements loaded with acetazolamide based on the microsphere model using iodine-123-IMP SPECT. We studied the accuracy of the method for measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) loaded with acetazolamide based on the microsphere model using iodine-123-IMP (IMP) SPECT. Two methods were examined, the super-early microsphere method with continuous withdrawal of arterial blood using the SPECT image obtained 5 min after tracer injection and the early microsphere method with one-point arterial sampling using the SPECT image obtained 30 min postinjection. On five subjects, after acetazolamide administration we measured rCBF by the analysis based on the two-compartment model using the data derived from dynamic SPECT scans and the sequential arterial blood sampling after IMP injection. Values of rCBF obtained by both super-early microsphere method and early microsphere method were significantly correlated with those obtained by the two-compartment model analysis (r = 0.982, 0.930, respectively). We conclude that it is possible to use the method based on the microsphere model in measuring rCBF loaded with acetazolamide. The early microsphere method with one-point sampling should be used clinically because of its simplicity and less-invasiveness.
