Global cerebral blood flow, blood volume, and oxygen metabolism in patients with migraine headache. Migraine headaches with and without aura are representative of vascular headache states traditionally thought to be mediated by alterations in vascular tone. Validation of this theory has been hampered in part by technical difficulties inherent in the measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF). The purpose of this study was to compare CBF measured during migraine and migraine-free states using PET.Patients with a minimum of one migraine headache without aura per month (International Headache Society [IHS] criteria) underwent measurement of CBF, cerebral blood volume (CBV), oxygen extraction, and metabolism during an episode of spontaneous migraine headache. Imaging was repeated during a migraine-free period of at least 48 hours. PET radiotracers used were: CBF, H(2)15O CBV, C15OIn nine patients (seven female and two male), global CBF (mL/min/100 g [SD]) was measured as 52.70 (6.9) during migraine and 59.65 (10.6) in the migraine-free state p=0.028. CBV (mL/100 g [SD]) was 3.6 (0.43) during the symptomatic state and 3.8 (0.55) after the migraineIn patients experiencing migraine without aura, CBF and CBV are reduced during the headache phase. Cerebral oxygen metabolism and oxygen extraction are not significantly affected.
