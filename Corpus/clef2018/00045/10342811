Impaired free fatty acid uptake in skeletal muscle but not in myocardium in patients with impaired glucose tolerance: studies with PET and 14(R,S)-[18F]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid. Free fatty acids (FFAs) are an important substrate for myocardial and skeletal muscle metabolism, and increased availability and oxidation of FFA are suggested to be associated with insulin resistance. This study was undertaken to assess whether myocardial or muscle uptake of FFA is altered in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Eight healthy men (control group age 48+/-1 years, BMI 25+/-1 kg/m2, mean +/- SE) and eight men with IGT (glucose-intolerant group
