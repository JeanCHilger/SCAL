Assessment of CABG-related risk in patients with CAD and LVD. Contribution of PET with [18F]FDG to the assessment of myocardial viability. Previous studies have demonstrated that hibernating myocardium can be assessed by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET). This study evaluated the use of [18F]FDG-PET for CABG related risk assessment in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and left ventricle dysfunction (LVD).We retrospectively evaluated 241 to patients candidate CABG presenting with signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) prevailing over ischemic signs. Of the 241 patients, 153 had undergone [18F]FDG-PET as well as conventional assessment: 110 out of 153 (group A) were operated because of PET evidence of hibernation. Of the 241 patients, 88 had not undergone [18F]FDG-PET: 86 out of 88 (group B) were operated on. The outcome of surgical patients was evaluated by considering all major perioperative complications including the use of mechanical and pharmacological support and in-hospital mortality. After hospital discharge, each patient was examined at 1, 4 and every 6 months thereafter.Perioperative use of mechanical supports and inotropic drugs, was significantly lower for the PET selected group (A) than for the non PET selected group (B). Mortality within 30 days of surgery was 0.9% in group A and 19.8% in group B. The only predictors of perioperative outcome were the presence of hibernating tissue and the ejection fraction.[18F]FDG-PET prior to CABG can be crucial for the assessment of perioperative risk in patients with CAD.
