Revascularization of residual viable myocardium improves left ventricular dysfunction in patients after myocardial infarction. The symptoms and prognosis of patients after myocardial infarction are essentially influenced by left ventricular function. About 50% of infarct related segments contain partly viable myocardium. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that regional and global left ventricular function can be improved by revascularization of infarct related segments with residual myocardial viability. In 15 of 30 consecutive patients, residual viable myocardium was found in the affected segment within 2.2 +/- 1.6 months after AMI. Myocardial viability was estimated by exercise-redistribution-reinjection thallium scintigraphy (SPECT imaging). Rest and exercise radionuclide ventriculography was performed to measure regional and global left ventricular ejection fraction before and after revascularization of the infarct related artery. 10 +/- 3 months after revascularization we observed a significant increase in the regional left ventricular ejection fraction at rest (from 32 +/- 16% to 41 +/- 19% p = 0.03), global left ventricular ejection fraction at rest (from 38 +/- 12% to 46 +/- 11%
