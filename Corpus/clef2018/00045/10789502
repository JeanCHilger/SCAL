Seroepidemiological investigation of feline chlamydiosis in cats and humans in Japan. The prevalence of chlamydia antibodies in Japan was investigated in 215 cat sera, consisting of 88 sera of stray cats and 127 sera of pet cats, and 2,184 human sera, taken from 2,003 general persons and 181 small animal clinic veterinarians, by microimmunofluorescence (MIF) testing with Chlamydia psittaci Fe/Pn1 of feline origin and Prk/6BC of avian origin as antigens. The prevalence rates of anti-Fe/Pn1 antibodies were 45.5% in stray cats, 17.3% in pet cats, 1.7% in general persons and 8.8% in small animal clinic veterinarians. The prevalence rates of anti-Prk/6BC antibodies were 51.1% in stray cats, 15.0% in pet cats, 3.1% in general persons and 5.0% in small animal clinic veterinarians. These results suggested that feline chlamydia infection is widely spread in cats especially in stray cats in Japan, and suggested that feline chlamydiosis could be transmitted to people who are in close contact with infected cats.
