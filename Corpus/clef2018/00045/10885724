Elastin-derived protein coating onto poly(ethylene terephthalate). Technical, microstructural and biological studies. Recently, it has been shown in our laboratory that certain proteins solubilized from elastin (ESP) formed a tight association with certain polymers such as elastin or polyethylene glycol terephthalate (PET) ... . The present paper deals with the description of the optimal chemical conditions of this unexpected association, its microstructure and its biological properties. A microstructural study of the composite ESP-PET material was performed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The thickness of the yield composite was evaluated (0.4-2 microm) but its imperviousness was unsatisfactory using ESP alone. So, we tentatively coated PET with the elastin-ESP complex. The microscopic views confirmed that the polymer was better filled by the organic matrix, the thickness of the layer being markedly improved (3 microm). Simultaneously, we attempted to verify whether the yielded composite retains the biological properties previously demonstrated with the 'Biopatches' and probably due to ESP. Thus, the culture of endothelial cells on an ESP-coating (with elastin or not) showed that a 100 microg/cm2 ESP concentration was able to promote endothelial cell growth in perfect conditions, maintaining their phenotypic character. While several physico-chemical determinations are in progress in our laboratory to identify and characterize the protein involved, a prototype of small-calibre vascular prosthesis was elaborated with elastin-ESP-PET composite and will be placed in a dog at the abdominal femoral junction to evaluate the in vivo performance of such an attractive material in artery restoration.
