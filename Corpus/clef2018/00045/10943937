Mean and variance of single photon counting with deadtime. The statistics of photon counting by systems affected by deadtime are potentially important for statistical image reconstruction methods. We present a new way of analysing the moments of the counting process for a counter system affected by various models of deadtime related to PET and SPECT imaging. We derive simple and exact expressions for the first and second moments of the number of recorded events under various models. From our mean expression for a SPECT deadtime model, we derive a simple estimator for the actual intensity of the underlying Poisson process simulations show that our estimator is unbiased even for extremely high count rates. From this analysis, we study the suitability of the Poisson statistical model assumed in most statistical image reconstruction algorithms. For systems containing 'modules' with several detector elements, where each element can cause deadtime losses for the entire module, such as block PET detectors or Anger cameras, the Poisson statistical model appears to be adequate even in the presence of deadtime losses.
