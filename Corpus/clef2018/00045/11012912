Unrestricted pore area (A0/Deltax) is a better indicator of peritoneal membrane function than PET. How to measure the peritoneal exchange in uremic patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) is still a matter of controversy. Most clinics use the peritoneal equilibration test (PET), but from a theoretical point of view, it would be more appropriate to determine the "area" parameter, A0/Deltax. The latter reflects the total unrestricted pore area per centimeter diffusion distance and can be obtained by three-pore analysis using, for example, the PD capacity test (PDC). To evaluate the different estimates of peritoneal function, PET data and the A0/Deltax parameters were compared with the independently determined uptake of a small diffusible tracer, iohexol (molecular weight of 821 D), from the abdominal cavity to blood.Fourteen patients on routine PD underwent determinations of PET and A0/Deltax using PDC. Within a month, the two-hour uptake of iohexol (6 mg/mL) was also determined from the plasma iohexol concentration following abdominal filling.A strong correlation was found between the rate of iohexol plasma concentration increase (k30-120) and A0/Deltax (A0/Deltax = 76,300. k30-120 - 1.56 r2 = 0.799The "area" parameter, A0/Deltax, is superior to the more widely used routine PET as an indicator of peritoneal membrane function. In addition, the concept of A0/Deltax has the virtue of supplying quantitative information about the peritoneal pathophysiology and physiology.
