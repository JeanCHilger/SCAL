Direct recovery of regional tracer kinetics from temporally inconsistent dynamic ECT projections using dimension-reduced time-activity basis. We present an algorithm of reduced computational cost which is able to estimate kinetic model parameters directly from dynamic ECT sinograms made up of temporally inconsistent projections. The algorithm exploits the extreme degree of parameter redundancy inherent in linear combinations of the exponential functions which represent the modes of first-order compartmental systems. The singular value decomposition is employed to find a small set of orthogonal functions, the linear combinations of which are able to accurately represent all modes within the physiologically anticipated range in a given study. The reduced dimension basis is formed as the convolution of this orthogonal set with a measured input function. The Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse is used to find coefficients of this basis. Algorithm performance is evaluated at realistic count rates using MCAT phantom and clinical 99mTc-teboroxime myocardial study data. Phantom data are modelled as originating from a Poisson process. For estimates recovered from a single slice projection set containing 2.5 x 10(5) total counts, recovered tissue responses compare favourably with those obtained using more computationally intensive methods. The corresponding kinetic parameter estimates (coefficients of the new basis) exhibit negligible bias, while parameter variances are low, falling within 30% of the Cram√©r-Rao lower bound.
