Improved effect of 131I-MIBG treatment by predosing with non-radiolabeled MIBG in carcinoid patients, and studies in xenografted mice. 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) has been used with success for the palliation of metastatic carcinoid. To qualify more patients for this treatment, we evaluated the effect of predosing with non-radiolabeled MIBG on 131I-MIBG tumour targeting in carcinoid patients and in mice with BON human carcinoid xenografts.Ten carcinoid patients with a faint tumour imaging on a diagnostic 131I-MIBG scan (1 mCi = 37 MBq, 5 mg MIBG) received non-radiolabeled MIBG prior to a second scintigraphy. In case of improved tumour targeting patients were treated with 200 mCi (7.4 GBq) 131I-MIBG following a pharmacological predose of 20-40 mg/m2 MIBG.In six patients. highly increased 'tumour/non-tumour' ratios were seen due to reduced levels in normal tissues and increased tumour accumulation. The combined treatment applied in five patients, considerably improved symptoms in all (duration 6-12 months), accompanied by biochemical response in three. In BON carcinoid xenografted mice, MIBG was injected intraperitoneally followed by intravenous 125I-MIBG with similar findings: increased 'tumour/non-tumour' radioactivity ratios by 1.5-3-fold.Predosing with non-radiolabeled MIBG resulted in improved 131I-MIBG tumour targeting, prolonged palliation and encouragingly often biochemical responses in carcinoid.
