Absolute cerebral blood flow measured by dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI: a direct comparison with Xe-133 SPECT. Absolute regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured in ten healthy volunteers, using both dynamic susceptibility-contrast (DSC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Xe-133 SPECT within 4 h. After i.v. injection of Gd-DTPA-BMA (0.3 mmol/kg b.w.), the bolus was monitored with a Simultaneous Dual FLASH pulse sequence (1.5 s/image), providing one slice through brain tissue and a second slice through the carotid artery. Concentration C(t) is proportional to -(1/TE) ln[S(t)/S(0)] was related to CBF as C(t) = CBF [AIF(t) x R(t)], where AIF is the arterial input function and R(t) is the residue function. A singular-value-decomposition-based deconvolution technique was used for retrieval of R(t). Absolute CBF was given by Zierler's area-to-height relation and the central volume principle. For elimination of large vessels (ELV), all MRI-based CBF values exceeding 2.5 times the mean CBF value of the slice were excluded. A correction for partial-volume effects (CPVE) in the artery used for AIF monitoring was based on registration of signal in a phantom with tubes of various diameters (1.5-6.5 mm), providing an individual concentration correction factor applied to AIF data registered in vivo. In the Xe-133 SPECT investigation, 3,000-4,000 MBq of Xe-133 was administered intravenously, and CBF was calculated using the Kanno Lassen algorithm. When ELV and CPVE were applied, DSC-MRI showed average CBF values from the entire slice of 43 +/- 10 ml/(min 100 g) (small-artery AIF) and 48 +/- 17 ml/(min 100 g) (carotid-artery AIF) (mean +/- S.D., n = 10). The corresponding Xe-133-SPECT-based CBF was 33 +/- 6 ml/(min 100 g) (n = 10). The relationships of CBF(MRI) versus CBF(SPECT) showed good linear correlation (r = 0.74-0.83).
