Pulsed Doppler tissue imaging of the velocity of tricuspid annular systolic motion a new, rapid, and non-invasive method of evaluating right ventricular systolic function. Rapid, accurate, and widely available non-invasive evaluation of right ventricular function still presents a problem. The purpose of the study was to determine whether the parameters derived from Doppler tissue imaging of tricuspid annular motion could be used as indexes of right ventricular function in patients with heart failure.Standard and pulsed Doppler tissue echocardiography were obtained in 44 patients with heart failure (mean left ventricular ejection fraction 24 +/- 7%) and in 30 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. The tricuspid annular systolic and diastolic velocities were acquired in apical four-chamber views at the junction of the right ventricular free wall and the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve using Doppler tissue imaging. Within 2 h of Doppler tissue imaging, the first-pass radionuclide ventriculogram, determining right ventricular ejection fraction and equilibrium gated radionuclide ventriculography single photon emission computed tomography, were performed in all patients.In patients with heart failure, the peak systolic annular velocity was significantly lower and the time from the onset of the electrocardiographic QRS complex to the peak of systolic annular velocity was significantly greater than the corresponding values in healthy subjects (10.3 +/- 2.6 cm. s(-1) vs 15.5 +/- 2.6 cm.s(-1), P < 0.001, and 198 +/- 34ms vs 171 +/- 29 ms, P < 0.01, respectively). There was a good correlation between systolic annular velocity and right ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.648, P <0.001). A systolic annular velocity < 11.5 cm.s(-1)predicted right ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 45%) with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 85%.We conclude that the evaluation of peak systolic tricuspid annular velocity using Doppler tissue imaging provides a simple, rapid, and non-invasive tool for assessing right ventricular systolic function in patients with heart failure.
