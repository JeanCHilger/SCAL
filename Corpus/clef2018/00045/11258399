The classical stroop interference task as a prefrontal activation probe: a validation study using 99Tcm-ECD brain SPECT. This study investigated the feasibility of brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) functional imaging in a neuropsychological test setting, following a single-day protocol with a split-dose paradigm. The Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT) is an example of a well-documented prefrontal activation task. In a split-dose protocol, ten right-handed healthy volunteers were injected twice with 370 MBq 99Tcm-ethyl cysteinate dimer while performing consecutively both series of card-reading of the SCWT. Images were reconstructed using filtered back-projection and normalized to a standard template in Talairach coordinates. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM96) was used to determine voxelwise significant changes. A first activation cluster was found in the left medial prefrontal cortex, consisting of the gyrus cinguli anterior and the gyrus frontalis medius and superior. A second activation cluster included the right gyrus frontalis dorsalis and medius. These findings confirm to a large extent the results of previous functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography studies of Stroop-like tasks. The choice and validity of various methodological characteristics of the experimental design leading to these results is critically discussed. It is concluded that brain SPECT activation with the Stroop Color Word Test under standard neuropsychological conditions in healthy volunteers, is both technically and practically feasible.
