Posterior cerebral artery Wada test: sodium amytal distribution and functional deficits. Inadequate sodium amytal delivery to the posterior hippocampus during the intracarotid Wada test has led to development of selective tests. Our purpose was to show the sodium amytal distribution in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) Wada test and to relate it to functional deficits during the test. We simultaneously injected 80 mg sodium amytal and 14.8 MBq 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) into the P2-segment of the PCA in 14 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. To show the skull, we injected 116 MBq 99mTc-HDP intravenously. Sodium amytal distribution was determined by high-resolution single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In all patients, HMPAO was distributed throughout the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus it was also seen in the occipital lobe in all cases and in the thalamus in 11. Eleven patients were awake and cooperative
