Mixed Chloride/Phosphine Complexes of the Dirhenium Core. 5. Reduction or Disproportionation at the Re(2)(6+) Unit in Reactions with Tertiary Phosphines in Different Solvents. For reactions of the octachlorodirhenium anion, [Re(2)Cl(8)](2)(-), with tertiary phosphines PEt(3) and PPr(n)(3), the influence of solvent on the reaction pathway has been studied. It has been shown that in 1-propanol at room temperature the reaction leads to a one-electron reduction of the Re(2)(6+) core. The novel dirhenium(II,III) paramagnetic products of stoichiometries [Bu(n)(4)N][Re(2)Cl(6)(PEt(3))(2)] (1a) and Re(2)Cl(5)(PPr(n)(3))(3) (2a) have been isolated and characterized. In benzene a disproportionation process occurs resulting in mononuclear rhenium(IV) complexes ReCl(4)(PR(3))(2) (PR(3) = PEt(3) (1b) and PPr(n)(3) (2b)) in addition to 1a and 2a, respectively. The solid state structures of compounds 1a, 1b, 2a.0.25C(6)H(14), and 2b have been investigated by X-ray crystallography. The crystallographic parameters are as follows: for 1a, tetragonal space group P4(2)/m with a = 11.821(2) Å, c = 14.770(3) Å, and Z = 2 for 1b, monoclinic space group P2(1)/n with a = 8.0555(4) Å, b = 12.536(2) Å, c = 10.2041(6) Å, beta = 99.167(9) degrees, and Z = 2
