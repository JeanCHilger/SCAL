Could the hypofrontality pattern in schizophrenia be modified through neuropsychological rehabilitation? The effects of neuropsychological treatment on cognitive hypofrontality were examined in schizophrenic patients through the score activation.Eight subjects (six men and two women) with persistent negative symptoms and cognitive impairments were evaluated with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) procedures and neuropsychological battery before and after a neuropsychological treatment group.After treatment an enhancement in neuropsychological performance was found, especially in executive functions. The activation score showed an increase over baseline levels and no cognitive-dependent hypofrontality after treatment was found. Although the prefrontal blood flow changes were small and non-specific, they suggest a reduction of the cognitive hypofrontality after neuropsychological treatment.Cognitive improvements after neuropsychological treatment would possibly be related with the diminution of the functional hypoactivity in the prefrontal areas.
