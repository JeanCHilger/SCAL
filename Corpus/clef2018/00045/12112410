Mu-receptor agonism with alfentanil increases striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding in man. Animal studies indicate that mu-opioids indirectly modulate neurotransmission in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. We used positron emission tomography (PET) to study the effects of alfentanil (a mu-opioid receptor agonist) on striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding in eight healthy male volunteers. D2 receptor binding was determined by using [(11)C]raclopride as radioligand. Each subject underwent two PET sessions on the same day, the first without the drug (control) and the second during alfentanil infusion. Alfentanil was administered as target-controlled infusion to maintain pseudo steady-state plasma concentration of 80 ng/ml throughout the PET session. A freeze lesion model was used for pain testing at the end of both PET sessions. A mechanical pain stimulus of 5 N was rated by the subjects using a visual analog scale. Regions of interest for the putamen, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum were drawn on MRI images and transferred to PET images. Alfentanil increased the binding potential of [(11)C]raclopride in the putamen by 6.0% (P = 0.04) and in the caudate nucleus by 7.4% (P = 0.008). Alfentanil caused a small reduction in respiratory rate (P = 0.046) and oxygen saturation (P < 0.001), and a moderate consistent increase in end-tidal CO(2) (P < 0.001). Pain scores were significantly smaller after alfentanil PET scan (median VAS 9 (0-42) vs. 23.5 (15-52), P = 0.008). These results indicate that pharmacologically relevant concentrations of alfentanil increase D2 dopamine receptor binding in the striatum in man. This increase is assumed to reflect reduced dopamine release.
