Dynamic evaluation of absorbed dose to the bladder wall with a balloon-bladder phantom during a study using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission imaging. An accurate evaluation of the absorbed dose to the bladder wall from 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) is clinically important because the bladder is considered as a critical organ in most positron emission tomography (PET) studies that cumulate about 20% of the total activity injection during image procedures. In the MIRD calculation, no allowance is made for the inclusion of all the dynamic parameters that affect the actual dose to the bladder wall to be taken in the dose assessment. The goal of the study is to propose a dose evaluation model by using a dynamic bladder phantom and time-activity curves from the bladder PET imaging. The proposed model takes all dynamic parameters into account and provides a much more accurate dose estimation to the bladder. In this study, the lowest dose to the bladder wall was obtained at the conditions of having a larger initial volume for the bladder contents and a higher production rate for urine. It is then advised patients to drink a bulk amount of water before the FDG injection or after urine voiding to facilitate urine production and to enlarge the bladder surface area, which are the most crucial steps in reducing the dose to the bladder wall. In our study, the voiding schedule in dose calculation plays certain roles although it is much more critical in the conventional MIRD calculation. The model estimated that the lowest dose to the bladder would occur at an initial void about 40 min after the FDG injection and the urine voiding was as complete as possible.
