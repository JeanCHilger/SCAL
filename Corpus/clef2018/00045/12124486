Clinical implications of cardiac (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy and cardiac natriuretic peptides in patients with heart disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether or not cardiac sympathetic nerve activity, using (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) imaging, and cardiac natriuretic peptides (atrial and brain, ANP and BNP) were independent predictors of cardiac events, and, if so, which was the stronger predictor. Planar (123)I-MIBG images were obtained from 62 patients with heart disease. Plasma ANP and BNP levels, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiography, serum total cholesterol and triglyceride were measured. (123)I-MIBG was assessed as the heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratio of the delayed image and the washout rate (WoR) from the early to the delayed image. Patients were followed up for an average of 16.2 months, and 12 of 62 patients had cardiac events. Patients with events had significantly lower LVEF and H/M ratio compared with those without events. They had significantly higher WoR, ANP and BNP. By multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, (123)I-MIBG (H/M or WoR), ANP and BNP were independent predictors for cardiac events. Event-free survival using a Kaplan-Meier model, with a threshold value of 2.0 for H/M and 45% for WoR, showed that patients with H/M<2.0 and/or WoR>45% had a significantly poorer prognosis. These results suggest that (123)I-MIBG imaging and cardiac natriuretic peptides are useful tools for the evaluation of patients with heart disease, and that cardiac sympathetic nerve activity is a stronger predictor of cardiac events.
