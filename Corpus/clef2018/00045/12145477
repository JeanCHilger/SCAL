Effect of elevated homocysteine levels on clinical restenosis following percutaneous coronary intervention. Since hyperhomocysteinemia confers a prothrombotic effect and promotes proliferation of smooth muscle cells in response to vascular injury, it might be implicated in the pathogenesis of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Our study comprised 55 patients who underwent successful PCI in the acute myocardial infarction (AMI) course. Homocysteine levels were determined within 24 h of admission. During a 1-year follow-up, 16 patients (31%) underwent repeated coronary angiography for recurrent angina or re-infarction, which demonstrated re-narrowing of > or =50% at the qualifying PCI site (clinical restenosis). Irrespective of stent deployment, clinical restenosis was not associated with higher homocysteine levels (12 +/- 7 vs. 14 +/- 11 micromol/l, p = 0.77). There was no correlation between homocysteine levels and time to restenosis (r(2) = 0.06, p = 0.35). In conclusion, elevated homocysteine levels do not predict a higher incidence of restenosis after PCI.
