New concepts in the clinical aspects of cardiovascular disease. Many patients with HIV infection, as well as those without this disease, may have coronary heart disease (CHD) or be at high risk for this condition. The high prevalence of and risk of CHD among patients with HIV infection are generally caused by traditional risk factors that can be readily managed with currently available therapies. New tools are also available for functional imaging and establishing diagnoses and prognoses in patients who do experience coronary events. Management of these persons requires careful attention to patient characteristics that may influence therapeutic outcomes.
