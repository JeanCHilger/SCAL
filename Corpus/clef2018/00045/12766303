Monte Carlo simulation for PET scanners and shields. A Monte Carlo simulation code was developed for simulating PET scanners with the Monte Carlo program package GEANT. The present simulation code can handle not only conventional types of PET scanners, but also any complex detector systems with arbitrary geometrical configuration. All the relevant interactions of photons and electrons are taken into account in all the defined objects while optical tracking in the scintillation crystals is approximated by simple analytical simulation. In addition to basic PET scanner performance factors, such as sensitivity and scatter fraction, valuable but un-measurable information, such as photon trajectories and interaction position distribution, can be obtained and represented graphically in various ways. This simulation code has proved useful in analyzing the physics characteristics of existing commercial PET scanners and related shields, and in design studies of new PET scanners.
