The neurobiology of developmental dyslexia: a survey. One of the most common disorders affecting the ability to read is developmental dyslexia, which, unlike the alexia related to a loss of the capacity to read associated with brain damage, refers to a specific disorder in the acquisition of reading skills and becomes apparent in reiterated persistent difficulties in learning to read. A number of studies have attempted to detect structural and functional abnormalities that might be the origin of problems in learning to read. The use of functional neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET), spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (SMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables us to measure changes in the metabolic activity associated with alterations in the neuronal networks involved in the reading process. In this review, different studies are analysed in an attempt to identify alterations in the cortico subcortical regions which could be the origin of the developmental dyslexia. Results show that in dyslexics there is a temporoparietooccipital disconnection, and a disconnection with the left frontal cortex as regards the demands for fast auditory processing, as well as abnormalities in the connections between the temporoparietal cortex and the cerebellum with other regions of the brain. Such findings suggest that the altered areas of the brain do not only show a characteristic pattern of hypoactivation, but also that these alterations could be the cause of this malady. We highlight the importance of these findings in the diagnosis and rehabilitation of this population.
