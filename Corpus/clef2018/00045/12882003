A vector with the downstream box of the initiation codon can highly enhance protein expression in Escherichia coli. An expression vector, pET-DB, with a perfectly matching downstream box of the initiation codon has been constructed on the basis of the pET system. Any gene of interest can then be inserted into the vector. Four genes were used to test the expression efficiency of the vector. The results show that the vector pET-DB can further increase protein expression level at least up to 35-70% as compared with the initial T7 expression system, indicating that the downstream box can enhance protein expression in Escherichia coli.
