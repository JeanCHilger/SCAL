Positron emission tomographic studies of central cholinergic nerve terminals. The aim of this study was to develop a quantitative method for the study of cholinergic nerve terminals in vivo. An 18F-labeled analogue of vesamicol ([18F]FMV) that binds with high affinity to synaptic vesicles from Torpedo electric organ was synthesized and evaluated in vivo in rats and monkeys by positron emission tomography (PET). In rats, the tracer was rapidly cleared from the blood and highly extracted into the brain, where it was specifically and irreversibly bound. In monkeys, a specific binding of the tracer was observed in brain regions known to contain cholinergic nerve terminals. Preinjection of non-labeled vesamicol prevented the cerebral binding of [18F]FMV to a high affinity site in both species. Our results are a major step towards quantitative human in vivo studies of presynaptic cholinergic functions.
