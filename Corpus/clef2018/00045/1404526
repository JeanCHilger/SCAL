Intravenous dipyridamole technetium-99m MMI myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for detection of coronary artery disease. To evaluate the efficacy of stress technetium-99m MMI (N-2-methoxy-2-methyl propyl isonitrile) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (Tc-99m MMI) using intravenous dipyridamole for detection of coronary artery disease (CAD), we collected 66 cases (53 men, 13 women, aged 40-79 years old) between Sept. 1990 and Oct. 1991. The cases were divided into two groups: group I involving 44 patients received coronary arteriography (CAG) examination without previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) group II embracing 22 patients received no CAG examination but all were suffering from old myocardial infarction (MI) evidenced by history and electrocardiography (ECG). All cases underwent Tc-99m MMI planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) both on intravenous dipyridamole stress and separate day rest tests. Of the 44 group I patients receiving both Tc-99m MMI and CAG, 35 (79.5%) were positive and 7 (16%) were negative by both tests and another 2 (4.5%) were positive by CAG only. Of those positive by both tests, 21 (60%) suffered from identical coronary arterial involvement, including 13 one-vessel disease, 5 double-vessel disease and 3 triple-vessel disease. Of group II patients, 14 suffered from old inferior wall (IW) MI, 6 from old anterior or anteroseptal wall (AW) MI, 1 from old lateral wall (LW) MI and another 1 from combined old anterior and lateral wall (ALW) MI by ECG. Of the 14 patients with IWMI by ECG, all suffered from right coronary artery (RCA) disease but 7 (50%) of them from multivessel disease (MVD) by Tc-99m MMI. 5 of the 6 patients with AWMI by ECG suffered from left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) disease, but 3 of them from MVD by Tc-99m MMI. Both patients with LWMI and ALWMI by ECG suffered from triple-vessel disease by Tc-99m MMI. The sensitivity of Tc-99m MMI in detecting CAD in group I was 95%, the specificity was 100%. The sensitivity for detection of individual coronary artery disease in LAD, left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) and RCA was 96%, 45% and 89% in this order and the respective specificity was 94%, 100% and 88%. In group II the sensitivity was 95%. The overall sensitivity of intravenous dipyridamole Tc-99m MMI for detection of CAD in groups I and II was 95%
