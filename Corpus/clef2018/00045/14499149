Using positron emission tomography 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose, 11CO, and 15O-water for monitoring androgen independent prostate cancer. Monitoring of androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC) therapy involves monitoring prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood serum concentrations however, the reliability of small changes in PSA values has been questioned. We performed a small pilot study to determine whether PET might be a useful monitor of changes during anti-angiogenic therapy in AIPC.Changes in tumor blood flow ([15O] water), blood volume ([11C]CO), 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) uptake and metabolic volume were measured before and during thalidomide treatment and compared with changes in PSA in six patients with AIPC.The percent change in PSA correlated with the FDG Delta%SUV(mean) (r=0.94, P<0.01) and Delta%metabolic tumor volume (r=0.91, P<0.01) but less well with Delta%blood volume (r=0.65, P=0.14). Percent change blood flow values showed an inverse correlation with percent changes in PSA (r=-0.83, P=0.032).PET measures of tumor blood flow and metabolism may have use in monitoring the physiologic changes occurring during anti-angiogenic therapy in AIPC.
