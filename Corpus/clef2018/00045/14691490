A polar expedition in challenging circumstances--experiences and psychological reactions. Four men, in the company of 16 dogs, skied for five weeks from GÃ¥sefjord to Ellef Ringnes Land, North Canada. The expedition met with considerable unforeseen challenges such as extreme and prolonged cold, unmotivated Greenland dogs, and much pack ice. Psychological reactions were described and measured by a qualitative free text analysis and a test battery including GHQ-30 (General Health Questionnaire) and STAI State (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) before, during, and after the expedition. Five main themes were found: external influences, relations between men and animals, progress and expectations, interpersonal relations, and thoughts at the end of the expedition. Negative emotional reactions were mostly present at the beginning of the expedition and were related to the environment and the pressure of perceived expectations from the outside world. Frustrations were enhanced by forced inactivity. Perceived essential positive elements were a strong group identity and friendship. The acceptance of dissension was low the group strived to achieve consensus before decisions were made. The psychometric results showed more stress and anxiety immediately before the expedition than after. These parameters also increased significantly at the beginning of the expedition, then there was a reverse. The level of anxiety was higher in the two leaders. The expedition was concluded in an overall atmosphere of mutual affection, satisfaction, and pride.
