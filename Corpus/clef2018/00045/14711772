State-of-the-art imaging of pancreatic neoplasms. Pancreatic imaging with multidetector CT allows multiphase acquisition of thin slices in a single breath-hold and is especially valuable in obtaining isotropic three-dimensional reformations that improves our ability to provide accurate pre-operative vascular mapping. Advanced MR technology allows faster imaging of pancreas, thus facilitating MR cholangiopancreatography. Use of tissue-specific MR contrast agents, endoscopic ultrasound and PET in pancreatic imaging has evolved considerably. This review article discusses the role of CT, MR, endoscopic ultrasound and PET imaging in pancreas.
