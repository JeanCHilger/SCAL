ILAE Commission Report. Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis. Experts discussed the definition, natural history, pathologic features, pathogenesis, electroclinical, neurophysiological, neuropsychological, structural and functional imaging findings, as well as surgical outcome in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS). After a long-lasting consensus process the ILAE Commission Neurosurgery of epilepsy accepted the resulting conclusions as state-of-the art report on MTLE-HS. The majority of contributors considered MTLE-HS to represent a sufficient cluster of signs and symptoms to make up a syndromic diagnostic entity.
