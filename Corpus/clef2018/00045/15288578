Endothelin ETB receptors inhibit articular nociception and priming induced by carrageenan in the rat knee-joint. The participation of the endothelin system on nociception and priming induced by carrageenan in the knee-joint was investigated. Intra-articular (i.a.) carrageenan (300 microg) caused long-lasting nociceptive effects (i.e., increases in paw elevation time [PET]), which were potentiated by endothelin-1 (dual endothelin ETA/ETB receptor agonist) and inhibited by sarafotoxin S6c (endothelin ETB receptor agonist both at 30 pmol, i.a., 24 h beforehand). Priming the naive joint with carrageenan augmented nociceptive responses to a second carrageenan challenge, 72 h later. Carrageenan-induced priming, but not nociception, was potentiated by local BQ-788 (10 nmol, i.a., 15 min before priming
