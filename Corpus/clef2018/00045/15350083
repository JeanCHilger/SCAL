Simultaneous tailoring of surface topography and chemical structure for controlled wettability. Wettability was controlled in a rational manner by individually and simultaneously manipulating surface topography and surface chemical structure. The first stage of this research involved the adsorption of charged submicrometer polystyrene latex particles to oppositely charged poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film samples to form surfaces with different topographies/roughness adsorption time, solution pH, solution ionic strength, latex particle size, and substrate charge density are external variables that were controlled. The introduction of discrete functional groups to smooth and rough surfaces through organic transformations was carried out in the second stage. Amine groups (-NH(2)) and alcohol groups (-OH) were introduced onto smooth PET surfaces by amidation with poly(allylamine) and adsorption with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH), respectively. On latex particle adsorbed surfaces, a thin layer of gold was evaporated first to prevent particle redistribution before chemical transformation. Reactions with functionalized thiols and adsorption with PVOH on patterned gold surfaces successfully enhanced surface hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity. Particle size and biomodal particle size distribution affect both hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity. A very hydrophobic surface exhibiting water contact angles of 150 degrees /126 degrees (theta(A)/theta(R)) prepared by adsorption of 1-octadecanethiol and a hydrophilic surface with water contact angles of 18 degrees /8 degrees (theta(A)/theta(R)) prepared by adsorption of PVOH were prepared on gold-coated surfaces containing both 0.35 and 0.1 microm latex particles. The combination of surface topography and surface-chemical functionality permits wettability control over a wide range.
