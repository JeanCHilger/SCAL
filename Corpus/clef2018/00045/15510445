PET scanning explained. A fixed PET scan unit can be placed into an existing diagnostic or treatment space with a certain amount of renovation or an addition may be built to house the PET scanner as well as required support spaces. Approximately 2,000 ft2 is needed to house a full PET scan operation although this can change substantially depending upon individual circumstances. Typically included are the PET scan room that resembles a CT scan facility, a hot lab (if not shared), equipment control room, patient waiting, patient prep area, and a patient toilet. Some spaces may need to be lead-lined, depending on uses of adjacent space. Patient throughput' ranges from 45 minutes to one hour and 15 minutes to complete a scan, depending on equipment.
