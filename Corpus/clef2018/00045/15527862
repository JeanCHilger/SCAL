Advances in in vivo imaging of serotonergic neurons in neuropsychiatric disorders. Alterations of central serotonergic neurotransmission, particularly changes in the presynaptically located serotonin transporter (SERT) availability, are thought to be one of the major pathomechanisms of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Modern neuroimaging techniques such as single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography employ radiolabeled tracers, which bind to SERT, and thus, allow detection of cerebral SERT availability in vivo. We review SERT imaging studies in patients with depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and patients with neurological diseases. We furthermore elucidate the potential of SERT imaging techniques in estimating the effect of selective serotonin reuptake-inhibitors.
