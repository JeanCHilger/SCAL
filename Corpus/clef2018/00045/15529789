Evaluation of brain tumors by simultaneous dual isotope SPECT with 201Tl-chloride and 99mTc-MIBI. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is useful for detecting brain tumors. In this study, we evaluated the utility of simultaneous dual SPECT with 201Tl-Chloride (Tl) and 99mTc-MIBI (MIBI) for diagnosis of brain tumors. We evaluated 20 cases, including 2 glioblastomas, 7 anaplastic astrocytomas, 2 oligodendrogliomas, 2 anaplastic ependymomas, 2 medulloblastomas, 2 meningiomas, 1 malignant meningioma, 1 pituitary adenoma, and 1 craniopharyngioma. We analyzed the uptake ratio (T/N ratio) of tracers in both Tl and MIBI at max counts/pixels ratio in the region of interest. The T/N ratios in early and delayed images were described as early ratios (ER) and delay ratios (DR), respectively. The retention index (RI) was calculated as the DR/ER ratio. Significant correlations were found between ER and DR for both Tl (DR = 0.797 * ER + 0.359, r = 0.871), and MIBI (DR = 0.961 * ER - 0.191, r = 0.784). Next, we analyzed the correlations between Tl and MIBI SPECT, for ER, DR, and RI. ER values for the two were strongly correlated (r = 0.791), DR values were weakly correlated (r = 0.556), and RI exhibited no correlation between them (r = 0.328). There were no correlations between tumor volume and T/N ratio for the two (ER-Tl r = 0.0095, DR-TI
