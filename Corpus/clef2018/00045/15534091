Correlation of molecular genetics with molecular and morphological imaging in gliomas with an oligodendroglial component. Since the recognition that oligodendrogliomas may be chemosensitive, their diagnosis and clinical management has become highly controversial. Histopathology diagnosis remains challenging and new tools such as molecular genetics or molecular imaging require evaluation.In a single-center, population-based prospective study, allelic imbalance in chromosomes 1p36, 19q13, 17p13, 10p12-15, and 10q22-26 has been investigated in 19 oligodendroglioma WHO grade 2 (OII), 20 oligoastrocytoma WHO grade 2 (OAII), 8 oligodendroglioma WHO grade 3 (OIII), and 12 oligoastrocytoma WHO grade 3 (OAIII), and compared with pretherapy histopathology, computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance (CT and/or MR), [fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG), and thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (201Tl SPECT).In 50 cases, 18F-FDG uptake correlated with 201Tl uptake however, 8 cases had increased 201Tl uptake but were hypometabolic for 18F-FDG, and 1 case was hypermetabolic with normal 201Tl uptake. Sixteen cases enhanced on CT/MR but failed to show 201Tl uptakeIn this study, dissociation of uptake of contrast agents and radiotracers suggests independent deregulation of the blood-brain barrier breakdown and metabolism during disease progression of oligodendroglial neoplasms, and the association of elevated metabolism with 1p/19q loss, particularly in low-grade tumors, may have implications for clinical management.
