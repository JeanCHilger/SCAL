Scintigraphic evaluation of the peak systolic pressure-end-systolic volume relation: comparison with invasive left ventricular contractile indexes. We calculated the slope of peak systolic pressure-end-systolic volume relation (P/V slope) and the ratio of peak systolic pressure to end-systolic volume (P/V ratio) using radionuclide ventriculography and indirect sphygmomanometry to evaluate left ventricular contractility, and to assess the usefulness of these indexes, we compared them with mean VCF, LVEF, ESVI and ESS/ESVI using cardiac catheterization. Subjects were 12 patients who had received both radionuclide ventriculography and cardiac catheterization within a two weeks period. Left ventricular end-systolic volume and peak blood pressure were measured at 3 different points, one in the control state and the other two at two different hemodynamic states during infusion of Methoxamine. We defined P/V slope as the slope of the regression line of peak systolic pressure-end-systolic volume relation, and P/V ratio as the ratio of peak systolic pressure to left ventricular end-systolic volume at control. Left ventricular volume was measured by the non-gated-SPECT method and changes of the left ventricular volume was measured by the multigate method. P/V slope was correlated exponentially with mean VCF, LVEF and ESVI (y = 0.34.e1.9x, r = 0.86, p less than 0.001 for mean VCF y = 0.25.e0.041x, r = 0.83, p less than 0.001 for LVEF
