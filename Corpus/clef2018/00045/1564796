Quantification of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurement with one point sampling by 123I-IMP SPECT. A handy method of quantifying regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurement by 123I-IMP SPECT was designed. A standard input function was made and the sampling time to calibrate this standard input function by one point sampling was optimized. An average standard input function was obtained from continuous arterial samplings of 12 healthy adults. The best sampling time was the minimum differential value between the integral calculus value of the standard input function calibrated by one point sampling and the input function by continuous arterial samplings. This time was 8 minutes after an intravenous injection of 123I-IMP and an error was estimated to be +/- 4.1%. The rCBF values by this method were evaluated by comparing them with the rCBF values of the input function with continuous arterial samplings in 2 healthy adults and a patient with cerebral infarction. A significant correlation (r = 0.764 (p less than 0.001)) was obtained between both.
