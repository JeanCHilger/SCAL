Cardiac functional analysis with multi-detector row CT and segmental reconstruction algorithm: comparison with echocardiography, SPECT, and MR imaging. To evaluate accuracy of cardiac functional analysis with multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) and segmental reconstruction algorithm over a range of heart rates.Institutional review board approval was obtained. Informed consent was not required. Multi-detector row CT (500-msec rotation time, 8 x 1-mm detector collimation) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were performed in 50 patients (28 men, 22 women age range, 46-84 yearsEF estimated with multi-detector row CT agreed and correlated well with EF estimated with MR imaging (bias +/- standard deviation, -1.2% +/- 4.6 r = 0.96). Agreement and correlation were similar for EDV (-0.35 mL +/- 15.2Various LV functional parameters were measured with multi-detector row CT with a segmental approach, and measurements correlated and agreed with those obtained with MR imaging. Moreover, functional analysis with multi-detector row CT was more accurate than that with two-dimensional echocardiography or ECG-gated SPECT.
