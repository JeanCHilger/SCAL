Improved test for the migration of antimony and germanium from polyethylene terephthalate. A simple and rapid test has been developed to quantitatively measure the migration of antimony (Sb) and germanium (Ge) from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) products. The PET product was soaked in 4% acetic acid (2 mL/cm2) for 30 min at 60 degrees C and 95 degrees C. The test solution was analyzed by ICP-MS. Recoveries of spiked Sb (0.025 microg/mL) and Ge (0.05 microg/mL) were 101% and 100%, respectively, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 2.3% and 1.7%. In ten successive analyses, Sb and Ge in the 4% acetic acid solution were analyzed with RSDs of 1.7% and 2.2%. Sb and Ge were not subject to interference from other elements simultaneously present in the 4% acetic acid solution. This method is simple, rapid and safe, requiring no pretreatment or use of the hazardous solvent carbon tetrachloride. Therefore, this test is a useful method to analyze Sb and Ge migration from PET products.
