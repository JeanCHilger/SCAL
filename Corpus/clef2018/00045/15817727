Cardiac structure and function in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for physical fitness. Cross-sectional studies in athletes and untrained subjects suggest that exercise training induces adaptations in cardiac structure and function. However, the role of genetic variation on the results has largely been ignored in these studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of long-term volitionally increased physical activity on electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters in male monozygotic twin pairs discordant for physical activity and fitness. On the basis of the mailed questionnaires, a telephone interview, and the inclusion criteria, 12 pairs of young adult male monozygotic twins were recruited from a Finnish twin cohort. All subjects completed a maximal oxygen uptake (.VO2 (max)) test and electrocardiography and echocardiography studies. Nine pairs had at least 9% difference in .VO2(max) and were selected for further analysis and for a second echocardiography study. Twins were divided into the more (MAG) and less active group (LAG), according to their VO2(max). On average, MAG had 18% higher VO2(max) compared with LAG. In electrocardiography, MAG had 29% (P = 0.02) higher Cornell voltage and 37% (P = 0.01) higher right-side hypertrophy index. In echocardiography, no significant differences were observed between the groups, and left ventricular mass index was only 7% (P = 0.16) higher in MAG. These results show that the volitionally increased physical activity that has led to an 18% increase in cardiorespiratory fitness induces greater changes in electro- than echocardiographic parameters. Electrocardiographic changes were suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy, and echocardiography showed a similar but statistically nonsignificant trend.
