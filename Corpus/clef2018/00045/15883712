Imaging of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Paragangliomas are tumours that arise within the sympathetic nervous system originating from the neural crest. These tumours can be found anywhere from the neck to the pelvis in locations of sympathetic ganglions. Although in the majority of paragangliomas the diagnosis is based on measuring catecholamines and metabolites in plasma or urine, imaging plays an important preoperative role. Today, there are several morphological and radionuclide imaging methods available that predict tumour localisation and tumour extent and give anatomic information to the surgeon. MRI is the morphological imaging modality of choice in localising pheochromocytomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas. It provides excellent anatomic detail and has the advantage of lacking ionising radiation. The overall accuracy of computed tomography (CT) in detecting primary adrenal pheochromocytomas is very high, but CT lacks in specificity as difficulties may occur in distinguishing between paragangliomas and other tumour entities. The major advantages of radionuclide imaging are very high specificity and routinely performed whole-body scanning. Furthermore, metabolic imaging is not influenced by artifacts like scar tissue or metallic clips in post-surgical follow-up. Currently, a reported specificity of 99% and a cumulative sensitivity of about 90% in paragangliomas make (123)I-MIBG the most important nuclear imaging method. However, (18)F-DOPA-PET seems to be a very promising procedure which offers higher accuracy. The higher spatial resolution of PET-scanners enables the detection of small lesions not visualised with (123)I-MIBG. Both use of radiolabelled somatostatin analogue like (111)In-pentetreotide and (18)F-FDG is limited due to low specificity of the tracers and should be restricted to MIBG- and F-DOPA-negative cases.
