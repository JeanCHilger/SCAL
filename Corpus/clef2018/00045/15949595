Metabolic (FDG-PET) response after radical radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer correlates with patterns of failure. We previously reported that F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) response correlated strongly with survival after radical radiotherapy (RT)/chemoradiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PET-response, survival and patterns of failure data are presented with long-term follow-up.Pre- and post-treatment FDG-PET scans were performed for 88 patients after concurrent platinum-based radical chemo/RT (n = 73) or radical RT alone (n = 15). PET responses were prospectively assessed as either complete metabolic response (CMR), partial metabolic response (PMR), stable metabolic disease (SMD), or progressive metabolic disease (PMD).RT was 60 Gy in 30 fractions in 6 weeks. Follow-up PET was performed at a median of 70 days after treatment. PET responses were: CMR, n = 40 (45%) PMR, n = 32 (36%)Attainment of CMR after radical RT/chemoRT for NSCLC bestows superior freedom from local and distant relapse late local relapse is common.
