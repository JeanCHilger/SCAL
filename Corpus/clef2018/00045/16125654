A method to quantify at late imaging a release rate of 18F-FDG in tissues. This theoretical work shows that the rate constant for the (18)F-FDG release in tissues can be assessed without needing any arterial blood sampling. The method requires that the clearance of (18)F-FDG from plasma has occurred, whereas (18)F-FDG is still present in the tissue. This condition can be met dating from 3 h after (18)F-FDG injection, when hydration and/or phlorizin injection are applied after the routine static acquisition. The release rate constant can be obtained from a graphical analysis performed at the later decreasing phase of the tissue tracer activity. A two-compartment and a three-compartment model are developed, both in accordance with one another. To cite this article: E. Laffon et al., C. R. Biologies 328 (2005).
