The association between the Lie scale of the Maudsley personality inventory and striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability of healthy Chinese community subjects. The present study examined the relationship between the Lie scale scores and striatal D(2)/D(3) receptor availability with respect to the cerebellum in 42 healthy community volunteers in Taiwan using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [(123)I]iodo-benzoaminde (IBZM). Even after controlling of age and educational level, subjects' Lie scale scores of the Maudsley personality inventory correlate negatively with D(2)/D(3) receptor availability. Individual with higher Lie scale scores may have higher impulsivity due to lower dopaminergic availability.
