Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the diagnosis of depressive disorders, neurotic and eating disorders. The aim of the study was to estimate usefulness of the single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the diagnostics of the depressive disorders, neurotic and eating disorders, and detect the organic factors and correlation between cerebral hypoperfusion and results of Benton's and Bender's tests.Study of 43 patients (33 women and 10 men) aged 16--59 years (SD+38, 65 +/- 11, 62) which were examined with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and Benton's and Bender's tests during their treatment in the 1st Department of Psychiatry, Medical University in Gda≈Ñsk in the years 2000 to 2003. 30 patients were diagnosed with depression (first depressive episodes--8, recurrent depressive disorders--9, organic depression--13), 8--neurotic disorders and 5--eating disorders.SPECT in 38 (88,37%) cases showed hypoperfusion mostly on the left side and in the frontal region. Hypoperfusion in the recurrent depressive disorders was considerably greater (nearly significant) in comparison with the first depressive episodes. The correlation between hypoperfusion and CNS impairment examined with Benton's and Bender's tests was observed. The correlation coefficient of was 0.6845.
