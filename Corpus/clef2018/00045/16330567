Comparison of changes in tumor metabolic activity and tumor size during chemotherapy of adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction. We evaluated the temporal relationship between chemotherapy-induced changes in tumor glucose use and tumor size.Twenty patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) were studied by 18F-FDG PET and CT scans before neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 14 d after the initiation of therapy, and 4 wk after the completion of therapy.The relative change in 18F-FDG uptake was more than 2 times larger than the decrease in tumor size at all time points (P<0.01). At 14 d after the initiation of chemotherapy, there was no correlation between the reduction in 18F-FDG uptake and tumor wall thickness. The change in 18F-FDG uptake after 14 d of therapy was significantly correlated with the reduction in tumor size after the completion of therapy.In AEG, changes in tumor metabolism are a more sensitive parameter for assessing the effects of chemotherapy than are changes in tumor size. Early changes in metabolic activity predict the subsequent reduction in tumor size.
