Feline hemoplasmas in Switzerland: identification of a novel species, diagnosis, prevalence, and clinical importance. Two feline hemotropic mycoplasma spp. (aka hemoplasma) have previously been recognized. We recently discovered a third novel species in a cat with hemolytic anemia, designated 'Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis', which is closely related to rodent haemoplasmas. This novel species induced anemia after experimental transmission to two SPF cats. Three quantitative real-time PCR assays were newly designed and applied to an epidemiological study surveying the Swiss pet cat population. Blood samples from 713 healthy and ill cats were analyzed. Up to 104 parameters per cat (detailed questionnaire, case history, laboratory parameters and retroviral infections) were evaluated. 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' infection was more prevalent (8.5%) than Mycoplasma haemofelis (0.5%) and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis' (1%). Hemoplasma infections were associated with male gender, outdoor access, and old age, but not with disease or anemia. Infections were more frequently found in the South and West of Switzerland. Several hemoplasma infected cats, some acutely infected, others co-infected with FIV or FeLV, showed hemolytic anemia indicating that additional factors might play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.
