Unexpected focal hypermetabolic activity in the breast: significance in patients undergoing 18F-FDG PET/CT. We describe the significance of detecting focal areas of hypermetabolism in the breast in patients undergoing PET/CT for reasons other than for breast cancer detection or staging.When evaluated, almost all of the abnormal foci detected in the breast subsequently proved to be breast carcinoma, specifically infiltrating ductal carcinoma.
