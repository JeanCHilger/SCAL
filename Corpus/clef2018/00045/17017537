Transcranial sonography in the early and differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. In recent years transcranial sonography (TCS) has become a widely used method for the visualization of the brain parenchyma through the intact scull. Using TCS, our group discovered changes of the echotexture--namely increased echogenicity--at the substantia nigra (SN) in about 90% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). These results assessed with an interrater reproducibility of r = 0.8 in several studies have been confirmed by several other groups. In contrast increased SN echogenicity is rarely found in patients with atypical or symptomatic Parkinsonian syndromes, providing a valuable tool for differential diagnosis. Interestingly, increased SN echogenicity can also be found in about 8 to 10% of healthy subjects. In PET analyses more than 60% of these clinically healthy individuals show a subclinical reduction of the striatal 18F-Dopa uptake indicating an alteration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system and nigral cell loss. Furthermore, it was possible to demonstrate that this ultrasound finding has a functional impact as subjects with an increased echogenicity of the SN (i) showed more frequently clinical symptoms of asymmetric hypokinesia with increasing age and (ii) developed more often and more severe Parkinsonian side effects when treated with neuroleptic therapy for neuropsychiatric disorders. Longitudinal studies indicate that the ultrasound signal does not change in the course of the disease. Moreover, presymptomatic carriers of mutations causative for monogenetic PD display the same echofeature as their relatives already affected by the disease. These findings indicate that increased SN echogenicity constitutes a biomarker for vulnerability of the nigrostriatal system in healthy subjects and eventually PD in a subgroup of persons with additional risk factors.
