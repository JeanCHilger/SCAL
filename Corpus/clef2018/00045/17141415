Seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in stray cats and dogs in the Bangkok metropolitan area, Thailand. Cats and dogs are the most popular pet animals worldwide. Cats are the natural reservoir of Toxoplasma gondii and excrete the resistant oocyst to environments. On the other hands, dogs play a role in the mechanical transmission of the parasite. Stray cats and dogs in the Bangkok metropolitan area are becoming a public concern because there is a considerable increase in their number annually. These facts indicate the risk of mechanically spreading zoonoses including toxoplasmosis to humans since human acquire the infection from infected mammals, either directly or indirectly. In the present study, the presence of T. gondii antibodies was examined in 592 cats and 427 dogs from October 2001 to September 2002 by using a latex agglutination test. T. gondii antibodies were detected in 65 (11.0%) of the 592 cats and 40 (9.4%) of the 427 dogs. The antibody titers in the positive animals ranged from 1:64 to 1:2048. Seroprevalence was significantly higher in female cats than in male cats. The present study suggested that T. gondii was widespread in the stray animals in the Bangkok metropolitan area therefore, it is essential to control the number of stray cats and dogs in order to reduce the transmission of toxoplasmosis to animals and humans.
