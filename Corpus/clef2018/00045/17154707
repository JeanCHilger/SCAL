Interhemispheric asymmetry in brain perfusion before and after carotid stenting: a 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT study. To assess the effect of unilateral carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) on cerebral perfusion asymmetry in patients with severe extracranial carotid stenosis by means of technetium Tc 99m hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime brain single photon emission computed tomography ((99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT).Twenty-nine consecutive patients (22 men median age 68 years, range 58-80The preoperative AI demonstrated a wide variation (mean -0.5%+/-8.4%, range -19.5% to 14.1%). There was no significant correlation between the degree of carotid stenosis and preoperative AI. The mean preoperative AI in the asymptomatic patients was lower than in the symptomatic group [-4.0%+/-8.5% (range -19.5% to 8.2%) versus 3.8%+/-6.4% (range -5.2% to 14.1%), p=0.01], suggesting reduced perfusion of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere compared to the contralateral side in symptomatic patients. AI variation did not improve after CAS there was no difference in AI among the 3 SPECT studies (p=0.75). Preoperative AI correlated significantly with late AI (r=0.74, p<0.0001)Asymmetry in cerebral perfusion in patients with severe extracranial carotid atherosclerosis does not correlate with the degree of carotid stenosis. Symptomatic patients demonstrate compromised perfusion of the ipsilateral hemisphere compared to asymptomatic patients. As judged by (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT scanning, cerebral perfusion patterns do not significantly change after CAS.
