Development of NEMA-based software for gamma camera quality control. We have developed a cross-platform software application that implements all of the basic standardized nuclear medicine scintillation camera quality control analyses, thus serving as an independent complement to camera manufacturers' software. Our application allows direct comparison of data and statistics from different cameras through its ability to uniformly analyze a range of file types. The program has been tested using multiple gamma cameras, and its results agree with comparable analysis by the manufacturers' software.
