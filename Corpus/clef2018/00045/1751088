In vivo results of hydrogel composite pericardial substitutes. In this study, two improved pericardial patches were developed and evaluated for their efficacy as pericardial substitutes. The patches are composites consisting of a hydrogel (PHEMA) that coats an underlying mesh (either ETFE or PET). Studies were conducted using subcutaneous implants in rats and pericardial patch implants in greyhound dogs. Adhesions between the substitute and pericardium and the epicardium were minimal. The ETFE composite patch caused an unacceptable epicardial reaction. The PET patch results were encouraging the epicardium was largely unaffected by the patch.
