A polyepitope DNA vaccine targeted to Her-2/ErbB-2 elicits a broad range of human and murine CTL effectors to protect against tumor challenge. A cDNA vaccine (pVax1/pet-neu) was designed to encode 12 different Her-2/ErbB-2-derived, HLA-A*0201-restricted dominant and high-affinity heteroclitic cryptic epitopes. Vaccination with pVax1/pet-neu triggered multiple and ErbB-2-specific CTL responses in HLA-A*0201 transgenic HHD mice and in HLA-A*0201 healthy donors in vitro. Human and murine CTL specific for each one of the 12 ErbB-2 peptides recognized in vitro both human and murine tumor cells overexpressing endogenous ErbB-2. Furthermore, vaccination of HHD mice with pVax1/pet-neu significantly delayed the in vivo growth of challenged ErbB-2-expressing tumor (EL4/HHD/neu murine thymoma) more actively when compared with vaccination with the empty vector (pVax1) or vehicle alone. These data indicate that the pVax1/pet-neu cDNA vaccine coding for a poly-ErbB-2 epitope is able to generate simultaneous ErbB-2-specific antitumor responses against dominant and cryptic multiple epitopes.
