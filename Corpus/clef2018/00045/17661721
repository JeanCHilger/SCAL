Incidentally discovered tumors of the endocrine glands. Clinically inapparent masses, or 'incidentalomas' of the endocrine glands are increasingly common owing to continued advancements in medical imaging. Incidentalomas of the adrenal glands have received substantial attention in the literature, whereas lesions of the thyroid and endocrine pancreas, though frequently encountered in the clinic, have received relatively little attention. We review the detection and subsequent management of incidentalomas of the thyroid, adrenal and pancreas, with specific attention paid to the mode of detection and risk stratification of lesions.
