alpha4beta2-nicotinic receptor binding with 5-IA in Alzheimer's disease: methods of scan analysis. Five patients with Alzheimer's disease and five healthy volunteers were examined by SPECT with the nicotinic receptor ligand 123I-5-IA-85380. Patients were scanned before and after 6 weeks of treatment with donepezil. Quantification by regions of interest was reliable and the optimal normalisation procedure used cerebellar ratios. We found relative reductions in 5-IA binding capacity in patients in thalamus, frontal and central regions of interest of approximately one standard deviation unit (Cohen's d = 1). Reductions in binding after treatment with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil of the same magnitude occurred in the brain stem. The study was clearly too small to confirm group differences, but it suggests that 5-IA can be used to examine both group differences and treatment effects in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
