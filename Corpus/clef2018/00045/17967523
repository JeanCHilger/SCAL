Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PET) are rare neoplasms of the pancreas accounting for less than 5% of all primary pancreatic malignancies. Included in this group are insulinomas, gastrinomas, glucagonoma and somatostatinomas. Collectively these neoplasms are classified as functional PETs. Where a PET is not associated with a clinical syndrome due to hormone oversecretion, it is referred to as a non-functioning PET. Non-functioning PETs are pancreatic tumours with endocrine differentiation but lack a clinical syndrome of hormone hypersecretion. The incidence of these tumours varied between 15 and 53%. Presentation is related to the mass effect of the tumour with symptoms often non-specific. Treatment is surgical excision with chemotherapy and hormonal therapy is controversial. For functioning PETs, surgery remains the optimal therapy, however, long-term survival can be expected even in the presence of metastases. With advances in medical management, radiolabelled somatostatin therapy, hepatic arterial chemoembolisation and radiofrequency ablation, symptoms may be controlled to optimize quality of life.
