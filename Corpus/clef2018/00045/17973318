Transient sialoadenitis: a complication of 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy. Radioiodinated metaiodobenzylguanidine [(131)I-MIBG] is commonly used to treat resistant neuroblastoma or metastatic pheochromocytoma [MP] with little non-hematopoietic toxicity. We describe here transient sialoadenitis, a previously unreported complication. Ten patients [9 neuroblastoma and 1 MP] received 12-18 mCi/kg of (131)I-MIBG. Five patients had bilateral parotid swelling, two with associated buccal discomfort within 24 hr of injection which subsided within 48 hr. Grade 3 or 4 serum amylase elevation was documented in 8/8 patients tested [median 1,336 range: 576-8,830 U/L] which normalized [25-125 U/L] within 4-14 [median 5.5] days. Serum lipase remained normal. Patients did not develop subsequent dry mouth or dysphagia.
