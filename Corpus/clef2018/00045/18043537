Bifunctional chelates for metal nuclides. The use of ''non-standard'' metallic radionuclides continues to be an expanding field of investigation. Radiolabeling small molecules, peptides, proteins, and up to nano-particles are all areas of active investigation for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. All require a common variableaethe need for appropriate chelation chemistry for adequate sequestration of the metallic radionuclide that is equal to the intended application. A brief overview of the array of the chelation chemistry options available to researchers and the means for their selection is provided.
