The ingestion of a Nectandra membranacea extract changes the bioavailability of technetium-99m radiobiocomplex in rat organs. The radiobiocomplexes labeled with technetium-99m (Tc-99m) have been widely used in nuclear medicine in single photon emission computed tomography and in basic research. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of a Nectandra membranacea extract on the bioavailability of the sodium pertechnetate (Na(99m)TcO(4)) radiobiocomplex in rat organs. The animals were treated with a N. membranacea extract (30 mg/ ml), for 6 days. Na(99m)TcO(4) was injected, the organs were isolated and weighed, and the radioactivity was determined in each organ (%ATI/organ). The %ATI/organ was divided by the mass of each organ to calculate the %ATI/g. A significant increase of the %ATI/organ of Na(99m)TcO(4) was observed in muscle and thyroid as well as in the %ATI/g in the heart, kidney and thyroid. These findings could result from the interaction between components of the plant extract and the radiobiocomplex which may influence the uptake Na(99m)TcO(4) in rat organs. Therefore, precaution is suggested in the interpretation of nuclear medicine results in patients using this herb.
