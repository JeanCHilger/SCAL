Sickle cell disease with regional silent cerebral infarction detected by SPECT. An 18-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital for a right leg ulcer, which appeared 1 year ago. After physical and hematologic examinations, he was referred for neurologic and cardiologic examination because his hemoglobin analysis and hematologic findings were interpreted as being consistent with sickle cell anemia. Although he had no neurologic symptoms, MRI and Tc-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer cerebral perfusion single photon emission computer tomography were performed to rule out a silent cerebral infarction. Changes secondary to an infarct were seen in the region of the caudate nucleus.
