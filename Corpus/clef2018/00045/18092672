A three-dimensional registration method for microUS/ microPET multimodality small-animal imaging. Small-animal models are used extensively in disease research, genomics research, drug development and developmental biology. The development of noninvasive small-animal imaging techniques with adequate spatial resolution and sensitivity is therefore of prime importance. In particular, multimodality small-animal imaging can provide complementary information. This paper presents a method for registering high-frequency ultrasonic (microUS) images with small-animal positron-emission tomography (microPET) images. Registration is performed using six external multimodality markers, each being a glass bead with a diameter of 0.43-0.60 mm, with 0.1 microl of [18F]FDG placed in each marker holder. A small-animal holder is used to transfer mice between the microPET and microUS systems. Multimodality imaging was performed on C57BL/6J black mice bearing WF-3 ovary cancer cells in the second week after tumor implantation and rigid-body image registration of the six markers was also performed. The average registration error was 0.31 mm when all six markers were used and increased as the number of markers decreased. After image registration, image segmentation and fusion are performed on the tumor. Our multimodality small-animal imaging method allows structural information from microUS to be combined with functional information from microPET, with the preliminary results showing it to be an effective tool for cancer research.
