FDG PET/CT for the detection and evaluation of breast diseases: usefulness and limitations. Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is used to diagnose, stage, and monitor breast cancer. FDG PET has the capability to depict abnormal metabolic activity before any anatomic change occurs however, in the absence of identifiable anatomic structures on PET images, it may be impossible to identify the location of areas of increased radionuclide uptake. In such cases, the coregistration of PET images with images from computed tomography (CT) may help improve diagnostic accuracy and lead to better clinical management of patients with breast cancer. Although FDG PET/CT may have limited diagnostic value for detecting small primary breast tumors, well-differentiated breast cancer, or regional lymph node involvement, it is superior to conventional imaging modalities for detecting distant metastases and recurrences and for monitoring the response to therapy.
