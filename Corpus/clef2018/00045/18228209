Evaluation of [67Ga]-insulin for insulin receptor imaging. Radiolabelled human recombinant insulin can be used for the imaging of insulin receptors in some tumours where FDG has natural uptake and diminishes the value of its imaging.Insulin was successively labelled with [(67)Ga]-gallium chloride after conjugation with freshly prepared cyclic DTPA-dianhydride (HPLC radiochemical purity assay > 96%) followed by biodistribution studies in normal rats, white blood cell labelling and preliminary SPECT studies.In vitro studies demonstrated the retention of radiolabelled insulin receptor affinity using freshly prepared human white blood cells at different blood sugar conditions. Preliminary in vivo studies in a normal rat model was performed to determine the biodistribution of the radioimmunoconjugate at up to 44 h. SPECT images revealed high uptake of the liver.Radiolabelled insulin is stable enough to be used in biological studies in order to image insulin receptors in diabetic conditions as well as possible tumour imaging applications. The data was consistent with other radiolabelled insulin studies.
