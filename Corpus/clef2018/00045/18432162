Scintigraphic imaging of adrenal disease. The nuclear medicine approach to adrenal imaging spans six decades with radiopharmaceuticals designed to take advantage of the unique characteristics of the functional divisions of the gland, substrate accumulation, hormone biosynthesis, receptor-ligand interactions and pharmacologic manipulation of mechanisms of central control. The recent introduction of hybrid imaging techniques that combine high resolution anatomy with the functional maps derived from the scintigraphic images is yet another step in the evolution of integrated imaging techniques that can be used to diagnostic advantage in the evaluation of disease of the adrenal gland.
