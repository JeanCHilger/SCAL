Fluorine-18 in radiopharmacy. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a recent and expanding functional nuclear imaging technique. Its extensive development is related to the radiophysical properties fluorine 18 (18F) (weak energy of positron, sufficiently long physical half-life) and to the simple production and labeling procedures for 18F. [18F]fluorodesoxyglucose was the first licensed radiopharmaceutical in France in 1998. [18F]fluoroDOPA was registered in 2006. Introduction of automated chemistry modules enable development of new fluorinated tracers.
