Imaging guidelines for children with Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma: a report from the Children's Oncology Group Bone Tumor Committee. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) is a multi-institutional cooperative group dedicated to childhood cancer research that has helped to increase the survival of children with cancer through clinical trials. These clinical trials include a standardized regimen of imaging examinations performed prior to, during, and following therapy. This article presents imaging guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary group from the COG Bone Tumor Committee. These guidelines provide both required and recommended studies. Recommended examinations may become required in the future. These guidelines should be considered a work in progress that will evolve with advances in imaging and childhood cancer research.
