Single Tc99m Sestamibi injection, double acquisition gated SPECT after stress and during low-dose dobutamine infusion: a new suggested protocol for evaluation of myocardial perfusion. The ability of low dose dobutamine (LDD) has been established in exploiting the reserved contractility of ischemic myocardium. This study was designed to assess the value of a new protocol, with an additional stress imaging during LDD infusion instead of the rest images, for evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD) and perfusion reversibility.A total of 51 patients (42 men, 9 women 57.2 +/- 11.3 years) were included in the study and underwent three sequential steps of imagingCalculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy regarding the presence of CAD in both SIDAGS-LDD and standard protocols were 90.9% (40/44), 71.4% (5/7), 95.2% (40/42), 55.6% (5/9) and 88.2% (45/51), respectively. The extent and localization of perfusion abnormality with the new protocol were correlated well with standard method. The estimation of reversibility, however, was considerably improved by SIDAGS-LDD, especially in those with history of previous myocardial infarction (MI).Our proposed protocol demonstrates good correlation and agreement with standard method and even is superior in some cases especially for estimation of viability after MI. Regarding no need for the rest phase radiotracer injection and imaging, this protocol can be more convenient (except the need for close monitoring of the patient during LDD infusion), less time-consuming, less expensive and moreover with less radiation burden to the patients and personnel.
