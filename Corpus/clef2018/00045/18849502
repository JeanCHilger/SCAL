Prostate carcinoma: diffusion-weighted imaging as potential alternative to conventional MR and 11C-choline PET/CT for detection of bone metastases. In a technical development study approved by the institutional ethics committee, the feasibility of fast diffusion-weighted imaging as a replacement for conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequences (short inversion time inversion recovery [STIR] and T1-weighted spin echo [SE]) and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in the detection of skeletal metastases from prostate cancer was evaluated. MR imaging and carbon 11 ((11)C) choline PET/CT data from 11 consecutive prostate cancer patients with bone metastases were analyzed. Diffusion-weighted imaging appears to be equal, if not superior, to STIR and T1-weighted SE sequences and equally as effective as (11)C-choline PET/CT in detection of bone metastases in these patients. Diffusion-weighted imaging should be considered for further evaluation and comparisons with PET/CT for comprehensive whole-body staging and restaging in prostate and other cancers.
