A highly sensitive and selective OFF-ON fluorescent sensor for cadmium in aqueous solution and living cell. A highly selective and sensitive OFF-ON fluorescent sensor 1, employing the PET mechanism, was designed and synthesized. It could be used to detect Cd(2+) ion in aqueous solution and to image Cd(2+) ion in living cells. The fluorescence intensity significantly enhanced about 195-fold and the quantum yield increased almost 100-fold. Moreover the fluorescence intensity of 1 increased linearly with high sensitivity (0-1 microM) toward Cd(2+).
