Noninvasive imaging of transplanted cells. Transplantation of cells is an urgent clinical need that is increasingly providing an alternative to solid-organ transplants. This review discusses the state-of-the-art in-vivo imaging of cell transplantation with a special focus on recent developments.Noninvasive imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear (positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography), acoustical, and optical imaging can investigate the biodistribution, fate, and functional integration of grafted cells. Especially, multimodal imaging is emerging as an important development to provide complimentary and confirmatory information.The development of noninvasive imaging of transplanted cells has progressed rapidly over the last few years. Translating these techniques into clinical protocols remains the focus of ongoing investigations.
