Modeling combined radiopharmaceutical therapy: a linear optimization framework. In this paper, we investigate a previously proposed mathematical model describing the effects that an innovative combined radiopharmaceutical therapy might have on the delivery of radiation to the tumor and limiting critical organs. While focused on a specific dual agent therapy, this investigation will prove mathematically that for any two therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals with different limiting critical organs the model provides patient specific conditions under which combination therapy is superior to single agent therapy. In addition, this paper outlines general methods for calculating the amounts of administered radioactivity for each drug required to optimize tumor radiation dose. We also consider extensions of this model to include an arbitrary number of independent radiopharmaceuticals and/or other treatment factors.
