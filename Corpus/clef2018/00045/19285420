(86)Y production via (86)Sr(p,n) for PET imaging at a cyclotron. Excitation functions of (86)Y production via (86)Sr(p,xn), (86)Sr(d,xn), (85)Rb(alpha,xn), (85)Rb((3)He,xn), and (nat)Zr(d,alphaxn) reactions were studied by means of ALICE-ASH code and the results were compared with ALICE-91 code and experimental data. The greatest nuclear reaction of cyclotron (86)Y production was found out as (86)Sr(p,n)(86)Y process. (86)Y production yield was calculated too. A SrCO(3) thick film was deposited on a copper substrate by sedimentation method. The deposited (nat)SrCO(3) was irradiated with 15MeV proton at 30microA current beam. The separation of Y from Cu and Sr was carried out by means of dual ion exchange chromatography.
