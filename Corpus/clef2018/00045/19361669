The evolution of musculoskeletal tumor imaging. Since the discovery of the X-ray, there have been substantial advances in musculoskeletal tumor imaging as radiography, nuclear medicine, angiography, ultrasound, CT, and MR imaging and the requisite computer technology have been developed. These imaging modalities provide invaluable information about musculoskeletal tumors to surgeons and medical oncologists at all time points along the continuum of patient care, from tumor detection and diagnosis to posttreatment surveillance. Despite the many technological advances, however, limitations of current imaging modalities persist. Advanced MR imaging techniques and molecular imaging hold substantial promise for further improvements in musculoskeletal tumor imaging. This article reviews the evolution of musculoskeletal tumor imaging by modality, and suggests possible directions for future developments.
