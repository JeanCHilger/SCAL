PET/CT in the evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease: studies in patients before and after treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the appropriate 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) determination in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) before and after clinical improvement to see if this determination correlates with clinical activity.We performed PET-computed tomography (PET/CT) on five patients before and after successful medical therapy in patients with moderately active IBD. Each patient had five bowel segments scored (0-3) for the appropriate FDG-PET determination.There were five patients [Crohn's disease (CD) = 3, ulcerative colitis = 2] who were studied an average of 437 days (range, 77-807) after initial PET/CT scan. All patients showed significant improvement in physician global assessment scores (p = 0.004) and underwent repeat PET/CT. The total score of all segments was 32 pretreatment and 14 posttreatment (p < 0.01). Of 11 pretreatment active segments, nine (82%) segments either became inactive or displayed decreased activity, while two showed no change (p < 0.001).Appropriate FDG-PET determination decreases with successful treatment of inflammation in active IBD and correlates with symptom improvement.
