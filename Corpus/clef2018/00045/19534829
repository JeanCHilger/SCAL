Quantitative detection of myocardial ischaemia by stress echocardiography a comparison with SPECT. Real-time perfusion (RTP) adenosine stress echocardiography (ASE) can be used to visually evaluate myocardial ischaemia. The RTP power modulation technique angio-mode (AM), provides images for off-line perfusion quantification using Qontrast software, generating values of peak signal intensity (A), myocardial blood flow velocity (beta) and myocardial blood flow (Axbeta). By comparing rest and stress values, their respective reserve values (A-r, beta-r, Axbeta-r) are generated. We evaluated myocardial ischaemia by RTP-ASE Qontrast quantification, compared to visual perfusion evaluation with 99mTc-tetrofosmin single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Patients admitted to SPECT underwent RTP-ASE (SONOS 5500) using AM during Sonovue infusion, before and throughout adenosine stress, also used for SPECT. Visual myocardial perfusion and wall motion analysis, and Qontrast quantification, were blindly compared to one another and to SPECT, at different time points off-line.We analyzed 201 coronary territories (left anterior descendent [LAD], left circumflex [LCx] and right coronary [RCA] artery territories) in 67 patients. SPECT showed ischaemia in 18 patients and 19 territories. Receiver operator characteristics and kappa values showed significant agreement with SPECT only for beta-r and Axbeta-r in all segments: area under the curve 0.678 and 0.665 P < 0.001 and < 0.01, respectively. The closest agreements were seen in the LAD territory: kappa 0.442 for both beta-r and Axbeta-rIn this agreement study with SPECT, RTP-ASE Qontrast quantification of myocardial ischaemia was less accurate and less feasible than visual evaluation and needs further development to be clinically useful.
