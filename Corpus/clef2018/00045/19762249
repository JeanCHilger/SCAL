An automated method for preparation of [(18)F]sodium fluoride for injection, USP to address the technetium-99m isotope shortage. The worldwide shortage of technetium-99m has created an immediate and urgent need for access to [(18)F]sodium fluoride for PET imaging of bone metastasis. In order to facilitate global availability of [(18)F]sodium fluoride for diagnostic nuclear medicine imaging procedures, a straightforward method for rapid production of [(18)F]sodium fluoride for injection, USP, using a modified GE Tracerlab FX-FN is presented.
