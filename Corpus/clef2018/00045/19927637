Arteriogenesis induced by intramyocardial recombinant adeno-associated virus vector encoding human CD151 cDNA gene transfer in swines with coronary artery occlusion. To investigate the efficacy of CD151 gene delivery in promoting blood perfusion in swines after myocardial infarction.Swines received coronary artery ligation and intramyocardial injection with rAAV-CD151, rAAV-anti-CD151 or rAAV-GFP. Eight weeks after vector injection, Western blot, immunostaining and 13N-labeled NH3 PET were performed to detect gene expression and biological effects of various treatments.High level of CD151 protein expression was detected in the rAAV-CD151 group. The capillary density in the rAAV-CD151 group [(83.8 +/- 6.7) n/mm2] was significantly higher than that in the control group [(33.2 +/- 4.5) n/mm2] and rAAV-GFP group [(41.6 +/- 5.6) n/mm2] (all P<0.05) the arteriole density in the rAAV-CD151 group [(16.4 +/- 2.5) n/mm2] was also higher than that in the control group [(6.6 +/- 2.3) n/mm2] and the rAAV-GFP group [(8.4 +/- 1.6) n/mm2] (all P<0.05). However, the lowest capillary density and arteriole density were evidenced in rAAV-anti-CD151 group. Myocardial blood perfusion was significantly increased in rAAV-CD151 group and significantly reduced in rAAV-anti-CD151 group (all P<0.05 vs. control).Intramyocardial injection of rAAV-CD151 could enhance the myocardial express of CD151 protein, increase capillary and arteriole densities and improve blood perfusion in swine with myocardial infarction.
