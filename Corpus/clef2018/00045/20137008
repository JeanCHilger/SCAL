Recovery of dermatophytes in pet grooming tools from veterinary clinics and pet grooming salons. Fomites such as brushes and clippers are known to be potential risk factors for the transmission of dermatophytes between pet animals. The aim of this study was to investigate this risk by examining those grooming implements for the presence of any viable dermatophytes.For this purpose, samples from 235 pieces of grooming equipment and swab samples from the surface of the 14 grooming tables were taken from 41 veterinary clinics and 3 pet grooming salons.Trichophyton tonsurans was isolated from two clipper blades from one veterinary clinic and Microsporum canis were isolated from three clipper blades and one toothbrush from another clinic.This study shows that current disinfection protocols and grooming procedures of the veterinary clinics and pet grooming salons appear to be adequate.
