Effect of different colored filters on photooxidation in pasteurized milk. The effect of different colored filters and atmospheres on photooxidation and quality in milk was studied. Pasteurized bovine milk (3.9% fat) was packed in 2 different atmospheres (air and N(2)) and exposed to light for 20 h at 4 degrees C under 8 transparent filters with different light transmission properties. The following transparent, noncolored, and colored filters based on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were used: noncolored (PET), noncolored with 2 different UV-block regions, yellow, green, amber, orange, and red. Control samples were stored in darkness and in a carton. Sensory evaluation showed off flavors significantly increased in milk stored under all filters compared with the control samples. Variation in atmosphere resulted in significant differences in formation of rancid flavor in milk stored under different filters. Milk samples stored in N(2) underwent the most sensory deterioration under orange and red filters, whereas milk samples stored in air were most deteriorated under noncolored filters. According to the oxidation compounds measured by gas chromatography, milk samples stored under noncolored and orange filters were highly oxidized, whereas red, green, and amber filters offered better protection against photooxidation. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to examine the degradation of photosensitizers (riboflavin, protoporphyrin, and chlorophyllic compounds) in the milk samples. Degradation of protoporphyrin and chlorophyllic compounds in N(2) correlated well with sensory properties related to photooxidation (R(2)=0.75-0.95). The study indicates that protoporphyrin and chlorophyllic compounds were effective photosensitizers in milk. To avoid photooxidation in milk, it is therefore important to protect it against light from the UV spectrum as well as light from the entire visible region.
