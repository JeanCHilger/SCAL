Biodistribution, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of insulin analogues in a rat model: Oral delivery using pH-responsive nanoparticles vs. subcutaneous injection. In this study, we report the biodistribution of aspart-insulin, a rapid-acting insulin analogue, following oral or subcutaneous (SC) administration to rats using the single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT). Oral delivery of aspart-insulin was achieved using a pH-responsive nanoparticle (NP) system composed of chitosan (CS) and poly(gamma-glutamic acid). The results obtained in the SPECT/CT study indicate that the orally administered aspart-insulin was absorbed into the systemic circulation, while the drug carrier (CS) was mainly retained in the gastrointestinal tract.Via the SC route, the peak aspart-insulin concentration in the peripheral tissue/plasma was observed at 20 min after injection. Within 3 h, half of the initial dose (ID) of aspart-insulin was degraded and excreted into the urinary bladder. In contrast, via oral delivery, there was constantly circulating aspart-insulin in the peripheral tissue/plasma during the course of the study, while 20% of the ID of aspart-insulin was metabolized and excreted into the urinary bladder. In the pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation in a diabetic rat model, the orally administered aspart-insulin loaded NPs produced a slower hypoglycemic response for a prolonged period of time, whereas the SC injection of aspart-insulin produced a more pronounced hypoglycemic effect for a relatively shorter duration. Finally, comparison of the PD/PK profiles of the orally administered aspart-insulin with those of the SC injection of NPH-insulin, an intermediate-acting insulin preparation, suggests the suitability of our NP system to be used as a non-invasive alternative for the basal insulin therapy.
