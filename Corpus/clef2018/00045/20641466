 Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a 53-amino acid cytokine (6.2 kDa) secreted by ectodermic cells, monocytes, kidneys and duodenal glands (1). EGF stimulates growth of epidermal and epithelial cells. EGF receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane protein with an intracellular tyrosine kinase present on most cells. EGFR is overexpressed on many solid tumor cells, such as those of breast, non-small-cell lung, head and neck, and colon cancers (2-4). The high level of EGFR expression on cancer cells is associated with a poor prognosis (5-7). EGF has been labeled with
