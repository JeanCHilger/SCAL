Adult extragonadal germ cell tumors. The purpose of this article is to describe the key imaging features of primary and metastatic extragonadal germ cell tumors in adults.Extragonadal germ cell tumors primarily affect men during the third and fourth decades of life. Their imaging characteristics are nonspecific, and extragonadal germ cell tumors should always be included in the differential diagnosis of a midline anterior mediastinal or retroperitoneal mass. Levels of human chorionic gonadotropin or Î±-fetoprotein or both may be elevated, depending on the histologic subtype.
