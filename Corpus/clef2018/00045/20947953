Simultaneous quantification of multiple magnetic nanoparticles. Distinct magnetic nanoparticle designs can have unique spectral responses to an AC magnetic field in a technique called the magnetic spectroscopy of Brownian motion (MSB). The spectra of the particles have been measured using desktop spectrometers and in vivo measurements. If multiple particle types are present in a region of interest, the unique spectral signatures allow for the simultaneous quantification of the various particles. We demonstrate such a potential experimentally with up to three particle types. This ability to concurrently detect multiple particles will enable new biomedical applications.
