( Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a form of dementia with gradual memory loss and progressive decline in mental functions (1, 2). It is characterized pathologically by neuronal loss, extracellular senile plaques (aggregates of β-amyloid peptides consisting of 40–42 amino acids), and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (filaments of microtubule-binding hyperphosphorylated protein tau) in the brain, especially in the hippocampus and associative regions of the cortex (3, 4). β-Amyloid peptides and the tau protein are implicated as the main causes of neuronal degeneration and cell death (5, 6). Early diagnosis of AD is important for treatment consideration and disease management (7). Various β-amyloid imaging agents have been developed for magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography, and positron emission tomography (PET) (8-13). The binding of different derivatives of Congo red, thioflavin, stibene, and aminonaphthalene has been studied in human postmortem brain tissue and in transgenic mice. Of these analogs, 2-(1-(6-[(2-[
