Efficient synthesis of new tetradentate ligands with potential applications for 64Cu PET-imaging. We wish to report the synthesis of new tetradentate ligands in less than 3h in good to excellent yields from a commercially available compound using microwave-assisted technology. First tests of complexation showed a high ability of these ligands to chelate (64)Cu(II) in very diluted medium. These new systems have the potential to be used for nuclear medicine and particularly for PET-imaging.
