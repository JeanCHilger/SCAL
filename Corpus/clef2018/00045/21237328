Somatostatin receptor-based imaging and therapy of digestive endocrine tumors. The management of gastroenteropancreatic endocrine tumors is greatly linked to the localization of primary tumor. Morphological imaging methods are thus necessary. However, the expression of somatostatin receptors in endocrine tumors makes their detection possible thanks to radiolabeled somastotatin analogs. [(111)In-DTPA] octreotide is the main radiolabeled analog for somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. Positron emission tomography uses other tracers and currently allows improvement of the diagnosis and the tumoral staging. It also allows to affect the therapeutic management. A further step is about to be taken as far as the therapy of endocrine tumors is concerned with the peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. Those therapies are now being offered in some European and American centers for progressive metastatic tumors. Their place in the therapeutic strategy has to be defined, especially in comparison to targeted therapy. The sudden and delayed adverse events as well as the current legislation on the use of radioactive therapy-aimed products have limited their development in France so far.
