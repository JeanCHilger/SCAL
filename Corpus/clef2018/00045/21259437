Low thrombogenicity coating of nonwoven PET fiber structures for vascular grafts. Vascular PET grafts (Dacron) have shown good performance in large vessels (≥ 6 mm) applications. To address the urgent unmet need for small-diameter (2-6 mm) vascular grafts, proprietary high-compliance nonwoven PET fiber structures were modified with various PEG concentrations using PVA as a cross-linking agent, to fabricate non-thrombogenic mechanically compliant vascular grafts. The blood compatibility assays measured through platelet adhesion (SEM and mepacrine dye) and platelet activation (morphological changes, P-selectin secretion, and TXB2 production) demonstrate that functionalization using a 10% PEG solution was sufficient to significantly reduce platelet adhesion/activation close to optimal literature-reported levels observed on carbon-coated ePTFE.
