Evaluation of an intraperitoneal ovarian cancer syngeneic mouse model using 18F-FDG MicroPET imaging. The objective of this study was to evaluate the syngeneic immunocompetent mouse model by using the micro-positron emission tomography with 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (F-FDG microPET) imaging of ovarian tumor growth.ID8 ovarian carcinoma cells derived from C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected into female C57BL/6 mice. Mice were injected with F-FDG (7.4 MBq, intravenous injection), and microPET images were obtained 40 minutes later. Micro-computed tomographic images were also obtained immediately after microPET images for anatomical reference. F-FDG microPET images were acquired at baseline and at 4, 8, 10, and 11 weeks after tumor cell injection. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in each time point was obtained from the images and compared to follow the tumor growth.Physiological uptake of F-FDG was intensely found in the bladder and heart and frequently in the gastrointestinal tract. Diffused uptake of F-FDG was observed in the peritoneal cavity of all tumor-bearing mice at 4 weeks, and high focal uptakes were developed in the peritoneal cavity at 8 to 11 weeks. High focal uptakes increased over time, correlating with a progressive increase in the SUVmax of F-FDG. At 11 weeks, the SUVmax value was significantly increased (1.49 ± 0.10 at 11 weeks vs 0.29 ± 0.03 at baseline, P < 0.01). Tumors in the gut and peritoneum were confirmed by anatomical and histopathological examination.Our results demonstrate that the peritoneal tumor growth in the syngeneic ovarian cancer model can be detected by the F-FDG microPET imaging.
