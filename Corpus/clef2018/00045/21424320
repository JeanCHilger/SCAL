Role of integrated PET/CT with [¹⁸F]-FDG in the management of patients with fever of unknown origin: a single-centre experience. Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a diagnostic challenge for the wide range of possible causes involved. The aim of our work was to evaluate the role of [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography ([¹⁸F]-FDG-PET/CT) in managing patients with classical FUO.Twenty-four consecutive patients (16 women, eight men mean age, 56.5 years) with a diagnosis of FUO based on routine investigations were retrospectively studied. All underwent [¹⁸F]-FDG-PET/CT, which was considered true positive when the result was in agreement with the final diagnosis.A final diagnosis was reached in 17 of 24 patients (vasculitis, n=5 autoimmune disorder, n=2This study underlines the crucial role of [¹⁸F]-FDG-PET/CT in managing patients with FUO. If prospective trials on this topic confirm the present findings, PET/CT should be incorporated in the routine diagnostic work-up of patients with classical FUO.
