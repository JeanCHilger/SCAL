SPECT/CT in the management of osteochondral lesions of the talus. The treatment of osteochondral lesion of the talus (OLT) is mainly based upon the stage of the disease so accurate imaging is crucial. SPECT/CT combines bone scan with high-resolution CT and can provide functional-anatomical images in a single stage. The purpose of this study was to assess the value of SPECT/CT in the management of OLT.From 2004 to 2009, 22 patients with OLT were identified that had both SPECT/CT and MRI of the foot and ankle. All charts were reviewed to ascertain the reason for ordering the SPECT/CT and the additional information obtained. AOFAS outcome scores were calculated at the time of followup.Twelve patients underwent ankle arthroscopy for debridement or drilling of the osteochondral lesion. The mean AOFAS score in these 12 patients was 83.6. SPECT/CT helped preoperative planning by identifying the exact location of the active lesion, especially in multifocal disease or revision surgeries while showing the depth of the active lesion. Ten patients had conservative management due to minimal or no activity over the lesion on SPECT/CT images. The mean AOFAS score in these ten patients was 78.8 which was comparable to the operative group.We believe SPECT/CT was able to provide additional diagnostic value by demonstrating a co-existing pathology as a potential cause of pain and in preoperative planning by showing the depth of activity and the precise location of the active segment in multiple lesions.
