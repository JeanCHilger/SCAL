Intraoperative imaging for sentinel node identification in prostate carcinoma: its use in combination with other techniques. We evaluated a portable γ-camera for sentinel node identification during laparoscopic sentinel lymphadenectomy for prostate cancer.We analyzed the portable γ-camera for intraoperative sentinel node visualization in 55 patients after (99m)Tc injection, preoperative planar lymphoscintigraphy, and SPECT/CT.Sixteen percent of 178 nodes seen on SPECT/CT could not be detected with the portable γ-camera. A seed pointer was useful for localizing sentinel nodes intraoperatively in 27% of patients. Seventeen additional sentinel nodes (2 tumor-positive nodes) were removed by monitoring after excision. The location of each sentinel node was significantly associated with the ability to detect it intraoperatively.Intraoperative imaging leads to excision of more radioactive nodes and can determine the residual radioactivity after excision. The use of a radioactive source as a pointer enables efficient identification of nodes in difficult locations (paraaortic nodes) and in patients with a high body mass index.
