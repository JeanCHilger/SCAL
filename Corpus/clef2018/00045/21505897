Comparison of ¹³¹I whole-body imaging, ¹³¹I SPECT/CT, and ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of metastatic thyroid cancer. The aim of this study was to compare (131)I whole-body scintigraphy (WBS), WBS with (131)I single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT), and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT in the detection of distant metastases of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).A total of 140 patients with 258 foci of suspected distant metastases were evaluated. (131)I WBS, (131)I SPECT/CT, and (18)F-FDG PET/CT images were interpreted separately. The final diagnosis was obtained from histopathologic study, serum thyroglobulin level, other imaging modalities, and/or clinical follow-up.Of the 140 patients with 258 foci, 46 patients with 166 foci were diagnosed as positive for distant metastasis. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of each imaging modality were 65, 55, and 59%, respectively, for (131)I WBS 65, 95, and 85% for (131)I SPECT/CT, respectivelyBoth SPECT/CT and PET/CT demonstrated high diagnostic performance in detecting metastatic thyroid cancer. SPECT/CT was highly accurate in patients who underwent a single challenge of radioiodine therapy. In contrast, (18)F-FDG PET/CT presented the highest diagnostic performance in patients who underwent multiple challenges of radioiodine therapy.
