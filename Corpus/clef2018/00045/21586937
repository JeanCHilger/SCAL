Radiological and clinical features of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. To retrospectively analyze computed tomography (CT) and clinical findings of patients with subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL).The CT findings were retrospectively assessed in 8 patients (6 men, 2 women age range, 23-60 yearsAll 8 patients had multiple (range, 4 to numerous) soft tissue lesions involving subcutaneous fat tissue of the chest, abdominal wall, back, and buttock. Lesions varied in size (range, 0.5-10 cm) and showed reticular (n = 1), nodular (n = 4), and diffuse infiltrative (n = 3) patterns. Three patients had lesions involving the entire thickness of fat tissue, 3 had partial lesions, and 2 had variable lesions. Skin thickening was mild in 4 patients, moderate in 2, and severe in 2 fascia thickening was mild in 3 patients, moderate in one, severe in one, and variable in 2. In 7 patients, lesions were accompanied by engorged supplying vessels. At onset, maximum standardized uptake values varied from 1.2 to 4.7, decreasing to 0.0 to 4.2. Five patients had αβ type and one had γδ type. Clinical outcome varied: two remain alive with disease, two had no disease, and one died.The SPTCL is characterized by multiple, nodular, or diffuse soft tissue lesions involving subcutaneous fat tissue, accompanied by engorged vessels and skin and fascial thickening. Patients vary in presentation and in treatment outcomes.
