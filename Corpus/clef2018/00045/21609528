Value of combined CT coronary angiography and adenosine stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for diagnosis of coronary artery disease. To assess the accuracy and feasibility of combination of CT coronary angiography (CTCA) and adenosine stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) for diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD).CTCA, MPS were performed in 105 patients with suspected or diagnosed CAD within 4 weeks before coronary angiography (CAG) examination.The sensibility, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy were 97.1%, 75.0%, 88.2%, 93.1% and 89.5%, respectively, for CTCA 79.7%, 63.9%, 80.9%, 62.2% and 74.3%, respectively, for MPS and 97.2%, 98.5%, 98.5%, 89.7% and 95.2%, respectively, for CTCA + MPS.Combination of CTCA and adenosine stress MPS, which provided both anatomical and functional information of coronary vessels, could significantly increase the specificity and PPV of diagnosing CAD with CTCA.
