The synthesis, magnetic purification and evaluation of 99mTc-labeled microbubbles. Ultrasound (US) contrast agents based on microbubbles (MBs) are being investigated as platforms for drug and gene delivery. A methodology for determining the distribution and fate of modified MBs quantitatively in vivo can be achieved by tagging MBs directly with (99m)Tc. This creates the opportunity to employ dual-modality imaging using both US and small animal SPECT along with quantitative ex vivo tissue counting to evaluate novel MB constructs.A (99m)Tc-labeled biotin derivative ((99m)TcL1) was prepared and incubated with streptavidin-coated MBs. The (99m)Tc-labeled bubbles were isolated using a streptavidin-coated magnetic-bead purification strategy that did not disrupt the MBs. A small animal scintigraphic/CT imaging study as well as a quantitative biodistribution study was completed using (99m)TcL1 and (99m)Tc-labeled bubbles in healthy C57Bl-6 mice.The imaging and biodistribution data showed rapid accumulation and retention of (99m)Tc-MBs in the liver (68.2±6.6 %ID/g at 4 min 93.3±3.2 %ID/g at 60 min) and spleen (214.2±19.7 %ID/g at 4 minA convenient means to radiolabel and purify MBs was developed and the distribution of the labeled products determined. The result is a platform which can be used to assess the pharmacokinetics and fate of novel MB constructs both regionally using US and throughout the entire subject in a quantitative manner by employing small animal SPECT and tissue counting.
