Functional imaging for assessing tumor response in cancer of the cervix. Treatment options for carcinoma of the cervix are guided by tumor stage, and include radical surgery, in cases where the tumor is confined to the cervix, or concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In those cases treated with chemoradiation, the ability to monitor the response to treatment in order to adapt the management plan during its course may be beneficial. This approach has the potential to offer an individualized treatment plan, allowing for differences in behavior between tumors to be addressed early, rather than a 'one size fits all' treatment approach. This article aims to review the use of evolving functional imaging techniques including diffusion-weighted MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and PET as tools for the evaluation of response to treatment of uterine cervical carcinoma.
