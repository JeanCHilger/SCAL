Si-H and Si-Si activation at Pt: synthesis and reactivity of neutral and cationic silyl complexes. Reactions of [Pt(PEt(3))(3)] (1) with the silanes HSiPh(3), HSiPh(2)Me and HSi(OEt)(3) led to the products of oxidative addition, cis-[Pt(H)(SiPh(3))(PEt(3))(2)] (2), cis-[Pt(H)(SiPh(2)Me)(PEt(3))(2)] (3), cis-[Pt(H){Si(OEt)(3)}(PEt(3))(2)] (cis-4) and trans-[Pt(H){Si(OEt)(3)}(PEt(3))(2)] (trans-4). The complexes cis-4 and trans-4 can also be generated by hydrogenolysis of (EtO)(3)SiSi(OEt)(3) in the presence of 1. Furthermore, the silyl compounds cis-4 and trans-4 react with B(C(6)F(5))(3) and CH(3)CN by hydride abstraction to give the cationic silyl complex trans-[Pt{Si(OEt)(3)}(NCCH(3))(PEt(3))(2)][HB(C(6)F(5))(3)] (8). In addition, the reactivity of the complexes cis-4, trans-4 and 8 towards alkenes and CO was studied using NMR experiments.
