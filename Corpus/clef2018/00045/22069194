Evaluation of primary prostate cancer using 11C-methionine-PET/CT and 18F-FDG-PET/CT. The objective of this study was to evaluate the capability of (11)C-methionine (MET)-PET/CT and (18)F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D: -glucose (FDG)-PET/CT to diagnose primary prostate cancer using recently developed Gemini TF PET/CT (Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, OH).Twenty men who had been referred for a diagnostic work-up for prostate cancer were enrolled in this study. MET- and FDG-PET/CT by high-resolution mode were carried out on the same day prior to prostate biopsy and each maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was compared with the pathological findings. The regions of interest (about 100 mm(2) small round) were placed at standard 6 points of the peripheral zone and 4 points in the apex of the transitional zone in cases that had undergone biopsy of the internal gland. We summed two scores if a specimen had inhomogeneous Gleason scores (e.g. GS 7 4 + 3) and doubled the score when the Gleason score was the same (e.g. GS 8The PET images, obtained with Gemini TF PET/CT, allowed visual identification of anatomical locations within the prostate gland. Among the mean SUVmax of MET, FDG early phase and FDG delayed phase, the differences between NG and HG were all statistically significant (P < 0.01). With MET the difference between NG and LG was also significant (P < 0.05). And for the elevation rate from FDG early to delayed phase, the difference between NG and HG was significant (P < 0.05). The cut-off SUVmax, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy for distinguishing between NG and LG + HG by MET, FDG early and delayed phase were 3.15/78.7/75.6/78.3, 2.81/61.7/80.0/70.7 and 3.00/62.8/78.9/70.7, respectively. And the same factors between NG + LG and HG were 3.76/70.1/89.7/82.6, 2.88/70.1/82.9/78.3 and 3.47/62.7/86.3/77.7, respectively.In terms of the capability to diagnose prostate cancer of high Gleason score (â‰¥8), there was no significant difference between MET and FDG. MET appears to be useful for detecting prostate cancer of both low and high Gleason score.
