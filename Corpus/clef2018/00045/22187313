Intratumoral heterogeneity of F-18 FDG uptake differentiates between gastrointestinal stromal tumors and abdominal malignant lymphomas on PET/CT. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and malignant lymphomas (MLs) in the abdomen are often observed as tumors of unknown origin on F-18 FDG PET/CT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity of F-18 FDG uptake on PET to determine if it might be helpful to discriminate between these tumors.The F-18 FDG PET/CT findings of 21 large abdominal tumors were retrospectively evaluated (9 GISTs and 12 MLs). Intratumoral heterogeneity was evaluated by visual scoring (visual score: 0, homogeneous 1, slightly heterogeneousGISTs exhibited heterogeneous uptake of F-18 FDG, whereas MLs showed rather homogeneous uptake on visual analysis (visual score: 2.67 ± 0.50 and 0.58 ± 0.79, respectively p < 0.001). The AUC-CSH was significantly lower for the GISTs than for the MLs (0.41 ± 0.14 and 0.64 ± 0.08, respectivelyGISTs exhibited significantly heterogeneous intratumoral tracer uptake as compared with the MLs. Evaluation of the intratumoral heterogeneity of F-18 FDG uptake may help in the discrimination between these tumors.
