Diagnostic value of myocardial SPECT to detect in-stent restenosis after drug-eluting stent implantation. Different angiographic patterns and restenosis rate may affect diagnostic value of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in the era of drug-eluting stents (DES). We aimed to determine the ability of myocardial SPECT to detect in-stent restenosis (ISR) in patients treated with DES compared to that of patients treated with bare metal stent (BMS). We evaluated 228 consecutive patients who underwent 6 months follow-up SPECT and coronary angiography (CAG) after stent implantation. In 228 patients, 354 vessels were treated with stent implantation (BMS, n = 105 DES, n = 249) and 65 (18.4%) vessels showed ISR (angiographic % diameter stenosis â‰¥ 50%) at the 6-month follow-up CAG. In patients with BMS-ISR (n = 37), restenosis was primarily diffuse (70.3%), whereas patients with DES-ISR (n = 28) exhibited more focal restenosis (53.6%, p = 0.028). The sensitivity and specificity of myocardial SPECT did not differ significantly between patients with BMS and those with DES (BMS vs. DES: sensitivity 56.8 vs. 39.3%, p = 0.163
