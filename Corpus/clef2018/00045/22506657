Clinical outcomes of patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumours and negative postchemotherapy positron emission tomography. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to identify factors associated with the failure of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to correctly predict relapse-free survival in patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumours. Ninety-three patients with negative postchemotherapy FDG-PET scan were analyzed in the retrospective study. The FDG-PET result was validated by long-term follow-up and, in some patients, by resection of the residual tumour mass. The negative predictive value of FDG-PET was 81.7%. Higher tumour marker levels and nodal stage at diagnosis, presence of residual mass, and teratoma or teratocarcinoma in the primary histology were associated with FDG-PET failure.
