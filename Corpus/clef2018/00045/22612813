Optical imaging of visual cortex epileptic foci and propagation pathways. Precise localization of neocortical epileptic foci is a complex problem that usually requires ictal video-electroencephalography (EEG) recordings high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies
