Role of 11C-choline PET/CT in the re-staging of prostate cancer patients with biochemical relapse and negative results at bone scintigraphy. to evaluate the utility of (11)C-choline PET/CT in prostate cancer (PC) patients who have demonstrated a biochemical recurrence and a negative bone scintigraphy (BS).123 consecutive PC patients (mean age 67.6 years range 54-83) with a biochemical relapse (mean PSA value 3.3ng/mL(11)C-choline PET/CT was positive in 42/123 patients (34.1%). (11)C-choline PET/CT detected lesions in: bone (10 patients), lymph-nodes (20 patients), bone and lymph nodes (7 patients), bone and lung (1 patient), lymph-nodes and lung (1 patient), local relapse (3 patients). Overall, (11)C-choline PET/CT showed a total of 30 unknown bone lesions in 18/123 (14.6%) patients.(11)C-choline PET/CT showed a better sensitivity than BS in patients with biochemical relapse after RP: (11)C-choline PET/CT detected unknown bone lesions in 18/123 (14.6%) patients.
