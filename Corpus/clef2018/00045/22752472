Clinical significance of incidental colonic 18F-FDG uptake on PET/CT images in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. We assessed the ability of positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) to detect synchronous colonic pathology and determined the significance of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) activity in the colon of gastric cancer patients.A total of 239 gastric cancer patients who underwent PET/CT and colonoscopy preoperatively were included. FDG uptake patterns on PET/CT were classified as (1) group A, focal (2) group B, diffuseIn group A, a total of 123 polyps of >0 mm were observed. Of these, nine polyps were colonic adenocarcinomas and six were high-grade dysplasia. The incidence of colonic adenocarcinomas was significantly higher in group A than in the other two groups (p = 0.037). There was a significant correlation between SUVmax values and incidence of colonic polyps of >10 mm (r = 0.471, p = 0.04). The distribution pattern of SUVmax in polyps with adenoma (>10 mm) was less homogenous than in polyps (>10 mm) with adenocarcinoma.The focal colonic FDG uptake in PET/CT requires colonoscopic confirmation. The suspicion of colonic malignancy increased in the presence of polyps >10 mm that showed a positive correlation with the SUVmax.
