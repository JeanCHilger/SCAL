Comparison of various methods for designing the shielding from ionising radiation at PET-CTinstallations. Protection at positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) installations is the most complex problem in the field of designing structural protection from ionising radiation in medical practice. This paper provides a discussion on the values for shield widths obtained from two different estimation methods, as well as of certain theoretical differences inherent in the two approaches. After the general operation principles of a PET-CT device are expounded, a comparative analysis of two methods for calculating structural barriers is performed. The first calculation was conducted by the 'Vinƒça' Institute of Nuclear Sciences, according to the recommendations of the AAPM task group 108, while the second was performed by a PET-CT device manufacturer, following the DIN 6844-3 standard.
