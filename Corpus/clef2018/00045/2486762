Computer system and software of POSITOLOGICA II: a whole body positron emission tomograph. Since a whole body PET-scanner POSITOLOGICA II was installed at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in 1982, improvements of the computer system and developments of new software have been continuously made to correspond to clinical requirements. As the result, POSITOLOGICA II possesses one of the most powerful systems and sophisticated software in Japan. This report describes the present status of the computer system and software of POSITOLOGICA II. It also discusses problems which still exist and proposes a future computer system for the PET study.
