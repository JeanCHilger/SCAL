Hemodynamic and metabolic effects of cerebral arteriovenous malformations studied by positron emission tomography. Seventeen patients with an intracranial arteriovenous malformation were studied with positron emission tomography. Cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, oxygen extraction fraction, and glucose and oxygen metabolism were evaluated in both hemispheres, excluding the area of the malformation itself. Patients were divided into three groups according to the size of their malformation, and results obtained were compared with studies in healthy volunteers. The glucose metabolism was significantly (p less than 0.01) decreased in the ipsilateral hemisphere in all patients. The cerebral blood volume was significantly increased (p less than 0.001) ipsilaterally in the three groups, and contralaterally in patients with medium- and large-sized arteriovenous malformations. The cerebral blood volume to cerebral blood flow ration, an index of vascular mean transit time, was significantly increased (p less than 0.005) ipsilaterally in patients with medium- and large-sized malformations and contralaterally in patients with large ones. Cerebral blood flow, oxygen extraction fraction, and oxygen metabolism were within the normal range bilaterally in all three groups, but oxygen extraction fraction tended to be higher in patients with larger lesions. The lack of significant change in oxygen metabolism suggests that oxygen metabolism in cortical areas remote from the arteriovenous malformation has been maintained by compensatory hemodynamic mechanisms. These data reveal widespread metabolic and hemodynamic consequences of arteriovenous malformations and suggest that they are associated with impairment of glucose metabolism, both in ipsilateral regions remote from the lesion and in the contralateral hemisphere in patients with large lesions.
