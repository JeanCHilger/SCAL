Modular automation in PET tracer manufacturing: application of an autosynthesizer to the production of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose. A compact autosynthesizer was developed and used successfully for the production of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose [18FDG] from gaseous acetyl hypo[18F]fluorite. The autosynthesizer performs a sequence of general purpose synthesis procedures named Synthesis Unit Operations (SUO's). Each SUO is controlled through execution of a digital control algorithm with a BASIC language subroutine. This automatic synthesis system is based on two industry standard microcomputer architectures, the IBM PC and STD Bus, and it becomes a component of an evolving distributed microprocessor network of task-dedicated subsystems suitable for automated manufacturing of several useful radiotracers. The yield of 18FDG product using the autosynthesizer and remote manually controlled purification procedures is approximately 20% EOB. Radiochemical purity of this product as measured by thin layer chromatography was 96-99%. Chemical purity of the product was measured to be approximately 96%. 2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-D-mannose impurity from this method was determined to be approximately 4%.
