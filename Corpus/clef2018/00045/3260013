Cognitive and brain imaging measures of Alzheimer's disease. The need to identify specific forms of dementia and their stages has fostered a surge to differentiate Alzheimer's disease (AD) from related dementias. Research has taken several directions, focusing on neuropsychological assessments, and now on neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). Defining methodological criteria for the diagnostic indicators is a major focus for these imaging methods.
