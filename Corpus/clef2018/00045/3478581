Practices in cat and dog immunotherapy among allergists. Allergists in each of four groups, board certified with academic affiliation (A), board certified without academic affiliation (B), non-board certified (NB), and previous trainees of our program (PT)--were queried as to their practices and philosophies in cat and dog epidermal immunotherapy (CDI) and pollen immunotherapy (PI). The four groups were similar in numbers of new patients seen and practices of PI. In several instances, with respect to CDI, however, the PT and A groups segregated from the B and NB groups. Most of B and NB allergists would administer CDI to a patient who refused to give up a pet, while most physicians in the PT or the A groups would not. Overall the number of patients placed on CDI was higher and the degree of efficacy was perceived as higher among the NB and B groups than in the PT or A groups.
