Iofetamine HCl I-123 (Iodoamphetamine) brain SPECT atlas. SPECT brain imaging using Iofetamine HC1 I-123 (IMP) has a great potential in the evaluation of various neurologic disorders. Transverse, coronal, and sagittal sectional IMP images obtained using a single head rotating gamma camera system are correlated with corresponding normal brain slices in this atlas.
