Experimental studies on myocardial glucose metabolism of rats with 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. The myocardial uptake of 18F-FDG was investigated under various conditions, and compared with brain and tumor uptake as a function of blood glucose level. The uptake by the heart of normal feeding rats was rapid and remained essentially unchanged up to 2 h after 18F-FDG injection, approximately 3%-4% dose/g tissue. On the other hand, the myocardial uptake of fasted rats was significantly lower than that of control rats throughout the course of the study, and it was about 0.3%-0.4% dose/g tissue. Myocardial uptake of 18F-FDG was relatively constant at glucose levels under about 120 mg/100 ml and increased steeply at higher blood glucose levels. In contrast, brain uptake decreased linearly with increasing levels of blood glucose, revealing a strong negative correlation between brain uptake of 18F-FDG and blood glucose levels. The tumor uptake pattern remained relatively unchanged, irrespective of blood glucose levels. It was revealed that the glucose demands of brain, heart, and tumor were entirely different. After a glucose load, the myocardial uptake of fasted rats increased only slightly from 0.4% to 0.6% dose/g tissue, in spite of transitional hyperglycemia. In contrast, insulin caused myocardial uptake to increase extraordinarily, although it caused a decrease in blood glucose levels.
