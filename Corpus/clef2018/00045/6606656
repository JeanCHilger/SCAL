Performance study of the PC-384 positron camera system for emission tomography of the brain. A positron camera system PC-384 has been designed and built for quantitative positron emission computed tomography of the brain. This head scanner consists of 384 bismuth germanate oxide scintillation detectors with a crystal packing fraction of 80%. The entire detector assembly rotates around a small circle (wobble) to achieve the necessary ray sampling. Seven simultaneous images are produced with four detector rings. Performances of the system are discussed and clarified based on experimental data.
