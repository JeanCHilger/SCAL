Aspects of the preparation of 18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG) for medical use. Fluorine-18-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG) for medical use had been prepared with the attention regarding radiochemical yield and purity, specific activity and quality control. More than four 18F-by-products in 18F-adducts from the reaction of triacetyl glucal with 18F2 were detected by the autoradiography of thin layer plates in which two by-products could not be perfectly removed by a column chromatography, and selective collection of the eluate gave 18FDG with the purity of 96.7% as an average in 12 runs. At end of synthesis (EOS) 259-925 MB (7-25 mCi) of a sterilized, isotonic solution of 18FDG was obtained with the specific activity of 629-851 MBq (17-23 mCi)/mg at end of bombardment (EOB) after preparation time of 3-3.5 hr, in which bacteria and pyrogen were not detected.
