Functional network interactions between parallel auditory pathways during Pavlovian conditioned inhibition. Using covariance structural equation modeling and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) autoradiography this study examined auditory system interactions when the learned associative effects of a tone were inhibited by a light. Two groups of rats received pairings of a tone (conditioned excitor: T+) with a mild footshock. Group TL- was trained in a Pavlovian conditioned inhibition paradigm (T+/TL-) where the tone-light compound signaled the absence of footshock, making the light the inhibitor (L-). Group TL degree was trained with the tone as the excitor and the light as a 'neutral' stimulus. After FDG injection, all rats were presented with the tone-light compound. Group differences in auditory system FDG uptake were observed only in the ventral division medial geniculate nucleus (MGV), where group TL- had relatively lower incorporation. Structural equation modeling was used with the covariances of FDG activity to determine the functional influences through the auditory system anatomic connections. Differences were noted mainly at the level of the inferior colliculus (IC) and medial geniculate, possibly reflecting the unique anatomic relation of these regions with extraauditory areas. Ascending and descending influences from the IC differed with stronger influences for group TL-. Intracollicular and the ascending influence influences of MGV and medial division of the medial geniculate nucleus (MGM) on the auditory cortex also differed mainly in the sign of the functional interaction. These results demonstrate how interactions among parallel auditory pathways can code the behavioral significance of auditory stimuli and emphasize that a full appreciation of neural operations underlying learning can only be gained through examination of both regional activity and interregional interactions.
