Ischemic heart failure. Heart failure is a major and increasing public health problem. Coronary artery disease has become the major etiology of heart failure. The differentiation of viable from nonviable myocardium in patients with coronary disease and impaired left ventricular systolic function is an issue of extreme importance to the clinician. Several diagnostic modalities including thallium imaging, dobutamine stress echocardiography, and positron emission tomography have gained considerable acceptance as useful tools in detecting myocardial viability. The management of heart failure with preserved left ventricular systolic function includes the use of beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nitrates. In patients with heart failure and impaired left ventricular systolic function, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have become an integral part of the medical management. In patients whose angina is unresponsive to the addition of nitrates, a trial of bet blockers should be attempted and first generation calcium blockers should be avoided. Revascularization should always be sought, particularly when myocardial viability has been established.
