Long-lasting inhibition of in vivo cocaine binding to dopamine transporters by 3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester: RTI-55 or beta CIT. Cocaine analogs such as 3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane-2 beta-carboxylic acid methyl ester (RTI-55 or beta CIT) with a higher affinity for the dopamine transporter (DAT) may be potentially useful in interfering with cocaine's actions in brain. This study evaluates the time course of the effects of RTI-55 on cocaine binding in baboon brain using PET and [11C]cocaine. [11C]Cocaine binding was measured prior to, and 90 minutes, 24 hours, 4-5 days and 11-13 days after RTI-55 (0.3 mg/kg i.v.). Parallel studies with [3H]cocaine and RTI-55 (0.5 mg/kg i.v. or 2 mg/kg i.p.) were performed in the mouse. RTI-55 significantly inhibited [11C]cocaine binding at 90 minutes and 24 hours after administration. The half-life for the clearance of RTI-55 from the DAT was estimated to be 2 to 3 days in the baboon brain. In the mouse brain, RTI-55 significantly inhibited [3H]cocaine binding at 60 and 180 minutes after administration and recovery was observed at 12 hours. These results document long-lasting inhibition of cocaine binding by RTI-55 and corroborate that binding kinetics of RTI-55 in striatum observed in imaging studies with [123I]RTI-55 represents binding to DATs.
