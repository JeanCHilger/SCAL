Myocardial revascularization in patients with impaired left ventricular function. From March 1988 to May 1993, 1,125 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent coronary surgery at our Institute. In the same period 74 patients (mean age 59 +/- 7 years range 36-73) with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) were referred for surgical decision making. All patients underwent [99mTc]MIBI/SPET to assess perfusion at rest and [99mTc]MIBI first pass radionuclide angiography to assess the ejection fraction (EF). In 44/74 patients we performed [18F]FDG/PET in fasting conditions and pharmacologic wash-out, in order to identify viable myocardium. We divided patients with LVD into 3 groups: Group A (30 patients) operated on without preoperative [18F]FDG/PET, Group B (37 patients) operated on with FDG uptake in segments with wall motion abnormalities, and Group C (7 patients) with no FDG uptake, who were excluded from coronary surgery
