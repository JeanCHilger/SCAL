Automated detection of the intercommissural line for stereotactic localization of functional brain images. A technique has been developed for automated detection of the intercommissural (AC-PC) line for positron emission tomography (PET). The AC-PC line is estimated from the location of four internal landmarks the frontal and occipital poles, the inferior aspect of the anterior corpus callosum, and the subthalamic point. The landmarks are detected automatically in PET mid-sagittal slices by combining edge detection, interpolation and profile curve analysis techniques. The anatomical relationships between the true and estimated AC-PC lines from the landmarks was confirmed by analysis of magnetic resonance (MR) images. Accuracy of the automated estimation technique was assessed in co-registered PET and MR images, which showed minimal angular differences and displacements of the estimated from the true AC-PC lines. The automated detection of the AC-PC line in a PET study enables accurate stereotactic localization of functional signals without the need for additional anatomical imaging and provides a basis for objective and reproducible intersubject comparison.
