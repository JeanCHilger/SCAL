Functional contributions of the primate pulvinar. One of the major tasks facing the central nervous system is choosing which sensory events to use for perception and directed behavior. All organisms live in a rich sensory environment, and it is impossible to attend and respond to everything. Certain brain regions and systems must evaluate sensory signals and then determine which are salient. Based on recent data derived from diverse studies of the pulvinar of primates, it is the hypothesis of this paper that a major role of the pulvinar is to participate in the generation of visual salience, those processes which precede perception and action. This process of salience generation makes use of two broad mechanisms, the suppression of noise and the enhancement of significant signals. Outlined above are experiments which show that the visual activity which might be caused by eye movements is filtered from some pulvinar cells. Visual responses associated with certain directions of gaze are removed. Finally the ability to suppress the activity of distracting visual stimuli is dependent on the integrity of the pulvinar. Conversely, there are neurons within the pulvinar which respond best when animals actively select and thus engender certain stimuli with salience. Modulation of pulvinar functioning with transmitter-related drugs changes performance as if salience is being modulated. Humans and monkeys with destruction of the pulvinar behave as if they too cannot create or evaluate salience. Finally, when salience is demanded of humans by making their visual tasks more demanding, there is an increase in PET activity. The hypothesis here is that the pulvinar functions as an early center for the generation of visual salience. This is similar to the view of striate cortex as an early integration stage for the basic elements of visual processing (Hubel and Wiesel, 1968 Zeki, 1976
