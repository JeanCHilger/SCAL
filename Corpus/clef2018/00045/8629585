Effect of spinal cord stimulation on myocardial blood flow assessed by positron emission tomography in patients with refractory angina pectoris. Spinal cord stimulation in angina pectoris increases exercise capacity and reduces both anginal attacks and ischemic electrocardiographic signs. This suggests an anti-ischemic action, perhaps through changes in myocardial blood flow. In 9 patients, regional myocardial blood flow was studied with positron emission tomography before and after 6 weeks of spinal cord stimulation, both at rest and during a dipyridamole stress test. Frequency of anginal attacks and consumption of short-acting nitrates were assessed by patient diaries. Exercise duration and time to angina were measured with treadmill exercise tests. After 6 weeks of stimulation, both frequency of daily anginal attacks and nitrogen consumption decreased (3.7 +/- 1.7 vs 1.4 +/- 1.0 [p <0.01] and 2.8 +/- 2.2 vs 1.1 +/- 1.2 tablets [p = 0.01], respectively) exercise duration and time to angina increased (358 +/- 165 vs 493 +/- 225 seconds [p <0.01] and 215 +/- 115 vs 349 +/- 213 seconds [p = 0.02], respectively)
