Scintimammography with technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile: comparison with mammography and magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of scintimammography with technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI SMM) in the detection of primary breast cancer with that of mammography (MM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fifty-six patients with suspected lesions detected by palpation or MM were included in the study. Within the 4 weeks preceding excisional biopsy, MM and MRI were performed in all patients. Between 5 and 10 min after the injection of 740 MBq 99mTc-MIBI, SMM in the prone position was performed. In the total group of 56 patients, 43 lesions were palpable, while 13 were non-palpable but were detected by MM. Breast cancer was confirmed by histopathology in 27 of the patients (22 palpable and 5 non-palpable carcinomas). The tumour size ranged from 6 to 80 mm in diameter. For non-palpable lesions, the sensitivity of SMM, MM and MRI was 60%, 60% and 100%, respectively, while the specificity was 75%, 25% and 50%, respectively. For palpable breast lesions, all methods showed high sensitivity (SMM 91%, MM 95%, MRI 91%) but SMM demonstrated significantly higher specificity (SMM 62%, MM 10%, MRI 15%). In two mammographically negative tumours (dense tissue), SMM showed a positive result. In comparison to MRI, one additional carcinoma could be diagnosed by SMM. It may be concluded that for palpable breast lesions, the diagnostic accuracy of SMM is superior to that of MM and MRI. Through the complementary use of SMM it is possible to increase the sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer and multicentric disease. In patients in whom the status of a palpable breast mass remains unclear, SMM may help to reduce the amount of unnecessary biopsies.
