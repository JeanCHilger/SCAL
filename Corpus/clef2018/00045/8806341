Coronary vasomotility and myocardial blood flow early after heart transplantation. Serotonin constricts coronary arteries with endothelial dysfunction, a common abnormality in cardiac transplant recipients. To assess whether endothelial dysfunction is associated with myocardial blood flow (MBF) abnormalities, 24 patients were studied 1 to 12 months after transplantation. Serotonin in increasing doses (1, 10, and 20 micrograms/min for 2.5 min each) was infused into the coronary circulation. Diameters were measured by quantitative angiography. Fourteen patients (group A) had a pronounced artery constriction (diameter reduction > 40%), while in 10 other patients (group B), such a constriction was never reached. No patient had evidence of rejection and all had angiographically normal coronary arteries. MBF was measured at rest and after intravenous dipyridamole with dynamic nitrogen-13 ammonia positron emission tomography (PET). The resting MBF was higher in group A than in group B (94 +/- 12 vs 74 +/- 15 ml/min/100 g of tissue p < 0.05). During dipyridamole, MBF was not significantly different (191 +/- 53 vs 184 +/- 64 ml/min/100 g
