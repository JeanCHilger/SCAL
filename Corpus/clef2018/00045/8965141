Metabolism and kinetics of iodine-123-BMIPP in canine myocardium. The kinetics and metabolic fate of 123I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)- methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) in canine myocardium were studied in an open-chest dog model.After left anterior descending artery injection of BMIPP, blood samples were collected from the corresponding great coronary vein (V) and femoral artery (A). On the basis of the A-V radioactivity difference as well as the HPLC elution profile at various time points, myocardial extraction, retention and metabolism of BMIPP were evaluated.BMIPP was instantly extracted from the plasma into the myocardium (74% of the injected dose) and was then retained (65.3%). Washout of the retained radioactivity was low (8.7%) and most of the washout was as alpha- and beta-oxidation metabolites (2.3 + 2.9 + 1.4%), with little loss of BMIPP itself (2.1 %).BMIPP is suitable for static SPECT imaging of the myocardium, and its slow washout appears to be due to metabolism through alpha- and beta-oxidation.
