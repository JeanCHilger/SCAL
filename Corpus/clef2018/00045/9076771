First SPET images of glutamate (NMDA) receptor activation in vivo in cerebral ischaemia. This report describes the initial clinical assessment of (+)-3-[123I]Iodo-MK-801 and its potential to provide single photon emission tomographic (SPET) images in vivo of NMDA receptor activation during cerebral ischaemia. Multiple SPET images were obtained in the 120 min after the administration of 150 MBq of (+)-3-[123I]Iodo-MK-801 to five patients with cerebral ischaemia (due to cerebral haemorrhages) and to five normal volunteers. In normal subjects, (+)-3-[123I]Iodo-MK-801 has a rapid uptake into the brain. The tracer has a high non-specific retention in the central nervous system due to its lipophilicity, which was made evident by the retention of tracer in the cerebellum and white matter (brain areas with few NMDA receptors). In all patients with cerebral haemorrhages, the initial uptake of (+)-3-[123I]Iodo-MK-801 into the ipsilateral hemisphere was markedly reduced, consistent with a reduced level of cerebral blood flow. In two of five patients, relatively increased tracer retention at later time points (60-120 min after tracer administration) could be seen in cortical areas adjacent to the site of the haemorrhage, consistent with activated NMDA receptors. In three of the patients, no relatively enhanced tracer retention could be identified. Using (+)-3-[123I]Iodo-MK-801, it may be possible to image excessive glutamate (NMDA) receptor activation during an ischaemic episode in living human patients. The utility of (+)-3-[123I]Iodo-MK-801 as a SPET ligand for assessing modest alterations in NMDA receptor activity may ultimately be limited by its lipophilicity and consequent high non-specific binding.
