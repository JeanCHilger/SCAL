SPET investigations in extrapyramidal diseases using specific ligands. Single photon emission tomographic investigations of the extrapyramidal system have become easier to perform since the development of the ligands [123I]-beta-CIT and [123I]-IBZM. Thirty-three patients were investigated with [123I]-IBZM. The images were evaluated visually and semi-quantitatively (ratio of the striatum to front cortex). Ten controls showed a mean (+/- S.D.) ratio of 1.513 +/- 0.06 nine patients with Parkinson's disease had a smaller ratio of 1.425 +/- 0.095
