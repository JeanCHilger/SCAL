Activation of the prefrontal, occipital and parietal cortices during go/no-go discrimination tasks in the monkey as revealed by positron emission tomography. The regions of the monkey brain involved in cognito-behavioral tasks were mapped using the H2(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) activation technique. Monkeys performed hand movements in an asymmetrically rewarded go/no-go reaction-time task with discrimination between green (go) and red (no-go) light signals. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured during the go/no-go task and a control task in which only go signals were presented. In the go/no-go task, when compared with the control, a significant increase in rCBF was noted in the following regions: (1) the principal sulci (2) the anterodorsal frontal pole
