Patient-specific dosimetry of indium-111- and yttrium-90-labeled monoclonal antibody CC49. The objective of this work was to develop patient-specific dosimetry for patients with metastatic gastrointestinal tract cancers who received 111In-CC49 IgG for imaging before therapy with 90Y-CC49 IgG.Whole-body imaging of 12 patients, who received 111-185 MBq (3-5 mCi) of 111In-CC49, commenced in < 2 hr postinfusion and was continued daily for 4-5 days. SPECT data were acquired at 24 and 72 hr to determine the range of 111In-CC49 activity concentrations in tumors and normal organs. Time-activity curves were generated from the image data and scaled from 111In-CC49 to 90Y-CC49 for dosimetric purposes. Absorbed-dose calculations for 90Y-CC49 included the mean and range in tumor and normal organs. Computed 90Y-CC49 activity concentrations were compared with measurements on 10 needle biopsies of normal liver and four tumor biopsies.In 9 of 10 normal liver samples, the range of computed 90Y-CC49 activity concentrations bracketed measured values. This was also the case for 3 of 4 tumor biopsies. Absorbed-dose calculations for 90Y-CC49 were based on patients' images and activities in tissue samples and, hence, were patient-specific.For the radiolabeled antibody preparations used in this study, quantitative imaging of 111In-CC49 provided the data required for 90Y-CC49 dosimetry. The range of activities in patients' SPECT images was determined for a meaningful comparison of measured and computed values. Knowledge of activity distributions in tumors and normal organs was essential for computing mean values and ranges of absorbed dose and provided a more complete description of the absorbed dose from 90Y-CC49 than was possible with planar methods.
