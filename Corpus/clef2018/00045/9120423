Pathophysiology of movement disorders studied using PET. PET radiotracer methods can measure various biochemical features of brain tissue in the living human brain. Here, local brain energy consumption and striatal dopaminergic function will be discussed in the light of the neurodegenerative processes underlying Parkinson's disease. Particularly, disease progression and its consequences for protective and restorative strategies will be outlined. Also, an example will be given to demonstrate how the effect of neurotrophic factors on the striatal dopaminergic system can be monitored by PET tracer methods.
