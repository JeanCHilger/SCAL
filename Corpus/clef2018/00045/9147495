Cerebral metabolic activity correlates of subsyndromes in chronic schizophrenia. Seventy-nine patients with schizophrenia and 47 healthy controls received positron-emission tomography (PET) with 18F-2-deoxyglucose uptake while executing the Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Patients had been off all psychoactive medication for at least four weeks. Patients' symptoms were assessed with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and factor scale scores were obtained. These scores were used in cluster analysis to identify patients with predominantly delusional, negative, disorganized, and remitted symptoms. To address the interconnective nature of cerebral functioning, regions of interest were defined on the basis of the results of a factor analysis of metabolic rate in selected brain regions. This procedure identified six cortical and eight subcortical region of interest factors. Metabolic rate factor scale scores were compared between the patients' clusters and the healthy controls. The delusional cluster showed a significantly reduced hippocampal activity, while the negative symptoms cluster presented with a prominent hypofrontality and significantly increased left temporal cortex values. Concurrently, both clusters were associated with a decreased activity on the factor 'anterior cingulum and medial frontal gyrus'. The disorganized cluster was characterized by a significant overactivity in the parietal cortex and motor strip and a decreased activity in the corpus callosum. The subsyndromes of chronic schizophrenia are therefore characterized by deviant patterns of cerebral activity rather than deficits in a single location.
