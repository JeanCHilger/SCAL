Xenon effects on regional cerebral blood flow assessed by 15O-H2O positron emission tomography: implications for hyperpolarized xenon MRI. Subjective and physiologic effects of 33% inhaled Xe were measured with 15O-water positron emission tomography (PET) in 3 subjects at rest and during visual stimulation. The procedure was well tolerated. Robust functional activations of the visual cortex were obtained after xenon (Xe) inhalation as well as air breathing. However, Xe inhalation was followed by smaller size, but significant decreases of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in visual cortex relative to the air-breathing baseline, both during visual stimulation and at rest. No such decreases were found in other sensory or motor regions.
