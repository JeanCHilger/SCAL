Detection of moderate and severe coronary artery stenosis with technetium-99m tetrofosmin myocardial single-photon emission tomography. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of technetium-99m tetrofosmin myocardial imaging for the localization of coronary artery stenoses of different degrees of severity. Stress-rest single-photon emission tomography (SPET) was performed on separate days in 80 patients (64 males, 16 females mean age 61 years
