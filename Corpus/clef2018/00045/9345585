Positron emission tomography: background, possibilities and perspectives in neuroscience. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a method for determining biochemical and physiological processes in vivo in a quantitative way. This includes the measurement of the pharmacokinetics of labeled drugs and the measurement of the effects of drugs and/or therapy on metabolism. Also deviations of normal metabolism can be measured and insight in biological processes responsible for diseases can be obtained. To accomplish these measurements a multi-disciplinary team is necessary for the expertise in the fields of radionuclide production, radiochemistry, pharmacy, medicine, nuclear imaging and data analysis.
