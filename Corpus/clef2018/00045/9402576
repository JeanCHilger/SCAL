Preoperative activation and intraoperative stimulation of language-related areas in patients with glioma. Evaluation of the accuracy of preoperative localization of language-related cortex by magnetic resonance imaging-guided positron emission tomography.Patients with gliomas in the left dominant hemisphere were examined preoperatively with magnetic resonance imaging-guided positron emission tomography and intraoperatively by electrical stimulation of cortex.A verb generation task yielded more intense and better lateralized local increases of cerebral blood flow in the positron emission tomographic examination than did a naming task. Significant correspondence of preoperative and intraoperative findings was observed for the verb generation task. Cortical sites with aphasic disturbance during electrical stimulation had a significantly higher cerebral blood flow increase during preoperative activation than did sites without intraoperative language impairment. Areas with cerebral blood flow increases above an optimum threshold had 73% sensitivity and 81% specificity to predict aphasic disturbance during intraoperative stimulation.The data suggest that with further technical improvements, imaging of language function may become a preoperative diagnostic tool for patients with tumors close to language-related brain structures.
