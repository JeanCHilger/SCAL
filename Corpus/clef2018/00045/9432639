Image fusion of different tomographic methods (PET/CT/MRI) effectively contribute to therapy planning. Image fusion (and image registration) is a fundamental topic of three-dimensional (3D) medical image processing. The need to register different imaging modalities arises for several reasons: some anatomical details, especially soft tissues, are more easily seen in MRI than CT images, but the bony structures are better visualised by CT. The visualisation of any morphological volume with a functional data set which may come from SPECT or PET is a very important method both for research purposes and for routine diagnostics. Our developed programs allowing us to solve image fusion tasks also contained some free available softwares. These packages helped us to start additional software development for more advanced applications having elaborated this way the informatical background of multimodality image processing. This paper presents three oncological applications of the image fusion: PET-CT-MRI registration for 3D radiotherapy planning, PET-MRI registration in planning surgery and metastasis localization. All these registration processes were solved by the landmark-matching registration method.
