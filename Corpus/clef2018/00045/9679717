Effects of long-term smoking on myocardial blood flow, coronary vasomotion, and vasodilator capacity. The effect of long-term smoking on coronary vasomotion and vasodilator capacity in healthy smokers is unknown.Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was quantified with [13N]ammonia and positron emission tomography (PET) at rest, during cold pressor testing (endothelium-dependent vasomotion), and during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia in 16 long-term smokers and 17 nonsmokers. MBF at rest did not differ between the 2 groups. Cold induced similar increases in rate-pressure product (RPP) in smokers and nonsmokers. However, MBF increased only in nonsmokers and was, during cold, higher than in smokers (0.91+/-0.18 versus 0.78+/-0.14 mL x g(-1) x min(-1), P<0.05). MBF normalized to the RPP (derived from the ratio of MBF ([milliliters per gram per minute] to RPP [beats per minute times millimeters of mercury] times 10000) declined in smokers but remained unchanged in nonsmokers (0.86+/-0.10 versus 0.72+/-0.11, P=0.0006, and 0.99+/-0.25 versus 0.96+/-0.27, P=NS). The hyperemic response to dipyridamole and the myocardial flow reserve did not differ between the 2 groups. In a multiple regression model adjusted for age, sex, serum lipid levels, years of smoking, and pack-years, years of smoking was the strongest predictor of the normalized blood flow response to cold (P<0.001), followed by the HDL/LDL ratio.The normal hyperemic response to dipyridamole in long-term smokers indicates a preserved endothelium-independent coronary vascular smooth muscle relaxation, whereas the abnormal response to cold suggests a defect in coronary vasomotion likely located at the level of the coronary endothelium. Its severity depends on the total exposure time to smoking.
