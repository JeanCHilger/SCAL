Diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy by fourier analysis of gated blood pool single-photon emission tomography. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of Fourier phase analysis of gated blood pool single-photon emission computed tomography (GBP SPECT) in arrhythmogenic right ventricular (RV) cardiomyopathy, 18 patients with confirmed arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy underwent GBP SPECT and x-ray cineangiography. Results were compared with data obtained with GBP SPECT in 10 control subjects. This 3-dimensional method demonstrated good correlation with cineangiography for measurements of RV enlargement and extent of the disease RV and left ventricular segments were analyzed with the same accuracy. Tomographic abnormalities were significant decreased RV ejection fraction, RV dilatation, nonsynchronized contraction of the ventricles, increased RV contraction dispersion, presence of segmental RV wall motion disorders and/or phase delays, and occasionally regional left ventricular abnormalities. RV-delayed phase areas were always present in our population. A scoring system with RV criteria was proposed to diagnose RV disease. Because Fourier analysis of GBP SPECT provides ventricular morphologic information for the right ventricle with the same accuracy as for the left ventricle, it may replace planar radionuclide studies. Therefore, this method is helpful in patients with a strong clinical suspicion of arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, and should be used as a screening method before right ventriculography.
