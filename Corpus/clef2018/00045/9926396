Sequence and expression in Escherichia coli of the coat protein gene of the dwarfing strain of soybean dwarf luteovirus. The nucleotide sequence of the coat protein gene of the dwarfing (D) strain of soybean dwarf luteovirus (SbDV) was determined from cloned cDNA. The gene contains 600 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 200 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 22.2 kDa. A major portion of the coat protein open reading frame (ORF) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a pET fusion protein and the product was detected by western blot analysis using SbDV-D polyclonal antibodies. Comparison of the deduced coat protein amino acid sequence to that from the yellowing (Y) strain of SbDV demonstrated 88% identity.
