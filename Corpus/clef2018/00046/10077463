99mTc-labeled MIBG derivatives: novel 99mTc complexes as myocardial imaging agents for sympathetic neurons. Radioactive-iodine-labeled meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is currently being used as an in vivo imaging agent to evaluate neuroendocrine tumors as well as the myocardial sympathetic nervous system in patients with myocardial infarct and cardiomyopathy. It is generally accepted that MIBG is an analogue of norepinephrine and its uptake in the heart corresponds to the distribution of norepinephrine and the density of sympathetic neurons. A series of MIBG derivatives containing suitable chelating functional groups N2S2 for the formation of [TcvO]3+N2S2 complex was successfully synthesized, and the 99mTc-labeled complexes were prepared and tested in rats. One of the compounds, [99mTc]2, tested showed significant, albeit lower, heart uptakes post iv injection in rats (0.21% dose/g at 4 h) as compared to [125I]MIBG (1.7% dose/g at 4 h). The heart uptake of the 99mTc-labeled complex appears to be specific and can be reduced by co-injection with nonradioactive MIBG or by pretreatment with desipramine, a selective norepinephrine transporter inhibitor. Further evaluation of the in vitro uptake of [99mTc]2 in cultured neuroblastoma cells displayed consistently lower, but measurable uptake (approximately 10% of that for [125I]MIBG). These preliminary results suggested that the mechanisms of heart uptake of [99mTc]2 may be related to those for [125I]MIBG uptake. If suitable 99mTc-labeled MIBG derivatives can be further developed, the prevalent availability of 99mTc in nuclear medicine clinics will allow them to be readily available for widespread application.
