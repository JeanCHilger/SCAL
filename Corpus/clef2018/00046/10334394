Functional brain imaging in neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood. This review article presents a summary of the current state-of-the-art of functional brain imaging, with a primary focus on childhood neuropsychiatric disorders. Coverage is emphasized for developments that appear to be of current or potential future importance for the child neurologist and related pediatric specialist, and also from the perspective of the developmental neuroscientist. Emphasis is placed on the modalities of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and both "conventional" and "functional" magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI) including reference to the major new radiopharmaceutical and magnetic resonance-based imaging agents and techniques. The fundamental physicochemical processes underlying such studies are outlined, with citation of sources of more detailed information for the interested reader. A variety of imaging studies are reviewed for selected groups of childhood neuropsychiatric disorders, designed to illustrate the achievements and future promise of these imaging modalities. Areas of concentration are suggested for future imaging research in the field of childhood behavioral disorders, where these methods seem critical to improved understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms, as well as development of more effective treatment strategies.
