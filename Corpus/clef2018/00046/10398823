Comparison of the distribution of fluorine-18 fluoromisonidazole, deoxyglucose and methionine in tumour tissue. To evaluate the tumour imaging potential of fluorine-18 fluoromisonidazole (FMISO), we studied FMISO uptake in an experimental tumour model and examined the correlation between intratumoral distributions of FMISO, 14C-2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and 14C-methionine (Met). The study was performed using control rats with the AH109A tumour and rats with the same tumour under local hypoxia. Tumour uptake of FMISO was constant between 30 min and 2 h after injection, and the tumour to muscle ratio was 2 from 2 to 4 h. A tumour study with FMISO was scheduled at 2 h. Double-tracer autoradiography of the tumour demonstrated that in the areas of high FMISO uptake, there was low uptake of Met, while areas of low FMISO uptake showed high Met uptake. FMISO showed high grain density in the rim of the tumour surrounding the necrotic area. 2DG showed a more uniform distribution over the entire section of viable cells. The mean uptake of FMISO by hypoxic, radioresistant tumours was significantly higher than that by the control tumours (P<0.05), while both 2DG and Met uptake by the control tumours was higher than uptake by hypoxic tumours. When individual tumours were examined, the uptake of FMISO was inversely correlated with that of Met (r = -0.507, P<0.02), while 2DG showed almost uniform uptake with no significant correlation to FMISO. In conclusion, hypoxic and radioresistant tumours could be identified by increased FMISO uptake in our model, consistent with findings reported by others. We found a large overlap in the distribution of FMISO and 2DG within the tumour, but only a small overlap in the distribution of FMISO and Met. A combination of FMISO and other tracers in positron emission tomography or single-photon emission tomography studies might be more helpful than single-tracer studies in predicting the response of tumour tissues to radiotherapy.
