Attitudes of Finnish dog-owners about programs to control canine genetic diseases. A mailed questionnaire survey was done to study dog-owners' knowledge of canine inherited diseases and the present screening and control programs in Finland, as well as to study the importance of health-related matters and well-being to dog-owners. The purpose was also to study the owners' role in programs and the influence of health and well-being in their decision-making process and choices when purchasing a puppy. This study showed that dog-owners highly valued health-related matters and well-being. The present programs were considered to have a positive effect on the prevention of canine inherited diseases. Dog-owners estimated that their own knowledge could be better but they believed in veterinarians' and dog-breeders' ability to inform them. Inherited skeletal and ocular diseases were thought to be important to canine well-being the importance of other diseases or behaviour problems was assessed to be lower. In choosing a suitable breed, behaviour and temperament were the most-important factors but health-related matters were essential in actually choosing a puppy's breeder and the litter. Well-being and health were also considered very important to the image of the dog hobby.
