Beneficial effects of fluvastatin on myocardial blood flow at two time-points in hypercholesterolemic patients with coronary artery disease. Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor initiating and accelerating atherosclerosis and leading to severe stages of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a high risk of cardiovascular events. We investigated the impact of lipid lowering in patients with hypercholesterolemia and evident CAD on clinically relevant parameters like myocardial perfusion. Myocardial imaging was performed with thallium-201 single photon-emission computed tomography at rest and after maximal bicycle exercise in 22 patients after a 4-week lead-in period, and after 12 and 24 weeks of therapy with fluvastatin. Perfusion defects occurred in all patients, indicating stress-induced myocardial ischemia. After 12 weeks of therapy, the perfusion of the ischemic segments increased by 26% (277+/-99 to 349+/-96 cpm p < 0.001), whereas the value of the normal segments was augmented only by 4% (478+/-44 to 497+/-28 cpm
