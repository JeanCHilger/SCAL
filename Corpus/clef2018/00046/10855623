Decreased dopamine transporter binding in Machado-Joseph disease. The aim of this study was to use 99mTc-TRODAT-1 brain SPECT for investigation of the binding of dopamine transporter (DAT) in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway of symptomatic Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) and to compare the results with the abnormal cytidylate, adenylate, and guanylate (CAG) expansion in the MJD1 gene and other clinical factors.Ten symptomatic MJD patients (8 women, 2 men age range, 20-71 yAll nigrostriatal 99mTc-TRODAT-1 ratios were significantly lower in MJD patients than in healthy volunteers (P < 0.05). Discriminant function analysis of all MJD patients showed that the decreased binding of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 in the putamen was not significantly different from that in the caudate nucleus. Eight of 10 MJD patients had significantly decreased 99mTc-TRODAT-1 uptake. Of these 8, 2 had extrapyramidal signs and 6 had no obvious extrapyramidal signs. The other 2 patients, who had normal 99mTc-TRODAT-1 uptake, had no obvious extrapyramidal signs.Our findings indicate that 99mTc-TRODAT-1 brain SPECT is an appropriate method for evaluating damage to the nigrostriatal DAT in symptomatic MJD patients with and without extrapyramidal signs. The decreased binding of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in symptomatic MJD patients correlates with the phenotype of extrapyramidal signs but not with the abnormal CAG repeat length, age at disease onset, or disease duration.
