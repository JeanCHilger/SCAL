Kidney function after radical nephrectomy: assessment by quantitative SPECT of 99mTc-DMSA uptake by the kidneys. To determine the function of the remaining contralateral kidney after the removal of a functioning kidney, 30 consecutive patients (18 men, 12 women average age, 67 yThe 30 patients were undergoing radical nephrectomy for renal tumors. The first study was done before surgery. Follow-up studies were performed 2-23 mo after surgery. Clinical evaluations and determinations of serum creatinine level were performed at the same time as the QDMSA studies.The relative contribution of the resected kidneys to the global renal function before surgery was 43.2% +/- 7.3%. After surgery the uptake of the remaining kidney increased from 13.4% +/- 4.0% to 18.3% +/- 5.8% (t = 5.7 P = 0.0000). The relative function of the remaining kidney increased from 56.8% +/- 7.1% to 79.1% +/- 23.6% (t = 4.9The results of this study suggest that adaptive changes causing hyperfunction of the remaining kidney may occur after nephrectomy of a functioning kidney in adults. These changes occur soon after surgery, persist for at least 1 y, and are evident on QDMSA studies.
