Cortical function in epilepsy. Recent work with functional neuroimaging that relies on blood flow techniques, (15)O water positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging has identified the lateralization and location of language functions. These technologies are increasingly being explored as alternatives to the more invasive intracarotid amytal procedure. Paradigms and sequences have been designed to identify the capacity of the hippocampus and mesial structures to support memory. Magnetoelectroencephalography offers the prospect of mapping language function in real time. Event-related data acquisition has also been employed to localize blood flow changes that are associated with interictal activity.
