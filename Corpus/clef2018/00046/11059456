Functional imaging of visual semantic processing in the human brain. Previous neuroimaging studies have identified a large network of cortical areas involved in semantic processing in the human brain, which includes left occipito-temporal and inferofrontal areas. Most studies, however, investigated exclusively the associative/functional semantic knowledge by using mainly words and/or language related tasks, and this factor may have contributed to the large left hemisphere superiority found in semantic processing and to the controversial involvement of left prefrontal structures. The present study investigates the neural basis of visual objects knowledge, accessed exclusively through pictorial information. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was assessed using positron emission tomography (PET) during 3 conditions in right-handed normal volunteers: resting with eyes closed, retrieval of semantic information related to visual properties of objects (real size), and visual categorization based on physical properties of the image. Confirming previous experiments and neuropsychological findings, most activations were found in left occipito-temporal areas during retrieval of visual semantic knowledge. The absence of any activation in the left prefrontal inferior cortex for visual semantic processing confirms recent observations which suggest that this region would not be involved in retrieval of visual semantic knowledge from living entities. Rather, such knowledge about visual properties of objects, situated closely to cortical regions mediating perception of the visual attributes, can be retrieved directly from these regions when visual images are used as entry level stimuli.
