Dissociation between improvement in angina pectoris and myocardial perfusion after transmyocardial revascularization with an excimer laser. Xenon chloride excimer laser transmyocardial revascularization significantly reduced angina in all patients and increased regional myocardial perfusion in most patients however, there was no correlation between symptomatic improvement and flow improvement. Patients' symptomatic improvement preceded improved perfusion by several months.
