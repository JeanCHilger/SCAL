(123)I]metaiodobenzylguanidine and [(111)In]octreotide uptake in begnign and malignant pheochromocytoma. Selecting the appropriate approach for resection and follow-up of pheochromocytomas (PCCs) is highly dependent upon reliable localization and exclusion of multifocal, bilateral, or metastatic disease. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy was developed for functional localization of catecholamine-secreting tissues. Somatostatin receptor imaging (SRI) has a high sensitivity for localizing head and neck paragangliomas, but studies of intraabdominal PCCs are rare. In this study we review our experience of [(123)I]MIBG and SRI, performed since 1983 and 1989, respectively, in the work-up of primary and recurrent PCCs. Scintigraphic results were correlated with catecholamine secretion, size and site, malignancy, associated tumor syndromes, and morphological features. [(123)I]MIBG scans were performed in a total of 75 patients, in 70 cases before resection of primary PCCs and in 5 cases because of recurrent disease. Ninety-one PCCs were resected. The overall detection rates were 83.3% and 89.8% for PCCs larger than 1.0 cm. Multifocal disease was detected in 4 patients with [(123)I]MIBG. [(123)I]MIBG uptake correlated with greater size of PCC (r = 0.33 P = 0.008) and greater concentration of plasma epinephrine (r = 0.32
