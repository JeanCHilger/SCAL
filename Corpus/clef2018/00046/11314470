The species-specific feeding of rabbits in pet husbandry. To meet nutrient demands as well as the species specific requirements of an animal it is absolutely necessary to know its nutrition physiology (KAMPHUES et al. 1999). Characteristics of the nutrition physiology of rabbits include the anatomy of the intestinal tract (i.e. the teeth, the size of gut as well as the small intestine and colon), the special ingesting behaviour (selection, intensity of gnawing and chewing) and digestive processes within the intestinal tract (digestion by own as well as by microbial enzymes, processes of separation (producing soft faeces) and the excretion of digested or undigested nutrients (excretion via faeces or kidneys, quality of faeces). In feeding pet rabbits it has to be recommended, that these species do not need concentrates, but ingredients with higher crude fiber contents due to their origin and their intestinal tract. Therefore these herbivorous species should be fed with hay, straw or vegetables and not with concentrates exclusively. If these components are not offered (an usual feeding practice in rabbits kept as companion animals), other products rich in crude fibre have to be fed. The offer of a pressed diet in cube form with long fibrous ingredients would be a possibility to upgrade a ration poor in crude fibre. To meet the gnawing requirement of the rabbits this cubes should be pressed intensively. Furthermore it is advisable to exchange ingredients of the mixed feed with a high energy content (i.e. sunflower seeds, nuts) for ingredients of lower energy density (i.e. oat hulls, pelleted ground hay). Finally calcium oversupply has to be avoided because higher calcium intake may result in urolithiasis (calcium stones/concrements).
