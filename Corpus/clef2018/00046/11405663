Structural, CV and IR spectroscopic evidences for preorientation in PET-active phthalimido carboxylic acids. Hydrogen bond and potassium cation mediated preorientation were detected for phthalimido acetic acid and the corresponding acetate. Evidence for these phenomena came from X-ray structure analysis as well as cyclic voltammetric and IR spectroscopic measurements. These interactions rationalize the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) reactivity of the substrates in photodecarboxylation reactions.
