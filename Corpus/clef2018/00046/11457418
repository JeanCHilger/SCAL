No evidence for in vivo regulation of midbrain serotonin transporter availability by serotonin transporter promoter gene polymorphism. A polymorphism in the serotonin transporter promoter gene region (5-HTTLPR) has been shown to influence the quantity of serotonin transporter expressed in human cell lines: the 5-HTTLPR short allele (s) has been associated with reduced 5-HTT expression when compared to cells carrying the 5-HTTLPR long allele (l). We performed a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) study using the ligand [(123)I]-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane ([(123)I]-beta-CIT) to measure 5-HTT availability in 16 healthy subjects genotyped for 5-HTTLPR.SPECT scans were performed 24 hours after tracer injection, regions of interest anatomically corresponding to the thalamus-hypothalamus and mesencephalon-pons areas were compared to the binding in the cerebellum, representing the nondisplaceable [(123)I]-beta-CIT-binding (results expressed as target activity minus cerebellum activity/cerebellum activity). DNA from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5-HTTLPR using standard polymerase chain reaction methods.Specific binding ratios in the thalamus-hypothalamus were 2.65 +/- 0.4 in subjects with the l/l genotype (n = 3), 2.76 +/- 0.5 in subjects with the l/s genotype (n = 9), and 2.77 +/- 0.4 in subjects with the s/s genotype (n = 4). Binding ratios in the mesencephalon-pons were 1.43 +/- 0.3 (l/l n = 3), 1.37 +/- 0.3 (l/sOur data provide no evidence for in vivo functional regulation of 5-HTT availability by 5-HTTLPR in the thalamus-hypothalamus and mesencephalon-pons of healthy subjects.
