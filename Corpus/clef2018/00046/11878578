Follow-up in neuroblastoma: comparison of metaiodobenzylguanidine and a chimeric anti-GD2 antibody for detection of tumor relapse and therapy response. Early and correct diagnosis of local tumor recurrence, occurrence of metastases, and therapy response are essential in patients with neuroblastoma stage IV. The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of metaiodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) and a chimeric GD2 antibody in the follow-up of patients with neuroblastoma. In a prospective study, mIBG (N = 31 scans) and immunoscintigraphy were compared with a chimeric antiganglioside antibody, ch14.18 (MAb) (N = 31 scans), labeled with technetium Tc 99m in the follow-up of 18 patients with stage IV neuroblastoma. The findings were compared with histologic findings, other imaging examinations, and clinical changes over the course of 4 to 6 years. For the diagnosis of local tumor recurrences, sensitivity was 80% for MAb and 70% for mIBG. Specificity was 93% for MAb and 72% for mIBG. The MAb was superior for the detection of skeletal metastases, with a sensitivity of 82% compared with 72% for mIBG. Specificity was 100% for both techniques. Also, for soft tissue/lymph node metastases, sensitivity for MAb was higher (50%) than for mIBG (31%). Specificity was 100% for each technique. In sequential studies, metastases were detected earlier with MAb (mean: 2.3 m for skeletal metastases, 3.6 m for soft tissue metastases) than with mIBG. After therapy, tumor uptake was visualized longer with mIBG (mean 6.3 m) than with MAb. The chimeric antibody ch14.18 is likely to be valuable for follow-up examinations and for assessment of therapy response because of earlier detection of new metastases.
