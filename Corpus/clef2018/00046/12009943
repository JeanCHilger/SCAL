NODAGATOC, a new chelator-coupled somatostatin analogue labeled with [67/68Ga] and [111In] for SPECT, PET, and targeted therapeutic applications of somatostatin receptor (hsst2) expressing tumors. A monoreactive NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid) derived prochelator (1-(1-carboxy-3-carbo-tert-butoxypropyl)-4,7-(carbo-tert-butoxymethyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane (NODAGA(tBu)(3))) was synthesized in five steps with an overall yield of 21%. It is useful for the coupling to the N-terminus of peptides on solid phase and in solution it was coupled to [Tyr3]-octreotide (TOC) on solid phase, and the resulting peptide, NODAGA-Tyr3-octreotide (NODAGATOC), was labeled with the radiometals 111In and 67Ga in high yields and good specific activities. [67Ga]- and [111In]-NODAGA-Tyr3-octreotide appear to be useful to visualize primary tumors and metastases which express somatostatin receptors subtype 2 (sstr2), such as neuroendocrine tumors, because of their high affinity to this receptor subtype with IC(50) = 3.5 +/- 1.6 nM and 1.7 +/- 0.2 nM, respectively. NODAGATOC could be used as a SPECT and PET tracer, when labeled with 111In, 67Ga, or 68Ga, and even for therapeutic applications. Surprisingly, [111In]-NODAGATOC shows 2 times higher binding affinity to sstr2, but also a factor of 4 higher affinity to sstr5 compared to [67Ga]-NODAGATOC. [67Ga]-NODAGATOC is very stable in serum and rat liver homogenate. There is no difference in the rate of internalization into AR4-2J rat pancreatic tumor cells
