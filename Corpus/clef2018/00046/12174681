Housing and use of horses in Switzerland: a representative analysis of the status quo. Out of a representative sample of 1861 Swiss horse yards, 622 horse keepers (35.2%) with 2536 horses, ponies and donkeys sent back a questionnaire about general farm characteristics, their horse-specific training, horse stock, housing conditions, intraspecific social contacts, feeding, ability to move freely, use of the horses and management. 83.5% of horses were kept individually (thereof 18.3% tethered, 32.3% in a loose box indoors, 28.4% in a loose box outdoors, and 4.5% in a loose box with permanent access to a paddock or an individual pasture), and 16.5% lived in group housing systems. 36% of the horses had daily access to a pasture, 62.8% depending on the weather, and 1.2% never at all. Individually housed horses pastured significantly less than horses kept in groups. The mean use per week was 4.5 hours, depending on breed, type of use and housing system. Only 50% of the horse keepers were trained with respect to horses or farm animals (e.g. professional training graduation, license, military service, veterinarian, farmer). In Switzerland, horses are still housed and fed in a traditional way, despite considerable recent changes in the amount and type of use (65.1% leisure horses, 34.9% sport and working horses) this may result in health and behavioural problems. Therefore, information and education of horsewomen and horsemen should be emphasized in the future. For the transfer of knowledge, veterinarians are of high importance.
