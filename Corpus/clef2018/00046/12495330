Highly bulky and electron-rich terminal ruthenium phosphido complexes: new donor ligands for palladium-catalyzed suzuki cross-couplings. Secondary phosphine complexes of the formula [(eta(5)-C(5)H(5))Ru(L)(2)(PHR(2))](+) BAr(F)(-) are prepared from cationic ruthenium N(2) complexes and PHR(2) (R = Ph (a), t-Bu (b), Cy (c)). Additions of t-BuOK or NaN(SiMe(3))(2) give the phosphido complexes (eta(5)-C(5)H(5))Ru(L)(2)(PR(2)) ((L)(2) = (PEt(3))(2) (5a-c), depe (6a,b)) in high NMR yields. These rapidly oxidize in air to give isolable RuP(=O)R(2) species. Complex 5a is more basic than the rhenium analogue (eta(5)-C(5)H(5))Re(NO)(PPh(3))(PPh(2)), and 6b is more basic than P-t-Bu(3). Complexes 5a-c and 6b are effective ligands for palladium-catalyzed Suzuki reactions. The catalyst from 6b is nearly as reactive as that from the benchmark ligand P-t-Bu(3).
