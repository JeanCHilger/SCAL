Peripheral chemoreceptor contributions to sympathetic and cardiovascular responses during hypercapnia. We tested the hypothesis that integrated sympathetic and cardiovascular reflexes are modulated by systemic CO2 differently in hypoxia than in hyperoxia (n = 7). Subjects performed a CO2 rebreathe protocol that equilibrates CO2 partial pressures between arterial and venous blood and that elevates end tidal CO2 (PET(CO2)) from approximately 40 to approximately 58 mmHg. This test was repeated under conditions where end tidal oxygen levels were clamped at 50 (hypoxia) or 200 (hyperoxia) mmHg. Heart rate (HR EKG), stroke volume (SV
