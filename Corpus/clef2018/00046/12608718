Evaluation of the effects of functional orthopaedic treatment on temporomandibular joints with single-photon emission computerized tomography. The aims of this investigation were to evaluate the temporomandibular joints (TMJs) with single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in subjects treated with a mandibular advancement repositioning splint (MARS), and to compare the results with the total effect on dento-facial morphology. The study was undertaken on 17 Class II division 1 malocclusion subjects (nine males, eight females) with mandibular retrusion. Ten patients (five males, five females) formed the treatment group and seven (four males, three females) were used as the control. SPECT was performed only in the treatment group. Cephalometric evaluation showed significant increases in NAPog (P < 0.001) and SNB (P < 0.05) angles. Increased bone formation in theTMJs was analysed with the aid of pre- and post-treatment scintigraphic studies. The results indicate that new bone formation in the mandibular condyles seems to contribute to the increase in mandibular prognathism resulting from functional jaw orthopaedics.
