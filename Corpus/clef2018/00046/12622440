Single photon emission computed tomography of technetium-99m tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus--a preliminary report. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of technetium-99m tetrofosmin (Tc-99m TF) myocardial perfusion imaging to detect myocardial involvement in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Three groups of subjects-group 1: 25 SLE female patients with non-specific cardiac symptoms and signs, group 2: 25 female SLE patients without any cardiac symptoms and signs, and group 3: 25 female healthy controls-were evaluated by comparing rest and dipyridamole-stress Tc-99m TF myocardial perfusion SPECT. Tc-99m TF myocardial perfusion SPECT revealed perfusion defects in 88% and 40% of the cases in groups 1 and 2. respectively. However, no cases in group 3 demonstrated myocardial perfusion defects. Tc-99m TF myocardial perfusion SPECT is a useful noninvasive imaging modality to detect cardiac involvement in SLE patients with or without cardiac symptoms and signs.
