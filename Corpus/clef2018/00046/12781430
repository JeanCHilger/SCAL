Stereotactic body frame based fractionated radiosurgery on consecutive days for primary or metastatic tumors in the lung. To evaluate the feasibility and treatment outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using a stereotactic body frame (Precision Therapy), we prospectively reviewed 34 tumors of the 28 patients with primary or metastatic intrathoracic lung tumors. Eligible patients included were nine with primary lung cancer and 19 with metastatic tumors from the lung, liver, and many other organs. A single dose of 10 Gy to the clinical target volume (CTV) was delivered to a total dose of 30-40 Gy with three to four fractions. Four to eight coplanar or non-coplanar static fields were generated to adequately cover the planning target volume (PTV) as well as to exclude the critical structures as much as possible. More than 90% of the PTV was delivered the prescribed dose in the majority of cases (average 96%, range
