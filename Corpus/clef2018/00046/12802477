Procedure guideline for iodine-131 whole-body scintigraphy for differentiated thyroid cancer (version 2). The version 2 of the procedure guideline for iodine-131 whole-body scintigraphy for differentiated thyroid cancer is an update of the procedure guideline published in 1999. The following statements are added or modified: The two alternatives of an endogenous TSH-stimulation by the withdrawal of the thyroidal hormone medication and of an exogenous TSH-stimulation by the injection of the recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) have an equal sensitivity for the diagnostic use of radioiodine and for the measurement of thyroglobulin. Image acquisition under rhTSH is obtained approximately 48 h after the radioiodine administration, while an interval of about 72 h is preferred under endogenous TSH-stimulation. If iodine-negative metastases are expected, the feasibility of scintigraphy using (99m)Tc sestamibi or preferably positron emission tomography using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose should be considered. The sensitivity of FDG-PET is increased by TSH-stimulation. Before planning the iodine-131 scintigraphy the patient has to avoid iodine-containing medication and the possibility of additives of iodine in vitamin- and electrolyte-supplementation has to be considered.
