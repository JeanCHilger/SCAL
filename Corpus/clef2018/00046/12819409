A metabolic imaging severity rating scale for the assessment of cognitive impairment. This study was designed to validate a simple scoring system for evaluating fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomographic (PET) scans that can be used routinely in patients undergoing the clinical assessment of cognitive impairment.The FDG-PET scans of 106 patients with cognitive impairment (65 with Alzheimer disease, 16 with frontal lobe dementia, and 25 atypical cases) were acquired using the PENN-PET scanner 40 minutes after the intravenous administration of 8 mCi FDG. Metabolic activity in various anatomic structures of the brain was scored using the following qualitative scale: 4 = normal 3 = mildly decreasedIn all patients, the qualitative MISRS scores correlated significantly with the quantitative MISRS (r = 0.73, P < 0.0001). In all patients with cognitive impairment, the qualitative and quantitative MISRS scores correlated significantly with the DSRS and the MMSE (P < 0.001). In patients with Alzheimer disease, the qualitative and quantitative MISRS significantly correlated with the DSRS and MMSE.A simple and practical rating scale can be used to assess the severity of cognitive impairment in patients with different types of dementing illnesses.
