3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine as a new marker for monitoring tumor response to antiproliferative therapy in vivo with positron emission tomography. 3'-Deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT) has been proposed as a new marker for imaging tumor proliferation by positron emission tomography (PET). The uptake of [(18)F]FLT is regulated by cytosolic S-phase-specific thymidine kinase 1 (TK1). In this article, we have investigated the use of [(18)F]FLT to monitor the response of tumors to antiproliferative treatment in vivo. C3H/Hej mice bearing the radiation-induced fibrosarcoma 1 tumor were treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU 165 mg/kg i.p.). Changes in tumor volume and biodistribution of [(18)F]FLT and 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) were measured in three groups of mice (n = 8-12/group): (a) untreated controls
