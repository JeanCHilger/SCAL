Interregional correlations of resting cerebral glucose metabolism in old and young women. A correlational analysis of normalized (regional to whole-brain) regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose obtained in the 'resting' state (eyes covered, ears plugged) using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, demonstrated differences between old and young women in patterns of functional associations. Fifteen healthy young (age less than 40 years) and 17 healthy old women (age greater than 64 years) were scanned with a Scanditronix PC1024-7B tomograph. The brain was divided into 65 regions of interest. The old women had fewer and less positive correlations between pairs of metabolic ratios in the frontal and parietal cortices. The results suggest an age-related reduction in frontal and parietal functional interactions in the 'resting' state that is consistent with a prior correlation analysis using a low resolution ECAT II scanner on young and old men. Reduced functional interactions may reflect age-related cognitive changes.
