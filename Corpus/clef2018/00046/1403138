Iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine and bone scintigraphy for the detection of neuroblastoma. The purpose of this study was to compare the utility of bone and metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy for the detection of primary and metastatic deposits of neuroblastoma. 99mTc methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone and 131I-MIBG scans performed within 1 mo of each other in 85 patients with known or suspected neuroblastoma were evaluated for evidence of skeletal and extraskeletal disease. In 77 of 77 patients with confirmed neuroblastoma, the MDP and MIBG scans were concordant for the presence or absence of skeletal disease. A nearly twofold greater number of skeletal lesions were evident on MIBG scanning. No patients with normal bone scans had MIBG studies indicating bone involvement. In patients with histologic evidence of bone marrow involvement, each study suggested skeletal lesions in approximately 70%. In patients with extraskeletal disease demonstrated by CT, there was soft-tissue uptake of MIBG in 80% and MDP in 39%. We conclude that both MIBG and MDP are useful for the detection of skeletal neuroblastoma. MIBG is the better agent for characterizing the extent of disease, and MDP is a valuable adjunctive agent that provides skeletal landmarks for comparison. MIBG is clearly superior for the detection of extraskeletal neuroblastoma.
