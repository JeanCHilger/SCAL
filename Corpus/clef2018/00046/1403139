Quantitative measurement of regional cerebral blood flow using N-isopropyl-(iodine-123)p-iodoamphetamine and single-photon emission computed tomography. We have developed a quantitative method of measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by using N-isopropyl-(iodine-123)p-iodoamphetamine and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Twenty-five dynamic SPECT images (24 sec/scan) were collected immediately after tracer injection using a ring-type SPECT system and the accumulation curve (C(t)) was obtained. The time-activity curve corresponding to the arterial blood activity curve was used as B(t). The latter curve was calculated from the lung time-activity curve monitored during scanning and corrected by the actual activity obtained by one-point blood sampling 5 min after tracer injection. The octanol extraction ratio during scanning was considered to be constant and taken as the value measured 5 min after tracer injection (E). The uptake constant (K) per pixel was calculated by the least squares fitting method as the slope of the linear relationship in which C(t)/E x B(t) was plotted against E x integral of t(o)B(tau)d tau/E x B(t). Functional maps of rCBF values were obtained on a 64 x 64 matrix by calculating the uptake constant per pixel and the cross calibration factor (CF) between the SPECT system and a well counter (rCBF = K.CF x 100).
