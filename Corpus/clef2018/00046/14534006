Improvement of the imaging quality by a non-uniform attenuation correction system in cardiac SPECT. A non-uniform attenuation correction system has been purchased recently by the Department of Nuclear Medicine of the University Hospital in Salamanca to be used in a dual-detector Picker Axis gammacamera. This system is based on the generation of an attenuation map from each patient using a transmission scan with and without the patient using two Ba-133 sources. At present, this system is only available for a 102 configuration between the detectors so its use is restricted to cardiac single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The aim of this work has been to evaluate improvement of the image quality of this attenuation correction system by doing three different tests (evaluation of the recovery coefficient, activity concentration ratio and attenuation residual error). After analyzing all the tests, the results for the non-uniform attenuation correction system have been favorable compared to the conventional correction method employed in the clinical practice.
