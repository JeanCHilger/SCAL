Metabolic characterisation of solitary pulmonary nodules by positron emission tomography with FDG--preliminary report. In the past some authors evaluated FDG-PET as a powerful tool for non-invasive assessment of malignancy of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN). The aim of this paper is to verify the performance of positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) in SPN in the conditions of the Czech Republic during the first 16 months of the operation of the PET Centre Prague.The group of 22 patients with 23 SPN was investigated by dedicated PET scanner due to inconclusive CT scan. Micromorphological confirmation was available in 61% follow-up (median = 12 months) concerned the other 39% SPN.PET was clearly positive in 11 nodules, all were malignant according to micromorphological assessment. PET was completely negative in 10 nodules, 3 of them were micromorphologically evaluated as benign, the other 7 nodules were followed up without any signs of malignancy. In two cases, PET revealed enhanced glucose consumption, but the pattern was not typical for malignancy. These cases were considered as bronchopneumonia, but till now, they have not been definitely resolved.Excluding two unresolved cases, sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET was 100% for malignancy in our series. PET was helpful in medical decision-making in all patients.
