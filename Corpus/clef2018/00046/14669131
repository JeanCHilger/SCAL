Treatment of post-pneumonic empyema thoracis. The present study evaluates the management of 65 consecutive patients with post-pneumonic empyema thoracis (PET) treated in our department during the last ten years.There were 51 male (78.5 %) and 14 female (21.5 %) aged 23 - 82 years. The initial cause of PET was pneumonia (postoperative and posttraumatic empyemas were excluded). In 2 cases, a bronchopleural fistula coexisted. Diagnosis was based on clinical, radiological and pleural fluid culture findings. Pneumonococci and staphylococci were the predominant bacterial isolates in our series.Tube thoracostomy drainage (TS) was performed in all our patients. Forty-nine patients (75.4 %) were successfully treated with TS alone. The other 16 patients were submitted to thoracotomy: lung decortication (n = 14) along with segmentectomy in two cases and the Eloesser procedure, also in two cases. The mortality rate reached 9.2 % (n = 6). Septic shock, multiple organ failure, cardiac insufficiency, and end-stage renal failure were the causes.1. Complete drainage and full lung expansion by tube thoracostomy with suction are essential in the management of post-pneumonic empyema thoracis. Surgery should only be carried out right away if these conditions are not achieved. 2. Despite clinical experience and the major strategies and procedures available, the mortality remains high.
