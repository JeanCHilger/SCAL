Synthesis and structural characterization of the first unsymmetrical diarylpalladium complex trans-Pd(C6F5)(2,4,6-C6F3H2)(PEt3)2, derived from transmetallation between 2,4,6-trifluorophenylboronic acid and trans-Pd(C6F5)I(PEt3)2. The reactions of 2,4,6-trifluorophenylboronic acid with aryl(iodo)palladium(ii) complexes, trans-Pd(C(6)F(5))I(PR(3))(2)(PR(3)= PEt(3), PMe(2)Ph, PMePh(2)) in the presence of Ag(2)O afforded trans-Pd(C(6)F(5))(2,4,6-C(6)F(3)H(2))(PR(3))(2) which are stabilized by fluorine atoms in the ortho positions.
