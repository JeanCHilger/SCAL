The effect of ketanserin on cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity in healthy volunteers. The effect of the anti-hypertensive agent ketanserin on the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity was examined in 10 healthy volunteers. Ketanserin was administered as an intravenous bolus of 10 mg followed by an infusion of 6 mg/h. Before administration CBF was measured by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) of inhaled 133Xenon. Then arterial CO2 tension was subsequently decreased by voluntary hyperventilation and increased by breathing an air/CO2 mixture. The relative changes in CBF induced by the changes in arterial CO2 tension were estimated by the cerebral arterio-venous oxygen content difference method. One hour following the start of ketanserin infusion the SPECT measurement and CO2 manipulations were repeated. The CO2 reactivity (expressed as the slope of the regression line of the linear relation between CBF and PaCO2), was unchanged, i.e. 3.2%/0.1 kPa before ketanserin and 4.1%/0.1 kPa during ketanserin, respectively. Using regression lines from a semi-logarithmic plot the CO2 reactivity was also unchanged 3.4%/0.1 kPa and 3.5%/0.1 kPa, respectively. Ketanserin did not change CBF. The cerebral oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) was decreased 19% one hour after the start of infusion of ketanserin. In conclusion administration of ketanserin in a clinically relevant dose to healthy volunteers does not change the regional CBF not the cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity, but a decrease in CMRO2 was observed. However further studies are needed to clarify whether ketanserin in fact has a depressing effect on CMRO2 or whether the different results are caused by methodological errors or stochastic variation.
