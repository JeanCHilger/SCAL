Identification of Cryptosporidium isolates from cockatiels by direct sequencing of the PCR-amplified small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Cryptosporidium is a significant pathogen in humans and animals. Cases of infection by C. meleagridis or C. baileyi with zoonotic potential have also been reported in domestic birds and recent studies indicate the presence of new host-adapted species or genotype in birds. Therefore, accurately identifying isolates is important for understanding the epizootiology of Cryptosporidium infection in birds and for the control of human cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidium has been detected in cockatiels, but the species or genotype of isolates remains unclear because identification was performed using conventional microscopy. We report herein the species or genotype of isolates from two cockatiels distinguished by a PCR-based diagnostic method. The isolates were found to be C. meleagridis and C. baileyi, respectively. This study documents the first discovery of C. meleagridis and C. baileyi in cockatiels and suggests that pet birds may play an important role in the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis.
