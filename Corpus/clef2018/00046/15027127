Expression of GLUT-1 glucose transfer, cellular proliferation activity and grade of tumor correlate with [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by positron emission tomography in epithelial tumors of the ovary. We evaluated whether tracer FDG uptake, quantified as an SUV by PET in ovarian epithelial tumors, correlates with clinical stage, tumor grade, cell proliferation and glucose metabolism, all of which are biomarkers for response to chemotherapy, prognosis and overall survival in ovarian cancer patients. Seventeen patients suspected of having ovarian cancer by physical examination, tumor marker analysis and anatomic imaging (such as sonography, CT and/or MRI) underwent whole-body FDG-PET within the 2 weeks prior to surgery. Seventeen epithelial ovarian tumor specimens (13 malignant tumors, 5 at stage I, 2 at stage II, 6 at stage III 2 borderline tumors
