Simulation of compartmental models for kinetic data from a positron emission tomograph. Linear compartmental models are used to describe the disposition of radio-labelled compounds in regions of interest in the mammalian body, based on a time sequence of measurements from a positron emission tomograph (PET). In this paper we show how closed form solutions for the model equations have been incorporated into a computer program for simulation and parameter estimation. A typical PET data example is included to illustrate the implementation and compare the closed form method with a numerical ode solution method.
