Importance of vesicle proteins in the diagnosis and treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. We have analyzed the expression of synaptic vesicle proteins in human neuroendocrine tumors and the potential use of vesicle proteins in the diagnosis and treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. Biopsies from endocrine and nonendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and adrenals were examined by immunocytochemistry using antibodies against synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2), vesicular monoamine transporter 1 and 2 (VMAT1 and 2), and neuroendocrine secretory protein 55 (NESP55). SV2 was expressed in all endocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas as well as in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). None of the adenocarcinomas expressed SV2. VMAT1 and 2 were expressed in amine-producing tumors of the gastrointestinal tract (ECL cell and EC cell carcinoids) and in a small number of peptide-producing pancreatic endocrine tumors. NESP55 was expressed in neuroblastomas and adrenal pheochromocytomas as well as in a subgroup of pancreatic endocrine tumors. The importance of VMAT1 and 2 for the uptake of 123I-MIBG in tumor cells was demonstrated. It was concluded that neuroendocrine tumors express multiple synaptic vesicle proteins that are useful in the histopathological diagnosis and classification of tumors. Vesicle proteins may prove to be useful for targeting tumor therapy.
