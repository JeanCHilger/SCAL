Executive processes in Parkinson's disease: FDG-PET and network analysis. It is assumed widely that the clinical expression of Parkinson's Disease (PD), both motor and cognitive, is subtended by topographically distributed brain networks. However, little is known about the functional neuroanatomy of executive dysfunction in PD. Our objective was to validate further in a PD group the use of network analysis to assess the relationship between executive processes and pathological disorganization of frontostriatal networks. We studied 15 patients with idiopathic PD, and 7 age-matched normal controls, using resting [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET). We carried out network analysis on regional metabolic data to identify specific covariation patterns associated with motor and executive dysfunction. We detected two independent patterns relating respectively to the two clinical abnormalities. The first pattern (principal component 1) was topographically similar to that described previously in other PD populations. Subject scores for this pattern discriminated patients from controls and correlated significantly with bradykinesia ratings (P = 0.013, r = 0.655) in PD patients. The second pattern (principal component 2) was characterized by relative ventromedial frontal, hippocampal, and striatal hypometabolism, associated with mediodorsal thalamic hypermetabolism. In the PD group, scores from this pattern correlated with scores on the conditional associative learning (CAL P = 0.01, r = 0.690) and the Brown Peterson paradigm (BPP
