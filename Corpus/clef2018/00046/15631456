Studies on the mechanism of the photo-induced DNA damage in the presence of acridizinium salts-involvement of singlet oxygen and an unusual source for hydroxyl radicals. Mechanistic investigations of the photoinduced DNA damage by acridizinium salts (4a-azonia-anthracene derivatives) are presented. Irradiation of 9-bromoacridizinium in the presence of defined double- and single-stranded DNA oligomers under aerobic conditions leads to both frank strand breaks and alkali-labile sites as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The extent of the DNA damage increases significantly in D(2)O and occurs selectively at guanosine residues. These observations reveal the formation of singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) as reactive species, which oxidizes the DNA bases, above all the guanine bases. Further evidence for (1)O(2) formation was obtained from laser-flash spectroscopic investigations, which show intersystem crossing (S(1) to T(1)) of the excited states of the parent acridizinium and of the 9-bromo- and 9-amino-substituted derivatives. The resulting triplet state is efficiently quenched by oxygen (k(q) > 10(9) s(-)(1)M(-)(1)) to yield (1)O(2). Under anaerobic conditions, no significant alkali-labile lesions are observed, but frank strand breaks are induced however, to lesser extent than under aerobic conditions. The DNA damage is suppressed in the presence of a radical scavenger, namely t-BuOH, and hydroxyl radicals are shown to be the reactive intermediates by trapping experiments with terephthalic acid. Moreover, the intercalated acridizinium molecules are not involved in the DNA damage reactions. The intercalated acridizinium salt leads to a primary PET reaction with the DNA bases
