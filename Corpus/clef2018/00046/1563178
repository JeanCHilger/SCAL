Value of three-dimensional surface display of brain perfusion imaging. Comparison with tomographic imaging. The diagnostic ability of a three-dimensional surface display of I-123 IMP brain scintigrams and tomographic images was compared in 12 patients who underwent I-123 brain tomography for cerebral cortical hypoperfusion. Foci of decreased accumulation were independently diagnosed by four radiologists, first with transaxial images, second with three-dimensional images, and finally with both images subjectively compared for the purpose of diagnosing the existence, localization, and extent of lesions. Six different lesions (0 to 3 lesions/radiologist) were found only on the transaxial images, but 30 different lesions (1 to 14 lesions/radiologist) were found on the three-dimensional images. In 9 out of 12 cases, the three-dimensional images were regarded as superior for evaluating the extension of the lesion and for lesion existence and lesion localization in 5 out of 12 (P less than 0.05). In conclusion, a three-dimensional display of an I-123 IMP brain tomogram is superior to tomographic images in diagnosing the extent of cerebral cortical hypoperfusion. However, the display is not superior to tomographic images for diagnosing the existence and localization of hypoperfusion.
