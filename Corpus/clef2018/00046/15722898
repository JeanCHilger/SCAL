Radiotracer development in psychiatry. Over the last 20 years a number of radiotracers that target various neurotransmitter systems have been developed for use in imaging studies in psychiatry, but there are many more targets still to be investigated. The development of a radiotracer for clinical positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) neuroimaging studies can be a complex and lengthy process with few imaging agents successfully progressing into clinical human studies. One of the most challenging aspects in the procedure is the development of a rapid and simple radiosynthesis protocol to obtain the potential radiotracer with adequate specific activity, isolated radiochemical yield and radiochemical purity for human imaging. Once a candidate has been radiolabelled, full characterization of the radiotracer is required before it can be used in clinical human studies. Pre-clinical studies include investigation into the binding distribution, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, toxicology and dosimetry of a radiotracer. There are many points during the development procedure where a potential radiotracer can be rejected. Due to interspecies differences the development of a radiotracer can either go too far with an unsuccessful candidate or can potentially lead to rejection of a candidate too soon. It is only when the radiotracer has been used in humans can we be certain that a radiotracer is a useful imaging agent for clinical research studies. The development of new technologies, such as micro-PET or SPECT can only improve our ability to predict the success of a radiotracer.
