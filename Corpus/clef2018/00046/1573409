Blood-cerebrospinal fluid and blood-brain barriers imaged by 18F-labeled metabolites of 18F-setoperone studied in humans using positron emission tomography. 18F-Setoperone, a sensitive radioligand for brain serotonin 5-HT2 receptor positron emission tomography studies, is metabolized into 18F-labeled metabolites, which participate in blood 18F radioactivity. Its main metabolite, identified as reduced 18F-setoperone, was synthesized and studied in humans to determine if 18F-labeled metabolites of 18F-setoperone (a) enter into the brain, (b) bind to the 5-HT2 receptor, and (c) explain the increase of 18F radioactivity in the free fraction in blood measured following 18F-setoperone injection. After reduced 18F-setoperone injection, the brain-to-blood 18F radioactivity concentration ratio (a) was low, at the beginning, indicating that this metabolite did not cross the blood-brain barrier (b) was increased thereafter, with a higher radioactivity level in the choroid plexus than in brain tissue, suggesting a blood-CSF barrier crossing due to radioligand hydrophilicity
