Effect of GPi DBS on functional imaging of the brain in dystonia. Five patients with idiopathic dystonic conditions, treated successfully with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi), were studied using single-photon emission tomography (SPET) in order to evaluate brain perfusion in the presence and absence of DBS. Comparison was made between the "on" and "off" DBS scans on an individual basis and also as part of a group analysis. Whilst the individual data suggested great regional variation in cerebral perfusion between individuals, the results of the group analysis revealed several topographically similar areas of the brain where relative hyperperfusion in the absence of DBS was common to all patients. Based on these results we postulate on possible mechanisms for this phenomenon.
