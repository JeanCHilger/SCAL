Study of myocardial viability: comparison of PET and MRI. In the last years, few methods for the assessment of myocardial viability have been developed. Now a days the gold standard test for this purpose is the Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Recently, the expansion of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) has promoted the research for indexes or scores than can predict myocardial viability so far, the late enhancement has proved to be one of the most accurate scores. The purpose of this study is to establish a correlation between the information of PET with the results of MRI in the assessment of myocardial viability. Late enhancement patterns and segmental mobility were compared. Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. SPSS v. 10 program was used for the statistic analysis.17 patients with diagnosis of myocardial infarction were enrolled. All of them underwent into a myocardial viability detection PET study and into a cardiovascular magnetic resonance study using a late enhancement technique. Results were interpreted by experts. The 17 segments model of The American Heart Association was used.A total of 289 myocardial segments were analyzed, by PET 239 (82%) viable segments and 50 (17.3%) of non viable segments were detected, meanwhile by MRI 210 (72.6%) and 79 (27.4%) of viable and non viable myocardial segments respectively were found. Both techniques correlate 75% of the times and when vascular territories were analyzed, a good correlation was also established.MRI is an adequate technique to determine viability since it has good correlation with PET. This is the first study realized in Latin America that compares PET and MRI in the diagnosis of myocardial viability.
