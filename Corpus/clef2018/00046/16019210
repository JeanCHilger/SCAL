Synthesis of [18F]SU11248, a new potential PET tracer for imaging cancer tyrosine kinase. N-[2-(Diethylamino)ethyl]-5-[(Z)-(5-[18F]fluoro-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-indol-3-ylidene)methyl]-2,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxamide, a new potential positron emission tomography tracer for imaging cancer tyrosine kinase, has been prepared by the nucleophilic substitution of the nitro-precursor N-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]-5-[(Z)-(5-nitro-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-indol-3-ylidene)methyl]-2,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxamide with K18F/Kryptofix 2.2.2 followed by a simple chromatography methodology combined solid-phase extraction with high-performance liquid chromatography purification procedures in 15-25% radiochemical yields.
