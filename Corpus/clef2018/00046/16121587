A new simple iterative reconstruction algorithm for SPECT transmission measurement. This paper proposes a new iterative reconstruction algorithm for transmission tomography and compares this algorithm with several other methods. The new algorithm is simple and resembles the emission ML-EM algorithm in form. Due to its simplicity, it is easy to implement and fast to compute a new update at each iteration. The algorithm also always guarantees non-negative solutions. Evaluations are performed using simulation studies and real phantom data. Comparisons with other algorithms such as convex, gradient, and logMLEM show that the proposed algorithm is as good as others and performs better in some cases.
