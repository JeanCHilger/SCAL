Adenosine myocardial perfusion SPECT with Tc-99m-MIBI in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease: correlation between quantitative coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound measurements. To correlate myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) with Tc-99m-MIBI and adenosine infusion using quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).Seventy patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) with MIBI and adenosine were studied. Clinical, electrocardiographic (ECG), and scintigraphic findings were correlated with variables of visual and quantitative angiographic analysis, as well as to those of IVUS.The mean age of patients was 60.6 years, and 39 were male. Coronary angiography showed percentage of diameter stenosis (% DS) of 49.94% in 105 arteries, 83 of which were re-evaluated by QCA (79%), mean of 44.20%, p<0.05. ST-segment depression during adenosine infusion was associated with higher degrees of % DS (55.0% vs. 47.8%), p<0.05). Scintigraphic ischemia was correlated with greater cross-sectional area of lumen obstruction by IVUS (% CSA). Clinical, ECG, and IVUS findings were considered together and expressed as global ischemic versus non-ischemic responses. Ischemia was associated with lower values of minimal lumen diameter (MLD) and minimal lumen area (MLA) determined by QCA and IVUS.Tc-99m-MIBI and adenosine myocardial SPECT is correlated with % CSA on IVUS, perfusion images considered. Global results assessment showed association between lumen diameter and area at obstructed sites as determined by QCA and IVUS.
