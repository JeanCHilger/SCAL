Effect of electro-scalp acupuncture on cerebral dopamine transporter in the striatum area of the patient of Parkinson's disease by means of single photon emission computer tomography. To probe the mechanism of electro-scalp acupuncture in treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) by single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT).Five cases of PD received electro-scalp acupuncture at Dingnie Qianxiexian (MS 6), Epangxian III (MS 4), Dingpangxian I (MS 8), Dingpangxian II (MS 9) and Zhenxia Pangxian (MS 14). Contralateral points were selected for pathologic change on one side and bilateral points were selected for pathologic lesion on both sides. All the patients received 99mTc-TRODAT-1 SPECT examination before and after acupuncture treatment of 6 weeks. And activities of dopamine transporter (DAT) were analyzed by the ratio of striatum/occipital lobe (ST/OC), which was evaluated by means of technique of regional of interesting (ROI).The ratio of ST/OC on the same side of the affected extremity before and after treatment were 1.19 +/- 0.15 and 1.24 +/- 0.31 respectively. And on the other side were 0.90 +/- 0.12 and 0.95 +/- 0.25 respectively. They were increased after treatment (P > 0.05).Electro-scalp acupuncture can decrease the loss of DAT and improve the activities of DAT in the striatum of the patient of PD.
