The variants of personality maladaptation in patients with multiple sclerosis. Thirty-four patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), aged 14-52 years, age-at-disease-onset 24,3 +/- 7,5 years, have been studied. Disease severity score measured with the Kurtzke scale (EDSS) was 3,6 +/- 1,7. Seven patients were at the exacerbation stage, 27--in remission. Personality features in context of its maladaptation were studied using a modified version of MMPI. Neurotic, psychotic and mixed types of maladaptation have been singled out. The positron emission tomography indices of metabolic brain activity by glucose metabolism rate were concurrently determined. Data on the complementarity of metabolic processes activity in frontal, temporal-parietal and limbic cortical areas with different variants of personality maladaptation and different MMPI personality profiles were obtained.
