The role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the evaluation of solid splenic masses. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography is a noninvasive imaging modality that appears to have a high negative-predictive value for malignancy in assessing solid splenic masses discovered on conventional imaging modalities. Histological sampling is recommended for fluorodeoxyglucose-avid splenic masses, as the main differential diagnosis includes malignancy, either primary or secondary, or granulomatous disease.
