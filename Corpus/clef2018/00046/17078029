Value of parathyroid hormone assay for preoperative sonographically guided parathyroid aspirates for minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. The key to successful parathyroid surgery is accurate preoperative tumor localization. This study investigates the use of ultrasound (US)-guided parathyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) as a confirmatory diagnostic method in patients with hyperparathyroidism undergoing minimally invasive parathyroidectomy.Patients were selected for minimally invasive parathyroidectomy based on the finding of a single parathyroid adenoma identified with US and/or sestamibi scans and confirmation of the suspected parathyroid lesion via FNA and parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay. The value of aspirate obtained from the thyroid gland intraoperatively served as the negative control.A total of 56 tissue FNAs were performed in 27 patients. US detected masses suggestive of parathyroid lesion in all 27 patients, and 31 US-guided FNAs were performed. No complications related to the procedure were noted. Intraoperatively, FNA was performed in the thyroids of 25 patients undergoing minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Aspirates from lesions subsequently confirmed as having developed from the parathyroid gland had a mean PTH level of 4,677 +/- 123 pg/ml (range, 3,600-5,000 pg/ml), which was significantly higher than thyroid aspirates, which yielded a mean PTH level of 48 +/- 7 pg/ml (range, 5-57 pg/ml). The sensitivity of US and sestamibi scans in the detection of abnormal parathyroid glands was 88% and 77%, respectively. The sensitivity of US-guided FNA in confirming the parathyroid origin of a lesion was 100%.US-guided FNA for PTH assay can be performed safely for the confirmation of lesions identified with preoperative US for the selection of patients eligible for minimally invasive parathyroidectomy.
