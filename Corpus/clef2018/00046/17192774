123I]-beta-CIT SPECT imaging shows reduced thalamus-hypothalamus serotonin transporter availability in 24 drug-free obsessive-compulsive checker. Numerous findings indicate alterations in brain serotonin systems in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We investigated the in vivo availability of thalamus-hypothalamus serotonin transporters (SERT) in patients with DSM-IV OCD who displayed prominent behavioral checking compulsions (OC-checkers). Four hours after injection of [(123)I]-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane ([(123)I]-beta-CIT), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans were performed in 24 medication-free non-depressed OC-checkers and 24 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. For quantification of brain serotonin transporter availability, a ratio of specific to non-displaceable [(123)I]-beta-CIT brain binding was used (V''(3)=(thalamus and hypothalamus-cerebellum)/cerebellum). Drug-free non-depressed OC-checkers showed an 18% reduced brain serotonin transporter availability in the thalamus and hypothalamus, as compared with healthy control subjects (1.38+/-0.19 vs 1.69+/-0.21 p<0.001). There was a strong negative correlation between severity of OC symptomatology (Y-BOCS scores) and SERT availability (r=-0.80
