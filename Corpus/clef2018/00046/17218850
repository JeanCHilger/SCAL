Positron emission tomography imaging for gynecologic malignancy. The utility of positron emission tomography (PET) in gynecologic malignancy has increased rapidly in recent years. This review examines publications in this area.PET scans are mostly performed using 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET). It is valuable in primary staging of untreated advanced cervical cancer, for posttreatment unexplained tumor marker elevation and restaging of potentially curable recurrent cervical cancer. Its value in early-stage cervical cancer is limited. In ovarian cancer, sequential imaging predicts response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and survival. It also provides benefits when increases in serum CA 125 or computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging defined recurrence is noted but biopsy deemed infeasible. A few studies have shown that FDG-PET may facilitate optimal management of endometrial cancer, especially for posttherapy surveillance and after salvage therapy. FDG-PET is potentially useful in selected gestational trophoblastic neoplasia by monitoring response and localizing viable tumors after chemotherapy. Scanty studies have been reported in vulvar and vaginal cancer. The methodology and prospects of using integrated PET/computed tomography in the management of gynecological cancer are discussed. Other PET compounds are briefly introduced.The role of PET or PET/computed tomography has evolved from a diagnostic tool into a potential indicator of response to treatment and prognosis. Evaluating this tool by clinical impact is an attractive end point.
