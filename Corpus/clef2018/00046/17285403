Assessment of disease activity in alveolar echinococcosis: a comparison of contrast enhanced ultrasound, three-phase helical CT and [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Objective of the present study was to assess activity or vascularization of focal liver lesions in alveolar echinococcosis (AE) using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in comparison with contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and three-phase helical computed tomography (CT).In this prospective study, 17 patients with confirmed AE of the liver were included (6 males, 11 females average age: 59 +/- 16 yearsFDG-PET identified increased metabolic activity in the corresponding lesions in seven patients (41.2%). A vascularization pattern of echinococcal lesions was visualized in 9 patients (52.9%) by CEUS and in 4 patients (23.5%) by CT. All positive FDG-PET findings were also positive at CEUS.There was association between findings of metabolic activity in AE at FDG-PET and vascularized lesions of the liver returned by CEUS. This suggests that CEUS may represent a cost-effective tool in the decision making to perform FDG-PET examination.
