PET tracer technology for monitoring focal epilepsies. Studies using positron emission tomography (PET) have advanced our pathophysiological and biochemical understanding of focal and generalized epilepsies. H(2) (15)O PET allows quantification of cerebral blood flow and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET quantification of cerebral glucose metabolism. Neurotransmitters are directly responsible for modulating synaptic activity and newer PET tracers can provide information about synaptic activity and specific ligand-receptor relationships, which are important for epileptogenesis and the spread of epileptic activity.
